0,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,4,"So my buddy Ryan introduced me and Jo to his new girlfriend this past weekend and she's a mathematician (who is clearly not very good at it, because Ryan with a girlfriend doesn't add up - ZING!), so I was like ""Do you think we're all avatars in a big futuristic game of The Sims?"" and her face just lit up, like ""I've been waiting for someone to ask me this all my life!"" She is adorable, and we geeked out about parallel universes for like half an hour while Ryan and Jo made big exaggerated sighing noises. ""Hey, just let us know when you want to talk about something that's not the nerdiest bullshit ever."" ""Okay, that will be never because we're best friends now."" I said that. Ryan's girlfriend probably thinks I'm just okay.And that's why this is a great book: because it's wicked fun to talk about all this shit. Whee, multiverse! says my avatar. You ever hear that theory that once computers get to the same complexity as human brains, they'll sortof automatically develop consciousness? Scientists think that because otherwise there's something we totally don't get about consciousness, and who needs that? Lame. So here's the thinking: if that's true, then we'll probably have it by around 2020. And once we have artificial intelligence, what are we going to do with it? Put it in video games, obviously. We know this because we are people, and that's the kind of shit people do. So we're going to have these virtual worlds, just like The Sims except the people in it will actually be aware, and we'll all play these virtual world games on our Playstations. And that means there'll be like thousands of virtual worlds with conscious inventions in them interacting with each other. And that means that only one of all the worlds featuring conscious beings is the real one; the rest are video games. And that means that odds are the world you're reading this in isn't the real one. Just statistically, it's more likely that you're a collection of sprites that some pimply teenager created near-arbitrary rules for.That's nuts, right? Crazy nuts! Batty! Among other things, it means that there's a God after all, because whatever pimply teenager is playing this particular game that I'm in can delete this game whenever he wants, or make an asteroid hit Brazil, or make Kate Middleton show her boobs. For most intents and purposes, that is God.Also, it raises this question: is Pimply God doing a good job? Is this particular world a good one? Or is he an asshole? If all the sim worlds were ranked from most pleasant to least, where would this one fall? If you set a bunch of AIs up in a fairly nice place, will they probably fight? Is there like an Aggression Slider so you can make us more or less likely to fight? What would this world be like if Pimply God was deep in the throes of puberty? Or is this it?Ryan's girlfriend thinks we are most likely virtual - seriously, serious people think this whole thing makes perfect sense - but I think I lost her with the puberty bit.This is the craziest and last theory in Hidden Reality. There are eight others, and they're not mutually exclusive. The least crazy theory is that space is infinite, and infinite is a lot, so somewhere beyond what we can ever see, given the speed of light, there will be a world just like ours, and infinite worlds just like ours, because infinite means everything, including a world where everything happens and will happen exactly like it has and will in this world you're in now with the sole exception that, instead of reading this review, you personally decided to make a sandwich. Infinite is a lot.Everything in Hidden Reality is theoretical, so there's no pressing reason for you to read this book. (Or any of the rest of the books, while we're on the subject. Pimply God read Shakespeare and was like ""Ha, that's cool - it rhymes and everything, sometimes! I mean, it's terrible compared to real-life literature, but not bad for artificial intelligence."") But whee, multiverse! Four stars, says my avatar, as Pimply God happens to narrow his focus on my apartment just to see what's going on near Boston and says ""That sim there just called me pimply! Here's a random asteroid, how ya like me n"
1,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"I've now read three books about the multiverse in rapid succession: the first two were Rees's 
Before The Beginning
 (1996) and Davies's 
The Goldilocks Enigma
 (2007). This one came out just a few months ago, so I'm hopefully up to date for the moment.Well: I'm starting to feel quite familiar with the arguments, but each book has an interestingly different slant. Rees concentrates on presenting the experimental evidence for the existence of other universes - basically, the physical constants of our own universe appear to be tuned exactly right for life to be possible, it's unlikely that this is just chance, so we're probably one of many universes - and explicitly avoids philosophical speculation. Davies recapitulates Rees's arguments, but then goes overboard on philosophy; whatever he says, it's clear that he very much wants there to be a spiritual dimension to the story. Greene is similar to Davies, but his obsession is with string theory. He's spent his life working on it, and he desperately wants it to be part of the final explanation. Despite Greene's exaggerated love for all things stringy, I liked this book and found it well worth reading. The author presents nine different theories which in one way or another involve multiple versions of the universe. Most of these I had already seen in Davies, but I found Greene's exposition clearer and more detailed. In particular, I thought his chapter on ""inflation"" was the best account I had read of this mysterious process, which got our universe started by exponentially blowing it up, in a minute fraction of a second, from the size of a proton to a macroscopic scale. People now seem to understand inflation moderately well, and there are mathematical models which can be checked against the detailed maps of the cosmic background radiation which have been constructed over the last 10 years. I also thought the chapter on the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics was excellent; I hadn't understood that it's just a historical accident that the Copenhagen interpretation is the mainstream one. As Greene points out, it's actually more conservative to think of quantum processes as continually splitting off new universes, each of which is equally ""real"". The Copenhagen interpretation, with its notion of the collapse of the wavefunction, is the one which involves hand-waving and mystical invocations of the privileged role of the ""observer"". If you just look at the underlying mathematics, the Schr√∂dinger equation, the Many Worlds interpretation is the straightforward way to translate the numbers into words.As already noted, Greene wants string theory to be in there, so there are chapters on ""brane-worlds"" (our universe is floating in a higher dimensional space), the ""Cosmic Landscape"" (there is a multitude of universes reflecting different flavors of string theory) and the Holographic Universe (we are the projection of a lower-dimensional process on a distant boundary surface). Like Davies, he also speculates about the possibility that our universe is a simulation running in some gigantic computer, or that we live in a ""Platonic Universe"", where mathematical theories exist simply by virtue of being consistent, and there is no other reality. All of these ideas were fun to read about, but I felt they were somewhat beside the point; I was surprised not to see him focussing on what, at least to me, seems like the obvious account. As he says, the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is perfectly respectable, and inflation has accumulated a great deal of credibility as a theory of how the universe got started. Inflation starts at a scale where quantum processes are all-important. We can actually see the fossils of those quantum processes in the unevenness of the background radiation.Putting those two things together, we already have a multiverse theory that's mainstream to the point of being conservative. The quantum realities which split off during the very early history of the universe will be substantially different from each other. The question is whether they're going to be different enough, since we want them to differ with respect to things including settings of the physical constants. This part is still speculative. But you need it anyway in order to make most of the other theories work, and there seem to be moderately well-worked out accounts of how it could happen. I am sure people must be exploring in this direction. It sounds incredible when you write it down, but we appear to be on the edge of constructing a coherent scientific theory of Life, The Universe and Everything. I'm really curious to see what happens next."

Yes, I refuse to spend much time on multiverse hypotheses; I used to spend a lot of time looking at quantum field theory instead (and doing QFT, thinking about it, developing a feel for and making choices about what I think is important or not, and changing my mind endlessly, and becoming intimate with it as much as my abilities will let me, all of which takes more time than anyone has)."
3,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,5,"Brian Greene really is one of the best popular science writers. His books give you a real sense of being guided by someone who genuinely knows what they're talking about, who uses metaphors effectively, and who effectively weaves the traditional material in with the new points he is making. He also approaches science with curiosity untainted by dogmatism. He is very much open to speculation, but equally open to the speculation not panning out.This book is about different concepts of the Multiverse. Greene devotes a chapter to each of what he defines as the major types and then has one or two additional chapters on questions like whether these theories are testable and broader implications.The multiverse's he consider include the quilted multiverse (which is just our universe extending out infinitely, leaving the possibility of endless accidental repetition -- which follows from some cosmological theories that follow the big bang), the inflationary multiverse (a product of repeated episodes of inflationary expansion, which follows from the addition of inflation to the previous theories), three multiverses that come from different versions of string theory (brane, cyclic and landscape), a quantum multiverse (which is Everett's Many Worlds interpretation, and is more conceptual), a holographic multiverse (which comes from the study of black holes and string theory), and simulated and ultimate multiverses (the last two coming from computer simulations and a deeper mathematical world).In every case, Greene does a good job of describing the physical theories that lead, usually by accident, to the implication that there is a particular type of multiverse, discusses the scientific status of those theories, and addresses issues around testing them. In the end, Greene has some sympathy with Steven Weinberg's adage that the problem with physics is that we do not take our theories/equations seriously enough as a real description of the world. The example he cites is the Positron, which was a byproduct of Dirac's solution of a math problem that turned out to be real. Greene clearly leans towards the view that the same is true of the multiverse, but he doesn't do much to tip his hand about which one."
4,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,5,"Outstanding update of the current status of modern physics and the projections of parallel universes from various advances. I would have loved to have Greene for a teacher in college. The tour is suitable for laymen with some understanding of physics, as he provides plenty of concrete examples to explain challenging concepts and gives an opportunity to skip more technical sections. For the more knowledgeable reader, a copious appendix is available, replete with the relevant math equations. Greene works his way through the history and logic behind eight different models of parallel universes and their status in terms of development and progress toward potential verifiability. The only one that I was really familiar with, from a college course on quantum physics 40 years ago, Everett‚Äôs 1956 Many-Worlds Hypothesis, is the only one that really bothers me, with its continual ‚Äúsplitting‚Äù off of parallel realities at every point where uncertain outcomes like the position of an object is resolved. Greene makes it clear how the interpretation is simpler and more elegant than Bohr‚Äôs interpretation. The latter calls for the probability wave of a particle to mysteriously collapses when it is detected or interacted with, effectively throwing out Schroedinger‚Äôs equations out whenever a ‚Äúmeasurement‚Äù is made and restricting their applicability only to very small objects. Despite Occam‚Äôs Razor favoring Everett‚Äôs hypothesis (the quantum mechanics equations apply deterministically at all times), the interpretation of possible alternative states as each being somehow ‚Äúreal‚Äù has always been too absurd to be true to me. It‚Äôs a relief then that there is still scientific resistance to the notion and demonstrations of problems with the theory. Greene notes: ‚ÄúI don't expect theoretical or experimental consensus to come in my lifetime concerning which version of reality-a single universe, a multiverse, something else entirely‚Äîquantum mechanics embodies.‚ÄùThe other theories are fascinating and do not call for my alternative choices to have an existence in parallel universes. It was great to get a perspective on the excitement and challenges with string theory and its promise for helping unify the gravitational force with the other forces already in the fold of quantum field theory. The discovery that our universe is undergoing an acceleration in its expansion, and the need for some kind of anti-gravity force (‚Äúdark energy‚Äù) was a shock to me, so the recent successes of the theory of empty space having an ‚Äúinflaton‚Äù field was satisfying to read about. Greene‚Äôs coverage of recent work on the meaning of entropy and information in physical systems was also a pleasure for me.For a sense of the content of this book, here is a thumbnail sketch of the seven other parallel universe theories covered, as laid out in Greene‚Äôs summary chapter: Quilted Multiverse: Conditions in an infinite universe necessarily repeat across space, yielding parallel worlds Inflationary Multiverse: Eternal cosmological inflation yields an enormous network of bubble universes, of which our universe would be one Brane Multiverse: In string/M-theory‚Äôs braneworld scenario, our universe exists on one three-dimensional ‚Äúbrane‚Äù, which floats in a higher-dimensional expanse potentially populated by other branes‚Äîother parallel universes Landscape Multiverse: By combining cosmology and string theory, the many different shapes for string theory‚Äôs extra dimensions give rise to many different bubble universes Holographic Multiverse: The holographic principle asserts that our universe is exactly mirrored by phenomena taking place on a distant boundary surface, a physically equivalent parallel universe Simulated Multiverse: Technological leaps suggest that simulated universes may one day be possible. Ultimate Multiverse: The principle of fecundity asserts that every possible universe is a real universe‚Ä¶These universes instantiate all possible mathematical equations.The summary chapter was also satisfying to me in attempting to address the following questions: Is the Copernican pattern fundamental? --Following the 500-year trend that ‚Äùthe more we understand, the less central we appear‚Äù, we now approach the perspective that ‚Äúour universe itself may not be central to any cosmic order‚Äù. Can scientific theories that invoke a multiverse be tested? --The worry is that ‚Äùby invoking a multiverse, we enter the domain of theories that can‚Äôt be tested‚Äù. He argues that well founded multiverse theories should be able to make predictions which are likely to be testable in our own universe, and hence falsifiable.  How does the multiverse affect the nature of scientific explanation? Traditional approaches for physics aims to use mathematical expressions of physical laws and a set of constants and initial conditions to project what measurable things will be like at a subsequent time. Multiverse theories usefully explore variability in these conditions and laws which must be accepted as a given in a single-universe theory. Should we believe mathematics? Based on past progress, mathematical theories have had a huge impact on guiding science toward hidden truth. Despite problems in testing the multiverse theories, pushing on them is likely to lead to progress."
5,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,5,"Brian = bae. Definitely one of the more accessible cosmology writers of today. Any book discussing quantum field theory and string theory is going to require your undivided attention, of course, but it‚Äôs much more readable than many others, especially if you‚Äôre fond of analogies. Turns out, there‚Äôs lots of theories that give rise to the possibility of alternate realities:Theory 1, aka Quilted Multiverse: If the universe is infinite (it might not be, but if it is) then at some point in the distant, distant universe, there are worlds where there is a human named Annie just like me, typing on Goodreads, except she typed ‚ÄúGR‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúGoodreads.‚Äù And there‚Äôs another world with an Annie whose life is exactly like mine except she‚Äôs allergic to red wine (I would have to kill myself because there would be no point in living). In some, the worst things I‚Äôve ever imagined happening have happened. In others, my wildest dreams have been fulfilled. (Somewhere, there is an Annie who can write like Kafka, DH Lawrence, and Kundera combined). Theory 2 aka Swiss Cheese: If the universe is expanding (hint, it almost definitely is) then there would be places which expansion would create which would have to have lowered rates of expansion, and those are like holes in Swiss cheese. The number of cheese-holes, as the cosmos continues to expand, continues to increase, and each one of those is adorably termed a bubble universe, or pocket universe. Including our own. This also brings in the Quilted Multiverse idea: from inside a bubble universe, the bubble‚Äôs space is infinite, but from outside the bubble universe, it‚Äôs finite. What appears as endless time to an outsider appears as endless space, at each moment of time, to an insider. And if it‚Äôs infinite to an insider, then there have to be infinite worlds with infinite repetitions and variations, as in Theory 1. Theory 3 aka String Theory aka Bread Loaf aka Cyclic Multiverse: [Strictly speaking there are five types of string theory, no one: Type I, Type IIA, Type IIB, Heterotic-O, and Heterotic-E, which all sound like sexually transmitted diseases to me, and anyway they all get subsumed into the grander M-theory]. String theory (particles are vibrating loops of filaments, and the way it vibrates determines what particle it is/how it behaves) and corresponding M-theory predict that there are ten dimensions of space and the eleventh dimension of time. Seven more than the ones we‚Äôre aware of: length, width, height, and time. But maybe that‚Äôs not an issue, because the four dimensions we‚Äôre used to extend over massive (maybe infinite) distances, but maybe the other seven are curled up at the other end of the cosmos and we can‚Äôt find them and they don‚Äôt extend far enough to reach into our reality. For analogy Greene gives the example of a straw, normal sized, except it‚Äôs as tall as the Empire State building. It‚Äôs three-dimensional up close, but from the other side of the river, it would just look like a vertical line (two-dimensional). Here comes the multiverse idea: pretend the world has just two dimensions (it‚Äôs a flat plane) called a two-braneworld. Line up a couple of these flat planes (slices of bread) and you can add on other parallel universes, other braneworlds, as many as you like (‚Äújust add slices to the cosmic loaf‚Äù as Greene memorably says). Of course, we have three spatial dimensions, but looking at 2 dimensions makes it easier to wrap our 3D heads around. It‚Äôs also possible that different braneworlds would bounce into each other and restart the cosmological clock, so that, rather than one big bang, things are a gigantic bumper-car game and universes are constantly (though very slowly, from our perspectives) getting remade and unmade and remade. Theory 4 aka Landscape Multiverse: pretty much the idea that the cosmological constant (density of energy in space, creating certain gravitational values) might be necessary for life, and so what are the odds it happened to happen? Well, you‚Äôd need an infinite number of universes to make it likely that [at least] one of them just happened to have the exact necessary cosmological constant to make life happen.Theory 5 aka the Quantum Multiverse: all the possibilities of [our] reality are realized in another reality, another multiverse. All possible histories and all possible futures are real. One of them is the reality we live in; the (basically infinite) rest exist in some way. True reality is more like a tree than a line. Theory 6 aka Everything is a Hologram: The event horizon of a black hole (point of no return) is the surface of a black hole in some ways, and fluctuations in the surface of the event horizon contains all the information the black hole sucks in. Similarly, our 3D world may be a rendering of 2D-encoded information (on some cosmological event horizon-type-thing) which creates reality as we know it.Theory 7 aka Virtual Reality: we can create other universes virtually and, someday, could probably create reactions in the (potentially sentient) actors in those universes which could make it feel like reality, every bit as much as it does to us. If everything‚Äôs infinite (see theory 1) with infinite numbers of beings creating infinite numbers of virtual universes whose inhabitants can also create infinite numbers of infinite universes and so forth, doesn‚Äôt it seem like odds are good that we‚Äôre just one of those games? Could we even tell if we were in a simulation? Depends on your Simulator and if they want to reveal themselves (are you there, God? It's me, Annie). Other interesting things:Dark energy might be the answer to Einstein‚Äôs unproven cosmological constant (that he retracted after he suggested it because he couldn‚Äôt account for it). There‚Äôs some‚Ä¶ some shit out there, and we can‚Äôt see it, describe it, or know of its existence other than through a few methods of measurement. The mind-boggling idea that if the universe is infinite, and you shrunk infinity, everything would be closer together but the universe would still be infinite. Rationally I understand that you can‚Äôt reduce infinity (infinity divided by two is still infinity) but my brain doesn‚Äôt want this to be a thing. About 1 percent of the snow on a television that‚Äôs tuned to a non-working channel is due to reception of the big bang‚Äôs photons (aka background radiation). "

7,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1394552-keith-akers,4,"This was a good book. For a popularization, this had some pretty heavy science in it. I'm a pretty smart guy and will have to re-read it to really have a better understanding. Greene really is a good writer, because even when you don't quite understand what he's talking about, he gives you enough of the broad overview so that you can go to the next section and feel that you haven't missed anything critical.The section on ""quilted multiverses"" was pretty straightforward and I can claim to have understood it. The next few parallel universes were a bit trickier, but I was with the program. When I got to multiple dimensions and the ""landscape multiverse"" with so many possible shapes to the extra dimensions that ""kazillions"" doesn't even begin to cover the number, this was something I wasn't quite so sure that I could explain to my wife. I'm not sure I want to challenge Brian Greene on any scientific question, but the one point I would have some questions about were the simulated multiverses (as in the movie ""The Matrix""). I think he may be shortchanging Goedel and Turing. I'm not convinced that a simulated multiverse sufficient to model all the creatures on our planet would not consume so much energy that it would be in effect less probable than an actual universe. My experience as a programmer is that the complexity of programs and the resources needed to design them go up exponentially with the size of the program. If that is the case, creating a universe might actually take less energy than modeling one. We would need to automate the process of computer design, but this essentially can't be done, and that's the point of Turing's thesis. There may be a practical upper limit on the size of simulated universes that we (or future super-intelligent beings in our universe) could ever design. This may be my confusion, but I'd like just a little more explanation here. So, this book is recommended, and I hope to come back to it. One final thing: though the book never utters a word about it, Brian Greene is a vegan. That anybody this smart is a vegan says something, I think, about where we should be headed as a species. "
8,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin,3,"The first book I had by Brian Greene was The Fabric of the Cosmos. I got it not long after it was releases and a friend asked me if he could borrow it not long after I received it in the mail, before I'd read it. I said yes.I didn't get the book back for several years, Dr. Greene had written more by then. Oh well.This book (as is Dr. Greene's wont) is an attempt to take highly technical and advanced ideas and make them understandable to ""us"", ""we"", ""the great unwashed"", ""the masses"". I suppose in all truthfulness it only succeeds to a point.I mean, I know I don't have the math to grasp the heart of what he's talking about and even I can see the imprecision. Still, he does take the difficult, sugar coats it and lays it out there. (I kept seeing that scene from Big Bang Theory where they have a cameo from Dr. Greene and Sheldon's reaction to him).If you're a physicist (theoretical or experimental I suspect) this book will probably be hopelessly imprecise and simple, if your like me, it's fairly interesting. Even though I know that what I'm getting is at best a broad outlined picture (where the multiverse is compared to a large Swiss Cheese with the bubbles pictured as the universes). The book is laid out largely in the format of here it is, here's what we think/know and here's why. It assumes that those reading it won't really be in a position to challenge it and tries to be as simple as possible.In short not a bad book and manages to lay things out in a relatively (get it ""relatively"") simple way when dealing with a difficult set of subjects (or subject if it's ""unified"" :) ). Enjoy. If it interests you I recommend it. "
9,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2102504-r-l,3,"This is a pretty dense book. Some of the footnotes have footnotes! I'm sure it must be very difficult for an author of a popular science book to walk the line between, on the one hand, providing enough technical information to make the arguments cogent, and on the other, miring the reader in a bog of difficult concepts and facts. My hat's off to Dr. Greene for giving it a try on some of the most out-there ideas that can be imagined. Some very interesting ideas, but ultimately, for me this was all a little difficult to chew and swallow.My own theory [ unencumbered by fact or mathematics :) ] is that the universe is infinite in all directions. Our atoms and subatomic particles are someone--or something!--else's galaxies and universes, and likewise, that our galaxies are atoms and molecules to some other beings. And, boy, are those beings *big*!For some reason I also think that the hierarchy that I just described doesn't recurse infinitely in a fractal manner. Instead, it's all circular, so that if you start here and go up to galaxies or down to atoms (or down to gehanna or up to the throne!), or, for that matter, out to the edge of our universe, and (bringing it back to the topic of this book) to other universes in the multiverse, you would eventually end up here again. Weird.Not light reading, but recommended if you're interested in some of the current thinking in the fields of cosmology and physics."

Brian Greene you are the master at delivering exactly what I have naturally been pondering and lack the scientific mind to undertake. Thank heavens it wasn't another science book that I had to sit through the whole of physics from Einstein onward. Way to know your audience.

Yet again you deliver in your classically simply elegant style the various avenues mathematics has led us to opening up different scenarios for parallel universes in every flavor under high investigation. Giving comparisons for each approach and tackling them all in turn. Its such absolute brain candy. You are so damn brilliantly perfect for presenting this type of information. Bravo!

Some of the explanations--for example, the bubble universes--really made my head hurt. The explanation for why string theory requires ten space-time dimensions seems a bit glib to me. Some of the analogies--imagine a bunch of clones of Cartman from South Park standing atop mountain peaks--are just too silly to take seriously. The description of black holes and entropy is fascinating. Some parts of the book are rather philosophical--do mathematicians ""invent"" math or ""discover"" it? And, if you enjoy reading about extremely speculative hypotheses--like our universe is a computer simulation, much like ""The Matrix""--then this is the book for you."

Still, I feel like I understand more about how theories of multiverses originate, and where they might be going. Not the most fun read, and I was expecting less theoretical physics and more descriptions of possibilities, but it was OK."
13,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3082950-tomislav,4,"The first half of this book is an expansion on some of the various multiverse concepts mentioned only briefly in Greene's earlier The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos (which overlap each other a little). I was an enthusiastic reader of those, and enjoyed this deeper look at what the scientific basis of those might be, in somewhat the same style. But for the second half of the book, I want to mention specific chapters, as I feel the value of the writing swings wildly.7. Science and the Multiverse. This chapter for me raised some troubling issues as to what is actually science and what is interesting philosophical speculation. He goes a bit further out on the limb of the anthropic principle than I am usually comfortable with. Greene reasons about infinities of universes in the a number of different types of multiverse, based on a sample size of 1. It could be we are typical, and the exclusion of so many possibilities is valid, or it could be we are atypical. I mean, it's cool, you know, but not so reasonable. The cover article of the April 2011 issue of Scientific American concerns related issues in inflationary cosmology. See ""Quantum Gaps in Big Bang Theory; Why our best explanation of how the universe evolved must be fixed or replaced"" by Paul J. Steinhardt, Princeton. 8. The Many Worlds of Quantum Measurement. This is possibly the best explanation of the uncertainty principle I have ever read. It gave me new insights into the Schrodinger equations, and addressed some concerns that have bothered me for years. This chapter alone justified reading the book.9. Black Holes and Holograms. I think I understand about information and the event horizon of black holes, but the holographic multiverse totally baffled me. Too many analogies and twists and turns in the explanation. I guess you have to do the math to get this one - or take it on faith, which I refuse to do.10. Universes, Computers, and Mathematical Reality. This chapter concerns epistomology and information theory. What's it doing in a physics book?Taken as a whole, the book was fascinating and worthwhile - but gets patchy in the second half. "
14,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2028832-kathleen,4,"I always enjoy looking at scientific concepts through the lens of the fantastic or peculiar, so this exploration of parallel universes by popular physicist Brian Greene is perfect for me. Written in his usual clear, funny style, Greene naturally discusses string theory, relativity, number theory with respect to infinities, quantum theory, and numerous other scientific concepts. Instead of simply discussing these theories, however, we get to look at various proposals of multiple universes. From the familiar quantum multiverse suggested by the probability wave math of Schrodinger's equations and the idea--Greene refers to it as a ""quilted multiverse--that if the universe is infinite than it obviously repeats, to more obscure suggestions from string theory, the many kinds of parallel universes are distinct and interesting. Perhaps the most intriguing is the idea of the simulated multiverse; if one day computing power reaches the extent that we can play at building self aware, self contained universes the way I play at Spore and The Sims, then we will essentially create our own multiverses. The most enjoyable aspect of this study is Greene's particularity in explaining the scientific concepts--and eventual testability--of these universes. This book never feels like a pointless philosophical exercise, which keeps it fun. "
15,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608649-laurie,1,"I really am a huge fan of Brian Greene. I've read both ""The Elegant Universe"" and ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" and find his writing simply astonishing. With complete sympathy for readers without mathematical acumen, he explains concepts like quantum physics, the theory of relativity, the four major forces including gravity with such precision, and wit, that I found myself gasping for breath as I felt like I was reaching groundbreaking depths of understanding of how the universe works on almost every page. Even if you are not interested in physics and the workings of reality, he has a way of presenting these ideas in such an entertaining and interesting way, you can't help but get caught up in his enthusiasm. He's so tuned in to the general reader that he even suggests skipping large parts of his book if you don't want the nitty-gritty details and just want the big-picture show. NOT SO with this book. It almost felt like a different writer. Even he did not seem as enchanted with the subject. Most of the book was really a lot of twisty, topsy-turvy conversation about the probability of multiple universes, including exact replicas of our own.His exlanations were vague and his writing was even boring. Big thumbs down and I am so disappointed! "
16,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6967393-nicholas,3," I purchased this on the strength of Brian Greene's past works and find him to be consistent in his clarity of explanation.Although I had a few sticky moments with some elements of string theory and the explanation of the concept of infinity, on the whole it went well.I didn't get the same revelatory experience I got from ""Fabric of the Cosmos"",as most of the multiverse theories are extensions of areas he has covered previously and as the book is written with the assumption of little or no prior knowledge,it can be a little tedious having to go through same theories again.If you have any prior knowledge in this field then you will realise that all these ideas are at the present unverifiable,but at the end he posits the questions that must be answered to advance the possibility of validating any of them. On the plus side I'd say that the book is well structured and comprehensive without complexity (although the notes delve a little deeper).On the minus side there is little new if you are a reader of ""New Scientist"" or are an avid reader of popular science and I must admit I did find myself counting the pages a few times. "
17,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29427016-zaid,5,"I am sold to Brian Greene after reading this one.I am fond of his simplicity for writing such a book.I was looking for such a book for quite sometime and when I learned about it I instantly decided to read it. It took me quite a time to read this book,to process it.It is a good book for the people who have little knowledge in this field.Want to broaden your knowledge on the topics like Multiverse,string theory? Read this book."
18,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5555043-the-pirate-ghost-formerly-known-as-the-curmudgeon,3,"Needed more ""Schrodinger's Cat and less Matrix."" Okay, I liked the first 66% of the book. Greene takes the time to go over, and over..(and over).... (and over) some of the same mathmatical points. It could get monotonous but in the first half to 2/3rds of the book he managed to add a little bit more ""new stuff"" to each repitition. It did help me understand string theory and that there is at least mathamatical (theoretical?) support for multiple universes and the book did a good job of explaining that. I know I heard about Skip Drives from John Scalzi and support for variations of the same universe (widely used in sci-fi and other fiction for centuryies now) as well as warp drives and worm holes...hell he practiclaly beat the fun out of ""Black Holes."" Then he started a long repetitive explaination of simulated universes that had a more existential philosophical lean to it than the hard math and science in earlier chapters. At several points I wanted to role down my window and shout, ""Come on buddy, take the damned blue pill will you?"" To add to my consternation and confusion he ends the debate he was having (mostly with himself) with statements about how he doesn't really buy the simulated universe bunk? What, was he paid by the word? I don't want to go too deep into things, but when a guy like me is known for beating a dead horse thinks it's a little ""too much matter and not enough art"" then it might be worth taking some scissors to the manuscript. (Oh come on!...It's figurative... no horses, alive or dead, have ever been harmed by, or in the making of, one of my reviews... well Sea Buiscuit didn't like one, but that's a halucination of a different colour...) To quote Margo Hemingway's character in ""The Meaning of Life"" (Peter O'Toole) ""Why don't you start by thinking you don't exist and see where that gets you."" Bottom line, first half good but the math's complicated. It does a good job of explaining the relationship between string theory, Quantum Theory and the Theory of Relativity. Then, it's time to check the ship movments to ""Fantasy Island."" Worth reading if you are a functional mathamatical idiot who likes to read sci-fi (and maybe write one day) like me. It's not exactly a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy...though it does help explain how Adams is not completely crazy. "
19,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"This book wouldn't be great without his first two. Or maybe it would, but it would seem like a fantasy ride in some bologna-artist's woo-science book. It's basically a survey of the different multiverse ideas out there - all the different ways people have dreamed up multiple universes.Given the scientific gravitas Brian Greene is able to bring, though, one has to take these ideas seriously. At least, as seriously as one can. I'm not a physicist, but I have taken a statistics course or two, and the thinking about how we can test some ideas of multiple universes by looking at our own universe make absolutely no sense to me. Our universe is one data point. It gives you zero degrees of freedom. There is no hypothesis one could reject by theorizing, as Greene seems to do, that multiverses where a universe like ours would be more likely, and then turning around and looking at the data from our universe.Whether or not he's right about testability, though, even constructing hypotheses is a portion of science. Science is the process of developing and testing hypotheses. There's nothing wrong with developing hypotheses you have no idea how to test, and calling it a scientific step. OK, so we have no idea how to test, or if we can. Don't let that limit the process of developing hypotheses.Two more nitpicks (I gave this 5 stars, too - why am I only complaining? I guess I found the book so intriguing and engaging that I want to talk back to it):1) He never talked about the fact that many of these multiverse theories are not mutually exclusive - bubbles in the expansion of space and simulated multiverses could obviously coexist, as could many of the others.2) In the ultimate universe model, the universe with nothing in it obviously exists - inasmuch as it needs to. We have to accept that one, just like we have to accept the empty set in every set of subsets ever.Anyway, good book. I recommend ""The Elegant Universe"" and ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" before this, but I guess it would work on its own, too."
20,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clouther,5,"This was a great follow-up to The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality. It didn't repeat a lot of material from the first one, it explained the progression in physics since then. It was pretty mind-blowing. I did get a little stuck in some sections, but I decided that a perfect understanding of the topic wasn't strictly necessary for my purposes. I do think Greene protests too much that every aspect of physics isn't a *miracle.* I've never heard of so many miracles I believe in, even if, as Greene claims it's statistically expected when dealing with such large numbers. It is a miracle to find ""shoes in my size"" as Greene's analogy goes. "
21,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/296706-lee-rocky,2,"I think I may just be too dumb for books like this. There are parts I understand and that intrigue me, but then suddenly things get too complicated for me to wrap my head around. This is mostly, but not exclusively, true of the sections that delve deeply into math (though the author, thankfully, relegates a lot of the math to notes), but there are plenty of non-math sections that were equally incomprehensible to me. Some of the notes are useful for clarification, but others just muddy the waters more. The last two chapters, where he delves into simulation theories, and then concludes by more comprehensibly summarizes the entirety of the book were the most readable and enjoyable to me. I'm glad I read it but am not sure I learned as much as I should have."

25,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20311760-santiago-ortiz,4,"This is a fascinating book that explains with great clarity no less than 9 versions of multiverses. Each of these are mind-expanding (or mind-folding, mind-bending, mind-exploding, mind-blowing, mind-wrinkling‚Ä¶ depending of the multiverse version). And, in many of the cases, the alternative to the existence of a multiverse is at least as anti-intuitive and/or unbelievable. So be reassured that reading this book will give you a sense that reality is much more than what our senses, or even our expanded senses (technology) can grasp. This book navigates the frontiers of science and it's honest about it, presenting the many ‚Äìand dramatically clashing‚Äìpoint of views (the multiscience).I missed three things in this book:- Any mention to quantum computation, specially when dealing with the Many-Worlds quantum interpretation. These two are eventually related by the fascinating fact that multiple computers (and people around them), from different universes, are working in parallel to get an operation done way faster to what can be done in a single universe. Multiverse collaboration.- Relations between different multiverses. It‚Äôs not discussed in the book wether the multiverse versions could co-exist, interfere with each other, or eventually, as my intuition says, two version could actually be two approaches for the same (the infinite Universe and the Many-world interpretation, for instance, could be the same since both contain the same information).- Borges is properly mentioned when dealing with two of the multiverse versions. He created prodigious analogies for the total multiverse and the many-worlds interpretation. But he‚Äôs forgotten in the infinite multiverse chapter, for which Borges do not created an analogy, but an exact description (perhaps by changing ‚Äútime‚Äù by ‚Äúspace‚Äù). So I'll quote him here:""The number of all the atoms that compose the world is immense but finite, and as such only capable of a finite (though also immense) number of permutations. In an infinite stretch of time, the number of possible permutations must be run through, and the universe has to repeat itself. Once again you will be born from a belly, once again your skeleton will grow, once again this same page will reach your identical hands, once again you will follow the course of all the hours of your life until that of your incredible death."", from The Doctryne of the Cycles, written in 1936."
26,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15058212-shayla,4,"Really enjoyed this, especially since it introduced me to string theory which I always thought would be so much more complicated! But it turns out to be such a beautiful concept.Parallel universes will always be one of those things that interest people I think, and I'm glad that I can now sort of talk about them intelligently. My favorite theories are the simulation one, the cyclic multiverse, and quilted multiverse, with maybe brane worlds thrown in there. My only problems with this book were 1) I want to be an astrophysicist and what I've studied before definitely helped here, but some of the concepts just completely lost me in a couple places (namely the holographic universe), and 2) sometimes could not connect all the different tangents in a chapter back to the main idea.Other than that, great book and I recommend for anyone looking to learn more about parallel universes who has at least some prior knowledge of physics/astronomy."
27,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11200007-douglas-cosby,4,"Great book on multi-verse ideas. Brian Greene is one of the best explainers of complicated physics topics alive today. He is even better in person, but this book does a good job laying out the different possible types of multi-verses. While a lot of the ideas represented in the book seem speculative, even fanciful, to me, that is what I thought when I first read Hawking's ""A Brief History Of Time"". In my opinion, the only current writer that can hold a candle to Greene is Sean Carroll. I can't wait for his next book."
28,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17648164-umair-khan,4,"In The Hidden Reality, celebrated theoretical physicist Brian Greene explains the mind-boggling idea of a ‚ÄòMultiverse‚Äô (plural of universe). A professor of physics at Columbia University, Greene is well-known for his two earlier works on popular science, The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos which sought to explain, among other things, the very nature of space-time. But The Hidden Reality, in explicating the idea of multiple realities, shows the layperson something that has never before been presented by a popular physicist.The Big Bang Theory, which suggests the origin of the universe some 14 billion years ago gives rise to several other theories which require our universe not to be the only one. Most readers of popular science are familiar with the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics and M-theory‚Äôs ‚Äúbraneworld‚Äù. Multiverses, Greene writes in this book, are ‚Äúharder to avoid than they are to find‚Äù and he discusses nine theories in their support.From the plain old ‚ÄúQuilted Multiverse theory‚Äù that postulates that in this infinite universe, there is bound to be repetition of the order of things to the ‚ÄúInflation theory‚Äù that suggests that our universe began as a rapidly expanding bubble of empty space, Greene discusses the all. ‚ÄúString theory‚Äù gained popularity because it successfully unifies General Relativity and Quantum Theory and verification is expected from the experiments currently being run at the Large Hadron Collider. Greene also ponders over the possibility of a ‚ÄúSimulated Multiverse‚Äù, theorising that we may all be part of a simulation, like that in The Matrix. Extending this supposition further, the creators of our simulation might themselves be part of another simulation and the final wonderland is the ‚ÄúUltimate Multiverse‚Äù in which everything that can exist and is mathematically consistent actually exists ‚Äòsomewhere‚Äô.As a teenager I read scientists like Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking on the queer nature of black holes, the philosophical dilemmas of time travel, and the creationist implications of the big bang theory. But compared to this, these problems seem mundanely simple. Some people call these theories scientific blasphemy, but in the words of George Bernard Shaw, ‚Äúall great truths begin as blasphemies‚Äù. The Hidden Reality both popularizes scientific ideas and shines a light on the path that will be explored by future physicists.These theories are challenging simplistic notions about science by ‚Äòenhancement‚Äô of mathematical and scientific standards. In order to resolve the deepest mysteries and the greatest dilemmas of modern science, modern scientists are willing to accept these bizarre-looking properties of the natural world. We have reached the point where we need to re-examine what is and is not science and how theories can be verified and accepted as scientific.Greene has selected an apt title for this book because nothing can be more hidden than a reality which is neither accessible physically nor conceivable mentally. The insightful and engaging narrative makes this complex tour of state-of-the art theoretical physics much more exhilarating and informative. Greene‚Äôsgreatest achievement is that even as you grapple with these allusive concepts, you start falling in love with these mysteries.Published in The Express Tribune, Sunday Magazine, May 1st, 2011http://tribune.com.pk/story/157862/th..."
29,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"This is a pretty good read.Greene does digress into silly analogies and painfully remedial mathematical lessons from time to time.Nevertheless, the many flavors of conceivable ""multiverses"" are an interesting and quite modern topic.Greene acts like a used car salesman at times, using syrupy language to give speculation more than it's due.Worst of all is his ""giving equal time"" to the anthropic principle!Anthropic arguments are nothing more than an ""I give up"" approach to explaining the yet-to-be-explained.ANY FREE PARAMETER can be pointed at with an up-turned nose, and labeled a ""problem with the theory"".The free parameter can then easily, and without fail, be ""explained"" using an anthropic argument.Why does [insert any free parameter of any theory here] have the value that it does? Maybe we're just lucky!You've solved nothing. No possible unique prediction can be made by anthropic reasoning alone.Any unique prediction can be made WITHOUT anthropic reasoning. It's useless. Worse than useless. It's wrong!The description of the measurement problem was good.The description of the holographic principle was good.I was really surprised by one assertion: Copenhagen and Many Worlds have different predictions. Greene argues that in Many Worlds, the wave-function have multiple spikes, corresponding to different possible outcomes. He reasons that these ""spiked waves"" might interfere, causing an observable interference pattern, which would disagree with Copenhagen wave function collapse. He admits that decoherence makes this ""an extraordinarily formidable task"", but I'm not sure what he means by this! Is it formidable to do the calculations, or formidable to measure them? He states his clear belief that Copenhagen and Many Worlds are, in fact, distinct theories, but doesn't at ALL explain how he reached this conclusion. Every source I've ever read treats them as interpretations which make the SAME predictions. In this case, I certainly do NOT take his word for it, and neither should you, fellow reader...The end of the book devolves quickly into child-like nonsense philosophy like the ""ultimate multiverse"" where ""math is reality"" and every possible equation gets it's own universe... Honestly, I don't know why the publisher let Greene put this frivolity in an otherwise serious book."
30,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7308179-jerry,4,"This book presents nine different theories supporting the idea of parallel universes. These are consistent with current physics theory and observational data. At this time there is not enough data to discern which one if any might in fact be a true representation of reality. One of the more interesting theories to me is the Quilted Multiverse.An infinite universe can be divided into a series of spherical patches each the size of the cosmic horizon. The cosmic horizon is the distance that light can have traveled since the beginning of the big bang thus is the farthest that can be seen from any given point. The universe has been expanding for 13.7 billion years. The cosmic horizon is now 41 billion light-years. No information has traveled between the patches so they are completely independent. If the universe is infinite, then there are an infinite number of patches. There is a limit to how many particles can fit into a patch of this limited size: about 10 to the 56th grams. This is the amount of mass that can fit into a black hole of this size. With an infinite universe there will be an infinite number of patches but each has a finite number of particles so there are a finite number of possible arrangements of the particles: 1 followed by 10 to the 122th zeros. This means that the arrangements must necessarily be repeated across patches. Therefore, there must be an infinite number of copies of our universe. And there would also be copies of a universe where you had something different for breakfast this morning, and a copy where you married a different person, and a copy with every other decision you and every other person made differently. Everything that could happen has happened in some universe of the quilted multiverse. But you could never travel to one of these other universes because the distances are too far for even light to travel."
31,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5580648-the-abeyant,4,"This is my first post on Good Reads, so we'll see how this goes. My fianc√© has been on here for quite some time, and she insisted that I become part of the group, so here I am.The book was a very smooth read for me, being someone who is comfortable with mathematics and science. All of the concepts and theories put forth in this book were things I had encountered before (via Through The Wormhole, in particular), and I feel that it greatly helped me to visualize what was being discussed, having seen them before on TV.The whole idea of multiverses is just really out there, and when it seems that all the math is there (I trust Greene when he says so, I'm not knowledgeable enough to really follow it all myself, or to care) to support the idea, that's even more crazy.I take it all with a grain of salt, of course. Odds are, that even if there are other parallel worlds, or an infinite series of universes that harbor every possible reality ever, we'll never encounter them to any significant degree. It will likely always remain theoretical. It's all just really cool in principle. It gets overwhelming to think about the complexities of the ideas of infinity - it always has. Since I was young, I'd find myself lying awake in bed pondering the sheer concept of the infinite... and of nothing. I love it, but after a while, you lose interest, and you just want to focus on living. If there is a deeper meaning to life, or any grand answer, then maybe death will bring us one step closer. Spending too much mental energy on it isn't worthwhile.I'm also particularly fond of the idea of the entire world being a computer simulation. I don't believe it is one, but the fact that it could be is thought provoking enough. I've been encountering various themes like that recently."
32,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,3,"If you want to see a weak theory oversold, read this book.Greene can be clear, easy to understand, and even near-eloquent in explaining all the different types of multiverses. (I'll admit, though, that the details of how a quantum tunneling multiverse could work aren't 100 percent clear still.)That said, there are some issues with the book.First, on the ""simulations multiverse"" chapter, Greene naively claims that ""sims"" inside a universe could always figure out, eventually, that they were sims. Why? This is absolutely not necessary philosophically, and Greene can't offer any scientific or engineering reason why a simulation multiverse couldn't evolve in ways that would prevent the sims from ever discovering their fate.Add in that the language in this chapter at times got a bit close to creationism without a creator, or, more bluntly, that Greene ran head-on into the origin of the universe philosophical argument from a first cause and didn't/doesn't even recognize it, and the book fell from the four stars it was at already down to three.Beyond the philosophy issues, Greene was definitely pushing the envelope on what is realistic in such a multiverse, or not.Second, the cheerleading. Even before this multiverse, it's clear that he *wants* some version of a multiverse to be true. That really started to come out starkly in the chapter on the many worlds multiverse. He explains what the main objections are to Everett's theory, but, IMO, he doesn't *answer* the objections.Third, the question of what science is, or should be. Greene calls himself a realist, but seems comfortable with ideas that not only can't be falsified now, but may never be falsifiable and will have no impact on us being called science. I'm not quite there. "

Sound fantastical?I stopped reading this book on page 87, and I'm going to have to put it in my Goodreads category of books-I-gave-up-reading. Here's why:Up to this point the author is starting with his conclusions, which is, in his term, that reality is a Quilted Multiverse. (This is the Many Worlds hypothesis.) In an infinite space, he writes, there are an infinite number of universes, and the particles that formed one (ours) are in every other one. In other words: you exist an infinite amount of times somewhere ""out there."" To this point in the text he's provided no proof of his claim, only his description that this is so. And I really appreciate his descriptions and explanations. Some really bring them to life; like his describing the multiverse bubbles as the air pockets in a block of Swiss cheese. Neat, but he presents it as a logical conclusion. It's anything but that. It's illogical. How is this science? Disappointed, I put the book down. I read several other reviews on Amazon and found one of three other 1-star reviews that provided confirmation of my suspicions. String theory is untestable, and so it is a metaphysical belief, not actual science. (I had no idea there was such a war going on within physics today; some googling led me to several Wikipedia pages of various authors, blogs, and articles; wow.)Such a shame, I was really looking forward to reading this book.

34,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,5,"Once again Brian Greene demonstrates that he is very talented writer. He exemplifies the sort of person that the modern world so desperately needs -- a first-class scientist who can also effectively communicate both the findings and the excitement of modern science.In this book, he introduces readers to several themes of modern physics and cosmology, all centering around the seemingly infinite universe about us -- the ""quilted multiverse"", the inflationary multiverse, string theory and the multiverse, the cosmological constant paradox, the landscape multiverse, the many-worlds formulation of quantum mechanics, the holographic multiverse, and, finally, recent thinking on the ""computable universe"" and physical reality.Greene accomplishes all of this without equations (although I wish he would use one or two here and there). Although the book superficially is readable by a layperson, nonetheless, it is probably not realistic to expect that a person completely without college+ level training in physics and astronomy would be able to completely follow his arguments.But it is an excellent read. Highly recommended."

Greene goes some way to explain how some of these ideas could make sense and perhaps be proved (to the extent that positing the existence of realms of reality -sorry- that are completely inaccesible to us could be done at all). One little point: he tries to put together arguments for and against each of these postulates (and of course, again, many look very reasonable but I haven't got the tools to judge) but he seems to put a bit more weight (and expound much more at length) in the arguments for than against. A good read nonetheless and one that offers breathtaking vistas and thoughts on what may be reality and the universe(s)."

I love the idea of a highly encoded piece of information undergoing a transform that then gets plastered upon the ceiling of the universe. Touching upon branes and seeing how they might possibly touch each other was also pretty cool.

41,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12807932-b-j-richardson,4,"I can sum this book up with one long sentence. Oh look, if you play around with these math equations enough and/or if you take these cosmological concepts to ridiculous extremes, it makes it look like there are multiple (or infinite) universes.Normally, I really like Brian Greene. I think he is one of the best out there at taking the cutting edge of quantum mechanics and making it accessible to dullards like me. Problem is, this time he has picked a topic I just can't get behind. Even if multiple universes exist, they are not accessible to us and they change nothing in our own universe. So... it isn't really science but rather just mind games. Here are the mind game theories he plays with in exploring the possibilities of multiverses:1) Quilted multiverse - Just imagine an infinitely large quilt. Eventually, some of the patterns are necessarily bound to repeat. In fact, if it truly is infinite, all patterns will repeat an infinite number of times. In the same way, the conditions in an infinite universe will repeat across space creating parallel worlds. There's another you out there. There's an infinite number of ""you"" out there.2) Inflationary multiverse - The universe is constantly expanding. Everything is. And new universes are popping up in the expanded space of older ones. Imagine it like a chunk of Swiss cheese that keeps getting bigger and bigger with new holes popping up when the existing ones get too far separated.3) Brane multiverse - This is the first of a series of theories (I use that term loosely) that come out of the math related to string theory. According to ST, there are at least 11 dimensions and our universe exists in 3 of them. Other universes might possibly exist in other dimensions.4) Cyclic multiverse - Imagine that two of the branes in the ""theory"" above inhabit at least one similar dimension. If these branes collide, they would (possibly, maybe) create a cataclysm similar to a big bang that would bring into creation other branes inhabiting other dimensions. 5) Landscape multiverse - The math nerds who are really into string theory have realized that there are an infinite number of multiple dimensional shapes that can be created when you play around enough with ST's equations. This version of the multiverse states that each of those shapes represents a real brane universe somewhere out there.6) Quantum Multiverse - This one is a scientific version of a theory that many of us are familiar with. Imagine Schrodinger's cat. I look in my box and he's dead. But another me in a parallel universe looks in his box and the cat is alive. I eat Chinese for dinner, he goes hungry. Quantum mechanics if loaded with probabilities rather than certainty. This theory states that each and every variable in those probabilities is realized in parallel universes. 7) Holographic multiverse - Our universe is mirrored by a reality taking place on a distant bounding surface. In other words, there is a physically equivalent ""holograph"" of everything in our universe... somewhere out there.8) Simulated Universe - The Matrix9) Ultimate universe - Any type of universe that can be imagined really does exist.I will let you decide for yourself how plausible any of these theories might be. For me, I don't mind exploring the ideas of some of them when they are played out in science fiction/fantasy. Its just... I was thinking this book would be a bit lighter on the fantasy and a little heaver on the science. Oh well, Brian Greene is still a great author. "
42,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55180466-akhil-munjal,4,"This book is sitting at the very edge of what science understands and what is yet unknown in terms of multi universes and quantum laws. This is a great book if one wants to get lost in the nuances of string theory, multiverse and the latest thought experiments in physics which are trying to weave a unified theory building upon Einstein's theories. Being a layperson myself I have to admit alot in this book was beyond my comprehension but that maybe because I am a being living in 3 dimension instead of 4 or 5 dimensions. I would recommend this book to a reader curious about detailed theoretical explorations in the multiverse landscape especially if reader is looking for a audiobook as I can't think of any other book which explores these concepts in such detail in the audio medium.5 years from now, I would like to revisit this book with a notebook and pencil to make notes and cross reference ideas but for the moment I went through it just once and came out feeling more list then enlightened. For a layperson like me, I would recommend reading about the topics presented in this book in conjunction with wikipedia to put ideas into perspective.Edit - I loved Dr Greene's TV show and have watched it quite a few times on Netflix - but I had not made the correlation between the author of this book and the show host till now.

Without a good foundation of previous knowledge, I found myself researching concepts, re-reading passages two or three times, and then going forward in an attempt to jolt myself into understanding.That said, Brian Greene does help simplify complex concepts with some nicely grounded imagery. I particularly like the explanation of the inflationary universe theory using Swiss cheese, or describing the braneworld scenario by likening us to fish in an aquarium.Greene also does a great job of presenting various theories and hypothesis, though the fact that some of these are incapable of being tested is a bit mind blowing to a layperson. I am definitely keeping this book as a reference for future research. "

That said, his explanatory analogies are strained often to the point of absurdity (i.e. Finding actors for ""Harvey W. Einstein's"" new movie, ""Pulp Friction""; locating electrons in a 3D map of New York). It is almost as if Kaku beat him to all the good ones and he had to make do with what was left.

"
56,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1925269-paul-weimer,5,"Brian Greene is the foremost advocate for the power and strength of String Theory. While he himself might not be on the cutting edge of string theory research, his role as a popularizer and explainer of string theory makes him the one name the average person could name, if they could name anyone at all, involved with string theory. In the Hidden Reality, Brian Greene builds on his previous two books, The Elegant Universe, and The Fabric of the Cosmos, to continue the story of String Theory in a new context--the Multiverse. The Universe is big, nearly indescribably so. Far from the small sphere imagined by the ancients, the universe is so large that there are regions of space within our universe that have expanded so far away, so fast, that we can never, ever see them. And yet even given that, that may not be the full extent of all that is. Such heady concepts abound in the Hidden Reality, where Greene describes a series of scenarios where our universe, our reality, is only one of many. From the quantum mechanical to branes to us living in a computer simulation a la the Matrix, Greene illustrates a number of possibilities for parallel universes of various kinds--from places where duplicates of Earth exist, to places where the very laws of reality are stunningly different. String Theory, the contentious, complicated and convoluted mathematics that describe one dimensional strings as the fundamental building block of everything, are our tool and guidepost for exploring these possible multiverses. While The Hidden Reality is a popular science book, one should not mistake this book as easy or light reading for anyone outside of the fields of Physics. Greene could have made this book even more comprehensive, as he again and again subcontracts some of his more detailed explanations to his other two books for readers interested in the deeper details of a point he is making. Having read both of his books, I didn't find this off putting, but it felt like he was overly pimping his work a bit the nth time I came across this practice in the text.The other thing to understand before picking up this book is his evangelistic attitude toward String Theory. There are some other physics theories out there that attempt to unify and explain things in the same way that String Theory does. (e.g. Loop Quantum Gravity) but Greene is frankly dismissive of these other approaches. High level Physics readers who have problems with String Theory will definitely not like this book, since reading nearly all of it predicates an acceptance of String Theory.Should you read this book? If you have read, relatively understood and enjoyed Greene's previous two books, then, absolutely. Greene marries string theory and its latest developments and evolutions with a sheaf of ideas for multiverses. Greene may not be Stephen Hawking, but he does a good job at making this material as accessible to the hoi polloi as it is possible. If String Theory to you sounds like something that happens to your Ramen noodles, then this is not quite the place to start. I would try the Elegant Universe, and then, if you understood and enjoyed that, come back to The Hidden Reality, possibly by way of the Fabric of the Universe.If Greene is right, and one of these multiverse theories are correct, then there is an alternate you, right now, reading this review, possibly wondering if there are more of you somewhere else in the multiverse. Heady stuff."
57,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105908-nate-johnson,3,"While I suppose this was an overall solid book, it had the dynamics of watching the big-bang in reverse as interesting opening chapters with infinite possibility got sucked into a singularity of, well, density. It was difficult for me to tell if this was because the material itself is inherently conceptually incomprehensible - I'm sure it's mind-bogglingly difficult - but unlike Greene's other forays into rendering the obtuse transparent, I feel this time his skills were not up to the task. He also engaged in my least-favorite aspect of all pop-science writing, the speculative epilogue. Greene struggled with the last view versions of speculative physics-based multiverses, which was fine and entirely expected; frontiers wouldn't be frontiers were they not difficult. But his step into the realm of computer simulations of and, E-friggin'-gads, philosophical versions of multiverses, were disastrous. I applaud his effort to incorporate these into a total vision of the topic of multiverses, but given that those latter theories relied on complex bodies of information theory, theories of the mind-body problem (hard and ""soft"" versions), and some pretty hard-core metaphysics (which get scant mention), I think he may have been better off politely declaring these aspects beyond the purview of the book. As it stood, the book overstepped, and an otherwise sharp account ended up saying some rather silly things in its concluding paragraphs*. For a book that requires so much imagination and vision to grasp, not to mention write, I found it odd that Greene failed to imagine that perhaps our earthbound imaginations and all their assumptions that math is eternal, that logic coheres, could break down in the, ahem, astral planes. (* - I'll limit things to one example - after a long explanation of how the possibility of total multiverses and computer simulated universes effectively challenges our faith in the reality of anything we see, he then went on to hinge his belief in the likelihood of these scenarios in whether evidence for them existed within what he just alleged we have every reason to be skeptical of. I.e., he says something along the lines of ""I'm not going to worry about the possibility of simulated universes until I see one in this reality,"" which is just a blatant mischaracterization of the knowledge relationships of hierarchical metaphysics. We have no reason whatsoever to assume that metaphysical possibilities for generating this world are contingent on those metaphysical properties being replicated by physical ones in this world. That's kinda the entire point of having that prefix ""meta"" before ""physics."" Ya dig? Ditto for his comments on possibilities of math and computers, etc. Alright, I'll stop).So, in short - a great, fascinating look at how exactly how theoretical physics leads to reasonable speculation about multiverses. It's not the wackiness that typically gets portrayed. So the first, say, 200 pages of the book flew by and were of the same quality of The Elegant Universe. The remainder got slower and slower and slower until the book devoured itself and made for some pretty painful reading. I admire the task Greene undertakes, but if the later theories in this book are still this impenetrable, perhaps the book is premature. That said, I enjoyed this account that while there may be nothing new under the sun, there's some potentially crazy stuff happening above it."
58,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4004160-john,5,"Wow. And also: holy crap. This is the book I wished the last Stephen Hawking book was going to be (but never could). Greene does an amazing job of explaining the mathematical approaches to physics, their validity, and how every one of them‚Äîwhen taken far enough down the path‚Äîleads to the appearance of multiple universes. Multiple universes. Think about that. Our solar system has 8 planets (sorry Pluto); our galaxy has hundreds of billions of stars in it, more or less like our sun. And there are hundreds of billions of galaxies out there. That's our universe‚Äîour knowable universe. But the observable horizon‚Äîthe section of ""what is"" that I described above‚Äîis just the tip of the iceberg. It's ostensibly even less than that. Less than a grain of sand on the beach.

If you get into this stuff, Greene's rundown of the different multiple universe scenarios‚Äîthe quilted multiverse, the inflation universe, the brane universe, etc‚Äîis very accessible.

59,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6007036-stephen-chen,4,"I enjoyed this book -- it was more difficult to understand than the Elegant Universe. Unlike the Elegant Universe, which spent a fair amount of time covering earlier developments in physics and quantum mechanics before getting to string theory, it moved more quickly into the actual new content, and honestly I enjoy reviewing those developments since I am not well grounded in them, so I missed that. But I did enjoy reading about the extent to which string theory has seen additional mathematical or experimental verification, how the theory has developed and the continuing challenges it faces. It also had a pretty interesting discussion on the anthropic principle, which I've read small articles on but still find very odd, and on the concept of wrestling whether speculation on the elements of the universe which by their definition are unobservable is really science. Its pretty interesting to think that we're getting to the boundaries of traditional conceptions of science as explaining why something acts or is the way it is due to fundamental rules about reality since we are asking ourselves why our fundamental rules of reality are the way they are and not some other way and the sort of mind-tripping explanations that science is coming up with to explain that (many of which are, in a nutshell, that the rules of the universe are simply the way they are because we happen to be in this universe and there are actually other universes where the fundamental rules are not the way they are here -- which itself raises questions as to whether that's a satisfying answer -- even if it were the right one). Also, Greene mentions learning from Robert Nozick at the end and postulates a universe theory based not on scientific theory but based off of his time learning from him -- which is interesting to see the intersection of philosophy and science -- things that I normally view as diverging several hundred years ago."
60,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37884382-corvus,5,"This book is 8 years old so parts of it are of course dated. For instance, evidence of gravitational waves has been found since its publication. But, there is still a lot to be gained. The book is definitely heavy and requires your attention. If you have never encountered these topics, you may have to repeat sections. I have and still repeated parts. That said, Greene wrote the book so that a wider audience could access it and he did an excellent job executing that intention. He gives the reader the opportunity to skip ahead if they already know something or even if they find a topic too saturating. He does his best to describe complex subjects to someone who knows little to nothing about them. He structures the book so that you can get through the whole thing and generally follow along even if you don't fully grasp every element of the text. Greene is the master of analogy and regularly uses easy to understand examples to explain complex and outstanding concepts. I saw Greene on a talk show discussing the discovery of gravitational wave evidence and I'm curious about how this book would read were it revised with new discoveries. Im not sharp enough to draw all those conclusions myself but do grasp somewhat what is now different in our understandings of possible multiverses among other things. When I was a child I would lay awake at night concerned about what was outside the universe. My dad taught me it was a finite thing. What was nothing? How could there be nothing outside of something? Somehow the near infinite possibilities of multiverses is a less disconcerting thought for the human mind. Also, Greene being an ethical vegan is a nice plus. He doesn't discuss it in this book, but I like that a man this logical often includes emotional reasoning as connected and valid."

That is my fault, not the author‚Äôs. Not even having taken a high school physics class, even the basic language used was beyond me. It was a good read though, in showing how much there is out there that I really have no clue about. The basic foundation of the book is that we have a limited understanding of our own universe and theoretical physics has indicated that our universe may not be the only one. That we are in fact part of a multiverse, consisting of other worlds in various states of evolution, including some that look exactly like ours. The most mind-blowing idea is that we are really all just random collections of particles and if there are infinite universes, statistically there has to be at least one in which the particles have coalesced just like ours so that there is an exact replica of us, doing the exact same thing, and having the exact same experience. Weird. There are ten different theories invoked by the author that could indicate our universe is not the only one. I was completely lost once he got to string theory, though, and really had to force myself to finish the last two-thirds of the book. I would push past something even if I did not remotely grasp what he was talking about. From Einstein‚Äôs theories of general and special relativity to Hawking‚Äôs theories on the entropy of black holes, the concepts conveyed are not the simplest to wrap your mind around."
62,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2439329-keith-davis,3,"After reading Greene's book I am less inclined to believe in the reality of parallel universes. The idea of everything being repeated an infinite number of times in an infinite universe seems ridiculous. Infinity is a mathematical abstraction that has no correlation with the physical universe. All discussion of infinity immediately bogs down into paradox, which is a sign that you have gone down the wrong track. String theory seems to be an exercise in devising a mathematical model to explain an imaginary universe and then trying to prove the imaginary universe is the real universe because it makes sense to you. Nine spacial dimensions? Strings or branes instead of particles? Why not?The many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics just seems to be wrong. Quantum theory explains events in terms of probability, but if every probability becomes a reality in a parallel world then the probability is eliminated. If one outcome has a likelihood of 90% and the other 10%, but they both happen in parallel worlds, then all possible outcomes were 100% certain and probability is meaningless.The holographic multiverse theory is just a speculation built on top of a speculation, while the simulated and ultimate theories appear to be little more than philosophical games. The inflationary bubble universe theory seems to be the only one of the multiverse theories that actually has a decent argument behind it."
63,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6977363-marjorie-thelen,5,"What is real? This has been a question of mine for a long time. From a physics perspective Brian Greene explores the question in his new book The Hidden Reality, Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of Cosmos. While he's a physics professor at Colombia University, he writes in layman's language as far as such esoteric concepts can be expressed outside of mathematics. It took me two months to read the book ‚Äì not a page turner but a thought provoker. I recommend reading the last chapter first to get an over view of the nine Multiverses Greene systematically explains in the the book. Basically, the idea is that there is more than one universe, but there isn't agreement about how many and how they manifest. Of nine Multiverses that may be possible, the one that blew me away is the possibility our world could be someone else's computer simulation. Shades of the move the Matrix. In the beginning of the chapter on‚Äù Black Holes and Holograms ‚Äì The Holographic Multiverse,‚Äù Greene refers to Plato's allegory of the cave ‚Äì that we are people chained facing the back wall of a cave watching shadows of the real world. That our perceptions are but a faint inkling of a far richer reality that flickers beyond reach. Greene has written two other excellent books ‚Äì The Fabric of the Cosmos and The Elegant Universe. Take a stab at them. I already have Fabric of the Cosmos and am going to buy The Hidden Reality since I read the library copy and couldn't scribble, underline and make notes. "
64,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/750659-don,4,"Truly fascinating read. The subtitle gives a general idea of what the book addresses, and I found Greene (second book of his I have read) to again be very good at explaining complex and abstract scientific thought and theory so that a layman could understand. Often, when I read a book that discusses ideas that are generally a little over my head, I am just trying to increase my exposure so that I slowly accumulate the language of the knowledge, and thus become more prepared to intake the knowledge on the next book I read on the topic. And with Greene's help, I think I did in reading this book, and have at least discovered one way of understanding the concept of ""parallel"" universes that truly makes sense to me and makes, I think, rational sense as well. I love reading something that introduces new ideas and stretches my mind to think and wrestle with those ideas, particularly when dealing with the nature of reality. This book does it, and because of Greene's easy to read writing style and skill at explaining the topic (as well as necessary background information like Einstein's theories of relativity), I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about what quantum mechanics or quantum theory is all about."
65,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2090739-gary-greenberg,5,"Really thoughtful exploration of all kinds of alternative universes (multiverses)From what I can retain, any of these can explain/predict multiple universes:- cosmologically equivalent from alternative (or nested) cosmic expansions, with different or similar cosmological constants- string-theory's Brame (membranes) in retreat or in variable contact with one-another- probabilistic diverting streams from quantum theory's concept of indeterminate presence frozen into place upon detection, leaving other locations (& other detectors) to create infinitely branching realities (Everett's multiple universes)- simulated realities, based on soon infinitely complex computer replicas of our universe, indistinguishable to their residents from a real reality. Who's to say ours is any more real?- (hardest of all); Based on black-holes' entropy written on their 2-D event horizon, how about the whole or our universe written on the lesser dimensional surface of a singularityMore fantastical than other Brian Greene books, but very comfortable narrative. I only got (& stayed) lost at the Brame/string ones and (worse!) with the entropy 1-fewer-dimensions-of-reality hologram idea.Very stimulating and rewarding."
66,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11740767-bengt,4,"The Hidden Reality is an excellent armchair guide to some of the more bizarre and extraordinary ideas of theoretical physics. This book explores several candidate theories for parallel universes, while covering an extensive and chronological review of physics history and theory. What makes the content so accessible is Greene's unparalleled ability to elucidate monstrously complex ideas with clear, concise, and oftentimes humorous analogies. For the most part, Greene shows an adept command of the content, and remains both scientifically and philosophically objective; furthermore, Greene plays devil's advocate when necessary -- even to the point of making the reader wonder whether he should chalk whole thing up to G√∂del's Incompleteness Theorem, as in the final chapter on mathematical reality. Having said that, the density of several ideas (e.g. Higgs fields and potential energy curves, the string landscape, probability waves) in relation to parallel universes escapes even Greene's conciseness, and the most tantalizing ideas (i.e. black holes and the holographic universe) are given decidedly less attention. Nonetheless, the book is a profound read for those with an inquisitive nature and a background understanding of string theory and quantum mechanics. "
67,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70856263-sanya,4,"The Hidden Reality by Brian Greene is essentially a ‚Äúmade for the layman‚Äù book dealing with multiverses that will leave your head swimming and your conscience questioning the very meaning of consciousness. This is the manifestation of what could be possible if we leave all our inhibitions and preconceptions at the door and truly think about the secrets that the universe holds. Greene beautifully weaves in theory, speculation, and evidence to paint a convincing picture of the realities that the human brain may miss out on. While I myself had considerable trouble trying to wrap my brain around the fact that anything is possible in the universe, this book gave me a reminder about just how little we actually know about our own universe.  Greene starts out simple and then delves right into the heart of the theories and proofs that have shaped the face of science today. While it is heavily loaded with text and scientific terms that might be difficult to understand, the book does its job of laying down exactly how the multiple theories of the multiverse come into play from all that is known today. And just when you‚Äôre ready to give up after reading line upon line and yet none of it making any sense, Greene drops the bombs that leave you questioning just how something like that could be possible. And yet, none of what he says is hard to believe because of the evidence he provides throughout the book. And of course, he does not claim that any of this is real and that one has to believe in these theories- only that they might be, according to the evidence that has surfaced.  Greene starts out with an explanation of the steady-state theory, acknowledging that it is most likely wrong as current evidence shows, that assumes that there was no beginning at all- with new matter being created as space itself expands. And definitely, this is a start. This makes readers go back centuries to the numerous theories that surfaced and were promptly debunked after the evidence that surfaced. This sets the book in motion- a dynamic one that addresses changes over time that physics, chemistry, and astrophysics have gone through. He then moves into the theory of the quilted multiverse, a multiverse with smaller universes situated within separate ‚Äúquilt‚Äù patches- unable to come into contact with the other patches at all. He then moves into an explanation of the Inflationary Theory, which, in fact, gives rise to the inflated multiverse. The inflationary theory deals with bubble, or pocket, universes that are a part of the ‚Äúcosmic cheese‚Äô. So, as the cheese expands, more bubbles are created. And of course, these bubbles are so far distant that they cannot communicate with each other.  Then comes the braneworld, which can only be imagined as infinite parallel planes stretching into infinity. This theory relies heavily on string theory, which is something extremely simple and yet extremely complex at the same time. This scenario deals with different dimensions that might just be close to us, but beyond our reach because of just how minuscule they are, The Cyclic Multiverse, in turn, stems from the braneworld. In a trillion years, partner branes are said to collide- destroying the past universes while creating new ones. As hard as this may be to imagine, it definitely isn‚Äôt the craziest of them all. There‚Äôs a multiverse that is based on the cosmological constant- with different values of the constant creating different atmospheric conditions in different worlds. So, constants that are close to ours can give rise to different worlds with conditions similar to ours, and thus, life forms like ours.  One of the hardest multiverses to understand was the landscape multiverse. This one deals with bubble universes within bubble universes due to different dimensions, and quite frankly, I still don‚Äôt grasp the whole concept of this one. There were pictures designed to help, but they were extremely confusing from a layman‚Äôs perspective. Moving on to the quantum multiverse, this one deals entirely with probabilities and their spikes at different locations. The electron probability waves show spikes at two different locations, meaning that this reality and that reality are both happening at the same time- and thus, multiverses. Moving on, the holographic multiverse is akin to the landscape multiverse- meaning it is extremely difficult to understand. What I did get from it was that the projection of reality happens inside, where we see things, while the information processing is taking place at some distant locus of control- exactly like a hologram. This one basically says that all we see are projections of information.  The simulated universe is by far one of the craziest, and slightly unbelievable, theories I‚Äôve ever encountered. Greene drops the bomb on us that we just might be inside a computer simulation with our brains being stimulated by some supercomputer that is generating these simulations. Of course, it is more complicated than that, but this is the gist of it. And if we are in a simulation, who is to say that there aren‚Äôt more of these? Who is to say that humans elsewhere have mastered the art of simulation and have created more of them? Ultimately, this leads to the ultimate multiverse- mostly a philosophical theory of the multiverse. Here, every possible universe exists. No single theory is true- all of them are true. This is the only theory that doesn‚Äôt generate the question- why this particular theory- because all of them are true. Greene takes us on a journey through all these endless possibilities while neither confirming nor denying anything. He reinforces the fact that the age of knowledge is still in its primary stage with a long way to go. What makes this book special is that it dares to do what others may not think possible- explaining complicated topics with sugar-coated explanations that may not be complete. However, it provides us with a vast array of knowledge at our disposal that isn‚Äôt necessarily inaccurate- just incomplete. This book debunked so many of the fundamentals we are taught in school about space-time, electrons, laws of physics, and so much more. While it can get exhausting at points, this book is still a good read for those who wish to explore more of what might keep scientists up at night. It definitely makes for a good read during quarantine."

And who better to navigate these hypothetical versions of the ""multiverse"" than Brian Greene? Normally an unflinching apologist for string theory, the bestselling author of The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos here treats all viable alternate realities to a laudably fair shake. For a book exploring the most far-reaching implications of bleeding-edge mathematics, The Hidden Reality is surprisingly light on math, written as it is ""for a broad audience ‚Ä¶ its only prerequisite the will to persevere."" Such perseverance pays off with a motley cast of potential universes featuring doppelg√§ngers, strings, branes, quantum probabilities, holographs, and simulated worlds. The result is that rare accomplishment in science writing for a popular audience: a volume that explains the science and its consequences while stimulating the imagination of even the uninitiated. "

But the hidden reality is that string theory kinda makes some sense after all, kinda, or am I just an easy woman? Greene's lively, and self-critical telling of the theory's checkered history leaves me with a well-let's-wait-and-see-attitude. He doesn't make a defensive attack, despite the acid critiques over several years by my erstwhile favorites named above. Instead, he illuminates the theory and its theorizers step by step over the decades, revealing with considerable charm (no pun initially intended) why we are where we are now, struggling to keep afloat--to understand the merest filament of--a huge, flawed, mystifying, revolutionary theory of the universe. No, make that the multiverse, with its stringy parallel worlds and its tiny little slices of transcendence. Please don't ask me any questions. "
70,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10270148-mac,4,"I heard Brian Greene interviewed on Radiolab, and he was fabulous; he provided fascinating ideas about parallel universes clearly interspersed with vivid examples, all presented through a pleasing mix of confidence and humility. So with that interview as background, I read Greene's The Hidden Reality, and it is excellent, exhibiting the same qualities of the interview.Additionally, the book is very well written. Greene writes with an effortless, clear prose, a logical progression from idea to idea, many excellent analogies and examples, numerous summaries of where we've been and where we're going, a (mostly) balanced portrayal of what's realistic and what's more speculative, and explicit declarations of what he believes. Just to be clear, there is much more than good writing here; Greene's depiction of many different multiverse proposals provides a wealth of information for the reader to chew on. All in all, the book is a banquet of mind-bending ideas served with great care and a pleasing style. "
71,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14100832-abdelkader-madoui,4,"In The Hidden Reality, professor Brian Greene discusses the idea of ""Multiverse"" which says that our universe is actually one of many. This contradicts with what we have always believed that the Universe ""ours"" is all that exists. When physicists tried to explain ""why this particular values"" of the constants of the cosmos, they realized that they have been asking the wrong question. It was clear that our universe is but one of many that have many different constants with ours having these particular constants we observe. Professor Greene discusses the possible types of The Multiverse; The Quilted Multiverse, the inflationary multiverse, the brane multiverse, the cyclic multiverse, the landscape multiverse, the quantum multiverse, the holographic multiverse, the simulated multiverse and finally the ultimate multiverse.It took me over a month to complete this fascinating book, although there are sections which I didn't fully grasped but I couldn't stop reading.

This book is, to me, like Greek mythology. The basic idea I came away with was this:""When physicists tried to work out the mysteries of the universe using String Theory mathematics, the equations didn't work out. If, however, we assumed that there were ten dimensions, instead of four, the math worked out perfectly. Therefore... there ARE ten dimensions, instead of four. Since there ARE ten dimensions, other calculations indicate that there MUST be parallel universes where all these dimensions come in to play.""The whole book book was this way. I am not unlearned, and understand the theories the author speaks of. I just don't see any REAL evidence that they show what they say they show.It takes a lot of blind faith to believe most of what is written in this book. Maybe more faith than it takes to believe in Zeus."

Well, in a parallel universe, you did. According to the theories explored in this book, there are multiple parallel universes Bumping up against our own, when you chose chocolate instead of vanilla, where you married Fred instead of George, where scratched your armpit two seconds later, and so on, and these choices affected the whole shape of your reality.This is fascinating stuff but not exactly easy reading, even though it is intended for the layman. I had to read it in bursts (often with large gaps in between) when my brain seemed most receptive to the information. I would recommend this to anyone that has an interest in physics or philosophy or both, but don't expect a relaxing read or page-turner. You gotta focus on every word!"

Escher-style imaginings, and impenetrable math. The bizarre theories that suggest possible parallel universes are fantastical and sometimes hard to conceptualize, but Greene is adept at analogous description so I felt I had a handle on most of it. There came a lucid moment out of the fog in the sea of physics when I realized that these concepts I was trying mightily to understand aren't real, but guesses! Sure, ""the math suggests"" or ""filling in the cosmological principle with this may mean that"" but it was all guesses! Fascinating as M-theory or Inflationary whosits are, you also get a basic overview of general principles that are field tested and that was helpful. "

I still absorbed a lot of the material, but I didn't *earn* it...The first half of the book is more or less rehashing the stuff I'd read in the first two books. Even some of the second half was familiar.Greene's descriptions of entropy as a tool for understanding physical phenomena and theory is just as interesting as it was in the second book. It still boggles me a bit how a concept can be used as a fairly precise tool. Precise enough to draw conclusions with.Overall, another good effort, but having read the first two (really read, not audio) there's just not as much new stuff there. A good snapshot of what topics physics is currently dealing with though. Interesting enough to see how much has been added to the story since Greene's first book in 1999."

Let me be clear, this isn't for everyone. Even though Brian Greene limits the amount of jargon and technical language, it is still pretty dense. Some people will have a hard time with this book. Then there are sections that will be hard to follow for pretty much everyone.However, I found this rather entertaining and interesting. The amount of detail given and the possibilities will make you give you greater insight into science and sci-fi. I know this helped when editing my own book (which luckily was nearly consistent with one of the theories Greene presents).It isn't the easiest book to read, but it's hard not to recommend."

You don't necessarily need to be a rocket scientist to absorb the material, but it helps if you had paid attention to your math and/or physics courses. Greene does a pretty good job of laying out the basic concepts behind the various multiverse theories and he likes drawing humorous analogies to those concepts. I came away a bit more informed about the universe.I'd like to think that the information you garner from here would help you hold an intelligent conversation with Sheldon Cooper -- and he might even compliment you on your breadth of knowledge. However, this book is not for the casual layperson. Take time to digest each chapter and it will be a decent read."
78,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3220056-pam,5,"The Hidden Reality is one of the most enjoyable non-fiction books I've read. In this book, Brian Greene discusses several theories on parallel universes and how those theories came about. I say it's enjoyable because 1) Parallel universes and 2) Greene discusses the theories -- all of which are based on really complex math -- in such a way that is easily understandable to those of us who are not versed in the concepts of advanced physics. If, however, the reader wants to know more about the inner workings of the theories discussed, there are still the end notes that give more details on those theories.But really, there is only one thing that should convince anyone to read this book: Parallel Universes -- many types of them."

Greene does a great job of explaining some of the most popular theories behind multiple universes. Some would find such infinite ideas frightening, but I find them comforting - I mean, really, how important are your problems in a multiverse of infinite time and infinite space, where there could be infinite numbers of you living infinite different lives. This is not an easy book to read, and the subject matter makes it almost impossible to be easy - but Greene does his best. Definite must-reading for the well-educated non-scientist. "

For most of the book I had to stretch my intellectual abilities to gain a glimmer of understanding; for some of it, no stretching would be enough. But I learned enough to be thoroughly fascinated by the subject. I don't believe the book is as ""accessible"" as its publisher claims, but it is still a masterful effort to explain things that even those formulating the theories don't understand fully."

This is the story of where modern physics leads us in terms on Cosmology and String theory. No one knows that the reality is, but the math leads to several possible concepts. One is a series infinite Universes, each contained inside of the next larger, slightly different Universe. So on and so on, all forming a bubble inside an infinite reach of foam, with each bubble a repeat of the same kind of nested infinite Universes and all of it expanding at unbelievable speeds. And that is just for starters. "

Many chapters were focused on answering a single question and throughout the book Greene showed an awareness of what critics are saying about the multiverse idea. Aside from presenting 8 or so different ways the universe could be just a small part of a multiverse, Greene included clear and concise explanations of quantum theory, black holes, the relation of mathematics and science, and string theory. I can't admit to understanding every idea presented but I did follow the line of reasoning for each chapter and felt good about that."

I suspect physicists have much more interesting lives then the rest of us could ever have imagined.Greene is a terrific reader (I listened to the audiobook and therefore didn't have to deal with footnotes). I'm going to see if our library has his other books in Overdrive downloadable format.

I thought I had a good grasp of modern physics' idea of multi-universes. This book shows how far into the shallow end I was really paddling. It turns out there are about 10 or so ways that parallel universes could exist. And parallel universes containing other parallel universes even! There's even a chapter on whether we're living inside a giant simulation and if there's any chance of our ever figuring that out. No math required (although the notes at the end dip into that if you're interested). Not for the faint of heart but worth the read if you like to stay up on the ""bleeding edge"" of cosmology and physics."

Greene gives a wide range of possible ways this may come about. I think the quilt has some merit, and like I said, even branes come out of it with some common sense.Even if you aren't big on the math, you will easily follow the paths that Green takes you (and all of the other yous in other universes as well)."

Much of current theory suggests that the universe that we experience may be a small part of a much larger multiverse.

What shocked me and made this book a late night page turner was the realization of just how much we do understand about the deep laws of nature."

Remembering parts of the series made it easier for me to understand, otherwise I likely would have gotten lost. One or two of the chapters did drag on and on, however, those were admittedly the parts where he'd said, look at this and skip the rest if you want to.

However, the second half of the book was a thought provoking, informative, and thorough account of what we should consider when questioning whether or not we are indeed in a multiverse. It ended up being one of my favorite books. "

Greene covers eight (give or take) theories about parallel universes with some well thought out and accessible examples. This really brings cosmology and physics (and super string theory) to light.

114,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2943820-christine,2,I just couldn't grasp what he was talking about. Prior education on the topic would have been useful for me. 
115,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2615958-j,2,"The book was written with one purpose in mind: to explain all the possible ways in which a multiverse could arise, given our current understanding of physics. As such, it is not as useful as his other two books. The author's first book explained the current state of string theory, with a multiverse being but a possibility of the theory. His second book delved into the philosophy of reality, given the physics as we know it, again, positing a multiverse as a possible result from string theory. In this book he seems at times almost wishful upon the existence of the multiverse.In other words, the author is not doing physics in this book. He is not even doing physics education. In this book he is an advocate for the multiverse. He wants this multiverse to exist for two reasons, as he hints in the book. For one, there is no need then to explain why the universe is as it is. After all, in a multiverse all sorts of possible universes exist, and this one just happens to be one of them. Thus, a multiverse presumably absolves him from explaining the world (which I should point out is his job as a physicist). Second, if the multiverse exists, then the same mechanism that creates the multiverse creates the universe we happen to live in: and thus there is a mechanism in sight for the beginning of our universe, a puzzle which has haunted atheist physicists since forever. And furthermore, maybe the multiverse is eternal (even if our universe itself got started in some way by the multiverse), thus eliminating the need for any Creator agent.It boils down to trying to explain existence without God, purely in a materialistic way, even when our current established theories posit a beginning to the Universe which they cannot account for. Thence comes the wistfulness (and almost grabbing-at-straws despair) to come up with a multiverse, ANY multiverse.Not surprisingly, all of the author's candidates for a multiverse end up being mere possibilities---some more plausible than others. He is scientist enough to admit this, I must say, though I would emphasize the word ""possible"" a lot more than he does. (1) The Quilted Universe makes use of an infinite universe to create an infinite array of quilt universes. This infinite quilt, by the the nature of infinity, implies that any part of the universe (any square on the quilt) will necessarily repeat infinitely often, or---even more commonly---will repeat except for some particular feature (thus bringing about duplicate or parallel worlds). Of course, it assumes a completed infinite expanse.(2) The Inflationary Multiverse posits eternal inflation, which, when completed, COULD yield an infinitude of pocket universes, each of which is infinite in extent. But he needs eternal inflation for this, and even then he might only get a single universe (and not an infinitude of pocket universes). Finally, the author seriously confuses here a completing infinity with a completed one.(3) The Brane Multiverse comes from string theory, and essentially says that each universe could be a Brane (a 3D version of strings). Firstly, string theory is highly speculative. But if it is right, it definitely allows for branes, though it does not require them. Even if branes did exist, it is not at all guaranteed that universes are the sort of things which branes can contain (perhaps branes are simply energy blobs, or random super-exited particles inside the universe), nor is there a particular reason why our entire universe would live in one of those branes, nor why other universes (if they existed) would also live in branes. Granting all these assumptions, it is possible that there are plenty of parallel universes, each inhabiting its own brane, eternally flying through this multidimensional braneworld.(4) The Cyclic Multiverse posits two braneworlds close together in a multidimensional Braneworld cyclically colliding with each other to produce cyclic Big Bangs (and resultant cyclic universes) in each brane. This seems to me to be piling assumptions upon assumptions. Even if the Brane Multiverse existed, who is to say that any two Brane universes would end up being close to each other? And who is to say that they would have just the right mass, and that they would cyclically collide with one another in just the right frequency, with just the right velocity, with just the right force, and at just the right angle to produce cyclic Big Bangs (a Multiverse in time) of which the current observable universe in but a cycle? Too many coincidences!(5) The Landscape Universe comes into being when string theory cannot specify any single set of parameters for the fundamental physical constants---despite the fact that this is what was hoped of it years ago. In fact, string theory---just like Quantum Field theory---simply allows for any number of choices for the physical constants, without singling any one set of them. As far as string theory is concerned, they could almost be anything. In fact, string theory MULTIPLIES almost ad naseum all the possible values for each of the fundamental constants thanks in part to the eleven dimensions necessary for the theory. The Landscape Universe simply posits that all of these values could conceivably (and physically) happen, and that perhaps they do happen in the parallel universes made possible by the Inflationary Multiverse (or pocket universes within our own universe). The math and the physics allow it, the author states, therefore it could very well happen.(6) The Quantum Multiverse is the repetition of the speculative theory that every possible possibility in a quantum function finds a physical realization in a parallel universe, each of which the other ""I""s, in their own specific universe, experiences. The main motivation comes from the incompleteness of quantum mechanics: because we do not have a good theory of the quantum wave collapse upon measurement---and must rely on ad hoc and artificial methods to manually re-adjust the wavefunction after every measurement/collapse---perhaps we should instead follow the math, which does not model any collapse at all, and postulate the existence of all possible results in parallel universes, so that the physical system is in fact modeled by the same equation before and after measurement. I suppose that one must give the author points for having so much confidence on the math. As he points out, Einstein did not believe all the implications of the equations of General Relativity and thus missed out on predicting some very exciting discoveries. But, what I find most troublesome is that he believes that parallel universes are less preposterous than the alternative mathematics two other physicists have developed---which he himself cites---, and which mathematics specifies quantum mechanics, while at the same time providing a mathematical consistent modeling of wavefunction collapse. A specific form of quantum mechanics (and consistent with it) is more preposterous than parallel universes? Really? On is almost compelled to argue that Occam's razor (a form of which states that ""entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity"") should surely apply here.(7) The Holographic Multiverse is the closest this book comes to physics. In fact, the author is really expounding here the holographic principle, which seems physically plausible. The idea behind the principle is that physical processes happening in some contained volume have some counterpart physical processes happening on the boundary of said volume, and that it is possible to translate between these two sets of physical processes. Now, such idea is not at all outlandish. It holds up mathematically in the Divergence and Stoke's Theorems, for instance,---and in Electromagnetism, which uses these two theorems extensively. The author applies this principle to black holes in a mathematical toy brane multiverse (with low gravity), obtaining very sensible and plausibly physically demonstrable results. Not sufficiently unambiguously to conclude the existence of a stack of branes, but sufficiently consistently to obtain the known result that a black hole would be seen as a source of Hawking's radiation at its boundary with the rest of the universe (that is, at the event horizon). Where the author flies into fancy is when he speculates that the reality as shown by the boundary physics is actually more real and has primacy over the physical processes going on in the solid which the boundary encloses. That is, he speculates that the holographic principle implies reality is akin to a hologram---where the 2D light etches on film are the real physical processes and where 3D projections are simulated consequences of these physical etches---instead of being akin to a shadow on a wall---where the 3D processes are the reality and have primacy over their projections on the wall. He offers no justification for choosing holograms over shadows. Thus, the author comes up with at least one other parallel universe at some universal boundary which mimics (or controls, he would say) the physical processes going on in our physical universe.(8) The Simulated Multiverse is a computer program. A very good computer program. As good a computer program as can be programmed and implemented with future technology. So good a computer program that the line between reality and programmed reality ceases to exist. Or rather, a multitude of such computer programs---as many as can in principle (and in actuality) be created by any and all our descendants and the simulated people they simulate in their realistic computer programs. Here the author does admit that this will only work if sentience is a matter of functionality and is emphatically not a property of a super-physical entity (such as the soul) or a property which cannot be abstracted from physical brains into computer circuits. Also, he admits that maybe there is a physical limit as to how good those simulations can be... Perhaps only the computable universes can be simulated, of which he does not know if our inverse is part. Given the assumptions he makes, he cannot discount that he is living in a simulated universe. Ultimately, he running up against philosophy here. As a philosophical concept, I can admit the possibility of simulated universes; as a physical concept, I am much more skeptical.(9) And finally he throws reason out the window in the Ultimate Multiverse. Although, to be fair, he doesn't buy into this one. He includes it merely for completeness. In this philosophical universe (which was dreamed up by one of his philosophy professors), anything which is logically and/or mathematically possible becomes its own universe. Thus, there is no need to explain why anything is the way it is, since, if the anything is logically consistent, it is then realizable in some universe. ""Why isn't the sky black? But it is, in some universe. We just happen to be living in one that isn't"". And there is no more need for why, ever. All you need is to show consistency---mathematical and/or logical. Thankfully the author draws the line somewhere.(9) & (6) It strikes me that proponents of the Ultimate Multiverse and the Quantum Multiverse would benefit from deep study of a difference that preoccupied the best Medieval minds (back when people used to know how to do philosophy)---namely the difference between a ""contingent"" world and a ""actual"" world. This difference has not entirely gone out of style. It is not very long ago that the famous logician G√∂edel used it in his private (not published by him) papers to try to show logically the existence of God. If there is anything that the proponents of the Quantum and the Ultimate Multiverses are trying to get at it is surely the very real concept of a ""contingent"" world. And if the concept is ""real"", in what sense is it real? Mathematicians, certainly, will often experience those ""contingent"" (mathematical) worlds as very mathematically real. And I sympathize tremendously. I myself feel very strongly that there must be *something* existentially true about logically and/or mathematically consistent systems (I am somewhat of a Platonist, after all). But I very much doubt that the existential *something* is of necessity physical. But I do have an advantage over the author on this one: I am not a physicalist---that is, someone who believes that ""it's all physics"". And I am dualist enough to believe that the world is more than abstract math."
116,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27614432-justin-tapp,5,"I found this book to be a very good explanation of the theories of multiple universe that are being bounded about by M-theorists and other modern quantum physicists. This book sets the clear tone that has to be answered by Christians and others who believe in absolutes. But reading this book, one has to remember that physics research/conclusions changes. Books written about black holes in the 1980s, for example, have to be scrapped in light of modern math being worked out.*SPOILER ALERT*The book closes with a long diatribe by Greene on how nothing in our world may actually be real, we could all be living in a simulated multiverse. After all, we see how video games like The Sims and research into artificial intelligence are evolving quickly; it's not hard to think about how our grandchildren may be manipulating simulated life, so maybe we're actually living in such a scenario and everything we do is more or less dictated by a game player. And what about the world the game player lives in? It could also be simulated, and he could be a simulation himself! You end up with an infinite loop of simulations...until what? Greene doesn't say. Greene doesn't even think to mention DesCartes ""I think, therefore I am."" If I'm doubting what Greene is saying then I must necessarily be thinking, and I reject the notion that my myriad of doubts are simply simulated by someone running my life like The Sims. It's clear why Stephen Hawking can say that modern philosophy hasn't kept up with physics (The Grand Design). Modern physics would move philosophy back a thousand years.But I give this book 5 stars for clearly elucidating the theories of the multiverse and explaining where the most modern physics are.Research into inflation-- the rapid expanse of the universe from proton-sized to the holder of galaxies in the blink of an eye-- has important implications for how we view our world and philosophy. Assumptions that the universe is finite and began at a specific instant in time are being challenged by M-theory. If the universe is infinite, then it has always existed and there are also multiple universes. If the universe is finite, then there are not. Greene writes that experiments with the Hadron collider are basically trying to find out whether we're living on a brane universe. If it can be determined we live on a brane, then it is much more likely that our universe is one of many. Greene states at the outset that he is not sure, and that much cannot be proven. But how you look at cosmology has deep implications for how you view your own humanity. 7 billion years ago, universe sped up its expansion and it's still rapidly expanding. So, what happened 7 billion years ago needs to be explained.The particals called ""inflatons"" necessary to explain the process of inflation are theoretical. That's a problem with physics that Greene addresses- is any of this theoretical speculation on things that cannot be actually proven still be classified as ""science?"" Science means testable hypotheses, can any of these be tested? A hypothesis simply sets conditions that can later be tested (at least in theory), which means that the various ideas thrown about by cosmologists are science, according to Greene.Greene goes through all the various possibilities for multiverses:Table 11.1 Summary of Various Versions of Parallel Universes1. Quilted Multiverse: Conditions in an infinite universe necessarily repeat across space, yielding parallel worlds.2. Inflationary Multiverse: Eternal cosmological inflation yields an enormous network of bubble universes, of which our universe would be one.3. Brane Multiverse: In string/M-theory's braneworld scenario, our universe exists on one three-dimensional brane, which floats in a higher-dimensional expanse potentially populated by other branes - other parallel universes.4. Cyclic Multiverse: Collisions between braneworlds can manifest as big bang-like beginnings, yielding universes that are parallel in time.5. Landscape Multiverse: By combing inflationary cosmology and string theory, the many different shapes for string theory's extra dimensions give rise to many different bubble universes.6. Quantum Multiverse: Quantum mechanics suggests that every possibility embodied in its probability waves is realized in one of a vast ensemble of parallel universes.7. Holographic Multiverse: The holographic principle asserts that our universe is exactly mirrored by phenomena taking place on a distant bounding surface, a physically equivalent parallel universe.8. Simulated Multiverse: Technological leaps suggest that simulated universes may one day be possible.9. Ultimate Multiverse: The principle of fecundity asserts that every possible universe is a real universe, thereby obviating the question of why one possibility - ours - is special. These universes instantiate all possible mathematical equations.The theoretical universe where absolutely nothing exists would exist the set of universes contained in #9 above. (Wrap your head around that.) There is much history on research attempting to determine whether or not the cosmological constant equals zero. The size of the cosmological constant matters greatly for the formation of galaxies and such. Putting it in the equation makes a difference, as does its magnitude. So, a physicists' assumption on the magnitude of the cosmological constant has huge implications for how you look at the universe and humanity. How many universes needed to exist for it to be reasonably possible that one containing our exact cosmological constant could exist? Greene works that out.Cyclical cosmology purports that the universe had no beginning or end, it exists in an infinite loop. This conflicts with the law of entropy, which is observed in our universe, that things are moving from order to disorder-- necessitating a beginning point. Greene explains how modern views combine the theory of relativity with cyclical cosmology to find a way around the need for a big bang. It's complicated, and he at least explains what the math looks like at some points.There is plenty on Calabi-Yau shapes, and Calabi-Yau spaces. I don't get it, honestly.Greene takes a long look at the math's implications for the anthropic principle - the philosophical consideration that observations of the physical universe must be compatible with the conscious and sapient life that observes it. Some proponents of the anthropic principle reason that it explains why the Universe has the age and the fundamental physical constants necessary to accommodate conscious life. As a result, they believe it is unremarkable that the universe's fundamental constants happen to fall within the narrow range thought to be compatible with life (wikipedia). In other words, the universe is as it is because we're here. But Greene explains the multiverse with the analogy of a shoe store-- there are plenty of pairs of shoes and one of them must match your feet. The Milky Way is one of an infinite number of galaxies, and happens to be just the one that can sustain us, which we shouldn't find remarkable.Also from wikipedia:The anthropic idea that fundamental parameters are selected from a multitude of different possibilities (each actual in some universe or other) contrasts with the traditional hope of physicists for a theory of everything having no free parameters: as Einstein said, ""What really interests me is whether God had any choice in the creation of the world."" In 2002, proponents of the leading candidate for a ""theory of everything"", string theory, proclaimed ""the end of the anthropic principle""[33] since there would be no free parameters to select. Ironically, string theory now seems to offer no hope of predicting fundamental parameters, and now some who advocate it invoke the anthropic principle as well.In the end, Greene hypothesizes that we're all in a simulation. Perhaps even the laws of physics we experience in this world are programmed into the simulation and may not hold in other simulated universes. Perhaps they are also accidents or unsolved problems in the code of the program being run that we inhabit (seriously, this is the best physics can do). I read a recent interview with Greene that faith and a belief in a Creator are not incompatible with physics (though he rejects any literal interpretation of Genesis) but it's clear that an infinite universe-- with no beginning or end-- needs no creator or creation point. I do not think Greene explained well how to reconcile what we know about a Big Bang -- that there was a beginning of the universe-- with the inflationary infinite loop. Much less how we can pinpoint the increase in the speed of the expansion 7 million years ago when such measurements are pointless if the timeline is infinite in both directions.Greene makes an interesting point that the human eye only evolved to see certain types of radiation-- like light, which contains information (his only foray into biology). Other types of radiation and information remain hidden to the naked eye. I've never seen an atheist explain how the light came to hold that information, except for Greene's simulated universe explanation. How did the eye know that the information was there to be processed? This is a problem for biologists, much less physicist-philosophers like Greene and Hawking. If Greene's infinite universe with infinite multiverses is correct, then we are all just a random compilation of molecules (as stated by Greene). At this juncture, it would appear physics is incompatible with evolutionary biology. Biologists purport that everything evolved in response to the results of trial-and-error processes that necessitate cells understanding information and responding accordingly (Richard Dawkins & company don't explain where that information came from, either). In the Greene/Hawking philosophy, it was purely random. Yet, they both agree that life is dependent upon information. This seems, to me, to be quite a contradiction (rather than just a paradox).This book is important because Greene alludes to the implications modern physics has for philosophy, and therefore ethics, human rights, theology, etc. Every Christian should read it as well as every atheist and respond with their own coherent philosophical critiques. I hope to read physicist Lee Smolin's The Trouble with Physics for a critique of Greene's string theory/M-theory from some of his own colleagues. "
117,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50086627-doug-ashby,2,"One of my eyebrows was still raised after reading Richard Dawkins‚Äô assertions that the structure, process and function of RNA/DNA may have appeared spontaneously (after which everything else just sort of fell into place), when I picked up a copy of Brian Greene‚Äôs The Hidden Reality. Damned if my other eyebrow didn‚Äôt go up. The very notion of infinite universes and particle arrangements is indeed stimulating and fun to think about. I have no qualification whatever to question Professor Greene‚Äôs word that the mathematics behind string theory gets us there. Given the pesky intrusions of quantitative analysis, I also rather like the idea of being freed from the burdens of more familiar probability assessments, despite worrying that it opens the door to a kind of ‚Äúinfinity of the gaps.‚Äù Who‚Äôd have thought that Professor Dawkins was aiming too low? No more need to worry about the appearance of membranes, metabolism, DNA and flight ready Boeing 747s for that matter, with or without strong winds and junkyards. Arguably, evolution itself becomes unnecessary as whole universes identical in particle arrangement to our own have and will pop into existence with infinite frequency. To be sure, infinite universes maintain identical particle synchronicity throughout their complete multi-billion year histories as a matter of pure chance. Golly. But of course there are infinite parallel yous and mes, from zygote to the present; every event, every movement, every thought, every platelet identically conjured, shaped and positioned. If Professor Greene spontaneously materializes on your Starbucks line, just move along to the register ‚Äì a comparatively modest event. It‚Äôs all just the (insidious) nature of infinity. But there are important assertions more within the public domain where I think Professor Greene and other celebrity scientists get bolloxed up.How often must I read that the latest scientific theory spells another cosmic demotion for the earth and life on it, akin to Copernicus‚Äô (and Darwin‚Äôs) dethroning of such? It‚Äôs a shame that the original luminaries have missed out on so many fascinating techniques and discoveries since, but I‚Äôm not so sure they‚Äôd go along with prevailing discourse in their names or on their behalf. The way that Professor Dawkins discusses and, to my knowledge, trivializes eyesight and embryology, just two examples, amazes me. I wouldn‚Äôt have thought it possible. Forgive my presumed delusions but the biochemistry, for starters, behind a ‚Äúsimple light sensitive patch,‚Äù unknown to Darwin, doesn‚Äôt look all that simple. Where would we start concerning embryology? It was good to see that Professor Dawkins saw the need to thin out probability assessments with regard to ‚Äúboth DNA and its protein-based replication machinery spontaneously chancing to come into existence,‚Äù spreading them across arbitrary assumptions of 100 billion billion earth-like planets - a tacit acknowledgement that it‚Äôs a doozy, incomprehensible good fortune. Earlier in the same book (The Blind Watchmaker), he assesses the probability of producing a hemoglobin molecule in a single step by chance, concluding, simply, that it would not be possible. Is RNA/DNA and its replication machinery somehow much simpler than hemoglobin? If so, can‚Äôt we just ratchet up our planet variable until hemoglobin appears? Professor Greene gives us an infinity of planets ‚Äìno? To be clear, Professor Dawkins, however it happened, you are, in the case of RNA/DNA, asserting that, if not analogous to a flight ready 747, something preposterously complex appeared spontaneously which, in itself, is an immense distance from the simplest of life forms. Despite your strong and condescending language, your readers have every right and very good reason to chew on whether this is within the reasonable productive boundaries of purely accidental expressions of natural law on any earth-like planet, no matter their number. After RNA and cumulative selection get going, ‚Äúwe need to postulate only a relatively small amount of luck in the subsequent evolution of life and intelligence.‚Äù Honestly? Why would Stephen Gould worry about the ‚Äúastounding cascades of improbability‚Äù as a defining aspect of ‚Äúthe remarkable construction and operation of organisms,‚Äù even after the doozy? Was he not aware of cumulative selection? I can‚Äôt imagine him quipping that eyes evolved ‚Äúeasily, at the drop of a hat.‚Äù In the same vein, I recently watched a Book-TV and another interview with Bill Nye the Science Guy who, evidently, is influential with young people and has also written a book. He seemed pained that people who think there‚Äôs something special about conscious life on earth haven‚Äôt yet been eliminated from the gene pool, and seeks to at least reeducate them. He was very good at using trendy vernacular to hammer away that the earth isn‚Äôt 6,000 years old as he seems to think people who dare still have questions about the emergence and evolution of life believe. Over more than 20 years of immersive interest, I have never met or read anybody who believes that. Nor have I met or read anybody who doubts that life evolved, until now. I‚Äôve attended a couple of lectures featuring Kenneth Miller who continues to get a kick out of the proceedings of Kitzmiller v. Dover but never quite elucidates the issues nearly to the depth I‚Äôd expect. He may well have deeper reasoning, but why the reluctance to share it with audiences at Princeton University? I‚Äôm unsettled about inferences regarding Intelligent Design but as I listened to Professor Miller, admittedly I thought how Michael Denton, Michael Behe and Stephen Meyer warrant every ounce of this man‚Äôs attention, for the good of science. Just a few points pertinent to Professor Greene‚Äôs hammering in this regard:1)	Copernicus wrote his book 500 years ago. Since then, most of Professor Greene‚Äôs readership has come to grips with the idea that the universe is very big and we wee. 2)	From other sources, I‚Äôve learned a lot more about the nearly inconceivable calibrations and workings of our segment of infinite space, of the earth and especially of life which, to my mind, are immune to demotion. Knowing the forces behind the Earth‚Äôs 5,974,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilogram revolution and rotation, 66,000mph and 1,100mph respectively, doesn‚Äôt make it any less spectacular that my coffee hasn‚Äôt flown all over the place. Conscious life presents a vastly more undemotable kettle of fish. Whereas we understand that prospects for infinitely large (collections of) universes make every possible particle arrangement, dead or alive, equally probable and inevitable, Professor Greene and Mr. Nye might forgive their readers, too, for thinking that there‚Äôs something qualitatively notable about particle arrangements that walk and think and talk. 3)	Truth be told, the thought that I have a parallel some10 to the 10**122th meters away doesn‚Äôt feel like a demotion.4)	Cosmic demotion is a kind of isolationist my-dad-is-bigger-than-your-dad argument. Why would we not be thrilled that there are infinite conscious beings wondering whether there are infinite conscious beings? I rather like other conscious beings ‚Äì it would be tragic if we were alone in that privilege.  Professor Greene declares his ‚Äúbias‚Äù early in the book: ‚ÄúI believe that a physical system is completely determined by the arrangements of its particles. Tell me how the particles making up the earth, the sun, the galaxy, and everything else are arranged and you‚Äôve fully articulated reality. This reductionist view is common among physicists, but there are certainly people who think otherwise. Especially when it comes to life, some believe that an essential nonphysical aspect (spirit, soul, life force, chi and so on) is required to animate the physical. Although I remain open to this possibility, I‚Äôve never encountered any evidence to support it. The position that makes the most sense to me is that one‚Äôs physical and mental characteristics are nothing but a manifestation of how the particles in one‚Äôs body are arranged‚Ä¶.. Every decision you‚Äôve ever made is tantamount to a particular particle arrangement‚Ä¶..‚ÄùFair enough. But then towards the end of the book we‚Äôre treated to the ‚Äúhigh likelihood that we‚Äôre living in a computer simulation‚Äù built by someone who ‚Äúcan come home at night, kick back and fire up the create-a-universe software‚Äù on an earth-size (quantum) computer. What happened between pages 38 and 330 that the need to ‚Äúencounter evidence‚Äù disappeared? How did we get to ‚Äúhigh likelihood,‚Äù and ‚Äúodds that overwhelmingly favor the conclusion that you and I and everyone else are living within a simulation?‚Äù Oh wait, Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom said so based on statistical projections which are based on baseless conjecture of what future, super-evolved hobbyists will choose to do with their time and presumed capability. Playthings, we are.  Wouldn‚Äôt you know it! Puny for sure, but now, just when I‚Äôm plum out of eyebrows, there‚Äôs a high likelihood that we‚Äôre not even real. That, my friends, would spell demotion. I stewed a long time in college over whether I was in a coma and other kinds of deep thinking deriving from Solipsism. Then I decided that it was both callous and disrespectful to deny the reality of so much human sacrifice and suffering past, present and future - I can‚Äôt imagine Professors Bostrom and Greene suggesting that the three year old refugee face down on a beach wasn‚Äôt and isn‚Äôt real. That was even before my frontal lobe caught up with the rest of me and it all became a lot of self-focused nonsense. Turns out that the stark and evidential realities of protein manufacture, photosynthesis and field theory alone beat the deep thinking pants off of coma suppositions, and simulations. Professor Greene is just wrong and silly in his evidence-free and callous declarations, but that isn‚Äôt the alarming part. With his premise that every possible particle arrangement is necessarily realized (infinitely), is it not decidedly and astonishingly unimaginative to settle and spend so much time on an image as earthly and everyday as a computer jock kicking back to boot up our sentient virtual existence? What about prospects for other renderings of superior, creative intelligences in this world of infinite inevitability (not in human or computer jock form), the size of the earth or a galaxy, let‚Äôs say. What would its creative capability be? For me, things became comical when Professor Greene suggested that the omnipotent computer geek might someday reveal himself through your bathroom window or ‚Äúon a worldwide scale, with giant windows and a booming voice surrounding the planet, announcing that there is in fact an All Powerful Programmer up in the heavens.‚Äù Where have I heard that before‚Ä¶..to Professor Dawkins‚Äô and Greene‚Äôs dismissal if not distain? It‚Äôs mildly interesting that in Climbing Mount Improbable, Professor Dawkins reasons that ‚Äú‚Ä¶..any designer capable of constructing the dazzling array of living things would have to be intelligent and complicated beyond all imagining‚Ä¶..‚Äù Intelligent and complicated indeed, but not too intelligent and complicated for the likes of a computer programmer it would seem. Perhaps Professors Dawkins and Greene should do coffee. Moreover, isn‚Äôt the very core of faith the (self-demoting) notion that there exists a creative intelligence beyond our own? Lest we inexplicably confine ourselves to earth-bound, anthropomorphic images, it would seem that nothing in Professor Greene‚Äôs thesis precludes such a notion and, in fact, may well affirm it unequivocally. I would never make that argument, of course, but Professor Greene does, however inadvertently. Beyond this, however, we must understand that according to Professor Greene‚Äôs assertions, there is no need for an ‚Äúall powerful programmer‚Äù or intelligence of any kind. Infinite universes will exist where exceedingly large and sophisticated computers producing simulated universes will simply have appeared chugging along without an inventor. Real, sentient, intelligent beings will be completely unknown to the real universes in which such computers happen to simulate humans. As well, infinite real (and simulated) universes will exist containing all of the inventions, constructions and events that we normally associate with and attribute to human ingenuity, effort and activity, except that life will not exist in them. For no purpose, all of the computers will run precisely as they do on this earth, every written sentence will chance into parallel bindings, every work of artistic expression framed, fastened or pressed, planes will fly, cars will drive, cities will arise absent only human life . Infinite worlds will exist where all of the objects in such people-free parallels will be upside down. My guess is that upside down cars won‚Äôt drive, but that‚Äôs none of our affair? In infinite universes, they‚Äôll skid along on their roofs as a matter of random, moment-by-moment particle rearrangement and fortuitous reconstitution. All manner of weirdness animates the inanimate in every imaginable and unimaginable way. Senseless and meaningless - perfect. The workings of RNA and DNA and flight ready Boeing 747s smack of underachievement. The whole of natural and human history a dithering yawn. Rational assessment ceases. Fantasy loses its meaning. Nihilism triumphs. I‚Äôm not sure where notions of self- organizing complexity have gone but, to be clear, this is the underlying scientific reasoning upon which Professor Dawkins finds the rest of us delusional, Bill Nye suffers our ignorance and Professor Miller continues to have lots of fun. As I continue to more independently think about the hairbrained implications of Professor Greene‚Äôs thesis, implications that he omits either as a matter of anemic imagination or to maintain some semblance of credibility and sanity, I‚Äôm afraid that my mind invariably returns to that particle arrangement on the beach.Even less starkly, and for all the good this educator has done, pity the young mind in Professor Greene‚Äôs grip that ‚Äúfully articulates‚Äù Beethoven‚Äôs 9th as a particle arrangement or attributes the deepening mysteries of life, the night sky, the love of his/her life and Dachau to a computer simulation. Pity the nation whose educational foundation goes so easy. Pity the professor, celebrity or otherwise, who waxes cavalier about the most finely orchestrated complexities and realities known to man, realities that, ironically, will continue to so effortlessly elude even his extraordinary intellect. I don‚Äôt know anything about chi or virgin births either but in the expanse of so much erudite wrangling I did find Mary Roach‚Äôs conclusion of Gulp (involving a close and entertaining look at the digestive system, end-to-end) haltingly accessible and instructive: 	‚ÄúThere is an unnameable feeling I‚Äôve had maybe ten times in my life. It is a mix of wonder, privilege, humility. An awe that borders on fear. I‚Äôve felt it in a field of snow on the outskirts of Fairbanks, Alaska, with the northern lights whipping overhead so seemingly close I dropped to my knees. I am walloped by it on dark nights in the mountains, looking up at the sparkling smear of our galaxy. Laying eyes on my own ileocecal valve, peering into my appendix from within, bearing witness to the magnificent complexity of the human body, I felt, let‚Äôs be honest, mild to moderate cramping. But you understand what I‚Äôm getting at here. Most of us pass our lives never once laying eyes on our organs, the most precious and amazing things we own. Until something goes wrong, we barely give them thought. This seems strange to me. How is it that we find Christina Aguilera more interesting than the inside of our own bodies? It is, of course, possible that I seem strange. You may be thinking, Wow, that Mary Roach has her head up her ass. To which I say: Only briefly, and with the utmost respect.‚Äù	She may not agree with even one of my sentences but, if nothing else, approximations and perspectives like Mary Roach‚Äôs seeping into scientific parley might temper our fixation on social media, better alert young people to the dimensional boundlessness of scientific inquiry, and make conscious beings harder to shoot. If you‚Äôre seeking engaging and recent books on physics written for adults, you might give The Particle at the End of the Universe and Life on the Edge a look. "
118,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31711953-peter-warila,4,"Brian Greene compares, contrasts, nests and branes the set of 11 distinct multiverse proposals currently accepted as possible (dating up to the publishing date of 2011). He does this clearly with healthy portions of detail. My single complaint stems over his brief and inevitable anecdotal use of the double-slit experiment. And take this how you will. My knowledge of physics goes as far as personal reading plus my dad's personal obsession with the subject. Many people call attention to the double-slit experiment and its most widely-known cousin, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, in order to conjure some hand-waving aura of generalized trippiness about the nature of quantum mechanics (e.g. WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, IT ACTS DIFFERENT, DUDE...LIKE WTF--or something along those lines). This can be fun, though I'll add there are better ways to get there than conjecture about quantum mechanics.Such a statement suffers from differing uses of the word 'look.' Electrons observed in the experiment do indeed behave differently when you 'look' at them compared to when you don't. However, 'look,' in this case, means to bounce (loads) of photons off of the electrons you are observing. In my experience, perhaps 95% of the time this 'quantum weirdness' is invoked, by published media, no less your friend at the party, this process of interaction with the measured electrons in question is totally missed.Greene, when using this experiment to explain probability waves, eventually comes to say this:When you look at an electron‚Äôs probability wave, where ‚Äúlook‚Äù means ‚Äúmeasure its position,‚Äù the electron responds by snapping to attention and coalescing at one definite location. Correspondingly, the probability wave surges to 100 percent at that spot, while collapsing to 0 percent everywhere else, as in Figure 8.6. Look away, and the needle-thin probability wave rapidly spreads, indicating that once again there‚Äôs a reasonable chance of finding the electron at a variety of locations.Greene, Brian. The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos (Kindle Locations 3779-3782). Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. For me, this is still too abstract to really get it, concerning the measurement interaction. Far better than terminology of electrons ""knowing"" where other electrons are--which Greene also uses, with the quotation marks--but for me it just didn't quite click. It would have only taken a paragraph more to get across the interaction between photons and electrons, which I feel is far more concrete. In any case, the statement of this phenomenon which I understood best was given in Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces, chapter six. I read it days before coming across Greene's account, which unfortunately increased the bloated irritation you see here. What are you doing still reading?This surely qualifies as nitpicking. And worse, I haven't read any of Greene's other work yet. He may get into this with greater detail in The Fabric of the Cosmos. I picked up The Hidden Reality after seeing Greene's visual explanation of gravitational waves on Colbert back in 2016, which remains the best I've come across yet. This is a great primer on multiverses, as far as I'm concerned. Greene is clear about the content, the history and the general current consensus for each proposal, and makes sure you know when he is expressing his personal intuitions and hopes for a given theory."
119,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1480888-jeff,4,"The Hidden Reality is a layman's primer on the latest in theoretical physics, structured around the ways in which recent theories suggest that our universe may be only one of many. It takes the reader on a tour of Einsteinian relativity, quantum mechanics, and, most particularly, string theory.The book unveils its physics through the presentation of several potential conclusions that flow from current theories about our universe, often ideas that attempt to reconcile Einstein‚Äôs theory of gravity and curved spacetime with the uncertainties of quantum physics. Each of these conclusions posits one way in which our universe might be part of a greater multiverse. The first of these is the ‚Äúquilted multiverse,‚Äù which is simply a way of describing the consequences of infinity. If our universe is infinite, but the number of states in individual sectors of that universe are finite, then those states will necessarily repeat, yielding regions that are identical or nearly so. So there would be infinite earths, and nearly-earths, and infinite yous and nearly-yous. The second is the ‚Äúinflationary multiverse,‚Äù and its variant, the ‚Äúlandscape multiverse,‚Äù in which universes drop like bubbles out of a substrate of inflation particles, and then further universes drop like further bubbles from those universes, yielding many universes with differing initial states and physical constants. The third is the ‚Äúbrane multiverse,‚Äù which posits that our three-dimensional universe sits on a membrane in a larger multidimensional space that could be filled with other three-dimensional universes. When these universes collide, they may create new big bangs, which lead to new universes over time, in a so-called ‚Äúcyclic multiverse.‚Äù The fourth is the ‚Äúquantum multiverse,‚Äù in which all possible quantum states are given reality through divergent parallel universes. The fifth is the ‚Äúholographic multiverse,‚Äù which emerges from the fact that the mathematics of our universe can be modeled as though taking place on a boundary surface of our universe; if this boundary surface is real, it would constitute an equivalent parallel universe. The sixth is the ‚Äúsimulated multiverse,‚Äù which suggests that if intelligent life can attain sufficient technological skill to create realistic simulated universes, those universes may be more numerous than root universes, making it more likely we exist in a simulated universe than a real one. The seventh is the ‚Äúultimate multiverse,‚Äù which is just a way of describing the idea that all possible universes are real.As may be inferred from the above descriptions, the potential multiverse ideas progress from those more closely grounded in our physical and mathematical understanding of the universe to those that are more purely philosophical in nature. Brian Greene is a skilled writer and teacher, and he‚Äôs crafted a clever way to satisfy readers of all levels of mathematical sophistication. He opens chapters with conceptual descriptions using real-world analogies, and saves a deeper dive into the physics and math to the ends of chapters and the footnotes. This allows readers to calibrate their level of engagement to their mathematical background. Moreover, Greene‚Äôs excitement over the ideas discussed and for the scientific process of discovery shines through every chapter. The reader is caught up and carried along by this enthusiasm, and the revelations and ideas are fascinating to absorb and behold. Even beside the parallel universe framework, the book effectively conveys key concepts of mainstream physics and string theory, threaded with interesting tidbits of scientific history; I significantly enhanced my understanding of probability waves and several other phenomena.Occasionally, explanations could be slowed down. For example, there‚Äôs not enough discourse on why a bubble universe may appear to be infinite in time from the outside, but infinite in space from the inside. Moreover, as Greene acknowledges, the thesis of the book depends on taking a realist view of mathematics, rather than an instrumentalist view; while Greene touches on why he subscribes to the realist view, since the idea is a critical assumption of the book, more time could be devoted to convincing the reader. And much as Greene tries, I was still left with skepticism about the direction of string theory research because it's not generating reasonably testable hypotheses.Overall, I was intrigued and entertained throughout, and many times paused, book in hand, to contemplate the ideas presented and the vastness that the universe encompasses. This is a rare science book that engages both mind and heart. I enjoyed Greene‚Äôs The Elegant Universe, but found this one even more captivating."
120,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,5,"Arthur C Clarke is often quoted as saying ""the Universe is not only stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine"". This book puts that quote to a strong test, because it demonstrates the extreme outer limits of what one ""can imagine"".It's not enough that we may live in a multiverse. There are multiple multiverse proposals to choose from, and some of them may overlap with each other. Greene goes through the variants:- the Quilted Multiverse, where space, having the same laws of physics that we see, is infinite in extent and therefore contains all possible configurations of particles, each infinite times over (because infinity is very large, especially towards the end)- the Inflationary Multiverse: posits ""bubble universes"" generated by an ""inflaton field"", each having potentially different fundamental constants of nature. (this one is truly head-spinning, because ""the math says"" we might one day be able to create a real universe out of only a few grams-worth of energy: relying on inflation, which is negative gravity, to spontaneously generate a universe-worth of matter and energy. As Paul Davies has written, ""The Universe could be the ultimate free lunch."" The bad news is we wouldn't be able to interact with our creation.)- The ""brane"" multiverse of string theory. Too difficult to articulate; involves the ten spatial dimensions (!) that string theory math requires- The ""many worlds"" interpretation of quantum mechanics. This is the one with which I have the most familiarity from past reading; it was first proposed by Hugh Everett as an interpretation of the famous Schroedinger equations. To put a finer point on it, Greene returns several times to the fact that ""the math"" doesn't need to be ""interpreted""; it merely needs to be taken seriously. In the final chapter Greene recounts multiple famous examples of scientists failing to take ""the math"" seriously: famously, Einstein's general relativity equations predicted both black holes and an expanding universe, neither of which he or anyone else took seriously until empirical observations forced the issue. Earlier, Maxwell's equations had predicted the speed of light as being a constant, but it took Einstein to truly take it seriously as being independent of any referent.- The holographic multiverse- The simulated multiverse and the ultimate multiverseI listened to the audiobook version which was actually narrated by Brian Greene himself, which I find amazing. Greene gives quite a sympathetic hearing to the criticism that, because many of these multiverse proposals are untestable, they ""are not science."" He provides strong reasons for maintaining a broad definition of science, particularly for proposals that could be testable in principle, even if not testable with today's technology.I award five stars. Of course, it's possible that infinite ""me""s have already provided all possible ratings out there in the multiverse. That, plus other possibilities literally impossible to imagine. "
121,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29240159-damian-roache,5,"(This review was originally posted on my blog at damianroache.com)Brian Greene is a very intelligent guy, an accomplished physicist and mathematician, and he also happens to be a hell of a writer. In The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos he deftly guides us through some of the amazingly complex ideas and scientific foundations behind the popularized notion of the multiverse. His explanation of the core concepts at work are thorough, but not laden with excessive technical language or the type of writing that demands a dictionary be kept close at hand. This is a boon to the vast majority of his potential readers, most of whom probably didn‚Äôt graduate from Harvard and Oxford, as he begins to talk about the potential for worlds that exist outside of our universe. Greene tackles a particularly murky and labyrinthine area of physics, but somehow distills all of the essential information into language that a non-scientist can digest. He does all of this while firmly grounding his discussions in the larger scientific paradigms which inform any talk of multiple universes.My own reading of the book was colored by my admittedly biased view of the topic (because I firmly believe that we are part of a multiverse) and by my desire to contextualize some of the ideas that frequently play a large role in my fiction writing. If I‚Äôm going to write about characters that cross over into other worlds and venture into realities that do not fit within our conventional model of a single universe, I need to at least understand some of the science underlying these fictional pursuits. I wanted to have a better idea of what it means when people talk about infinite space and the possibility of worlds beyond the range of our senses.The scope of possible topics within the text would appear to be limited by his focus on one particular set of theories, but after reading it all the way through I can safely say that this is not at all the case.Do you know how many different theories propose the idea of a multiverse? I didn‚Äôt have any idea how many there actually are until I read this book. Greene takes us on a tour of nine different theories, each of which has its own proposed set of features and logic to explain the existence of a multiverse. There‚Äôs the Quilted Multiverse, in which our world would be part of an infinitely large expanse where the conditions of reality are repeated over and over. The Inflationary Multiverse proposes that we might be part of an ever-expanding space that eternally continues to create bubble universes propelled ever-farther from each other. And the Quantum Multiverse seeks to show how there could be a parallel universe for every possibility inherent in the probability waves which make up a key component of quantum mechanics. That‚Äôs only a third of the different forms of multiverses Greene writes about, and already you can begin to see how dense‚Äîfrom a reader‚Äôs perspective, not in a literal, physical sense‚Äîthe subject of parallel worlds is once you get into the details.I found this book on Amazon when I was searching for something to read that I could both enjoy and learn from‚Äîfor me The Hidden Reality accomplished this to a degree I wouldn‚Äôt have guessed. There‚Äôs more to the book than a long series of scientific theories broken into their respective parts, because Greene goes a step further to show some of the practical applications‚Äîand consequences‚Äîof viewing our existence as part of a larger reality. For example, late in the book Greene goes into detail about the Simulated Multiverse in which technological advances reach a point where we have the capacity to simulate entire digital universes filled with simulated inhabitants capable of thought, who are also able to create such universes within their own. Once this idea is established in the mind of the reader, which takes some time and considerable effort, he then takes the idea of the Simulated Multiverse to its furthest logical extension: that it‚Äôs theoretically possible our universe is actually a simulation, created in some other realm and existing only as data that has no equivalent physical form tying it to reality. How would we know if that were the case, and what would it mean? Greene attempts to answer some of these questions throughout the text. It‚Äôs in these sections that the text becomes more than a mere ‚ÄòIdiots Guide to Parallel Worlds.‚ÄôOf course, the information contained in The Hidden Reality is not as hidden as the supposed other worlds made possible by the theories it talks about. Greene‚Äôs purpose in writing the book was not to propose some new insight involving multiverses or theories advocating their existence. This text is meant to provide a strong basis of understanding for anyone looking to learn about multiverse theory and all it entails. In that sense, it‚Äôs a complete success. With a little determination and an open mind, most people could read this book and come away with a better understanding of how such amazing things as doppelgangers and higher dimensions could one day be considered scientific fact‚Äîno longer relegated to the domain of science-fiction. It‚Äôs important to note, however, that Greene is cautious in his approach and informs the reader of the healthy skepticism that many physicists have when talking about multiverses.If you have a background in science, this book probably won‚Äôt have much to offer for you. But if you‚Äôre an average reader, like myself, with only a basic knowledge of the subject and a desire to know more, this is a great place to start. I haven‚Äôt read other, similar books, but that‚Äôs on my to-do list. There are other scientist-authors venturing into the speculative territory of parallel worlds, and I‚Äôm curious to see how their work compares to Greene‚Äôs. Until then, what I can say for sure is that Brian Greene is a more than adequate source for learning the basics of the physics that are behind current theories of the multiverse.The final verdict on The Hidden Reality is that it‚Äôs an illuminating look into some very strange science, one that I think holds some appeal for anyone who‚Äôs willing to stretch their mind some. For writers that work in the genres of fantasy, science-fiction, and horror, I‚Äôd say this is a must-read‚Äîunless, again, you already have a working knowledge of the physics involved. I didn‚Äôt have a lot of experience with physics to use as a base for my stories, but I had the urge to find that base. I wasn‚Äôt looking for an ultimate, comprehensive source, but enough to say with some confidence that I do actually know what the hell I‚Äôm talking about. Having invested some time into learning more about the subject, I now feel better prepared to write stories that are built upon, and grapple with, the idea of multiple universes.As always, I know there‚Äôs still plenty left for me to learn‚Äîbut I‚Äôm on the right track now, thanks to Brian Greene and his thoughtful, well-written tour of the science of multiverses."
122,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61217472-eric-li,4,"I rated this book 4 stars, which means I consider this book to be exceptional but not classics (that's why I rarely give 5 stars- otherwise classics will not be called classics).This book is an exploration of the concept ""parallel universe"", defined very loosely by the author. Greene lays out 9 versions (some can be synthesized together, some are subsets of a higher level category) of parallel universe, summarized well by other GR reviewers.Things I like about this bookÔºö1. It is extremely accessible. Greene's use of analogies and his wit undoubtedly contribute to this. I have background in sciences (but mostly in chemistry and biology), and consider myself to be a reasonably intelligent person. Yet, I say to friends time to time that Physics (especially relativity, quantum and string theory) are for smart (really smart I mean) people. Greene did a great job in making this book readable to the general audience.2. I like how Greene unfolds the historical development of theories. It adds the story telling element to the book, brings me more scientific/historic context, and backs up Greene's philosophy that scientific breakthroughs, however novel they appear, build on ideas of previous generation.3. It's hard to find a balance between science (meat) and philosophy (wine, I would say) served in a book on this topic, but Greene does a fantastic job in it (of course, evaluated by my subjective opinion). I like his detour on statistics or probability can't be defined without invoking the concept of probability (a circular argument, in philosopher's term) and his touch on other philosophical views (scientific philosophy in last chapter, humanity in Quantum Multiverse etc). I enjoyed those pieces a lot.I will probably not touch another serious scientific writing on physics for a while. Yet, the other two books by Greene will definitely be among my considerations when I return some day in the future. "
123,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67176102-marc,1,"This book was not for me, way way way above my intellectual capacity. I am drawn to sci-fi and time travel novels, and thought perhaps this book could enhance my appreciation and understanding of the genre. WRONG ! The most comprehensible chapters for me were chapters 7 & 10 . Probably 95% of the book was simply beyond me. I read ALOT, and don't exactly consider myself a simpleton, but I doubt I will ever delve into a book of theoretical physics again, much less anything by Brian Greene. Are we really investing billions of dollars in research funds to conclude that string theory tells us that there are 10 dimensions and we have NO clue what 6-7 of them are ? Yet, string theory proves there are multiple universes. That quantum theory tells us about Plancks and quantum mechanics and measurements of 10-34 power. SERIOUSLY ... who freakin cares ? What is the practicality ? If a neutron bomb exploded tomorrow and computers were fried, would these scientists break out the yellow legal pads and dream up this drivel with pencil and paper ? Universes we can NEVER interact with or prove exist.""... deciding which mathematics should be taken seriously is as much art as it is science."" A quote from the book. Seriously??? It's like an art historian discussing whether Picasso or Warhol are serious artists. Isn't there enough in our own universe to study ? Can't we take a step back toward Newtonian physics before we start making shite up ?I am so pissed off that I spent 10 days plowing through this book and reading every last word. But maybe not as pissed as Brian Greene will be when he finally reaches his alternative universe or Saint Peters gate and is asked, ""So you spent your lifetime on THIS ??? Really, there was a whole world and universe out there RIGHT in front of you !!!""Think I'll re-read ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" again to ground myself."
124,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26290648-paul,3,"In all honesty, I did not read this book. I skipped parts of it because I am fascinated by theissues raised by the author. I simply do not have the energy to put into understanding a realforeign language of science and mathematics.However, my primary interest was in how the author could call his constructs science. The mathematics of physics is a measure, not as reality, and this is especially true when unlike experimental science, there has been no corroboration by repeated experiments. I suspect that by the nature of the study, multiple universes, etc, there cannot be.In a word, I wondered how what he says could be science. The author is honest enough to understand the criticism and spends a fair amount of time trying to meet the criticism. p. 163 Until now, we've been exploring the implications for reality, writ large, of various developments in fundamental physics and cosmology research. I delight in the possibility that copies of the earth exist in the far reaches of space, or that our universe is one of many bubbles in an inflating cosmos, or that we live on one of many braneworlds constituting a giant cosmic laof ...But with the Landscape Multiverse, we've invoked parallel universes in a different way . Multiverse is not merely broadening our view of what might be out there. Instead, an array of parallel universes, worlds that may be beyond our ability to visit o see or test or influence, now and perhaps always, are directly invoked to provide insight into observations we make here, in this universe.Which raises an essential question: Is this science?"
125,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54464095-ryan-alsaihaty,5,"Brian Greene takes us on an interesting journey across the different parallel universes & multiverses that arise from different theories in physics. The multiverses that are discussed in this book are: Quilted Multiverse, Inflationary Multiverse, Brane Multiverse, Cyclic Multiverse, Landscape Multiverse, Quantum Multiverse, Holographic Multiverse, Simulated Multiverse, and Ultimate Multiverse. When discussing each multiverse, the author provides enough information and explains the relevant concepts in order to understand it. Additionally, the author provides notes at the end of the book that are mainly aimed at more technical readers to further explain a concept using technical terms and equations. Even further, the author references more advanced/technical books that should be read in order to fully grasp all the ins & outs of each multiverse if the readers seeks further details and technicality. As always, Greene uses everyday analogies and illustrations in order to explain difficult concepts and make them more accessible to the general reader, though some concepts are still hard to understand fully. This book was written as a standalone book, but a previous knowledge in physics theories (General relativity, quantum mechanics, string theory, etc.) will definitely help the reader throughout the book and make the reading more enjoyable. A good book to read before this is Greene‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Fabric of the Cosmos‚Äù but is not absolutely required. "
126,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33761275-katherine-tirado-ryen,5,"Once again Brian Greene does a terrific job explaining the often convoluted physics (both classical and quantum) as well as the complicated mathematics that go into the present-day theories of parallel universes and alternate realities. Like his previous works, Greene touches on a familiar story: how the cosmic microwave background radiation (that's a direct consequence of general relativity combined with basic cosmological physics, and is itself a modern remnant of the Big Bang) only came to prominence after being discovered twice theoretically (and a dozen years apart) before being randomly observed as techs attempted to install a satellite and couldn't understand why they couldn't achieve a clear signal (that pesky cosmic microwave interference!). Greene then surveys the various multiverse options, from bubble and quilted to simulated to holographic, and shows how scientists must ""follow the math"", no matter where it takes them. To this point, he references another famous story: how Einstein, in an effort to keep the universe static (as religious dogma and the world, at the time, staunchly believed) instead of inflating (which the math demonstrated in his own equation), leading Einstein to push against his own findings by inventing an integer to agree with his preconception: the cosmological constant. The truth can sometimes be terrifying, but it is always illuminating, and I'm thrilled to see where science takes us in the years to come. "
127,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1870856-andy,4,"Fantastic read - assuming you are into this sort of things. The first 3/4 of the book is extremely well organized, and fairly easy to follow. Each chapter seems to be organized as: background/history, intro to the math/science, how a theory of possible multiverse stems from the math/science. Often, the history, and science background is more interesting then the thoughts on possible multiverse that stems from the science. The last 1/4 of the book seems to deviate from that formula a bit, and is a harder read. While there is no actual math in the book, the last chapters delve deeper into speculation based on some pretty hard math. So sometimes I had to re-read sections, and sometimes I scratched my head, thinking the scientists had to be smoking something when they came up with these ideas. However, even though the last chapters made me work harder, it was still a worthwhile read. I have read a few books lately on quantum theory, string theory, and cosmology. Very often these books used allegories that were over simplified, or deeply flawed. Brian Greene did a much better job in explaining what can be very complex science, than many of the other books I have read. It's obvious that Mr. Greene both lives an breaths this stuff every day, and is well practiced at explaining it to laymen, as he both seems to know the topic well, and explains it well. Definitely not a book for everyone. But I enjoyed it. "
128,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/578242-johnny,4,"I listened to the audio book edition of this book. The author is the reader, and he is a good reader. The book is about the possible scenarios for multiple, parallel universes offered up by modern physics research. His treatment of the subject is great. This is the kind of stuff I would have eaten up as a teenager. But by now my tastes have changed, and I am much more critical of it.A quote from the beginning of chapter 3: ""For all its progress, string theory has yet to make definitive predictions whose experimental investigation could prove the theory right or wrong."" So string theory does not even meet basic falsifiability criteria? Great.. Imagine an author like this making a statement like that in relation to homeopathy or clairvoyance, or even something like chi that has played a significant role in traditional Chinese medicine for over five thousand years?Here is what the author has to say about chi in this book: ""Especially when it comes to life, some people believe that an essential nonphysical aspect (spirit, soul, life force, chi, and so on) is required to animate the physical. Although I remain open to this possibility, I've never encountered any evidence to support it. The position that makes the most sense to me is that one's physical and mental characteristics are nothing but a manifestation of how the particles in one's body are arranged. Specify the particle arrangement and you've specified everything."" So wait, have you ever encountered any evidence to support that last statement?Don't get me wrong - I think super-string theory is great stuff, and that people should be studying it. A little later in the book, the author does say that the theory is speculative, and discusses at some length why he thinks this is still science, and still valuable science. His arguments work for me. But I do still see a double-standard at play here. Lack of evidence, in regards to super-strings, or to chi, or to whatever else, is not a disproof. And lack of evidence can mean many things, including nobody really searching for evidence. For instance, how many billions of dollars per year are spent world wide on physics research, including basic research, telescopes, particle collidors, and supporting staff for all these endeavors? Just how many billions of dollars a year? If would be interesting to get an estimate. What would happen if you gave a competent administrator with an interest in tai chi and Chinese medicine, say, a hundred million dollars a year for a period of, say, 20 years, to study the phenomenon of chi? Just a tiny fraction of the budget for physics research. They may well turn up some real evidence for the phenomenon. And if they didn't, that would certainly be a valuable result as well. But it's just a thought-experiment, and will probably always stay that way, since there is virtually no chance that anybody will invest this kind of money in chi research in the current socio-political climate.Okay, I started with a long digression, so back to the book. The author does a great job of explaining highly complex and hard to understand concepts of modern physics in ways that are very accessible to a reader with little to no physics background. He is entertaining, and he evokes trust. He reads his own work, and is a good reader. The subject matter is also interesting - an exploration of the different possible ways that modern physics research supports the possibilities of multiple universes, or many worlds. Overall, it's a great treatment. But a few things bother me about it.My first complaint is a general one and certainly no fault of the author's. It seems to be quite difficult to read an introductory account of a highly specialized area as presented by a specialist. Because I am so uninformed in the field, I have to rely on what the author has to say about the matter far more than is comfortable for me. It's a single person, so I am clearly exposed to any of his personal biases. In this case, the author seems to be very professional, and careful about his biases and the biases of others, so I am not terribly concerned. But there are also the biases that permeate the field as a whole, which, from within the field, can sometimes be very hard to make out. Unfortunately, without at least a few semesters of coursework in the area, I am completely susceptible to these biases, and I am completely reliant on the author's account of the matters in question.My second complaint is that because modern physics is a very new and unsettled field, and highly speculative in a lot of ways, I often get the sneaking suspicion that the many-worlds variants described in the book will be completely warped, or replaced with entirely different kinds of many-worlds theories, within just a decade or two of further research. Just how relevant can these descriptions of many-worlds be in a field that is in such flux? I can deal with this problem by telling myself that the many-worlds theories presented are just stories, and instead of taking them as some kind of genuine account of specific truths, taking them as descriptive, in a sort of broad-brush way, of the kinds of conclusions that modern physics would lead us to.Finally, while reading this book I can't help but wondering just how relevant any of this material is? In most cases, the best we can hope for would be to prove that certain kinds of parallel worlds exist. But we will never be able to visit these worlds, or have any real sense of what they are like, aside from their overall physical properties. It's definitely interesting, but, billions of dollars of research interesting? Not really. Especially when I think of all the things that we could invest in understanding, right here in the real world. Such as our bodies, our chi, our emotions, and our psyche. In meditation, with practice, we can directly connect to parts of the universe that we are as yet unable to explore with the technologies and mathematics of physics. This is much more tangible and meaningful than some other world that we won't ever know much of anything about besides what the gravitational constant is, and whether they have electrons or positrons, or both."
129,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6110400-rrisher,4,"This is the second book by Greene that I have attempted to digest, and, thanks to my fanatical reading habits in the last few months, more than last time, I was better prepared for certain theoretical concepts. In audible form, I'm guilty of being distracted by my surroundings when listening, but crossing mid-town Manhattan everyday in mid-winter I tried my best to absorb the startling and fascinating propositions for reality that Greene dressed down from their mathematical heights. In my studious listening I tried to imagine a reality that I am unequipped to fully understand. But I enjoy bending my own conceptual muscles to see if even this tiny brain can understand 4 dimensions, let alone 10. A few things are now clear thanks to Greene and others like Sean Carroll who write physics for the masses, reality is only real to those that live it, all other parallel existences own the properties of the possible, whether or not it exists for our experience. This makes thinking about the possible impossible very exciting."
130,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25368814-seth-reisser,5,"This dive into the ideas of multiverse leaves you thinking for days on end of the different sciences that affect and are affected by the idea of multiverse. Multiverse is the idea (Many, including mtself, don't believe in it, but it is still infinitely amazing to think about) that for everything that could happen, there is a universe where the other outcome did happen. For example, if you flip a coin and it lands on heads, there is an alternate universe where that coin landed on tails. The average living organism makes 3.6*10^13 calculations per second. That, times the number of living organisms (5*10^39) is equal to how many alternate universes would be created per second (18 with 53 0's). That's per second! Most people would probably find this incredibly boring, but I, for one, am obsessed with this thought. The book dives so much deeper into the topic, and was incredibly interesting to me, earning 5 stars in my book."
131,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8648543-jonathan-crabb,4,"That was a mind stretching book. Not only in the sense that it explained concepts far outside of our normal culture earthbound, but so many of the ideas are theoretical. These thoughts would only really come up in conversations about deep physics based conversations or activities, and thus are often strange. However, I was really excited to learn about concepts like inflationary cosmology, cosmic time, probability waves, and multiverses of various types (especially simulated multiverses). I by no means understand them deeply, but Greene does a really good job of putting these complex concepts into somewhat relatable examples. He excels at it actually. The best thing that I can say for the book is that it made me much more interested in the field of physics, and due to it, I will read much more widely on the topic. It also made me want to go back and rewatch the show Fringe a lot. Well done. "
132,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15747665-brady,4,"This was a great introduction into current scientific thought about all possible worlds that could exist. The beginning of the book gives world possibilities more founded in current state of science while as the book goes on, the theories get more and more ‚Äúinto the fringes of scientific theory‚Äù and finally the later theories are more into the realm of philosophy or thought experiment than science (if considering the definition of science to be what is or could possibly be empirically proven or demonstrated). Some people might be turned off by this but I was not. Science and philosophy have went hand in hand and philosophy and thought experiments do have uses for science...it gives science things to pursue, a direction. Greene is very careful when outlining whether a theory is testable, how it could be proven, and what would disprove each possible world theory. Essentially this book is touching on the edges of what science is able to grasp as it goes on, but it‚Äôs a very fun ride."
133,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70163959-lalu-zam,4,"Like two previous books, Dr. Greene superbly explained the main topic of his book, which is various multiverse models from the latest investigation of theory in physics and mathematics. Although his explanation is mostly easy to be understood, there are some points that I think unnecessarily repeated through the book, namely the need to assess the theoretical claims with experiments/observations. Also there are habits of him to explain a simple concept with a long prelude and stories which I feel not really important. Take example when he explained the parallel universe as consequence of the interpretation of the wave functions in quantum mechanics. Overall, it is a fun book to read. It has this twists here and there that made you questioning whether is this still physics, philosophy or straight science fiction type thing. A must read for anyone interested in ‚Äûcrazy stuff‚Äú predicted by physics."
134,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94921143-jeff-rader,5,"It was quite a challenge to read about things that I have no background in, but I enjoyed following along as best I could with some of the cutting edge and revolutionary theories out there. I still don‚Äôt truly understand Einstein but I see how he changed physics forever. I don‚Äôt understand string theory but I see that it is revolutionizing so many aspects of science. What I really appreciate about this book is that it doesn‚Äôt try to be dogmatic. It talks about the theories of science. Too often we hear about the truths of science when there is actually much more uncertainty than many of us are comfortable with. I know it is strange but this book strengthened my faith that God is working in ways that man has yet to fully comprehend. The enlightenment did not define God and we haven‚Äôt either. God is still bigger than what we are able to understand and comprehend. To me He is the hidden reality. "
135,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20557364-michael,3,"On the one hand, I listened to this book on tape in my car over the course of a month, which in the fits and starts it was consumed, made for a somewhat disjointed read. On the other hand, this book is so far at the edge of what my brain can understand, that even if I had been reading it in a white room with nothing on the walls, instead of listening to it in a car going 70 miles an hour, I still don't think I would have understood everything. With that being said, Greene did a moderately good job of explaining pretty much the most complicated stuff known to humanity. I wish he had used more humor, but his analogies to things I knew about made it more understandable. My main gripe is that with most of the stuff I still don't understand it well enough to explain at a cocktail party conversation, which was my main impetus for getting the book to begin with. "
136,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42769150-sparowhawke,4,"After reading The Elegant Universe, which I highly recommend, I saw the audiobook of this title and purchased it. It then had to await a trip long enough to accommodate the reading. I enjoyed it as much as I did The Elegant Universe, but in hindsight I wish I had read the print version. There is much to ponder in both books, too much so to do while driving. The ability to pause, to reflect, to flip back to earlier sections, or to reread passages is, for me at least, necessary to a full appreciation of both.While I have been a physics aficionado since my youth, I do not profess to be talented enough at physics to fully appreciate or to ably critique string theory. That said, I still did not come away from this book as optimistic about its future or as satisfied with the many worlds and multiverses the theory allows as I think the author hoped I would."
137,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9233935-paul,4,"I picked up a copy of this book ages ago but took my time getting around to reading it. Consequently, this book about cutting edge scientific theories ended up a little dated after less than a decade. The material mostly holds up, but every now and then it postulates the consequences of things that have happened since, like the verification of the existence of the Higgs Boson or gravitational waves. Likewise, the book devotes an entire section to the holographic universe concept which has been frequently plastered on the news for the last several years; that is, I've read quite a lot about the topic since I purchased the book.This is not a bad book! It's good for anyone who wants to learn about the scientific ideas motivating the theories of parallel universes (without all the math). I made a mistake by not reading it when I bought it."
138,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2487858-amy,5,"This is a pause-to-return to library read, not a DNF read when I put it down about 30% of the way through.Dr. Greene asks, ""Are there parallel universes? How would we know?"" and his explanations are sort of pitched at the detail-oriented person who has a high school level background in science and not more. In some ways, I wanted him to get to the cool and ""woo"" stuff, but I appreciate how he spends his time explaining how theories are built, how we know what we know, and the decades and centuries of experimentation that lead us to a variety of kinds of conclusions, and what we don't know yet.Leave it to a scientist to make a fascinating topic boring via explanations that try to cram a lot of information into a short book, but hey, that's what scientists do and I appreciate it. I'll get my fix of science fiction elsewhere. "
139,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,5,"Another superb book by Greene. I haven't read his latest yet (though I eagerly await the opportunity). But this, his third, was just as fascinating and brilliantly executed as his first two. This one focuses on multiverses and parallel worlds, different varieties of which arise (in the sense of being more-or-less forced by the mathematics) in different areas of modern physics (inflationary physics, quantum mechanics, etc.) The jury's out on whether any of the 'hidden realities' Greene describes are, in fact, real. But Greene does a superb job (as ever) of describing why they may be real and of identifying the sorts of empirical observations/tests that could at least support such a hypothesis. A challenging, inspiring, and mind-expanding book. I loved it! "
140,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10948462-gautam-kamath,4,"I have to confess that I didn‚Äôt grasp all of this book, but the parts I did were tantalising enough to merit four stars. For the first time the concepts of string theory and the brane multiverse became clearer, as did a few other concepts but there were other times I fell asleep (quite literally) trying to figure out what Greene was saying. As when he slips in this explanation in one of the footnotes: ‚ÄúThe conformal group of symmetry transformations is infinite-dimensional, and this proves essential to ensuring that the perturbative quantum analysis of a moving string is mathematically consistent‚Äù. Dude, seriously? Still, a good read for those that love physics."

In the right hands, mathematics can be a versatile set of brushes with which an imaginative philosopher can paint awe inspiring pictures of the cosmos. Brian Green is just that kind of artist. Sometimes the things he writes about remind me ideas born of smoking way too much pot. In fact, I'd say Brian Greene and his colleagues provide us with living evidence that a person can get high on math."
142,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33039140-allan,5,"This book reviews one of the trippiest aspects of modern physics- the idea of multiple (maybe infinite?) parallel universes. And rather than just describing what parallel universes would look like, Greene gives us 8 different scenarios for how they could exist, then takes us through the very well-grounded physics behind each. The physics he describes are cutting edge- inflatons, quantum mechanics, string theory, etc. But Greene does a great job of making the very, very complex physics and mathematics accessible through analogies and simple language. Some of the sections drag a little, but overall it's a smart, interesting look at a fascinating topic."
143,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/545183-meghan,4,"Very well laid out for the layman who cannot go through all the math of higher-level physics. I kept having similar thoughts over and over throughout this book having to do with religion. First, many of the theories/speculations were so similar to or could potentially explain many doctrines in my own religion. Second, Brian Greene goes on about how many of these theories and ""so out there""and to stay with him and scientists have the duty to explore all possibilities, but many scientists refuse to even theorize the possibility of a God (which they cannot disprove or should not rule out). I wonder where scientific theory would go if truly all possibilities are considered equally. "
144,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11723162-b,5,"This was an excellent review of the topic of parallel universes. As with all of Greene's books, this one is very readable for the general reader but also difficult enough that you may want to go back and read certain sections. It will also make you feel that you actually learned something. I didn't realize that there were so many different, largely unrelated versions of the multiverse idea, though in hindsight I think I have heard of all of them. Overall, great book and well-worth the read if you're interested in the topic. "
145,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19333231-zoe,5,"I read this book in hopes of learning about the multiverse. Not only did I learn that there are 9(!) versions of multiverses, it is mind blowing that they are mathematically & logically derived.I‚Äôve read a couple other books on cosmology, but I have to say Brian Greene is the best at simplifying extremely complex concepts. I had many ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moments reading this book. My favorites being the measure problem, principle of fecundity, and brane/cyclical multiverse. I also appreciate that he‚Äôs not one of those dogmatic scientists; he wants to see science continue to break boundaries. "
146,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63641121-elizabeth-rains,5,"This book is mind-boggling. It delves into some (among many, the author says) theories of alternate universes based on current research in physics. The technicalities of the physics and mathematical explanations in the book are far beyond my comfort zone with science, but Greene made it easy to zone out somewhat on the hard stuff but still understand basics topics. I can actually now explain string theory or quantum mechanics in a sentence or two--I think. I will probably read the book a second time so I can figure out which of the many types of multiverses I possibly inhabit."
147,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67810670-laurie-sand,4,"Where Fabric of the Cosmos was a fairly comprehensive overview of physics that physicists feel pretty confident is true, The Hidden Reality pushes the boundaries of what is known, and in fact constantly asks the question, ""How can we really be sure that we actually know the things we think we know?"" The content is much more abstract, theoretical, and philosophical than in Greene's previous books. I definitely had to give my brain more breaks from this book, so if Fabric of the Cosmos was a frustration for you, this one might deserve a pass."

It's wonderful how multiverse concept is introduced. Book gets a little heavy towards the mid-end, but if you are any better than a non-math person like me, you are all good!Overall it is a fun book for all Physics lovers! <3Disclaimer: Brian Greene is a Prof at my college and I guess this book made me his fan already!"

This is his second book I've read (also read The Elegant Universe), and although they can be very technical, with a lot of physics, I still really enjoy reading them. In The Hidden Reality, Brian discusses several different theories that could explain why there are multiverses, from the Many Worlds theory, to Holographic and Simulated Worlds. Brian is a great writer, and does a great job at explaining very complicated ideas to those of us with a love for the universe."

The reading is bland and sometimes hard to push through but Brian Greene does an excellent job of giving you the knowledge you will need to understand very complex ideas. I had a few ""ah-ha moments"" about various theories and mathematics that I was not grasping the concepts until now. I intend to keep reading more non-fiction books regarding some of the concepts in this book. Very exciting stuff!"
151,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18935251-utsav,5,"I began reading this book - which was languishing in my Kindle for a while - just as the news of the (potential) clinching evidence for the Inflationary model of the Big Bang cosmology came out (the polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation due to gravitational waves form the Big Bang). And it was just what the doctor ordered. As most readers interested in such topics, I was already somewhat familiar with many of the concepts that Greene discusses, but what he does very well in the book is that he assumes no specific scientific knowledge base, no physics or mathematics above high school is needed and takes the reader gradually step by step through the admittedly esoteric concepts that are on on the cutting edge of modern day physics.Chapter by chapter, we are on a journey through an increasingly expanded view of reality. Greene takes us step by step through each version of the parallel or multiple universe by describing how those ideas were motivated by developments within physics and how in most cases those developments had nothing initially to do with pursuing a hidden reality or parallel universes. He describes how ideas about solving one problem or another in modern physics, like resolving a paradox about black holes swallowing information (something not allowed by Quantum Physics), or trying to explain the ""flatness"" and uniformity of the 3 dimensional universe we observe led physicists inexorably towards concepts that unambiguously suggest that those ideas - if true - would inevitably also mean that there are hidden realities out there which are much more expansive that what we had traditionally considered ""the Universe"".The explanations of the underlying physics and the associated scientific efforts are very well described. Greene mixes in the historical developments within science and the evolution of the ideas themselves with accessible explanations of those ideas and how they related to the then current understanding of the Universe well to give an enjoyable read. The explanations of the difficult physics or mathematics ideas are well supported by diagrams and pictures and whenever warranted he takes his time developing the idea before plunging into what its implications are for the topic at hand. This allows the reader to come into the book with little to no prior knowledge which is great. And for those who do possess some inkling, it provides a good review and a fresh perspective as well as putting it into context with relation to how those ideas relate to the multiverse view of reality.Another great aspect of the book is that the author is very careful to highlight and demark what is currently known to be correct in terms of Physics verified by experiment and what is for now still in the realm of hypothesis, speculation and conjecture. In fact a significant portion of the book is dedicated to discussing the current status of various proposals like the Inflationary cosmology model or string ""theory"" (which doesn't yet deserve the status of a scientific ""theory"" like say General Relativity or the Standard Model of particle Physics because it has not been tested experimentally and so is nothing more than a bunch of very interesting and suggestive ideas, but cannot rightly be called a theory which in science has a ""revered"" place of something that has been exhaustively verified by experimental data). These discussion highlight the core of the scientific process - how no idea is sacred and the importance of checking one's proposals via experiments and observations. Without that, these are nothing more than curious symbols scribbled onto paper. A lot of discussion goes into what it would or should take for us to take the reality of these multiple or parallel universes seriously and to ""believe"" in them. What it means to be scientifically tested. In the subject of hidden realities this is by definition tricky because they are, well, hidden. So with perfect clarity, Greene makes it clear what we currently think can and cannot be experimentally tested and how our ideas have now come to a place where even thinking about how to go about testing them stretches the imagination. It could very well be that we may never be sure in a scientific sense about the reality of some of the implications of these proposals because they might, even in principle, be untestable. This leads to a lot of deep question about what science can actually tell us about reality and how we could find ingenious ways to test the most outlandish ideas about the nature of our existence.All in all, the book is a great read to anyone who is interested in the deep questions about existence and wants to get the scientific low down about it. The language is flowing and the explanations accessible. Without presuming any deep knowledge of physics, the book manages to go very deep into the most interesting questions out there which everyone undoubtedly asks in one form or another at some point in their lives. It gives a thorough scientific view of these questions leaving the reader amazed about how far we have come in so short a time but also gives a glimpse into how far we might still have left to go. There are interesting discussions about the nature of scientific fact that arise naturally and are dealt with in appropriate clarity.So to anyone who is looking to expand their mind to the almost unfathomable wonder of the cosmos and our place in it, this book is a must read!"

The author does a great job of using examples to explain concepts. It's an in-depth look at parallel universes and highly technical, but not overwhelming. He also explores the challenges facing scientists in this field - an unexpected, but great addition to the other material."
156,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6038911-david,4,"Columbia University professor and physicist Brian Greene is known for his ability to communicate science to a non-scientific audience and he demonstrates that ability well in this book. It's a lot to digest but if you are interested at all in understanding current scientific topics like parallel universes, string theory, quantum physics, multiverses and other topics that most people like me don't know much about, this the book to go to. It's very readable and enlightening."

221,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49575307-rodney-harvill,4,"In this well-written book designed for a general audience, Brian Greene discusses string theory and hypothetical multiverse proposals. In dealing with string theory, he compares it to relativity, which deals with macroscopic phenomena such as gravity, and quantum mechanics, which deals with microscopic phenomena such as strong and weak nuclear forces. If relativity is used to evaluate microscopic phenomena or quantum mechanics is used to evaluate macroscopic phenomena, the math breaks down. Furthermore, the math of either method breaks down in dealing with singularities. String theory, on the other hand, can handle singularities, and string theory math simplifies to quantum mechanics when applied to microscopic phenomena and relativity when applied to macroscopic phenomena. For this reason, string theory appears promising although it is not testable with current technology.The following multiverse proposals are discussed in this book:- Quilted multiverse theory treats space as infinite such that there are regions of space that are too far apart to interact. The different non-interacting patches (zones or regions) are collectively called the quilted multiverse.- Inflationary multiverse theory incorporates inflationary cosmology, which modifies big bang theory by inserting an intense burst of enormously fast expansion during the universe‚Äôs earliest moments. The inflationary multiverse results when bubble universes continually form within an ever expanding spatial environment permeated by a high-valued inflaton field. Theoretically the inflaton field would not be uniform; rather there would be peaks and valleys. Regions of high field energy would generate repulsive gravity and inflation, generating bubble universes.- Brane multiverse theory utilizes two-dimensional objects, membranes, instead of the one-dimensional objects of string theory. These methods identify objects with up to ten spatial dimensions. Factoring in time as a dimension, there are eleven dimensions. The Brane multiverse implies multiverse separation across dimensions.- The cyclic multiverse is a variant of the brane multiverse accounting for the destruction by collision and regeneration of brane multiverses. Its appeal is its apparent ability to avoid the issue of how the universe began although the second law of thermodynamics is the monkey wrench in the works. As each iteration would produce increasing entropy, earlier cycles would have less entropy and would have had shorter durations. Sufficiently far back in time, the cycles would have been so short as to have ceased. There would still have been an ultimate beginning.- The landscape multiverse combines inflationary cosmology and string theory by positing that eternal inflation sprinkles string theory‚Äôs 10^500 possible forms for the extra dimensions across the bubble universes, one form for the extra dimensions per bubble universe. We just happen to live in the bubble whose extra dimensions yield a universe that is hospitable to our form of life and whose properties agree with observations.- Quantum multiverse theory proposes that all possible outcomes are realized as alternate realities in separate worlds. Although Dr. Greene does not mention this in the book, this multiverse proposal was popularized in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation.- Holographic multiverse theory posits that the universe is an information processor that takes information representing the here and now and produces information describing how it will change. The observable physical environment arises from this information and evolves according the laws of physics. It would be quite interesting to compare holographic multiverse theory with William Dembski's information metaphysics in Being As Communion.- There are two possible simulated multiverse options: creation of a real universe or a virtual universe. The first option would require at a minimum an inflaton field along with a white hole to start the process. Given that both phenomena are merely theoretical and have never been observed, this option is a tall order. The second option is essentially a computer simulation that utilizes advanced artificial intelligence technology to anticipate and appropriately respond to the mental states and intentions of its simulated inhabitants.- Finally, an ultimate universe is an all-encompassing multiverse in which all possible mathematical equations are realized physically. In other words, it fails to accept any possible hypothetical multiverse as brute-force reality. I haven't yet decided if it is a way to keep options open or if it is a merger of post-modern philosophy and cosmology.For the record, I do not accept multiverse theory but appreciate Dr. Greene's masterful communication skills and his ability to make arcane topics understandable for the layman."
222,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15091414-ryan,5," I‚Äôve become fascinated by quantum physics over the past several years. That isn‚Äôt to say that I understand it all that well, but I try. This is the fourth book I‚Äôve read on the topic and, as I‚Äôve become accustomed to with regards to this subject, it dropped my jaw more than a few times. The book is about what physicists are learning regarding the possibility of parallel/multiple universes. You have to read the book to get the full ‚Äúknock you out of your chair‚Äù effect (not to mention the whys and hows), but here is a summary of the main ‚Äúmultiverse‚Äù theories that physicists believe, based on current scientific understanding, may exist:1) Quilted Multiverse: if our universe is infinite (and that - so far - is undetermined) then because there is only a finite number of ways in which particles can arrange themselves, there must be an infinite number of exact replicas of our part of the universe spread throughout the infinite universe. Though they are likely to be at distances far beyond anything we can observe or communicate with, in an infinite universe there are infinite numbers of Earths and Ryan Hunter‚Äôs writing book reviews.2) Inflationary Multiverse: think of all that there is as being an infinitely large and rapidly expanding slice of swiss cheese. The holes in the swiss cheese are universes, one of which is ours. At any moment, a new hole ‚Äì or universe ‚Äì could be created. Also, the cheese separating two holes could separate, combining the two holes (i.e. - a collision between two universes).3) Brane Multiverse: think of our universe as a three dimensional (+ time) slice of bread (i.e. a ‚Äúbrane‚Äù) and each additional slice as a different universe that together make up a ten dimensional cosmic loaf (though there is no limit on the number of slices in the loaf). Nothing can interact between the bread slice universes except for gravity (which is why gravity is so weak compared to other forces because it is diluted by its presence in the ten dimensions outside our universe).4) Cyclic Multiverse: This is an addition to the Brane Multiverse scenario in which two universes (slices of bread) collide with each other and then bounce off each other (i.e. the big bang), only to be pulled back toward each other by gravity in a pattern that repeats itself (though the whole time our universe continues to expand). Physicists estimate that this may occur on a 1 trillion year cycle. Our universe is 14 billion years old, so if this idea is correct, we have another 86 billion years before the next collision and big bang.5) Landscape Multiverse: This one is hard for me to describe, but the idea is that new universes may be formed within regions of our own universe, essentially bubbling up from empty space due to ‚Äúquantum tunneling‚Äù (though we wouldn‚Äôt be able to perceive them as they would have different laws of physics and be entirely separate universes).6) Quantum Multiverse: Due to the quantum wave function - which tells us that a particle is in any of a number of locations at the same time but only locks in at one location when it is observed - all possible events actually happen in parallel universes and we only experience one of those events in our universe. To dramatize this idea, let‚Äôs say you were in a fender bender on your drive home because you rolled through a stop sign. There is a parallel universe where you did not roll through the stop sign and did not get in the wreck (since we are all made of particles, and because any one particle can be in numerous locations at once, so can we, and we only perceive one version of that reality). There is also a universe where you weren‚Äôt at the stop sign because you worked late that day. There is also a universe where you don‚Äôt exist because your parents never met. And there are an infinite number of other universes where any possible event or combination of events has occurred.7) Holographic Multiverse: Another hard one to describe, but the idea is that our universe is a three dimensional holographic projection of activity occurring on a two dimensional surface (and the activity has no resemblance to what it is represented by in our universe‚Ä¶.for example, a black hole in our universe is simply a projection of a collection of hot particles on the two dimensional surface).These summaries do not do the subject justice. I highly recommend that you read the book, or any other book by Brian Greene, or any book by Michio Kaku, or Lisa Randall‚Äôs book ‚ÄúWarped Passages,‚Äù all of which deal with the amazing reality being discovered through quantum physics."

225,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15651131-last-ranger,5,"No Road Untraveled.This challenging, but fascinating, book from Brian Greene is another winner. It turns out that there's not just one version of the multiverse proposal but several, ranging from the Quilted and Inflationary Multiverses to the Brane and Quantum Multiverses. If you'r not careful you could get lost on this mathematical road trip. Drawing on everyday analogues to help explain the various examples of the Multiverse, Greene delves into the mysteries of Quantum Mechanics and Relativity searching for some common ground. As always his writing is geared for the well-read layperson but it helps to have a good background in reading this type of book. If you've read his previous books or similar titles by other authors then this one shouldn't be much of a problem. The whole idea of the Multiverse is based on extreme mathematics but you don't have to be a math wizard to enjoy the book. While the approach is non mathematical Greene does provide some equations (in the notes) for anybody so inclined. Some of the information is given as a kind of ""refresher course"" in String Theory and Quantum Mechanics but the author gives you the opportunity skip ahead if you wish to. Not being a physicists myself I tend to appreciate that kind of approach. The book is presented in 11 chapters with each chapter devoted to one or two kinds of Multiverse so the reader gets an in depth look at each variety. I found that some chapters were easier to read than others and there were some sections that were a little overwhelming in content. It took me two passes to read The Elegant Universe and three attempts on The Hidden Reality but in the end I got through both of them. I liked the section on the Inflationary Multiverse and it's ""Swiss Cheese"" analogy, it was the easiest to get through while the section on Quantum Mechanics, Probability Waves and Entropy was the most difficult. A good portion of the book is devoted to the history of theoretical physics and multiverse scenarios, giving you a look at the important people and events that made the most impact. To some people things like String Theory and Multiverses are more of a philosophy than a science since proof of their existence lies beyond our currant technology to access. To that end, the book closes with a section of extreme speculation on the future of computer simulation, artificial intelligence and the Multiverse. Read at your own risk. Scientist the world over are pushing the boundaries of knowledge with mathematics and observations, as well as complicated experiments but, so far, have not been unable to come up with any defining answers. And if the answers are not there or they lead in a different direction, then we will have to come up with a whole new set of metaphors to explain the world around us. The Hidden Reality gives you a well written glimpse at this strange landscape. But keep in mind that neither Greene or anyone else know for certain whether or not there are indeed Multiverses out there and he's the first one to admit that. Theoretical Physics is an active, fast changing field and researchers like Greene will continue probing the fringes of the known universe, looking for a way to combine electromagnetism and gravity into one coherent theory and also looking for the back door into other worlds and universes that may be lurking just out of sight, in some hidden reality. I recommend this book to any science reader who has an open, but skeptical, mind. While I had no technical or formatting problems with this Kindle edition it would have been nice if the publisher had saw fit to include the index, from the hard bound edition, to aid in searching the book.Last Ranger"
226,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,3,"This book focuses on the description of various scientific and philosophical trains of argument which lead to ""parallel universes"" or a ""multiverse"". Like Brian Greene's earlier books, The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos, it is full of interesting ideas; but I was not as impressed by this one. Where those books each followed out a single line of development wherever it seemed to lead (although for Greene it always seemed to lead to string theory), this book begins with a conclusion and then looks for all the many different possible arguments which might lead to it; and given the nature of the conclusion (the Multiverse) it has the feel of a ""gosh-wow"" book, concentrating on just those aspects of contemporary physics that seem counter-intuitive or astonishing and leaving out everything else -- I felt at times I was reading a book by Michio Kaku rather than Brian Greene.The arguments were uneven and did not seem all that convincing. Perhaps it was just that having recently read the more mathematical books by Penrose and Susskind I am more critical or at least less accepting of the simple analogies; but I just didn't think they ""worked"" as well as in the earlier books. For instance, he argues in the first chapter that if the universe is infinite and there are finitely many possible patterns of particles, each and every pattern must repeat exactly infinitely many times -- infinitely many Earths and infinitely many Brian Greenes writing infinitely many books . . . He uses the example of Imelda's shoes and outfits. (The reader under fifty may not get the allusion.) Eventually, if the number of outfits is finite, in infinite time (or infinite space) Imelda has to repeat her outfits. But it may as well be that she keeps wearing the last outfit, or chooses her outfits among the ones that had the most impact the first time she wore them, and avoids the horrible combination she vowed never to wear again. (One could imagine physical equivalents.) So the analogy doesn't prove that any combination must repeat infinitely many times, or even once. (Whatever may be the case with the particles.) The second analogy, with decks of cards, is based on an example where the probabilities are all equal, which begs the question. There are just too many cases like this throughout the book, where he may be right but his analogies don't support the conclusion.It may also be that while in the earlier books, he begins with accepted theories like quantum mechanics and general relativity and works up to the more speculative ideas like string theory, here he starts with speculative ideas from the beginning and ends up with more speculative metaphysics than physics. (Having majored in philosophy, I have no problem with a philosophical discussion of metaphysics, but physics and metaphysics are two different things, and if one wants to cross the boundaries, one needs to take into account the current technical arguments from both fields, not just combine modern advanced physics with Plato or a first year philosophy class.)The biggest problem, though, was that there just didn't seem to be all that much new here, except for the chapter on how string theory might be related to the cosmological constant (and even then, the cosmological constant just seems to replace other constants from earlier arguments.) If you've read his earlier books, and a few other recent popular books (Susskind's The Black Hole War and The Cosmic Landscape or Carroll's From Eternity to Here for example) there's no real reason to read this one. On the other hand, if this is the first book you've read on the subject you probably wouldn't follow it."

I consider myself fairly well versed in physics in a broader sense having always found that science quite interesting. Even following the field to some degree, it's easy to get ""behind."" The Hidden Reality really did an excellent job of capturing my interest and discussing the topic at hand: multiple universe (multiverse) theories.Most of us have some idea of ""parallel universes"" based on science fiction television/movies or books. But this book covers 7 wildly different multiverse theories: The Quilted Multiverse, Inflationary Multiverse, Brane Multiverse, Cyclic Multiverse, Landscape Multiverse, Quantum Multiverse, Holographic Multiverse, Simulated Multiverse, and the Ultimate Multiverse. I knew of the existence of several of these theories, but none to the level of detail that I learned in the book.Even if you have little understanding of physics, Greene does spend several chapters giving a basic rundown of the physics involved or required for the understanding of several of these. I found these chapters to be quite interesting and worthwhile, for the most part. These specific chapters explain in basic language (and without any math required) classical mechanics, relativity, string theory (several different string theories, actually), Inference and Quantum Probability.More Like ThisA Brief History of Time by Stephen HawkingHyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the Tenth Dimension by Michio KakuParallel Worlds: A Journey Through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos by Michio KakuBlack Bodies and Quantum Cats: Tales from the Annals of Physics by Jennifer OuelletteDeath by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries by Neil deGrasse TysonThe Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory by Brian Greene (and just about anything else by Green, Kaku, or Hawking that isn't published in a journal)"
229,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875081-arvind-balasundaram,3,"In this book, Brian Greene draws on recent developments in physics and mathematics to motivate arguments that entertain the possibility (some rather convincingly) that our universe, rather than being central in any cosmic order, may actually be just part of a multiverse supporting many other parallel universes. The book is not as easy to access as Greene's earlier book, The Fabric of the Cosmos, and appeals more to the intermediate/advanced reader who is well-grounded in fundamental concepts of string theory and cosmology. However, the work develops the arguments with great patience and very systematically, and the reader is left to reflect on the radical conclusions and implications, even if they are unable to fully digest the underlying scientific arguments.Greene's fundamental premise in this book is that multiple streams of scientific and mathematical thinking overwhelmingly suggest that our commonsense picture of reality as we know it is only part of a grander whole. This premise, Greene argues, is a natural progression of the same scientific ideas that initiated the Copernican revolution, and that our universe's non-centrality is merely an extension of similar earth-shattering ideas that historically challenged the centrality of the earth vis-a-vis the Sun and other planets. The author offers several proposals for the existence of parallel universes, devoting a chapter exclusively to each to develop the foundational arguments and support. Most of these are developed using mathematics and quantum physics, and ultimately paint a vision of a grand cosmos so big that a cosmic horizon restricts our understanding of what lies yonder since light cannot reach us from universes farther away.The proposals developed in this book are as follows: the Quilted Multiverse (infinite universes repeat across space based on manifesting conditions), the Inflationary Multiverse (where inflationary cosmology leads to the establishment of several bubble universes), Brane Multiverse (motivated by string theory's brane structure and higher dimensions which leads to co-existence of parallel universes) and the related Cyclic Multiverse (resulting from brane collisions that follow a cycle), Landscape Multiverse (where Quantum tunneling in a string landscape create bubbles of new space that co-exist), Quantum Multiverse (that results from Hugh Everett's challenge to the Copenhagen interpretation of Schrodinger's wave function equation, suggesting that probability waves simultaneously co-exist and present alternative realities), the Holographic Multiverse which proposes all perceived reality as a hologram (based on Hawking's work with black hole boundaries and Maldacena's surprising conclusions that connect physics at the boundary and bulk, equating quantum field physics with string theory with uncanny exactness), and finally, the Simulated and Ultimate Multiverses (which motivate technological and pure mathematical bases for the existence of parallel universes).This is a very thought-provoking read if the reader is willing to continue in spite of content challenges in the science. The bigger picture is always lucid and the general takeaways cannot be argued against, even though much depends on future endeavors experimentally testing many of the support pillars for these hypotheses. If nothing else, the reader is forced to ponder the contextual inconsequence not only of one's own existence in the grand cosmology but the very universe we presently inhabit, and for a moment suspend one's ego that usually overwhelms...

Greene is, hands down, the best science writer I've ever read, on so many levels it amazes me. Here he tackles the most mind-blowing aspect of cosmology: the fact that the mathematical unfolding of every cosmological theory today leads unfailingly to the idea that we are but one in a (usually) infinite collection of universes, collectively referred to as a ""multiverse.""Just as the search for an ultimate particle has led us down through the atom to the nucleus to the proton to the quark to (possibly) the string, so the search for ultimate ""bigness"" expanded from the Earth to the solar systems to the galaxy to the galactic cluster to the universe, now it has downgraded the entire universe to but a button in the sewing drawer of existence.Each branch of physics ‚Äì quantum mechanics, string theory, cosmic inflation, holography, etc. ‚Äì has posited (or more correctly been led mathematically) to a slightly or in some cases radically different view of what the multiverse would look like. It's silly to go into all of them in a review, especially since I couldn't touch either the detail or the elegance of Greene's presentation. But a couple theoretic setups struck me for one reason or another.The Quantum Multiverse assumes ‚Äì again through mathematical necessity ‚Äì every probabilistic outcome of a quantum event is actually realized and creates a separate branching universe. In other words, if I've got this right, the probabilities inherent in ""quantum jitters"" cause every single particle at every instant to generate a range of universes that each goes its own way. Seems like things would get crowded, no matter how you figure the separation of these universes. Despite the math involved, the conclusion seems silly. I'm 99.99999% sure it's hooey. Of course, that .00001 may be off somewhere creating a place I'd rather be, who knows?The Ultimate Universe, based on the idea that math IS reality, claims, rather simply but all-encompassingly, that we should consider any possible universe, based on any possible mathematical system, to be a reality. Thus you might have universes with an entirely different set of mathematic laws where reality unfolds in ways we can't even imagine. You even have to include the universe of Nothing ‚Äì the total empty universe.I have two problems with this: First, can you really say mathematics = reality? Calculus leads to the computation of ""instantaneous"" speed and acceleration. But, in reality, there is no such thing: speed and acceleration are dependent on time, and in the instant, there is no time. Calculus is magnificently useful, but to say that it IS a form of reality? I can' swallow that. Second, the Nothing universe would have no math. Period. Seems to me to kind of blow that theory.""The Hidden Reality"" is the capstone of what, so far, has been Greene's trilogy. It's the most difficult of his three books, on some levels, but beyond engrossing. Reading it, I felt I too was in a different universe."
231,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3737249-abbe,0," Amazon.com Review The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos here treats all viable alternate realities to a laudably fair shake. For a book exploring the most far-reaching implications of bleeding-edge mathematics, The Hidden Reality is surprisingly light on math, written as it is ""for a broad audience ... its only prerequisite the will to persevere."" Such perseverance pays off with a motley cast of potential universes featuring doppelg√§ngers, strings, branes, quantum probabilities, holographs, and simulated worlds. The result is that rare accomplishment in science writing for a popular audience: a volume that explains the science and its consequences while stimulating the imagination of even the uninitiated. Oliver Sacks on The Hidden Reality Brian Greene is not only a profound cosmological thinker--a pioneer of string theory--but a writer of exceptional clarity and charm. His books--_The Hidden Reality_ takes us deeper still, and it has a special personal quality and warmth that is evident from the opening of the book, when Greene recollects how, as a boy, he was fascinated by the multiple reflections in parallel mirrors. He has never lost this childlike wonder at the world of physics, but he brings it now to examining theories of multiple universes, of the continual birth of universes, starting long before our own. . . and destined to continue, perhaps, to the end of time.In the 1930s, as a boy myself, I read   From Publishers Weekly Starred Review. ""There was a time when √øuniverse' meant √øall there is,' "" writes Greene, but soon we may have to redefine that word, along with our own meager understanding of the cosmos. A theoretical physicist and celebrated author, Greene offers intrepid readers another in-depth yet marvelously accessible look inside the perplexing world of modern theoretical physics and cosmology. Greene's book The Elegant Universe explained late 20th-century efforts to find a unified theory of everything, culminating with string theory. But string theory opened up a new can of worms, hinting at the possible existence of multiple universes and other strange entities. The possibility of other universes existing alongside our own like holes in ""a gigantic block of Swiss cheese"" seems more likely every day. Beginning with relativity theory, the Big Bang, and our expanding universe, Greene introduces first the mind-blowing multiplicity of forms those parallel universes might take, from patchwork quilts or stretchy ""branes"" to landscapes and holograms riddled with black holes. With his inspired analogies starring everyone from South Park's Eric Cartman to Ms. Pac-Man and a can of Pringles, Greene presents a lucid, intriguing, and triumphantly understandable state-of-the-art look at the universe.

232,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4046161-james,2,"Let me begin by stating that I am a Brian Greene fan. I've read 'The Elegant Universe', 'The Fabric of the Cosmos', and even 'Icarus at the Edge of Time'. I thoroughly enjoyed each one. Of course, I also enjoyed the NOVA/PBS program, 'The Elegant Universe', based upon Greene's book by the same name and I'm looking forward to the upcoming program based upon his second book, 'The Fabric of the Cosmos'. Brian Greene has the ability to take a subject that is immensely complicated and translate it into language that the average person who has an interest in science can easily understand. I am, admittedly, a science enthusiast, but, by no means, am I an expert. Despite this, Greene's books kept me captivated from the first page to the last. The one exception was this book.I purchased Greene's book at my local Barnes & Noble store the very day it was released. I'm not sure why I did so, as I didn't begin reading it until several weeks later. However, I suppose my purchase of his book was a testament to my fandom and so it is with great pain that I give his latest work only two stars. Now, by all means, if you are more technically inclined to understand the subject of string theory and, in particular, so-called multiverse theory, then you may wish to disregard my comments. But, for the average reader, this was, as has been stated in other reviews, quite a difficult read. In fact, difficulties began as early as chapter two.The various multiverse theories are speculative, at best, as is readily admitted by Greene. In fact, Greene goes so far as to admit even that string theory, that for which he is so widely known, is largely speculative. However, 'The Hidden Reality' takes speculation to a new level and, while multiverse theories are arrived at by way of mathematical calculations and, hopefully, by some experimental verification in the future, the theories explained by Greene are such a wild departure from anything one might experience or imagine, that attempting to do so while reading this work made enjoyment of its contents all the more difficult.My criticism of Greene's latest book, however, is not with the science behind that with which he attempts to enlighten the reader, but with the delivery. As I read this book, I felt almost as if it had been published before its time. That is to say that Brian Greene introduces us to things that are so cutting-edge, that even the scientific community that has developed these theories cannot agree on their accuracy or whether their potential discoveries of worthy of scientific merit. With that said, it stretches the bounds of reasonableness to expect that the average reader (albeit, the reader with an interest in science) will find this book particularly engaging. To be fair, Greene admonishes the reader early on that this may be the case. And so it is with regret that I must agree."
233,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31055595-joel-fishbane,4,"A heady, intellectual adventure from start to finish, Brain Greene's The Hidden Reality boldly goes where only Star Trek and The Matrix have gone before: the topic of parallel universes. Tackling nine different theories of parallel realities, Mr. Greene carefully explains the science that supports them and in the process manages to prove that for all the goofy pseudo-science found in Star Trek (and I mean that affectionately), the underlying concept of an evil Spock is actually grounded in the deepest laws of the cosmos.Like John Gribben and Carl Sagan, Mr. Greene has the enviable ability to discuss complex ideas in an engaging way, favoring simple language and amusing anecdotes as a way of getting his ideas across. Whether he discusses quantum mechanics, string theory or black holes, Mr. Greene is able to carry us deftly from one idea to the next. Admittedly, this isn't the first book on cosmology or quantum theory that I've read, so I'm already well grounded in many of the book's basic concepts. It's possible that a quick survey of the Idiot's Guide to Cosmology may be in order - or just maybe just read Mr. Greene's other books, The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos. The ideas presented here would seem esoteric if they weren't the natural extension of physics most common theories. A Quilted Multiverse (parallel worlds spread out across infinite space), a Quantum Multiverse (everything the can happen does happen) and the Simulated Multiverse (ala The Matrix) are each presented as complete viable scientific conclusions. Mr. Greene clearly has his own favorite choices, but this doesn't keep him from discussing the controversy surrounding each theory - nor does he shy away from a discussion of why we should bother trying to unravel the mysteries of our reality at all.For all the science, however, at it's heart The Hidden Reality is a philisophical exploration of the most basic question of existence: why. Whichever theory is true, it seems likely (scientifically speaking) that we are part of one multiverse or another, an idea which has the potential to make our existence seem less unique then we like it to be. The Hidden Reality has the possibility to provoke reactions similar to those that followed Copernicus' revelation about the motion of planetary bodies: in other words, it can shake one's perception of both reality and our place in the world. I'd love to read a religious response to this book: not one that ignores the science, but rather one that finds a way to incorporate it into a religious theory.Although, it's possible this already exists. After all, the theologian Bishop Berkeley theorized that we only exist in the mind of God, which seems to be nothing but an extension of Mr. Greene's idea of a simulated reality."
234,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"The Hidden Reality contains a lot of theoretical information regarding multiple universes, holographic universes, string theory, quantum multiple universes and computer generated universes. These are incredibly strange and mind blowing concepts to be sure, but the thing I found most strange and mind blowing about Brian Greene‚Äôs The Hidden Reality was the complete absence of the phrase ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. Instead, Greene walks us through a physicists land of make believe for which not a shred of evidence exists. I understand that there are thousands of physicists out there who need to publish papers to advance their careers. I also realize that theoretical physics has largely stagnated since the exciting advances in quantum theory that began in the 1920‚Äôs leaving few topics to write about. But surely the efforts of these intelligent individuals is better spent on a more productive endeavor than the navel gazing that string theory has become. One would think that after almost 40 years of work that string theory and multi-verse proponents would be required to put up a single unambiguous piece of evidence in support of their claims. But they can‚Äôt, and some say that they never will. The following quote sums it up pretty well:""For more than a generation, physicists have been chasing a will-o‚Äô-the-wisp called string theory. The beginning of this chase marked the end of what had been three-quarters of a century of progress. Dozens of string-theory conferences have been held, hundreds of new Ph.D.s have been minted, and thousands of papers have been written. Yet, for all this activity, not a single new testable prediction has been made, not a single theoretical puzzle has been solved. In fact, there is no theory so far‚Äîjust a set of hunches and calculations suggesting that a theory might exist. And, even if it does, this theory will come in such a bewildering number of versions that it will be of no practical use: a Theory of Nothing.""‚ÄîJim HoltI suppose I found Greene‚Äôs uncritical presentation too close to the fairy tales one would expect from Dr. Seuss or Billy Graham. It would be far more honest of him to simply admit the truth and say ... I don‚Äôt know, nobody does. Update: I should have finished the book before writing the review. He actually says almost the exact words above ... IN THE NEXT TO LAST SENTENCE IN THE BOOK!! His readers would have been better served if he put it on the cover."
235,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/766282-james,3,"I've read Brian Greene's previous two books (Elegant Universe and Fabric of the Cosmos) and found this to follow a similar pattern. The first couple of chapters devoted to the historical pedigree of cosmology (so Newton, Einstein etc.) the next few chapters devoted to developments in hard science, and the last few chapters devoted to cutting-edge or speculative science. There's obviously some repetition over the three books (especially in the earlier chapters) but there's enough novelty to justify reading them all. So how does this book fare compared to the previous ones?To begin with, maybe I've just become much smarter over the last couple of years, but I found the material this work to be much easier to grasp than the material in his earlier books. Although his explanations border on patronising at times (such as using Eric Cartman rolling down a hill to explain inflaton fields) he does have a knack of simplifying very complex concepts into comprehensible analogies, and to that end this is probably his most accessible book yet. He was also more forthright about the scientific difficulties which face string theory at the moment (primary among them, the lack of supporting evidence), which I think makes a nice change from the untrammelled optimism of his earlier books.The faults? I think the science quickly veers from grounded discussions about the possibilities of multiverses (the scientific pursuit of which forms the unifying theme of this book) to rather less-grounded discussions about holographic universes and the possibility of our living inside of a computer simulation, by which stage my eyes began to glaze over. The discussions were fun in their way (and - as I said - Greene is generally explicit about noting where he is deviating from established science into wanton speculation), but given that the ""multiverse"" topic is already an inherently speculative idea, I would have preferred more material about the hard, scientific case for the multiverse (which - I must stress - Greene does a good job of presenting here) rather than these rather sci-fi flights of fancy. But, overall, it's a minor quibble. If you enjoyed his previous works (which I'd recommend starting with if you haven't), you'll probably enjoy this one too. 3.5 stars."
236,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2258782-chris,4,"The Hidden Reality is an intriguing journey to the frontiers of physics, explaining how different, sometimes unrelated, theories are independently converging on the probability that there is, and in fact must be, more than one universe. The long story short is that, as we learn more and more about the nature of reality, in order for physicists to make sense of some of the more baffling facets of our universe, it has become increasingly necessary to invoke various types of alternative universes to fully explain the data. The math--if not the evidence (yet)--is pointing toward the likelihood of an infinite number of parallel universes, taking an infinite number of forms. An infinite number of yous and mes living different lives throughout the unimaginably vast expanse of the ""multiverse.""And, once again, humankind is demoted from the centrality of our place in the cosmos. Our species, our planet, our solar system, our galaxy, and now, not even our entire universe, are nowhere near the ""center"" of anything. There is no center to speak of, really. The cosmos is a mysterious and wondrous place, isn't it?Greene is an excellent tour guide to each of the possible parallel universes, and is a gifted writer to boot--capable of generating a seemingly endless reserve of analogies and examples grounded in common experience that are employed to illuminate ideas that are anything but. It's a skill that particularly useful in outlining the current state of understanding in the field of quantum mechanics--it never ceases to amaze me just how fundamentally weird the tiny constituent parts of the universe are. Greene is also quite good at explaining the Anthropic Principle, a shockingly useful concept that provides a powerful rationale as to why our universe (and planet) seem just right for life. (Essentially: If it weren't, then we wouldn't be here to wonder at it. There's more to it than that, of course.)I'd recommend this book to anyone. Some of the sections offer more challenging material, for all but the most intrepid explorer, but Greene does an effective job of telling the more cursory reader what portions safely can be skipped. So, just sit right back and let Greene be your tour guide for cosmic adventure..."
237,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10924440-rob,4,"Brian Greene writes books on cosmology and string theory that are remarkably approachable. He writes in a clear and entertaining way that makes you almost believe you understand string theory and quantum physics. This book walks you through theories of multiple universes. Sci-fi fans have always assumed that parallel universes were possible, but Greene walks us through how physicists came to believe these were theoretically possible. Along the way, he talks about questions like the meaning of probability in an infinite universe. Twice as likely implies that one possibility occurs an infinite number of times and the other occurs, um, two times infinity number of times (""this sounds like the tortured math of one-upping seven-year-olds""). Speaking of probabilities, he describes the work of philosopher Nick Bostrom, who reasoned that simulated universes like the Matrix (if possible) would be presumably much easier to create than real ones. As a result, statistically speaking the chances that we live in a simulated universe are much higher than that we are living in a ""real"" one. Hmm. And my favorite topic is the idea that the universe as we know it is an illusion--a holographic projection of matter that exists on a distant outer periphery. The scary part is that there is math behind this theory--something to do with the fact that information embodied on the outer shell of a boundary described in terms of quantum theory is identical to information inside the shell described in terms of string theory. (I didn't really get it either, but it sounds logical ;^) ) Anyhow, the point is that by focusing on parallel universes, this book describes some cutting edge cosmological theory. If you've read other books on cosmology, then this is a great book to push you out of your comfort zone once things like Schrodinger's cat and entanglement theory no longer seem bizarre to you. On the other hand, if you're new to the topic, I'd start with something like Greene's Fabric of the Universe or Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time or Kip Thorne's and Stephen Hawking's Black Holes and Time Warps. Greene also has a TED talk and discussed the topic on Nova."

I feel as a popularizer of notions and having a low bar of entry, it is even better than Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions. This is very easy to follow with clear analogies such as blurry photographs of a fly and the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and similarly works well to explain simply ideas like Planck constant and information capacity, the Copenhagen interpretation and, new to me, the inflaton field theorized to drive cosmic inflation in the very early universe. In short, an excellent summary introduction by a researched in cosmology with a gift for explanation."
239,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9924189-james-kane,4,"This guy is without a doubt one of the best science writers going around. His style is clear, engaging, and informative without being condescending, and he has an uncanny knack of making you feel like you've understood what he's talking about even when you probably haven't. The Hidden Reality is tougher going than The Fabric of the Cosmos (2004), his previous bestseller, but this is unsurprising given the fact that it tackles a topic that is less general and inherently more challenging, even in terms of the basic overall concept. Greene uses the principles of inflationary cosmology, quantum mechanics, string theory and a host of other theoretical frameworks to introduce no less than nine possible models of a reality in which our universe is not, in fact, the universe at all, but merely one of a (potentially infinite) number of alternative universes containing both micro- and macrosopically different physical features. The Hidden Reality really is a slog at times, but Greene's infectious enthusiasm for his subject and his ability to translate difficult concepts into comparatively lucid everyman terms make it an enjoyable slog nonetheless. As someone who lives and breathes the humanities, I think the thing I really like about Greene is that he has no polemical agenda, no interest in trumpeting the superiority of science over all other disciplines or reducing existence to a dry agglomeration of quantifiable data with no scope for all the complexities and mysteries and beauties of life. He infuses all of his books with the same sense of awe I always feel when looking at the stars and writes with a wide-eyed wonder, as if he's encouraging us to constantly pinch ourselves as a reminder that we really are here in this vast, infinitely astonishing universe, or possibly ""multiverse"" (though if one of the models Greene outlines is correct, we might not actually be here at all). Greene is a brilliant, eloquent advocate of the value of searching for knowledge and understanding, even when that search takes us beyond what's familiar or seemingly reasonable. I'm sure his next book, whenever it comes, will be another reality-shaking read."
240,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4646872-parsa,4,"Unbelievable parallel, cyclic, quilted, holographic, simulated and many other scenarios that the string theory and the quantum physics allows to arrive at the same mind bending conclusion. We are such an insignificant being, in such an insignificant corner of such an insignificant universe, in such a vast and incomprehensible 'multi-verse'... The good news is, if you found your head spinning and feel like you are somehow lost in some unfathomable dimension of reality or mathematical complexity, you are not alone. Even the author seems to be lost, his mind and his grasp on the reality I would say... While the author admits speculative nature of many of these theories (better to say hypothetical realms with some mathematical explanations), he does a good job in listing several arguments that point to the same conclusion, that our universe is only one of the many. He doesn't claim any scientific rigor to this conclusion (which is sad. see Scientific American August 2011 issue challenging the idea of Multiverses in scientific grounds), but I guess the point that emerges out of reading this book is that when several different, unrelated, and sometimes disjoint paradigms suggest the same thing, although none can be independently and empirically tested or proven, one is inclined to think that it is more than just a mathematical happenstance.I am fond of reading sci-fi books as well as scientific books and couldn't really tell the difference in many of the passages of this book. Speculations backed by untested and untestable theoretical explanations, with fantastically amazing implications on how our entire species should identify itself and rationalize its adventures to the outer-verses made reading this book more interesting for me. I am happy that I read it back to back with The Elegant Universe, which made understanding many of the theoretical groundings of this book much easier for someone unfamiliar with the mathematical complexities of the String theory... "
241,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"The Hidden Reality is a brilliantly written book that does not impart as much proven knowledge as Fabric of Cosmos or The Elegant Universe but takes the readers to the highly speculative, part-philosophical ride on the nature of reality. In the nine different multiverse theories discussed here, the underlying theme - as discussed towards the end - is that the only thing that does not make sense is why our universe can not be unique and special, the way our galaxy, sun or earth are not. The theories are often complex and always speculative, but lucidly explained. While one may not understand all the finer points, the author has a great ability to return to the main messages which are always crystal clear.That said, the theories discussed here often appear like new, scientific religions. The infinite regress problem that used to trouble anyone logically analysing religion (if God created us, who created God etc) are now afflicting the universe and whatever latest elementary particles/fields. As per science, their has to be something behind their finely balanced structure - like practically infinite number of universes of which we just happen to be one. Lest this is ever proven, chances are that someone will then need to come out with multi-multiverse theories to justify why our multiverse can not be unique. At some point, science has to grapple the issue of the beginning or a singularity or uniqueness of our reality. There is one whole which may not be a single universe, as it is not a single star or atom, but still it must exist. Science and philosophy are not complete until we reach there. If multiverse theories' main foundation (in the absence of provable assertions) is that our universe can not be unique, it is on a massively wrong footing. And this is where this book has its shortcomings, in the eventual conclusion. That said, a must read for anyone who likes to get to the deeper issues of existence or learn more about the latest scientific theories. "
242,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9892350-ollie,2,"At one point in this book Brian Greene poses the question of whether as human beings, we are equipped with the mental capacity to understand our universe. For this to happen our universe must have produced something that is able to understand itself, and if our universe is really part of many, it must have produced something greater than itself. In other words, we might be woefully unfit to understand the mechanisms of our universe. That in and of itself is thought provoking enough.On that note, I'd like to ask the question, are books fit to explain the grand ideas that Greene tries to discuss here? In other words, are 2-dimensional words and pictures an adequate way to explain something like string theory? I found myself asking this question as soon as I got to that chapter (the previous chapters on quilted and expanding universes being ""simple"" enough for me to grasp somewhat), and after putting the book down in frustration and watching a PBS documentary called the Elegant Universe (which explained all these concepts perfectly well in a fraction of the time it took to read some of these chapters) I have to conclude that this book is almost a lost cause. As if Hidden Reality didn't already have so much going against it, it also becomes obvious that some of these theories are basically -- well just theories, almost philosophical in nature, and set up in way that they're essentially scientifically untestable at this point. In other words, we can't observe them in a lab. But, Greene says, if these theories are largely based on math, and it's truly only though math we can understand the universe, doesn't that make all of these theories valid? He seems to think so, while at the same time understanding people's hesitation.In the meantime, we're left with these theories,each more elaborate than the next, which mostly sound like desperate and creative attempts to dance around an actual answer.The ideas in this book are grand, but the lack of substance unfortunately leave the reader unsatisfied."
243,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16304535-unni-krishnan,3,"I had heard about some of the parallel universe ideas before, but not about all of them. Brian Greene has managed to piece together all the possible parallel universe concepts and compiled into one single book in an accessible manner. This helps an enthusiastic reader to compare and understand the various multiverse ideas in a coherent manner. Although Brian Greene is a string theorist, he doesn't give undue prominence to the multiverse ideas originated from the string theory. Out of them quilted, quantum, holographic, simulated and ultimate multiverse ideas were easy to grasp. The descriptions of the others were not that easy. Especially I didn't understand the difference between landscape, inflationary and cyclic multiverses. Maybe the idea about the inflationary big bang puts me off as it always sounds like a tweak in whatever manner it is described. The inflation field and swizz cheese with multiple holes forming different universes was only understood as, well, swizz cheese with multiple holes.I loved the detailed treatment of the quantum multiverse. I have heard about this before and had a rough idea about it. But Greene had managed to bring out all the subtleties originating from this. Especially the place of the probabilistic description of the classical quantum mechanical interpretation in this interpretation. I think the difficulty in managing the idea of probability in many worlds approach is not only a problem about the quantum mechanics, but in general about the general probability theory. I would be interested to read further treatment on this.Brian Greene has struggled all the way to avoid mathematical equations in this book too. Maybe he believes in the infamous quote about each equation reducing the sale of a book by thousand. I would have preferred a feeling of struggle to understand a Hamiltonian's evolution in a theoretical physics rather than the pretentious feeling of satisfaction after reading about a 'wiggling string' in two dimensions and myriads of metaphors. But, then I shouldn't read Brian Greene in the first place."
244,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1317185-matija,3,"I am probably doing this book a disservice by reviewing it. The problem is, I listened to the audiobook version of The Hidden Reality. It's not that the author, Brian Greene, who reads the book himself, is a bad narrator. Quite the contrary, I think the guy could do this for a living if he wasn't a theoretical physicist. It's just that it is easy for a mind to wander momentarily when listening and then you miss things. Normally not a problem, but when you're listening to an explanation of string theory or general relativity or the brain-slice multiverse theory, then you may quickly miss the point and have difficulty following the subsequent explanations. And unlike with a book, you cannot just quickly rescan what you've missed, you have to rewind.Anyway, The Hidden Reality is all about how our universe may be just one of the perhaps infinitely many universes in a multiverse. Various possible multiverse theories are explored. There is the inflationary theory, the bubble one, the holographic one, my favorite the simulated multiverse theory and even the ultimate one. The science supporting each such theory is explained, whether be it Newtonian physics, Einstein's relativity, quantum fields or, of course and possibly most prominently, string theory. Quite often Greene resorts to colorful metaphors, such as using Cartman from South Park rolling down the mountain to explain inflationary cosmology, but I wonder if that actually does more harm than good, since it obscures and possibly trivializes the subject. I mean, I didn't quite get it - not that it means anything.Fascinating subjects are broached here, but as I said, one might get more out of it by reading rather than listening to this book, which I once already abandoned listening to due to the problems described above. I am going to try to atone by actually reading one of Greene's previous books on the subject of string theory."

You know, because if you are not a physicist and not even inclined to understand complex (or, OK, some basic) science and math, and if you do not hang out with scientists and science/math nerds and people who talk regularly about inflationary cosmology and quarks and quantum tunneling, then you obviously will find yourself needing to refer to this book at least weekly.And yet the book managed to a) squeeze some actual learning into my not-very-sciencey (or mathy) brain, and b) inspire me to consider reading other books about physics. From a non-science-brain perspective, ‚ÄúThe Hidden Reality‚Äù is a mixture of helpful allegorical explanations and hard-to-follow science. Though I understood a lot of it only in the moment (like, I‚Äôd forget what something was a couple paragraphs later), I am surprised to find that I actually remember some things and can even explain them, though obviously in less sophisticated and eloquent terms. It isn‚Äôt an easy book to read, if you‚Äôre an extreme amateur like me, but then I am not sure what to compare it with since it‚Äôs the first real look at physics I‚Äôve ever read.A few of my favorite topics/vocabulary:*entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics*redshifting*quantum tunneling*cosmic horizon*event horizon (it‚Äôs not just a creepy movie!)*parallax (it‚Äôs fun to have a word to describe how objects appear to move depending on which eye you open)And on a final note, did you know that there are real scientists in the world who believe that parallel universes might actually exist?

246,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,4,"Beyond the farthest star we've seen, is there another expanse of matter we cannot, and will never see? Have other big bangs formed similar expanses separate to ours? And how do we really know that what we are seeing is real and not a simulation in some sophisticated computer? This last one is particularly thought provoking. Perhaps the history of science is merely an accumulation of ideas which we are deceived into thinking have consistency and meaning. Not such a new idea in light of The Matrix, but challenging when read as a serious idea rather than watched for entertainment.The premise for this book is that the math's and physics that has so richly informed our picture of the natural world also suggests that many 'other' universes exist. In some cases this is relatively well founded, whilst in others it is more tenuous. String theory, for all the popularity it has had, has not been easy to 'prove' for phenomena in this universe, so extrapolation to others is a stretch. Not that Greene is trying to suggest otherwise. All along he points out that these ideas are virtually impossible to verify, and may never be, but offers suggestions that could do so if the technology were available/possible. This was surprisingly readable. Considering that the ideas draw on some of the most advanced physics around - relativity, quantum mechanics, string, etc. - most of the content is descriptive and makes good use of analogy, illustrations, etc. to help get the pint across. I read most of the 'extra' material in each chapter and didn't find it hard going, although the notes only got a half look. Not that the content doesn't require some mind-stretching. Amidst the chapters is a very good description of the anthropic principle, and other notes (such as how big the universe is) which were not perhaps new, but freshly told. Liked it."

After having read ""The Elegant Universe"" and ""Fabric of the Cosmos,"" I was pretty pumped to pick this up. I liked the start; felt that it was solid, recapping some of his previous work and getting the reader boned up on the knowledge that they will need to push through the entirety of the book. And then he just started going down rabbit hole after rabbit hole. This book (and all other Greene books) was supposed to be for the lay reader and those who have a neophyte's understanding of theoretical physics. So why all the jumping around? He's just starting on what new advancement's have been made on Brane/M Theory and then he's rushing off to the Planck length and black holes and the mathematics and conceptualizing of the Quilted Universe and then there's the Swiss Cheese Universe concept and oh-my-goodness-I'm-listening-to-this-on-audiobook-and-can't-hardly-even-stop-the-disc. On one hand, it's very much my fault for choosing the medium that I did to experience this work (i.e., audio). On the other, subject matter vacillated so quickly that who could keep up with it? Where both of his other books were concrete, this one alluded me on so many levels as to relegate it to forgettable status.I agree with other reviewers. To a physicist, this is surely so simple as to be almost a waste of their time. To the lay reader, it's quite difficult, giving you nothing more than a mental concept...a hard to grasp one at that...with the details being, what I would call, riff-raff. Kind of sad that I spent the time listening to it. Should have read it instead. All I remember is the first 4 or 5 discs and the last one, and that's simply not good enough. "
249,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1635942-kyle-wright,4,"I'm a big Brian Greene fan and eagerly anticipated reading this book. While most of my high expectations were met, there were a few unavoidable downsides as well. First of all, I appreciated how this book challenged my notions about the universe we live in and how it plays out in the largest sense of the cosmos. There are many interesting theories, each one superbly explained with Greene's keen ability to distill highly complex ideas down to the essential and widely accessible core principles. Even though the ideas are understandable by those with only moderate scientific inclination, I never feel like Greene is talking down to us or dumbing things down too far. The many theories make for an interesting read on possible configurations for the universe(s), but at the same time also offer the greatest weakness as well.It's fun to imagine space as explained by Greene. I was disappointed -not by Greene or his writing- but by the lack of conclusiveness that these theories bring. While they each offer intriguing and applicable mathematical possibilities, the fact that some, almost all, or even none of them may be correct led me to feel that everything I had just learned might be nothing more than fantasy. At some point in the future, we may be able to determine which one, if any theory, is correct. But for now my curiosity remains insatiated by this gaping hole. It's not the author's fault, but merely a product of the material being covered.I almost gave this a five star review, but the lack of answers left me feeling that the book was unable to fulfill what I had been looking for. Curse my curiosity! If I could, I would have given it 4 1/2 stars, as it fell just short of giving me what I had hoped for."
250,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1528196-joe,4,"This is Science light. Which means by staying away from the math and the deeper technicalese Greene gave us a book penetrable by the average reader. It is a tour of the many branches of modern physics which independently, or together, lead to the possiblity that this universe is not unique. Some suggest that it may not even be all that special. The great center piece is, of course, M-theory, the grand union of string and particle theory that practically mandates there be multiple universes. Greene reminds us that this is only part of the story though when he takes us on a tour of recognized but dismissed for decades multiple-universe implications of relativity and quantum physics that are now being rethought.Pros: Clear desriptions supported by good, clever real-world analogies to help you through the counterintuitive stuff. A bit of playful humor, and an eye toward storytelling. Diagrams that are actually useful. (A rarity in science books for the layman.) Discussion of just how testable some of these theories are (sone highly), with the recognition that to the extent that some cannot currently be tested they amountto mere speculation.Cons: Padding. In chapter 10 Greene considers possibilities drawn less from science than philosphy, making them dubious content in a book about science. Stuff not born of the implications or mathematics of a theory based on observation, but of the pure imagination. Barely justifiable I suppose in that they include the kinds of speculation some readers already have.But the cons are a small thing in an otherwise highly informative and readily digestible book. It's an excellent layman's guide to modeern multiple universe theories."
251,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7318157-amy,2,"Finished The Hidden Reality [audiobook] the other day, but have to say it wasn't my favorite of reads. The book is all about different theories of the 'multiverse' and/or the existence of infinitely parallel universes. I've heard of the idea before, and while I think it's fun to play with mentally, I do feel like it seems like a distraction from more testable physics. I do like that Greene does try to present the controversies, though personally, I felt like his defense was a bit weak. It's hard too, because I certainly appreciate that Greene is trying to boil down huge current theories in physics into something that a layman could read...but the problem with that is always that I come away feeling like I don't have enough expertise to really test the merits of his argument, despite his explanations. I love making things accessible, but I wonder sometimes if it's dangerous to make things accessible if the average person remains unequipped to really judge your points adequately. A tension that exists in many areas of life, I haven't yet figured out what the best way to balance things are.I will say that I do appreciate his analogies, he has a knack for teaching things, though to be sure he oversimplifies them at times. He does seem honest about the limitations of things though, and I appreciate that he does attempt to sketch out where controversy exists, etc. He didn't have to do that, and the fact that he did adds some credibility. I also feel like this was a book I should've read in hard copy, because when you get distracted in an audiobook, it's hard to 'go back a page'...and I definitely know I missed a few things sometimes for that reason, which is difficult in a book on a topic as complex as this.smile emoticon"
252,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14073277-marc-bynum,0,"Greene does it once again. While this book is a little deeper than his previous on the same subjects, it is still easily digestible and I recommend it."
253,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24970-michelle,4,"For a mathematician and theoretical physicist, Greene is particularly adept at explaining not only the essentials of relativity and string theory but also more general ideas (such as the assertion that science's ""core mandate"" is to find regularities on the workings of the universe) to mass consumption audiences. Although some more well-read readers may complain that he spends too much time rehashing high school physics (like Newton's laws), average readers will probably find Greene's writing a good mix of facts they should remember from school and completely new theoretical physics concepts (new at least to the book's intended non-string-theorist audience).I've read parts of Greene's other books, and I always really want to enjoy them (because he's an engaging writer), but find that it's hard to get past his unwavering commitment to string theory -- which he admits is still, after decades of research, still just a mathematical exercise (numbers on a page). His latest book attempts to present other possibilities of multiverse scenarios besides just those based on sting theory, and the breadth of possibilities he lays out and explains makes for an interesting read. This is not an academic text filled with math. However, it can be dense and even boring at times (chapter seven, for example, can probably be skipped)... If you have even a passing interest in multiple universes, you'll probably get something out of this book, but it takes some persistence to get through it cover to cover. Pick out the interesting bits -- Greene usually provides sufficient recaps to allow readers to skip from chapter to chapter without too much confusion."
254,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1009562-moonglum,4,"This book is filled with trippy, speculative science and is quite fun. I remember when I was 7, I was at the observatory with my dad, and while looking at an orrery I wondered, naturally, if that is kind of what the solar system looks like. It probably looks something like that, I thought, and it sits in the milky way, which I can see a picture that describes what it looks like, and the milky way sits in the local group and I can picture a group of galaxies that includes the milky way and the Andromeda galaxy, and that sits in the universe, what does the whole universe look like? My dad was kind of a prankster, and so, not actually knowing the answer (this was in like 1969, so really it was not well known at that point, though I recall several years later being able to find some astronomy books that contained the dots on the balloon demo of the expanding universe), he told me that Einstein says that the universe looks like a key. It took me a couple years to figure out that there is no way that could be true.Anyway, if one wants to read something about the bleeding edge research as to what everything looks like, this is a good, non-technical book that presents many fun, mind expanding, scientific theories for one's consideration and amusement. Included: the quilted multiverse (universes beyond our cosmic horizon) the inflationary multiverse (little bubbles of collapsed regions of the hypothetical inflation field), the quantum multiverse (the cat lives in the universe next door), brane theory, the cyclic multiverse, and the ultimate,ate ensemble of all universes with a mathematics. No mention of Amber, The Courts of Chaos, or Tanelorn, however."
255,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1292978-steve,4,"This was not the easiest of the Brian Greene books to read, but then it was a grand tour of the bleeding edge of physics, all told without Math. You have to expect that there would be some stop, go back, read that again moments in there, and there were. There were fewer references to pop culture icons this time around, and if felt like those ommisions must have been because someone complained about Simpsons references not belonging in a serious book or something. There were missed to some degree, and if felt like he was working a lot harder to explain things without them.The base subject of the book itself is mind altering: Like licking the cover and finding it laced with LSD. For weeks and weeks ager I have returned to think about what I read, and consider it more closely. I went on a total mind candy bender while I processed all the possibilities of the Multiverse.Mr. Greene is quite clear about the theoretical nature of all of it, but at the end we have 9 different, not mutually exclusive multiverses! If one were a betting person, it seems likely that even if all 9 are not correct, than at least some of them are, at least in some significant part, and in a way that is comforting. Knowing that, at the end of this 4+ dimensional universe, we are only at the beginning. There is way way way more.In my next incarnation, or in the next universe over, I hope I am a math wiz and can understand all the things that went into making this book that I do not know or understand without the math here/now."

It does belong to that genre, but as it progresses, we find the book taking deeper look than others, explaining different types of multiverses theorized by current research in physics. The most interesting discussion I found, is the fact that as cutting edge physics research is breaking final frontiers of knowledge, it is entering a realm where its theoretical predictions are impossible to put to experiment. As multiverse by definition means, other universes, which are impossible to interact with, any theory predicting them cannot really be put to test(though there may be indirect hints making our belief in particular theory stronger or weaker). Yet, as the book details chapter by chapter, almost all versions of string theory and some interpretations of quantum theory give a strong hint of other universes out there.The most fascinating of all facts is how Second Law of Thermodynamics seems to be obeyed even inside Black Holes and how this fact provides a strong hint of parallel universe.From philosophical standpoint, it seems Brian Greene believes in broader role of physics, that is to 'really' explain all phenomenon. This seems to be different (in my limited understanding), from Bohr's position of not speaking much about what reality is, just speaking about what we observe reality to be(and probably no objective reality even exists). A fascinating read."
257,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,2,"Though I am finding myself struggling to write a coherent review of this book, I can at least take comfort in the fact that there is another person, named Brad, in another parallel universe who has an account on Goodreads, who just read this book but perhaps, unlike me, can faithfully recapitulate what he just read. I cannot. I am trying hard enough not to smash my head on the counter.This was heavy. And I am a huge fan of Brian Greene. He has the rare ability to take complex theoretical physics and make them easily accessible and digestible. But, despite his best attempts this time around, my head still could not escape a thorough physics-induce butt kicking. Delving into the highly, highly, highly speculative subject of multiple universes ‚Äì a subject, it turns out, that requires the most abstract concepts of physics and math in order to understand ‚Äì Greene is at least forgiving enough to relegate the math to the notes section and offers the reader the opportunity to just skip ahead lest that reader throw himself into the fire. Didn‚Äôt really lighten the load for we readers in this universe all that much. The idea that is space is infinite, then patterns are necessarily destined to repeat made the most sense to me; it required nothing more than a grasp of infinity. After that, all bets are off.

The book is basically a theoretical physicists wet dream with its talk of the Many Worlds Multiverse, the Bubble Universe and it‚Äôs infinite possibilities, and everything else imaginable that needs to exist to make the math of string theory work (and Greene assures us that in this universe the math of string theory holds true as long as we simplify enough and remember to carry the ones).Anyway, this is a reasonably well written book with interesting concepts that show how theoretically we are not just all vibrating strings, but rather vibrating strings in 11 dimensions of infinite shapes across infinite worlds. So as you are reading this, there is another you (or infinite yous) in another universe (or infinite universes) actually writing this review yourself and I am the one reading it. I find the whole thing a bit preposterous, even if the math works (for now), but since this review won a Pulitzer in at least one of the infinite worlds of the multiverse, I guess I will accept string theory and the Many Worlds hypothesis for the time being."

Unfortunately, in this universe, I read this book and had moments of clarity and near-infinite understanding which were quickly dashed and replaced with confusion and vacant looks. Holographic multiverses and uncertainty waves in quantum measurements makes my brain hurt. Greene does provide a good survey of the many theories expounded by string theory and others into the possible nature of parallel universes. I think the most compelling possibilities were: 1) the quilted universe - if the universe is nearly infinite with finite components, then a finite number of patterns exist. Having a solar system and an earth and evolved life could just as easily crop up somewhere else) 2) brane multiverse - our universe exists in 3-dimensional brane which floats among other higher-dimensional branes (other parallel universes). Unfortunately our brian only processes data in 3 space so we are unable to access the other universes. (In string/M-theory's braneworld scenario) Simply put, multiple universes could exist but Greene is skeptical. And since, in the end, none of this makes any difference to my life, I too am skeptical. (but three cheers to the string theory scientists who continue to toil away at this philosophy)I would put this back on my list of books to re-read one day, unfortunately I don't think I will gain any more insight than what I already have.

The result is that rare accomplishment in science writing for a popular audience: a volume that explains the science and its consequences while stimulating the imagination of even the uninitiated. --Jason Kirk"
261,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5854740-john-harder,4,"There is a reason this book is called The Hidden Reality. I read this entire book, I was interested all the way through and if you asked me now what the hell he was talking about I would say, ‚ÄúI have no idea.‚Äù Whatever he was trying to say will remain forever past my grasp. I understand some of the science but my mind is too limited to truly grasp grand ideas.Greene spends a lot of time talking about the size and potential shapes of the universe (or even the possibility of multiple universes). Indeed if the universe is infinite (also there is some jabbering about finite matter in infinite space and it implications ‚Äì at this point I would grab a glass of wine and watch Sponge Bob) mathematically it is also absolutely certain that there are an infinite number of copies of all of us. This means some meathead that who has my identical DNA is writing this same review somewhere. And apart from the compensating factor of his astonishingly good looks, he also is too inferior to comprehend this book.Though my brain is in the cognitive equivalent of a ‚Äúswirly‚Äù right now, I still recommend this book for a couple of reasons. One, perhaps you likely have more functioning neurons that I do and understand this stuff. And Two, now I can blather on about string theory and the quantum calculating power that exist on the edge of black holes‚Ä¶while having no idea what I am talking about. "
262,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33492449-chris,5,"Quite simply, this book blew my mind. I was utterly unprepared for the slew of multiverse theories Brian Greene would inevitably put forward, detailing the big picture physics of holographic, Matrix-like, quantum, and virtual realities, among others. I'm not being dramatic when I say that there were times when the ideas presented by Greene were so mind bending I thought it unwise to read before bed! Some of my favorite passages of this nature occurred within the last two chapters or so.Brian Greene's first book, the Elegant Universe, was the book that began my love affair with physics. Greene has a unique knack for taking some of the most complex ideas conceived in all of human history, and making them understandable for just about anyone willing to think. And while Greene is clearly an ardent proponent of string theory, he very carefully lays out both the positive and negative aspects of each theory, and how they might be supported experimentally.For the more advanced physics readers, Greene includes endnotes with equations for quantum mechanics, relativity, etc. It is up to the reader how far to delve into each topic. This is the type of book you'll want to read slowly, as to digest each passage. From a physics perspective, it is more complex and ""heavier"" than both the Elegant Universe and Fabric of the Cosmos. I cannot stress enough the importance of setting a slow, deliberate pace. Following this strategy to the end, I was astounded by the result."
263,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35247389-alejandro-ramirez,5,"Standing on the edge of the latest discoveries on string theory, quantum physics and cosmology, this books probes into an area that used to be mere speculation: parallel universes.The result? Reality could be much stranger than any fiction in this world... and this universe. Fuelled by a series of Nova episodes (The elegant Universe, The Fabric of Cosmos), and a couple of books, 2012 re-sparked my always lingering interest in physics. This one answers (well, kind of) some of of most basic haunting questions: such as is the universe finite or infinite? what is the shape of it? I struggle wit the idea of limitless and yet finite on 3 dimensions (I'm ok with it on 2 and the ballon surface analogy).I think I finally get the multiverse theory based on the inevitable repetition based on a finite (however large) arrangement of elements, if those rearrangements are infinite. And even just glancing at the implications you have to wonder:Is living a multiverse the most significant or the most irrelevant discovery ever? I pondered this with Leon Marchebout on a terrace in Providencia, Guadalajara, and I concur that the answer is: both. Objectively, it can't have any effect in my life, or the life of my great, great, great grandchildren, or anyone I'll ever know. But we're subjective beings, and it does make a difference.I, subjectively declare, that physicist's inference of Multiverse, is the most life altering concepts ever, and it just occurred in our lifetime."
264,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/134043-steven,3,"While it's possible that, given its terrestrial evolution, the human brain is only just able to comprehend the concepts laid out in The Hidden Reality, I still have to wonder that there may have been a clearer way to put forth those concepts to the reading public. Brian Greene is certainly game, as any good science teacher must be, for any and all manner of descriptions and analogies to illustrate ideas this exotic. But in looking for a way to make physics this otherworldly relatable, maybe he tries a bit too hard (or maybe the ideas are too hard) because his metaphors too often only barely translate the complexity and are sometimes, in his rare attempts to use pop culture, clumsy or distracting.Still, when Greene is successful in pinning down parts of these theories for us to see, the results are provocative, even transportive. Maybe this reveals my established interest in the subject but I found much of it, even the confusing parts, to be engaging. Greene's tone is not of a lecturer giving us rote directions but of someone who is trying to navigate these twisted paths along with us. The reader almost gets the sense he believes that if he can get us to understand these theories without the math, then that on its own will partially validate the mathematical work itself. That wouldn't be true of course, nor could he really believe it, but the attitude is appreciated."
265,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8709707-melissa-sohayda,3,"This book offers a pretty dense overview of modern theoretical concepts about string theory, multiple universes, holographic universes, quantum multiple universes and computer generated universes. At the offset Greene explains that the book will provide information for a variety of readers- and suggests that the more well-read reader should skip past areas that are beneath her, while the lay reader can stop whenever she becomes saturated. The first couple of chapters rehash historical cosmology, the following chapters move into developments in science (though nothing really ‚Äúnew‚Äù to be told), before eventually delving into the speculative science. The speculative concepts could be considered mind-blowing, but many have gone a bit too far down the rabbit hole for me. I felt as though there were too many instances where Greene suggested that I ‚Äútake a pass,‚Äù when in reality I was hoping for something more concrete or based in hard science to help ground it. I enjoy having my notions of the universe being challenged, but there was just not enough substance in many of the later chapters. At times it felt simply like he was just presenting mental concepts and this detracted from the overall authority of the book. The first half of the book is worthwhile for historical info and current M-theory explanations, but you can get this elsewhere. Overall the book was a disappointment. "
266,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/975391-steven,3,"I just finished this book and my brain hurts.I had read a previous book of Greene's and my memory told me that I had followed it pretty well. Now I'm not so sure. This is a pretty dense book to get through. It left me feeling like I don't know anything about the universe(s) around me. Greene looks at various and theories and ideas about the possibility of other universes existing outside (or within, or near) or own. He covers nine variations, from one's that lead from quantum and string theory, to ones that are much more conjectural. He does a good job of explaining, even if I didn't always do a good job of understanding. Good illustrations throughout help explain. Although he gives readers much appreciated permission to jump ahead to sections if they don't want to know how the quantum sausage is made, I gave it a shot anyways. I always felt I was right on the edge of grasping the concept, but not quite.Which is kind of where Greene says physicists and mathematicians find themselves in their quest to determine the existence of parallel universes through equation and experimentation. Overall, this is a great explanation of the scientific state of the art on this topic. Read carefully and with an open mind. It's pretty interesting stuff."
267,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4481375-jeffrey-rasley,5,"Brian Greene is one of the most brilliant minds in America (and the world). He has a gift, like Stephen Hawking, of makiing the incomprehensible comprehensible. He is one of our foremost theoretical physicists and a proponent of string theory. I was privileged to meet him several years ago in Washington D.C. and was impressed with his cordiality and easy manner. So, I've enjoyed ""The Elegant Universe"" and now ""The Hidden Reality"". The concepts presented are very difficult for Humanities majors, especialy ones who didn't take upper level Physics or Math. I read the book very slowly, only a few pages per sitting. Light bulbs went on regularly as I grasped the ideas Greene was describing, which support the likelihood of multiple universes, possibly an infinity of universes.One of my favorite pieces in the book is the possibility that we are living in a simulated universe within a computer program. If humans are able to simulate universes within computer programs in our future, and we are closing in on that possibility. Then, if there are many other universes, it is likely that creatures more advanced than we are have done so in the past. And that means we could be their simulation. If you are a sim, you would have no way of knowing it. Yikes!"
268,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28996386-barrett,5,"Thought provoking and sometimes downright jaw dropping. Greene presents a case for why modern developments in physics may imply the existence of various different kinds of multiverses. His scientific explanations were difficult, but in my opinion, easier than Stephen Hawkings'. He has a great gift for using familiar analogies to explain concepts impossible to visualize, such as the 9 spatial dimensions of string theory, or quantum tunneling events. It turns out certain conceptions of a multiverse are a natural progression of some well established scientific theories such as quantum mechanics. Even more surprising is that nearly all of Greene's multiverses may someday be supported or contradicted by experimental evidence. Only one proposed multiverse he discusses is forever removed from any potential observation by principle. Before reading this book I had always thought of a multiverse as an obscure and unnecessary concept evoked arbitrarily by scientists for philosophical reasons. Greene managed to really shake my views by explaining that actual scientific principles give rise to various views of a multiverse. Our world is truly an amazing place that seems to become larger and more astounding with every generation of scientific advances. "
269,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33225119-carolina-nunez,4,"I read this book for the ""Deep Laws of the Cosmos"" part of the title and not so much for the ""Parallel Universes"" part of the title. The book takes each potential parallel universe theory at a time and explains the physics behind each theory. For the most part, this results in a fairly good (though very basic) summary of quantum physics, gravity, relativity, string theory. However, sometimes the discussion of the physical laws (quantum probability, for example) gets divided between two or among several chapters instead of being cohesively presented together. This, of course, is because some aspects of the theory are necessary for the particular version of parallel universes being discussed in that chapter, while other aspects are necessary to other versions of parallel universe theories. I would have preferred a more cohesive exposition of the physical laws and a little less discussion of parallel universes. But that probably means I should have read a different book. And I think I will. That being said, I thought Brian Greene did a good job of making difficult theories and principles accessible. In fact, when I choose another book like this, I'll look for Brian Greene's name."
270,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5526063-mary-jean-harris,5,"I enjoyed this book a lot, and it is really comprehensive in all the different options for parallel universes and the multiverse that it discusses. Although it was a general overview, they go into enough detail so that I actually learned a lot of new things from reading this. I especially thought the author's discussion about inflation and simulated universes were particularly well done.I found it was advanced enough to make it challenging to read at some parts, but it was also written clearly so it wasn't too difficult. The author writes very well and you can tell that he's really interested in the topics he's discussing. It definitely brings up many interesting questions about our universe and its place within a greater multiverse, and although we aren't in a position to answer those questions now, the author has really set the stage in where things are headed and new views we can take when developing theories."
271,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3780769-bill-h,4,"I love reading Greene's stuff, even though I haven't a prayer of following the underlying math anymore. And he makes that, thankfully, unnecessary (unless you really want to dig into the footnotes).In this volume, he explains the concepts behind a wide variety of ""parallel universe"" hypotheses -- most of which I hadn't heard of before. I came to the book with the notion that it would treat just the famous (but nearly ""traditional"") Many Worlds hypothesis based on quantum mechanics, but that's just one of many examples here.I do think that the reader benefits from having read Greene's earlier books (or otherwise holding a layman's familiarity with the bare outlines of relativity, quantum mechanics, and string and inflation theory). Still, his explanations are quite clear for the purpose, his illustrations apt, and even his sillier examples are helpful.One minor gripe is that the inclusion of computer-based virtual worlds in his taxonomy seems a bit out of place, though the subject itself is of no small interest to me. All the other hypothetical parallel world systems stem from more basic physical concepts.For those interested in such things: recommended!"
272,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3152575-bob,4,"My background is mathematics and computer science with a fondness for cosmology and physics. I religiously watch the various science programs on PBS, the Science Channel, etc with their cursory overview of specific topics. Often they only rehash the same personalities with the same information from the last show I watched, which simply whets my appetite for more information. The Elegant Universe was the last of Greene's work I read, so chose The Hidden Reality for my latest science foray.Overall I found the work very approachable. His descriptions of string theory, branes, quantum mechanics, extra dimensions, and entropy were all accessible bringing the varied multiverse theories to life. Granted my brain did glaze over whilst working my way through the section on probability wave functions - but who's doesn't?! It even gave Einstein the willies... The one drawback is the overemphasis of Cosmological Inflation. But perhaps I only felt that because of the recent Scientific American essay authored by one Inflation's cocreators reconsidering the theory itself?But what does it all matter when we are just living in a simulation?"
273,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11263068-eric-chevlen,2,"  Meh. This book is, as the author readily acknowledges, long on speculation and short on evidence. The many universe theory is a charming, unexpected, but ultimately jejune interface of cosmology and metaphysics. The hard core science which drives the speculation cannot be explained without high level math. Those who can understand that math won't be satisfied with this book,which tries to accomplish such explanations without it. They should read the primary sources. Those who cannot understand the higher math will find the authors efforts here disappointing. Ultimately, I set the book down having completed only two-thirds of it. To end with some positive points: The author clearly knows his subject matter, and distinguishes between what is known and what is speculative. He gives a fair comparison of various theories which are all compatible with the current observational and experimental findings.One of the implications of the multiverse theory is that somewhere out there, there is a nearly identical duplicate of you, in fact an infinite number of them, and some of them, instead of reading this review, are just now finishing writing it. As I have."
274,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7541671-ariadna73,4,Check out what I wrote in my blog: http://lunairereadings.blogspot.com/2...10-13-2011: Finished finally! Not very easy to understand; but very nice to read. I finished it with big effort; but I don't think that I got a lot of the things he said. However; I am looking forward to reading something else of this author in the near future.08-05-2011: I am trying hard to keep up with all the equations and mathematical explanations; but I have been about to give up. However; somewhere around chapter five; the author gave me the opportunity to skip some pages; and I did promptly and found out that the next set of pages was very entertaining and understandable. In sum; I am still struggling with this; but not yet abandoned it.I am still in the process of reading this book. It has been a nice surprise to be able to understand and follow the author's line of thought. He tries to prove that there are parallel universes; and that there are more than the three dimensions that we are used to live in.
275,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/716844-danny,3,"I read this because I've always wanted to know more about the theories behind parallel universes and I thoroughly enjoyed Greene's Elegant Universe. I find string theory and physics fascinating. Now, the concept of the holographic universe seems intriguing, especially reading this after the Holographic Universe. Now, I have a better mathematical understanding of how the holographic universe theory was constructed, translating information between the math of quantum mechanics and relativity.Hmm. Elegant Universe was better than this in my opinion. There were parts of this text that got so deeply theoretical that I became discombobulated and disinterested. Then, the idea struck me. Why am I even reading about speculative theories about alternate universes that will never be possible to examine? All of these different types of possible universes seem too much for me right now. It's just solving puzzles with math and explaining mathematical anomalies. Wait...we might be in a simulated, Matrix-type universe? Perhaps, these ideas are interesting and just need to settle in my caffeine addled brain."
276,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5268904-david-hammond,4,"Brian Greene writes about difficult scientific concepts much better than most scientists who attempt to do so. A lot of the ideas in this book -- inflation, the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, the holographic principle -- I have heard about before but feel that I understand much better after reading this book. Well, of course I would understand them better after repeated explanations, but Greene has a way of writing for the layperson without seeming to dumb down the material. He mainly does this through a steady stream of analogies and colorful illustrations, while being careful to often point out the limitations of such approximate imagery.Many people may be turned off by Greene's focus on string theory. He gives a rather exhaustive defense of the scientific merits of the continued pursuit of string theory absent the imminent ability of string theory to generate any testable hypotheses. The entire book is about theories of parallel universes, many of which by definition cannot generate testable hypotheses. He confronts head-on the question of whether theories such as these qualify as science, and gives what to me is a convincing argument that they do."
277,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5454980-erica,3,"So, if you're the average person who enjoys learning the latest in science, and want to feel completely stupid, this is the book for you. I mean, obviously it's readable, because I read it - and enjoyed a lot of it! - but about 10% of it felt like it was completely out of my reach. So it was like seeing a puzzle that was 90% done. You get what it's supposed to be and where they're going with it, but it lacks clarity. It didn't help that every once in a while he would say, ""the next couple of paragraphs get really complicated so feel free to skip to the next section."" ""Yeah right"", I would think, ""I'm no dummy. This isn't my first popular science book, after all."" So I would read it. And get completely lost. I didn't even attempt to read the notes at the end.That being said, I found the topic fascinating and if you're ok with only understanding most of it, I would highly recommend it. I'll probably be reading Greene's other books. Because I'm a glutton for punishment. Or because I'm hoping that the more I read it, the better I'll be able to understand it. But something tells me that the only way I'll understand these books is to take a couple of courses in quantum mathematics..."
278,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1919854-mark,4,"I liked the overviews of where science is with things like string theory, quantum mechanics. Of course, you can't have those things without extra dimensions. Here's the best description of extra dimensions I've read yet - I felt I could almost grasp the idea for a minute before it unraveled in my head. Usually I just have to read through an author's description, then set it aside and say 'okay - let's just say there are extra dimensions'. This is valuable, because another big focus of the book is to discuss how theoretical physics keeps coming back to the idea of multiple universes. Greene steps through how several different multiverse theories have come about, how they work, and how they might / might not one day be tested. There's even a good discussion of a simulated universe. I'm going to admit that I got lost in the underlying details a few times, and did skim a section or two, but the themes of the book kept me on it. For those with a more solid physics foundation, there are lot's of notes for getting more deeply into the mathematics behind the topics."
279,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2426776-nate-solberg,3,"Whew, this was a load! I enjoy reading Brian Greene's books, because they're filled with an awful lot of ""blow your mind"" moments. He does a great job of bringing his content to the masses, in a way that we can appreciate if not fully grasp. I have to say that there was a lot of material through the middle that I really had to work through. As always, he gives you the overview and then offers you the free pass of skipping to the next section if you think it might be a little technical. And, as always, I decline the offer and take it on. In the end, I'm glad I did. The prospect of infinite space implying infinite copies of me writing this review is so interesting, and I loved the chapter on simulated universes as well. This book makes you work for it, but perhaps that's why the payoff is worthwhile. I don't know if I'd last a week in one of his classes, but Brian Greene would probably be an interesting guy if you wanted to enjoy a cold one and be amazed at what's out there for us to discover."
280,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17131437-peter,5,"The idea of parallel universes began with Everett Young, a graduate student whose thesis in quantum theory argued that the collapse of the Schrodinger probability wave upon measurement was not really a collapse: measuring a quantum state didn't just cause all states other than the one observed to disappear. Instead, Young argued, on observing a quantum system the universe splits so that each quantum state exists in one of the new universes. You, the observer, are in the universe where the outcome you see exists, and there are other YOUs that see the other outcomes.This was a very mysterious theory. Where are all these other universes? If you throw a die why should ""reality"" split into six different universe, one for each possible number of pips? It was considered quackery. But modern physics has increasingly accepted the idea, and Brian Greene--a real physicist and an outstanding writer--tells us how and why.For those interested in quantum physics and cosmology, this will be a great book. I certainly enjoyed it. It is the best exposition that I have read."
281,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21422614-alex-acton,5,"Two perspectives here. First, this book is phenomenal if you want to understand the ways in which physics and math suggest multiple/parallel universes. Second, you better get ready to give your brain a workout.The book is written for a largely general audience, so you don't need more than a passing familiarity with the concepts to get by. That said, even to provide a cursory overview of some of the topics requires mind bendingly complicated shifts in perception. Every think about all of reality as existing on a ""flat"" geometrical figure floating through a larger space? Well, get ready to, because the math says so. And that in the end is the question you're left with. Is reality just mathematics? Or is math simply a description of the fundamental reality that let's us make sense of what we see? I don't know. I'm moving on to Tegmark's 'The Mathematical Universe' next to try and make up my mind. Despite the deep metaphysical confusion I've been left with, if you're looking for a really good mind-wrinkling book, this is it."
282,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59252999-roo-phillips,4,"Brian Greene is one of the best writers in popular physics. This book, The Hidden Reality, is no exception. Greene is a master at giving relatable analogies to explain some of the most difficult concepts in modern physics. The only drawback in this novel is the detail. At times, Greene will get overly bogged down in details that aren't necessary for grasping the overall concept. However, to his credit, he often does warn you in advance of delving into mathematical complexity.In short, this book suggests several possible parallel universes that emerge from theories in modern physics. Basically, the math that describes some proposed theory (like inflationary cosmology) brings along with it interesting solutions and possibilities (like a parallel universe). Right now, there is very little in the realm of parallel universes that can even begin to be explored observationally or experimentally. But that doesn't mean we should't consider it. Math has precipitated discovery many times in the past, and it will likely continue to lead us into the future."

The Hidden Reality is a great book for the layperson interested in physics and cosmology and the brain-bending theories that are at the leading edge. Greene starts by taking us through the centuries of theories and discoveries that got us to the science of today and then explains the implications of advanced physics in the various theories regarding the existence of a multiverse.While some of the theories are hard to grasp, Brian Greene is able to provide sign posts and descriptions using objects and ideas that are familiar to allow the reader/listener to take the mental leap into the unfamiliar ideas presented. This seems like material that can be revisited over time to clarify concepts as dictated by the reader‚Äôs interest.Audiobook VersionUnabridged / 13 hrs 48 minNarrator: Brian GreenePublisher: Books on TapeRelease: 01.25.11"
284,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4322334-jim,4,"This book was both entertaining and yet had a few parts that were very hard to get through. It's like a more readable and entertaining version of a Stephen Hawking book, in which the author attempts to explain complex theories of quantum mechanics, the big bang, and advance mathematics, while trying to render it approachable for the reader. He even invokes Cartman from Southpark to explain energy potentiality. That part was pretty odd! The author teaches physics at Columbia University, and is well-known for his work on String theory. He's appeared on PBS many times, and has been on Letterman a couple of times. An interesting side-note in the book is how discoveries in theoretical physics are leading to breakthroughs in Mathematics (e.g. complex 'Manifolds'). He also goes into parallel universes and probability theories, perhaps the most compelling aspect of the book. Worth reading if you're even remotely interested in this stuff."
285,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1843249-aaron,2,"I was so excited to pick up the latest Brian Greene book; after devouring ""The Elegant Universe"" and ""Fabric of the Cosmos,"" I was certain that I would do the same here. I was mistaken. Without belaboring the point, two features of this book caused my interest to wane extremely quickly. First, there seemed to be an inordinate amount of ""free-pass"" statements from Mr. Greene. After the third time of reading ""If you are reaching saturation, feel free to skip this entire chapter,"" I began to wonder if he had somewhat lost his previously uncanny ability to explain complex topics in a way that negated the desire to skip ahead. Second, nearly every ""revelation"" in this book followed up with the caveat that while it might be true, we don't (and may never have) the ability to prove it. The book quickly went from cutting-edge research to conversation points designed to sell a book. Overall, very disappointing."
286,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3346363-matt-heavner,3,"This was a parallel look at parallel universes. (Sorry for the poor attempt at a pun, but it the book does go through nine different visions of the multiverse.) The author seemed to recognize that this might be a bit too technical (his words) or too detailed (my view). He referred several times to the method that the chapters are written in a overview -> deeper and deeper discussion so when you get ""sick of it""/over-your-head the reader can just skip to the beginning of the next chapter. I found that there was too much detail on topics that someone who is likely to read this type of book has probably already gotten or read elsewhere. The specific example I remember was going over the double-slit. But then the logical story built on the ""re-run"" was pretty good. Overall, I enjoyed the ""a bit too wordy/detailed"" look at the multi-verse. I liked Greene's other books more, but this was still solid."
287,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182024-dan,5,"This book is more a flight of fancy for Greene than The Elegant Universe or the Fabric of the Cosmos. In those books he spent a lot more time explaining the fundamentals of Einstein‚Äôs theories and quantum mechanics as well as the reasoning behind string theory and some of string theory‚Äôs more immediate implications. Here, Greene relies on string theory to an equal degree as he does astronomy, simple logic, and philosophy to advance nine different arguments for believing that there are universes different than the one we are currently inhabiting and observing. He does an excellent job explaining complicated concepts in a way that is somewhat understandable to someone who does not have a background in theoretical physics, but even so some of his arguments simply seem like thought experiments that will never either be proven or disproven. I enjoyed the book and if you‚Äôre looking for something that considers the world and the universe from a unique perspective it‚Äôs worth picking up. "

I dropped off a couple times and had to re-listen to a few sections. Diagrams would be useful. I might have given it 4 stars if I read it in paper. Still, a thought-provoking read, if a little meandering.I have seen in other reviews that this book is not recommended for people new to theoretical physics. I agree with this. I have read a number of popular science books in the field and I think it helped my understanding of Hidden Reality. That said, I think that Greene bounces between the relatively advanced (9 models of multiverse) to the relatively novice (objectivity of maths, mind-body dualism etc)Probably could've used a bit more ruthless editing. I appreciate how Greene has recommended ""skip ahead"" points, but I don't know who would feel confident in taking advantage of these."
289,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8281679-andrew,3,"I've enjoyed all of Brian Greene's books that attempt to explain deep topics of physics and cosmology to laymen like me. While not an exception, found this the most difficult to get through, largely because the topical matter (the existence of parallel universes) was so far over my head. My 1970s undergraduate physics classes enabled to follow most of the items in his earlier works, but the concepts here are very difficult for the average person (ie, one like me without a grip on the deep math required for full understanding). Those with more recent and deeper scientific education may be able to appreciate this more than I can. That is, I greatly appreciate Mr. Greene's usually excellent ability to present deeply engaging topics in approachable language, but I couldn't quite get up to speed with this one.That said, I would highly recommend his earlier works (The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos) to just about anyone with an interest in this subject matter."
290,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5859124-paul-lunger,4,"What if the universe as we know it were only one of possibly many? That is the fundamental question behind this latest book by physicist Brian Greene. Greene takes a very simplistic approach to things as he explains how scientists believe that our universe is not alone on its own & also describes the theories behind possible alternate universes & what they might look like. In each subsequent chapter we go further & further in depth into the concepts behind each of these possible variations in the multiverse & experience numbers on both sides of an extraordinary scale. It helps that while you don't have to have a complete understanding of current studies in the world of astronomy, physics or cosmology to make this book make sense. No matter what the thought that there could be other versions of us out there somewhere is still fascinating & proving this will be even more fun. Definitely a read for any of us who've wondered if parallel realities exist."
291,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1191018-dale,2,"Speculative physics, described without the least whiff of mathematics, but with frequent mentions of the fact that the mathematics is actually very difficult, and that much of it is brand new.This is all about parallel universes, arising from string theory in about five different ways, from general relativity, from a particular interpretation of quantum mechanics, and from philosophy. Most of the string theory parallel universes seem to arise from the following argument:- here's a (mostly untestable) form of string theory.- you can apply a certain mathematical transformation to certain equations in this theory.- that transformation can be interpreted as representing a parallel universe.- therefore, the theory is compatible with the existence of parallel universes.- therefore, there might be parallel universes.Anyway, it's all vaguely interesting, but I didn't come away feeling that I had learned much."
292,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2615246-elgin,4,"This book has caused me to think a lot about my own existence as well as that of the rest of the universe.Why are we here? Where are we going? Is there something special about our reality (universe) or are we just one of some large number of realities? As always, Brian Greene does a very good job of explaining difficult concepts in physics for the lay man...and he supplements his discussions with endnotes for those who might want to know a little more. Greene discusses some of the amazing possible implications of various aspects of physics (inflationary cosmos, quantum mechanics, string theory, holographic projection) all of which might say deep things about our own reality or imply the existence of possibly infinitely many other realities that we will probably never get to observe. If you enjoy reading about physics and especially if you have a real sense of wonder about the universe we inhabit this is the book for you. In fact, its probably worth reading twice."
293,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13691498-michael,3,"Brian Greene is a very good writer, his explanations seem to reliably deal with just the objection I was about to raise. That does not, however, make him right - especially when it comes to parallel universes of the dozen or so flavors he describes in this book.Among the questions Greene raises along the way is the nature of mathematics. Why does math work so well to describe reality and is there a sense in which math is 'real'? There are numerous examples of mathematical formulations that came to be applied outside the realm of their initial conception and led to new physical insights. Special Relativity was developed on the idea that the math of Maxwell's electromagnetic field equations could be understood to imply that the speed of light was relative to everything. General Relativity predicted black holes and an expanding universe, neither of which was expected or even believed by Einstein. On the other hand, must we believe in tachyons?"
294,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8509871-liz,3,"Greene certainly has a gift for analogy. For a layman curious about the fringes of cosmology, this is a cool read. A few parts were pretty mind-blowing. I struggled more than I'd anticipated, having to go back and re-read quite a bit, but I would've regretted skipping parts or speed reading or bailing altogether. Rife with jokes only science nerds can make, Greene made topics like string theory and quantum mechanics approachable. Denser material was mitigated with historical stories about scientists and Greene's own childhood musings and adult epiphanies. His (M-theory) duality analogy was probably my favorite thing; he compared the versions of it to one of those optical illusion pictures that looks like one famous person up close, but another when you back up. So yeah, The Hidden Reality is a challenging read but shrewdly lays out awe-inspiring material, while somehow also being fun."
295,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1782604-jim-aker,4,"I can't say anything in this review that has not already been said dozens of times in the hundreds of reviews here. In microcosm, this is a well written account of some of the research being done on the bleeding edge of the physics of multiple universes. Like his other books Dr. Greene has written for the layman and tries, and in most cases succeeds in making difficult concepts relatively clear in layman's terms. But it is wise to keep in mind that almost all of what is being talked about in this volume is entirely theoretical. Some physicists do not agree with Dr. Greene's String Theorist approach.Still it is interesting to see the direction being taken by some of the great names in Cosmology and Quantum Physics. While there is little chance that any of this material will be proven through experimentation in our lifetime, the consideration of such concepts fires the imagination and stimulates the creative mind to consider realms well outside the box of everyday thought. "
296,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1401974-toby,3,"This book discusses a motley collection of about 9 different physical and philosophical notions of alternative universes. Some modern physical theories seem to admit the distinct possibility that the universe we live in is not the only one.Greene is a working physicist and so knows his stuff better than a typical science writer who can only re-hash abilities and descriptions heard from experts. His metaphors are lucid, original, and framed within pleasingly-written chains of argumentation.Yet I thought much of the book was quite dull. The last two chapters, in particular, were quite tedious. And chunks of earlier chapters were also well outside my interests; indeed, at a couple of points Greene helpfully suggests that some chunks of the book can be skipped.This book might be a good resource for science fiction writers who want to invoke alternate universes using sciency language."
297,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1066544-blair-conrad,3,"A bit of a letdown. Started out promising, with the trademark Greene conversational style and the relatively-interesting patchwork parallel universes. Somewhere toward the middle and the landscape multiverse, the book became quite plodding. I don't know if it's that the subject matter is just so dense that not even Greene can enliven it or what, but that section was a chore to get through.Eventually things got better, and we ended up on a higher note, so the book was not a complete loss. The discussion of Holograms and the Quantum Multiverse were interesting enough.I was pleasantly surprised to see the chapter on simulated universes, and the implications of same. It wasn't the sort of thing that came to mind when I heard of this book about parallel universes, but it was definitely worth consideration. "
298,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/861650-laura,4,"I've been reading this one in chunks for almost a year. It is incredible how something so completely non-technical can still be so _dense_. Greene has a true skill for taking extremely complicated material and translating it for a lay audience -- I actually felt like I was following well till it hit projections and black holes. He makes no effort to hide that his writing is biased towards his own philosophy and favorite theories, and I actually enjoyed a science writer who was so open about this fact. This is a great crash course in the current theories surrounding possible multiverses, by giving a clear snapshot of roughly where current physics stands, how the process of theoretical investigation works, and a humbling sense of just how much MORE there is to the topic than what is presented here. Be warned, despite being very much a popular science book, this is NOT a light read."
299,0307265633,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4370506-stephanie-evans,3,"Maybe it was a mistake to listen to the audio version of this book. In spite of Greene's surprisingly good reading voice (I almost never enjoy authors reading their own books--it's usually best left to the pros) and his lovely writing, this is what I got out of the book--there are very likely parallel universes and those may come in sundry forms. Greene did tell me why he believes this, I just don't understand a word of it. I mean, I understood each word taken individually,but the sentences and paragraphs? Not a clue. Now, I have no physics background beyond knowing that if I drop something, it's going to fall, so Greene was working with poor soil when he was reading to me. However, if Greene is right, then in one of his parallel universes, I totally grok his book--I could freaking teach his book."
