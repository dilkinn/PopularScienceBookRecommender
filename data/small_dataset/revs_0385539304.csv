There are definitely interesting aspects of the body, but I'm more of a ""fun fact here, quirky tidbit there"" kinda person. I wasn't sure I wanted to read a whole book full of words I can't pronounce. But, no, Bill Bryson really can make anything interesting.His usual charismatic, undemanding style is all over this book. He begins with the head and takes us all the way through the physiology of the human body. The organs, systems, various proteins and bacterium that I will never remember the name of. What really makes this interesting is that he links each part of the body in with the history of medicine and diseases relating to that part. He pulls out little anecdotes that shocked me, infuriated me, and often made me laugh. Bryson knows he isn't writing a book for medical professionals here. There's a certain amount of depth in some chapters, but it feels like a lot is probably skimmed over so us laymen can wrap our heads around the information. And, frankly, it wouldn't be nearly as readable if that wasn't the case.My one big takeaway from The Body is that we know almost nothing about the body. We know so much more than we did a hundred years ago, and yet we still know almost nothing. I swear that about ten times in every chapter, there's a comment like ""these cells do this, but nobody knows why"" or ""women are 10x more likely to get this disease than men, but why is anybody's guess"". I mean, we spend a third of our lives asleep and no one even knows why we do that.I like how Bryson looks at health and disease across the world and not just in the United States and Europe. Though the U.S. comes out of this looking even worse than I would have anticipated. Despite spending more on healthcare per person than any other country, U.S. citizens die younger and have higher rates of chronic disease, depression, drug abuse, homicide, and HIV than almost all (if not all) developed nations. There are a number of theories why, though no one knows for sure.If you like Bryson's previous books, you should like this one. It's pop science, and more fun than it is ground-breaking, but as long as you're not planning to use it as your handbook for experimental surgery, then I see nothing wrong with that.Facebook | Instagram"

2,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3268839-theresa-alan,5,"I learned so much from this book. One of the things I learned was that continuing to learn and keeping my brain active will help me avoid dementia, so you should read this book, too. I highlighted many, many pages, so I’ll just offer a few highlights here. The most interesting thing was reading about our skin, the tiny tiny layer that we makes us white or black or brown. Bryson watched a surgeon incise and peel back a sliver of skin a millimeter thick from the arm of cadaver. It was so thin it was translucent. That’s what race is. Which is why it’s so ridiculous that such a small facet of our composition should be given so much importance when it’s merely a reaction to sunlight. “Biologically, there is no such thing as race—nothing in terms of skin color, facial features, hair type, bone structure, or anything else that is a defining quality among peoples.”Skin gets its color from a variety of pigments, the best known is a molecule we know as melanin. It’s also responsible for the color of birds’ feathers and gives fish the texture and luminescence of the their scales. Our skin evolved based on our geography. A lot of myths I grew up with are not true. Like the fact we only use ten percent of our brain--false. I was taught as a kid that different parts of the tongue were attuned to different tastes like salty, sweet, sour. Nope. Also, like the movie the Matrix, apparently when I eat a brownie straight from the oven, it doesn’t actually taste good, my brain just reads these scentless, flavorless molecules and makes me think they’re pleasurable. In one of the studies he talks about, a man was given an injection of a harmless liquid to mimic snot. It couldn’t be seen by the naked eye, but under those blue lights detectives use. The test subject went into a room with other folks, and when they turned the overhead lights off and the blue lights on, every single person, doorknob, and bowl of nuts had the pretend snot on it, which is how the common cold passes from person to person so easily—through touch, apparently not by making out with someone (although presumably at some point you might touch that person). Antibiotics•	Almost 3/4ths of prescriptions written each year are for conditions that can’t be cured with antibiotics (like bronchitis) •	80 percent of antibiotics are fed to farm animals to fatten them up which meat eaters then consume, which is one of the reasons antibiotics aren’t as effective as they used to be.•	Fruit growers use antibiotics to combat bacterial infections in their crops, sometimes even of produce marked “organic.” Which means we humans are unwittingly eating antibiotics, rendering them ineffective when we need them for a real disease/infection.There’s a lot more interesting stuff in here. Thanks so much to NetGalley for the opportunity to read this book, which RELEASES OCTOBER 15, 2019."
3,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,4,"The definition of a “well” person?Someone who hasn’t been examined yet(loosely quoted from the book)This book is two things:-	Really interesting trivia about the human body-	TerrifyingI love trivia, and this book had tons of it. This was not a deeply scientific analysis of the human body. It is just snippets and brief anecdotes from various regions of the body as Bryson takes you on a journey through our innerspace. If you are not into big fancy words and meandering analysis, then you need not worry! There may be a time or two that he throws some deeper tidbits in, but it always moves on quickly. A good balance to keep both a med student and the layman interested (just guessing on the med student side as I am most certainly the layman!)So – yay, trivia!However, I will have to say, more often than not, the book journeys off in the direction of what can go wrong with the body. This is not surprising as a lot can go wrong with the body. However, it is not a book to read while eating, if you have hypochondria, if you have germ phobia, if the word “parasite” gives you heebie-jeebies, etc. While it may all be true, perhaps somethings are better off left unknown!With these two things in mind, proceed at your own risk! If you love trivia and don’t mind dumbed down science, this should be perfect for you. If you are a doctor, it may be too simple of an explanation to satisfy – or, maybe not??? If you are easily queasy when it comes to blood, vomit, and other bodily fluids and functions, I would suggest passing on this one.But, when all is said and done, another decent book from Bryson!"

From up to down, inside to outside, young to old, organ to nerve and so on goes the journey trough our miraculous wonder of nature whose amazing eyes are just sending this information to the brain of the reader.Many myths about the body are shown and design flaws described, but after billion years of evolution, that´s no wonder. We deliberately build in design flaws in everything we create and call it planned obsolescence and what is an appendix or other useless extra bonus parts compared to that.We really don´t understand anything in detail as shown in many great examples and the cool thing is that we once again stand in front of an ocean of lack of knowledge with that stereotypical hand full of sand and much that we believe to know about our body today might turn out to be completely different or even wrong. Especially because of the tininess we still have to explore and to discover areas of nano and quanta. Take physics, we don´t know anything, so what could this say about a system as complex as the human body in a world we hardly understand? Photosynthesis in plants seems to do it´s work with something creepy that just can be explained with some kind of not understood quanta phenomena teleportation stuff and, in some rare cases, we are more complex than vegetables.The most interesting implication of hidden dept comes for the mind, brain, conscience and ego. When over 1 billion copies of this book could be stored in an area of the cerebral cortex the size of a grain of sand, there is pretty much space for unknown programs running in the background, possibly with programming and instructions from wherever and whomever.Because we don´t understand, we should treat the body as good as possible with a diet of things and thoughts of which we know that they are not harmfulLike all of Bryson´s books, it an entertaining and great read, integrating history, medical science and vivid examples that stay in mind and easily find a way to a long term memory whose functioning we don´t understand to associate it with a brain we know nothing about and a mind that,... well, you get the meaning.It´s better and more informative than biology education and in my imagination I see books like this in a close future with much more data, pictures, animations, links of different grade of difficulty for each kind of reader, VR, AR and the integration of the reading audience, probably with a kinda collective reading live streams while using different kinds of technologies or just old school reading. A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real-life outside books:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science...Tropes show how literature is conceived and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

How to make a human body:
Blend together the right amount of each of 59 elements, at a cost of US$151,578.46 according to the Royal Society of Chemistry.  ~Or~If you don't have that kind of money lying about, you can also do it the old-fashioned way that involves heterosexual sex. I'm not here to judge your methods; make a human whichever way you please.  What I am here to do is tell you that Bill Bryson has done it again!  He has written yet another brilliant and vastly interesting book, this time about the human body. Whether you want to know about bones or skin or digestion, muscles or brains or bacteria, you'll find it in this book.  I don't even know where to begin in telling you about the contents.  Whilst some things I already knew and thus this was a refresher, there were even more that I didn't know and thus made my brain very happy.  There are just so many interesting facts wrapped up in this book.  A random few from my highlights:•""You have a meter of [DNA] packed into every cell, and so many cells that if you formed all the DNA in your body into a single strand, it would stretch ten billion miles, to beyond Pluto.""•We shed over a million flakes of skin every hour, leaving behind about a pound of dust every year.  (Easy way to rid yourself of a pound, but for some reason I've never seen it in a diet book.)•If you could ice skate on cartilage, you would go 16 times as fast as on ice, due to the smoothness of cartilage.•""In the second or so since you started this sentence, your body has made a million red blood cells."" (and used a dozen muscles just to read these words)•""The length of all your blood vessels would take you two and a half times around Earth.""•""Every gram of feces you produce contains 40 billion bacteria and 100 million archaea.""  (Now that's something you can impress your co-workers with at your Christmas party!)•The ""the death rate for infectious diseases has been climbing and is back to the level of about forty years ago.""  This is due to bacteria evolving resistance to our antibiotics, partly because of the copious amounts of antibiotics that are fed to livestock (a good reason to cut out meat and dairy!) and the over-prescription of antibiotics, especially for illnesses that are not helped by them (please stop asking your doctor for antibiotics for colds!).The award for my favourite tidbit of information in this book goes to:•All of your skin colour is in ""a sliver of skin about a millimeter thick"".  Did you get that??  ALL of the pigment in your skin is in a sliver so thin that you can see through it!  ""That’s all that race is—a sliver of epidermis.""  For this we have enslaved millions of people, killed, hated, treated unfairly, imprisoned.  For a translucent sliver of skin.   Stupid reason if you ask me, especially when you consider that if you go back far enough, every single person on earth has ancestors who came from Africa.  We ALL had black ancestors.  We ALL came from Africa.  The original skin colour of homo sapiens was dark, so stop already.  Stop hating on people over a sliver of skin.  If you have ""white"" skin, it's due to a gene mutation, a freak gene that happened to get passed on because our ancestors needed Vitamin D after they left Africa.  Not because you are somehow superior to people who have more melanin than you.  Got that?Those are just a few of the many things I highlighted in this book (it's best to have a Kindle copy if you don't like marking up paper pages).  If you enjoy learning new things, if you like to know what makes you you, or if you have an extra $151,578.46 on hand and want to know the ingredients required to create a human body, this is the book for you!"
6,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"I like Bryson, his books are often amusing and informative. He has a good eye for details that will keep the reader engaged or outraged or just smile. This is a tour of the human body, but it includes stories and asides about people associated with the discovery of various diseases or a cure or a system in the body. Some books on this topic can get a bit carried away with long names for parts that involve endless Latin or Greek. A nice thing he does here when he does give these is to say what the words mean in English, often interesting enough in itself, and to say why the person naming it that might have thought that was a good idea.I didn't realise that the X-chromosome was called that because the person who discovered it didn’t know what it did – and so, like ‘planet X’, the letter was chosen due to this mystery rather than for the chromosome’s shape. And the Y-chromosome was likewise named following on from X in the alphabet.You come away from this thinking that a lot of people are basically bastards. I won’t spoil the stories, but the person who took credit for Streptomycin fits this category particularly nicely. This is a quick read and an interesting one. Particularly good is the last chapter – you know, we are all going to die sooner or later and so death often sharpens our interest. I’ve become fascinated by the idea that no one is allowed to die of ‘old age’ any more. You have to have died of something, but as Bryson says, getting old generally involves multiple things going wrong with you – and so picking one generally ignores the significant contribution one or other of the things you were suffering from inevitably played in your demise. Perhaps saying ‘he died of old age’ as the cause of death would be in fact be more accurate. Some of the things people were allowed to die of in the past seem so much better than heart disease or cancer - like ennui, for example. ""I think he died mostly of listlessness..."" As I said recently to a friend of Facebook – the category of deaths I would choose for myself would be ‘peacefully and in his sleep’."
7,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,4,"I read this off and on for over a week, I think reading it straight through would not have left me time to ponder the information and possibly would have been a case of too much at one time. Our bodies, many systems and other developments of which I knew little all in one book. I actually own a copy because this is another that I feel deserves more than read. Or at least to have as a reference. There is a huge amount of research that went into this book. Bryson is good and picking out information and identifying unsung, unknown heroes. As informative and as I found it, it seems Bryson has traded his trademark sit for some gross examples. Thankfully, I have never encountered these relatively rare conditions. Shuddered at all the diseases, viruses we don't get, there were quite a few. Our body is quite a compact and intricate mechanism. It's a wonder that more things don't go wrong.I still have two unread by this author that I'm saving for a book drought, along with books from a few other favored author. This is an author loved by many, and he explains our bodies in an easy to understand fashion. Though I did miss the humor , of which there was some, but not as many instances as in previous books. Definitely worth reading, regardless."

For those of us who haven't had a biology class since we fulfilled some course requirement ages ago, Bryson gives an excellent overview of what doctors and scientists know about all our different body parts and bodily functions. This book does for biology what books like Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong or A People's History of the United States have done for history; it updates and corrects some common misconceptions that may have been passed on to us at one stage or another.Bryson's dry wit will come across even more clearly when this is eventually made into an audiobook.  While reading, I imagined Alton Brown reading the text in the same manner he talks to the audience in Good Eats. Bill Nye would be a great narrator, too! It's clear that The Body is aimed at a general audience. (Readers who specialize in the biological sciences might want more detail than this book provides.)One caveat, particularly for Goodreads reviewers--more than our fair share of us have had frustrating or scary ""adventures"" through the medical system. Since Bryson spends a surprising amount of time discussing the things doctors *don't* know, this aspect of the text could be unsettling. Four stars for the print version--and if the audiobook is available when you're making your purchasing decision, I would definitely give this a listen.Thanks to Doubleday and NetGalley for my DRC of this book, which will be available for purchase on October 15th."

Chapter 20 (When things go wrong) in this book is a must-read one as it is perfectly explaining the current scenario we are facing. This book will help us to know more about our body which might enable us to appreciate it's uniqueness even when it's challenged to the extreme by viruses and other microbes. I read this book amid all the pandemonium I had to face as a Doctor and more importantly, as a human being. I am going to copy and write the last paragraph of chapter 20 (page 335) due to its current relevance  ”The fact is we are really no better prepared for a bad outbreak today than we were when Spanish flu killed tens of millions of people a hundred years ago. The reason we haven’t had another experience like that isn’t because we have been especially vigilant. It’s because we have been lucky” Well, it seems that we can’t write that sentence again.P.S. Please don’t go to a bookstore to purchase this or any other book if the shops are still open in your country. Instead, either order it from any online store or buy the ebook or the audiobook.

And, of course, we also have the opportunity to enjoy the Bryson wit. This is a field trip through the human body and I was astounded at the level of research needed to write such a book. And I admit there was so much I did not know about the body and how it is built to repair itself. This is an informative guide as well as a source of humour, now and again.

13,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"Until now, I only knew Bill Bryson for his snarky travelogues. My buddy-reader, however, informed me that his non-fiction book was very good indeed. Besides, many biology books suffer from the fact that their authors are great scientists but horrible writers. So I wanted to read something that had the potential to be entertaining as well as educational.The book is divided into these chapters:And yes, we did get a little bit of humour, but that wasn't because Bryson made fun of certain things, but was very good at pointing out the hilarity of history and us silly homo sapiens.Bryson decided to explain anatomy to the reader as well as giving historical and practical context. We thus hear of the abominable Typhoid Mary, a women who, at one point, found out she was one of the rare carriers of typhoid without showing any symptoms, but decided to still work in kitchens (against a promise she had made to the authorities) and didn't even bother to wash her hands before preparing meals, thus spreading the disease until she was finally put under house arrest.Or Nicholas Alkemade, who served in WW2 and jumped out of his plane (his parachute had burnt to cinders and he preferred not to burn to death), survived falling 5500 metres into a pile of snow (after having been slowed down by some pine trees) and suffering only a sprained leg. After the war had ended, he worked in a chemical plant where, while removing chlorine gas-generating liquid from a sump, he received a severe electric shock from the equipment he was using. His gas mask became dislodged and he began breathing in the poisonous gas. After 15 minutes, his appeals for aid were finally answered and he was dragged to safety, nearly asphyxiated by the fumes. Not long after, a siphoning pipe burst, spraying Alkemade’s face and arms with industrial sulphuric acid. With astounding presence of mind, he dived head-first into a nearby drum of limewash, thereby neutralising the acid and escaping with only 1st-degree-burns. He returned to work, but was pinned beneath an almost 3m long steel door runner that fell from its mountings as he passed by, escaping - somehow - with only minor bruising. However, after this, even he came to his senses and decided to no longer tempt fate. He thus became a furniture salesman, dying peacefully in June 1987.Just two examples of how remarkable and resilient the human body can be (though Mary, in my opinion, was mostly an example of being sick of mind). There are others, of course, such as people being trapped in frozen lakes or extremely cold weather, who are afterwards successfully (slowly) warmed up and who survived (babies even).The book is full of other fascinating facts as well. Many of us know, for example, that damages to our frontal lobes result in personality changes, which was the reason lobotomy became popular at one point in human history (Rosemary Kennedy was lobotomized because her father considered her too willful, something Bryson mentions in this book, too). Did you also know that it's 400 times more likely that a teenager is in an accident if said teenager is accompanied by another teenager?! And this isn't just limited to car accidents.Or did you know that we always say ""our 5 senses"" but that there are many more? Like the sense that tells us if we're lying down or standing upright even when our eyes are closed? It's called proprioception (our sense of where we are in relation to the space around us).Or did you know how many things we still cannot explain? One such thing are emotional responses like crying when sad - it has no physiological benefit AND is the same response as for joy so why are we doing it?Science, it's history, trials and errors but also impressive feats from hundreds of years ago, groundbreaking discoveries (the most well-known example being penicillin), modern appliances and procedures but also problems that will become more dangerous in the near future ... I was delighted how Bryson presented it all comprehensibly and explained it in a way every layman can understand, often giving examples from every-day occurrences, always showing just how much he is fascinated by the subject(s) himself.A wonderful look at an important and thrilling subject (us) by a seriously talented author - just don't be prissy about digestion or our insides. ;P"
14,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"For all of you other cyborgs and pure artificial intelligences out there, I should mention that this is a rather interesting primer on regular meat-sacks. It even has the distinction of not being science fiction at all.But as the title suggests, outright occupancy usually comes with a rental charge. The bill always comes due.I've read a few Brysons before... and my favorite has got to be A Short History of Nearly Everything. This one, from a regular knowledge-gathering stand, comes in as a tight second. The travelogues are fun and often funny, but Short History is pretty comprehensive and rather more funny. This one, however, was not very funny at all. That's okay. Very little about our bodies, aside from sex and farts, is funny.Bryson DOES, however, accomplish a lot, go over a LOT of ground. Pretty cool, in fact. Do I recommend reading this? Absolutely. Everyone ought to have a primer on themselves. The benefit here is much more than meets the eye, though. So many new discoveries and outright debunking of myths have made it in this text. Recent ones, too.You know that leaky faucet and the clog in the pipes? Yep. We really need to talk to the landlord. "
15,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Bryson is a wonderful travel guide, and this time around he takes us through an enjoyable tour of the human body. The book is surprisingly detailed, for a popular-science book. Bryson exhibits his usual knack for the extraordinary and unusual, but despite veering close to it at times, he avoids the pitfall of making this book just a tour of the oddities of the human body. Bryson takes just enough such detours to keep us amused, but just like a good tour guide ensures that we are adequately educated as well. The best thing about Bryson, as best exhibited in A Short History of Nearly Everything, is his knack to make everything he touches so memorable. I am sure if a quiz was added after each chapter, most of his readers would fare very well in them. Did you know it takes more time for food to move through a woman's digestive system, than a man's? Who would've thought to include that in an anatomy book? However, is this the best book to pick up if you are interested in reading about the Human Body? It might be the most fun book, but I am sure even Bryson would recommend Daniel Lieberman's The Story of the Human Body over his own book if you could read just one anatomy book. After all, he refers to Lieberman so often that it sometimes feels like this whole book is nothing but a detailed review of Lieberman's magnum opus. If you can spare the time for two, by all means, get both.Towards the end, Bryson comes to the real point of why we are reading the book - how to keep ourselves healthy. He takes us through a tour of nutrition science, exercise science and even of mortality. In the end, Bryson leaves us with the message that it is not that difficult to live a good life - you just have to take good care of your most precious resource - your Body."
16,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3292905-julie,5,"A truly amazing compendium on the human body aka ""a warm wobble of flesh!"" Truly engaging and enlightening. Occasionally I wanted to fast forward to avoid the details, but mainly I was truly engaged, appalled or enthralled!My personal favorite of Bill Bryson's anecdotal stories:The emergency appendectomy on a US submarine during WWII. The ship's pharmacist assistant was ordered to operate without any knowledge or equipment, as he as was the senior medical personnel on board. This is a little mind-boggling to me, as I would expect that there would be a trained medical doctor on board at the very least. Anyway, the pharmacist assistant successfully anesthetized the patient by guessing at the quantity of anesthesia to administer. Then, he successfully performed the appendectomy ""wearing a tea strainer lined with gauze as a surgery mask and guided by little more than a first aid manual."" Truly amazing!  Surprising fact, which had somehow passed me by: women in labor today have the same pain relief options as their great grandmothers.Conclusions: 1. We could avoid a lot of diseases by living more sensibly. LOL!2. We have been successful in extending life, but not in improving the quality of life.4/29/20 Update: Reading this for a second time with my hubby. Bill Bryson's matter of factness and humor make for a perfect listening experience during this stay-at-home time."
17,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643325-paul,3,"3.5 starsI am joining a book club; unusual for me because I am not a hugely social animal. It is based at the university where I work for one day a week and it meets a lunch time, once every two months. This is the book for January; it’s not something I would have read in normal circumstances. Bryson employs his usual wry and laconic style and applies it to the human body. This isn’t a medical text book, but it is detailed and covers pretty much what you would expect. Bryson does cover the history and development of medicines, surgery and approaches to the body. He also uncovers some of the lesser known pioneers of medicine, those history has forgotten. Bryson tells their stories and uncovers their foibles in an entertaining way. The book is full of facts, it must be a dream for someone who goes to quizzes a lot, although there are some interesting ones as well. Bryson estimates that austerity in Britain has led to about 120 000 preventable deaths. He attributes the fact that Americans die at a younger age the Europeans to lifestyle. Bryson also takes a more global perspective and looks at the battle with infectious diseases and our overuse of antibiotics which has led to antibiotic resistant bugs. Bryson takes a look at the opioid crisis and at some of the medical techniques that did not stand the test of time; lobotomy for example.There are lots of interesting facts, many obscure diseases, lesser known medical operatives and trillions of cells. It is informative and Bryson is, as ever, a great raconteur. However I was left asking WHY? What’s it all for, interesting though it is? I’ll keep you posted on the book club!"
18,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3060349-karen-r,5,"Bill Bryson’s trademark humor is evident in this fascinating book that provides detailed descriptions of the body, how things function and history of discovery. A big takeaway is that although there have been great strides in what we know about science and medicine, he makes it clear just how much is still unknown about how and why things work. This book would be perfect to serve as a primer for a high school health and wellness course. Thanks to Doubleday Books for the ARC in exchange for my honest review."
19,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,5,"This book was given to me as a Christmas present, and it was a great gift. As a fan of Bryson, I was surprised that I had not even heard of his new work of popular science. I am glad that it came to my attention, then, since this was my favorite Bryson book since A Short History of Nearly Everything. Structured as a tour of the human body, the book made me feel right at home. No matter what the subject, Bryson’s style is consistent: snappy prose, engaging anecdotes, and fun facts, all tied together with a lot of curiosity and humor. At its worst, this can make for some superficial books—a meandering array of factoids with little structure—which in my experience plagues his history writing. But science seems to bring out the best in Bryson. Here, the writing is disciplined and controlled. He clearly did a great deal of research and organized his facts with care. And Bryson has a rare talent for research. You would think that, in our media-saturated age, most of the great stories and characters from history would be known. But somehow Bryson is always able to uncover an unsung hero with an eccentric personality. The history of science seems particularly rich in this.Bryson not only unearths unsung heroes, but surprising information. Bryson is a fun fact factory. Arguably, fun facts are the very definition of superficial knowledge; but Bryson’s curiosities are irresistible. There were so many things about the body—about digestion, sleep cycles, anatomy, disease—that I did not know, and so many things that surprised me. For example, I learned that our eyes do not only have rods and cones, but photoreceptive ganglion cells; these do not contribute to vision in any way, but tell us when it is light or dark. This is why some blind people instinctually know if it is day or night, or even if the light is on or off.Bryson’s style is also well-suited to popular science. His jokes, comments, and asides can be distracting in other contexts; but when reporting potentially dry scientific information, the humor helps. And it must be said that Bryson’s two biggest preoccupations—things we do not know, and things that can kill us (or ideally both)—have ample material in a book about the human body. Indeed, this book gave me a bit of death anxiety, since Bryson dwells on all of the things that can go seriously wrong and how little we know about the why. The scariest thing, for me, was the section on antibiotics. The rate at which bacteria adapt to antibiotics is far outpacing the rate at which we are discovering new medicines. (And our flagrant overuse of antibiotics is certainly not helping.) If we do not somehow reverse this trend, we can have a real crisis in the near future.If the book has any takeaway, it is that lifestyle is important. Exercises is tremendously beneficial; and inactivity is likewise lethal. A good diet makes a big difference, too, as does avoiding obviously harmful activities like smoking and excessive drinking. Our bad habits in the United States are partially why we lag behind other developed nations in life expectancy. As Bryson also points out, our health system is not particularly good, either, despite the enormous costs involved (several times the prices in other countries). Indeed, the American health system is not only lagging behind other countries, but is actively creating problems. The most obvious example of this is the opioid epidemic, which is largely caused by overprescribing pain medication. And the reason that these medications are only overprescribed in America, it seems, is the unsavory relationship between doctors and drug companies.As you can see, there is a great deal of interest in these pages—from the history of science, to the development of modern medicine, to the science of anatomy and physiology—none of it dense, dull, or otherwise difficult, but rather witty, charming, and altogether fun to read. I recommend it."

I have to admit I would have been bored if I'd tried to read this straight through but tackling a few pages every night at bedtime turned out to be fascinating and educating. There is a lot of trivia about not just the body itself and how it works, but also about scientists and doctors and their discoveries, sometimes accidental, the sometimes wrong conclusions they came to, and health care systems all over the world. My conclusions at the end of this book: The body is an incredible machine that does everything it can to keep us alive, most of the time without us even knowing about it. In the end, it really is a crap shoot, so enjoy it while you can. Or as Bill Bryson says at the end of the last chapter that describes what happens at death - ""And that's you gone. But it was good while it lasted, wasn't it?""  Carpe Diem!"
21,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,5,"Shelve this next to Being Mortal by Atul Gawande in a collection of books that everyone should read – even if you’re a squeamish hypochondriac or you don’t normally choose nonfiction. Bryson is back on form with his latest, indulging his layman’s curiosity about how the body works. Now, I read a LOT of medical memoirs and popular science. I’ve read entire books about organ transplantation, sleep, dementia, the blood, the heart, evolutionary defects, surgery and so on, but in many cases these go into more detail than I really need and I can find my interest waning. That never happens here. Without ever being superficial or patronizing his readers, the author gives a comprehensive introduction to every organ and body system, moving briskly between engaging anecdotes from medical history and encapsulated research on everything from gut microbes to cancer treatment.Bryson delights in our physical oddities, and his sense of wonder is infectious. How fantastic that there is such a thing as the Belly Button Biodiversity Project (run by North Carolina State University) that has discovered 1,458 species in bacteria new to science in people’s navels! How astounding that a man hiccupped for 67 years straight! As you’ve likely gathered from his other work, he loves a good statistic, and while this book is full of numbers and percentages, they are accessible rather than obfuscating, and will make you shake your head in amazement.“A study in Switzerland found that flu virus can survive on a banknote for two and a half weeks if it is accompanied by a microdot of snot.”“If you’ve ever wondered why no one wants to kiss you first thing in the morning, it is possibly because your exhalations may contain up to 150 different chemical compounds” including “methyl mercaptan (which smells like very old cabbage), hydrogen sulphide (like rotten eggs), dimethyl sulphide (slimy seaweed)”, etc.“Even with the advantage of clothing, shelter and boundless ingenuity, humans can manage to live on only about 12 per cent of Earth’s land area”“Altogether there are about seven thousand rare diseases – so many that about one person in seventeen in the developed world has one, which isn’t very rare at all. But, sadly, so long as a disease affects only a small number of people it is unlikely to get much research attention. For 90 per cent of rare diseases there are no effective treatments at all.”This is a congenial and persistently cheerful book, even when discussing illness, scientists whose work was overlooked, and the inevitability of death. What I found most sobering was the observation that, having conquered many diseases and extended our life expectancy, we are now overwhelmingly killed by our lifestyle, mostly a poor diet of processed and sugary foods and a lack of exercise – “we are born with the bodies of hunter–gatherers but pass our lives as couch potatoes.”A few specific things I learned:I’ve had a nasty cold for the past two weeks, and this book saved me from making a wasted purchase – I had just put Vitamin C on the shopping list when I read that taking large doses of Vitamin C is ineffectual. That it can cure a cold is an urban myth. Immediately, I crossed it off the list and ate an orange instead.It takes 72 hours for food to move through a woman’s digestive system and be excreted. I’d always assumed that what I was getting rid of was my last meal – so that if I had a bout of diarrhea I could blame it on what I’d just eaten. I’m now curious to know how it works for flatulence: I’m sure that I get instant flatulence after eating chickpeas, lentils, eggs or cheese. But is that just my imagination? Maybe I’m actually observing the effects of a meal from a few days ago.A neat thing to know about cold weather; it makes total sense, but had never occurred to me. “Incidentally, the reason your nose runs in chilly weather is the same reason your bathroom windows run with water in chilly weather. In the case of your nose, warm air from your lungs meets cold air coming into the nostrils and condenses, resulting in a drip.”Favorite passages:“Your body is a universe of mystery. A very large part of what happens on and within it happens for reasons that we don’t know – very often, no doubt, because there are no reasons. Evolution is an accidental process, after all.”“Your brain is you. Everything else is just plumbing and scaffolding.”"
22,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1170391-sara,4,"Bill Bryson, as usual, manages to make a difficult and complex topic completely accessible and enjoyable in The Body. Taking the reader on journey from the brain (my favourite chapter), endocrine system down to the lungs and beyond, every chapter is full of interesting facts that will entertain as well as inform.Bryson just seems to have this ability in his writing to make the reader feel as though they're chatting with a friend about a subject that he's so clearly passionate about. It manages to invoke an excitment in the reader that is not easily achieved in lesser authors, who could make the subject too dry. I will say that I wasn't as interested in some chapets as I was in others (homeostasis and equilibrium come to mind) but this never stopped me from reading this fast paced, easy read.Fun fact: I met Bill Bryson when I graduated with my BSc and he's a really nice guy. I'd recommend this to anyone wanting a general overview into the weird and wonderful world of the human body. "
23,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43708514-candie,5,"I really enjoyed this book; it is very entertaining. There are so many interesting facts about every single part of the body in here. There are just enough stories and humor added in that it makes the book very readable; it never seems like it is too technical or dry, but keep in mind that it is still a book about body facts. It was very fascinating to learn just how much we don't know about the body and how or why it does what it does. I also found that there were quite a few things that I thought I knew, and I did not.If the topic itself sounds interesting to you then I would definitely recommend it because it is very well written."

26,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,4,"3.5 starsThis is like A Short History of Nearly Everything but for the body.Had I not read so many medical books and watched endless hours of QI I would have given this a MUCH higher rating but because of this prior knowledge some sections felt like deja vu.The scope of the book is impressive, Bill does not leave any stone (or rather muscle, cell, bacteria or organ) unexplored. I also learned enough fascinating trivia which I plan to spring on unsuspecting friends at inappropriate times for my own entertainment.My favorite sections dealt with the microbiome, gut and nervous system and to be honest any book that incorporates something like the Belly Button Diversity Project would grab my attention.I found it amusing that he treaded so lightly and diplomatically in the nutrition and vaccine section but then again there is currently a lot of controversy in these areas.The author also quoted some of my favorite books by Mary Roach as well as sections of The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancerto just name a few so even with my slightly middle of the road rating I can highly recommend this to anyone who has a passing interest in well researched books that make medical speak accessible and learning new things fun."
27,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"What a marvelous book! Bill Bryson is one of my favorite authors. His dry wit shines in all of his books. Before reading this book, it was hard for me to imagine what the book would be like. I've read some of Bryson's travel books--all delightful--but I couldn't image what a book about the body would be like. As it turns out, it is a tour book, written in the same style, as a metaphorical tour of the body.Bryson interleaves talking about a lot of facts with interesting and often humorous anecdotes. Every single page is very interesting, even entertaining. There are a few gruesome parts that I simply skipped over. This is not a comprehensive book about the body; Bryson relates interesting facts, lots of trivia, and really skips the details. That is the magic he brings to a very engaging book.I didn't read this book, I listened to the audiobook, as read by the author. Bryson has a pleasant, soft voice. Unlike other narrators with soft voices, this audiobook's audio engineering allowed me to hear and understand the narration distinctly. It is also fun, because Bryson's voice inflections bring out the points he wants to emphasize, and the humor comes out in a perfectly deadpan manner."
28,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,3,"Bryson has supplied the reader with an anatomy class for the layman. He provides an excellent overview of what scientists know about the body from skin to bones, what is essential to keep it healthy, and a plethora of diseases that can attack it. However, missing is Bryson’s signature wit and his unique way of looking at the mundane."
29,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27298436-toni,5,"A casual readable guide for the ‘common man,’ (you know I mean person). Reading through this book by Bill Bryson, is like talking to your favorite uncle at the Thanksgiving table, after everyone else went to watch the football game. You and he are nibbling dessert, sipping coffee and just chatting about the human body. That’s how easy the writing flows.So far from any textbook, it contains valuable facts yet it’s not overly technical. The categories or elements of the vast network that contains the wonders inside and out are organized perfectly; and the technical words are available for anyone who wants them. Just when you’re ready to ask, ‘but what about this?’ Bill segues into that area. Always the teacher and the guide, Bryson just knows what to tell us next. He presents not just the basic information, but any controversies, recent and past, surrounding this body part or organ relative to disease or maladies. I’ve learned more through this book than I have reading articles or other periodicals over the past year or so. I highly recommend this book to everyone!Thank you to Netgalley, Doubleday Books, and Bill Bryson."

31,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115625-thefourthvine,1,"People who should read this: those who really, really enjoy book reports. People who should absolutely not read this: trans people, people with chronic pain, fat people, anyone with a degree in any aspect of biology, anyone who reads more than one popular science book a year. The thing is, there are basically three ways you can go with a book like this. There’s the complete and in-depth approach, which is absolutey ruled out here; you can’t cover the human body completely in four years of medical school, never mind in a single book. Then there’s the fun facts approach, which Mary Roach has absolutely perfected; you give a brief overview and then you delve into interesting and possibly amusing things your reader probably doesn’t know. That’s where I thought this was going. And then there’s the massively oversimplified, somewhat dull book report, and that’s where this unfortunately ended up. This reads like Bryson read approximately 400 books, summarized each one in a single page, and then added an introduction and a conclusion. And that’s a problem. The reason each of those books was written was that their topics could not be adequately covered in a page. So every time I happened upon an area about which I already knew some things — or when I’d read the same book Bryson had for that particular bit — I found myself hissing, “But you’re MISSING THE POINT” or “But that’s — that’s so superficial it’s actually inaccurate” or just “Seriously? Seriously??” I had particular concerns about his discussions of sex and sex chromosomes, which was so simplified and bad that it pretty much went directly to a TERF place. (The problems start with him saying everyone has two sex chromosomes, and that if you have XX you are always female and if you have XY you are always male, and then they sort of go on from there. Biology is more complicated than your fifth-grade-level overview suggests.) He also manages a neatly internally contradictory discussion of the Death Fat that spans over multiple chapters. (Especially enjoyed him explaining in one chapter some of the reasons humans are fatter today than previously, only to explain in another chapter that we all just eat too much and don’t exercise enough. Also there’s a good bit where he explains that fat is definitely killing everyone early, only to point out a bit later that some of the fattest populations on the planet are also the longest-lived. And so on.) There’s also a fun spot where he describes Alexis St. Martin, who was an intensively mistreated victim of constant unethical experimentation by a physician, as “not the most cooperative of subjects.” There’s a lot of stuff like that, that Bryson lightly glosses over and really, really should not. When the book’s not enraging, it’s just dull. Bryson mostly elides his own narrative voice, which is his main strength as a writer, in favor of pretending to be an authority, so we get an endless dull recitation of facts that many readers already know. (And many of which we learned from more engaging books than this one.)This book left me sad and frustrated and took me so long to slog through it messed up my holds at the library. A solid loser, all the way around. "
32,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98423937-nursebookie,5,"""THE BODY"" by Bill Bryson.Did you ever think you ever needed an owner's manual for our complex body? I think this was a brilliant idea!! We live in this body that we are so intimate with and yet could hardly speak of what goes on inside or tell us the functions of the organs we have, nor even name them, Bryson took a Biology Book, that is the last thing I ever want, and turned it to an amazing book that I cannot keep my hands away from. Converting a daunting and boring science book into an understandable and entertaining book for EVERYONE is like wizardry. His writing is brilliant and truly enjoyable. Bryson kept me intrigued and in awe for the facts and information he magically sprinkled throughout the pages. Additionally, the anecdotes within the chapters made for a really fun read for me. This book had accurate and important information that I did not even learn in my pre-med courses in college. I feel like I can win a trivia contest or even join Jeopardy after reading this book. Bryson wrote a phenomenal book full of amazing information without feeling like I am stuffing my head with information, but for some reason I am retaining these facts and enjoy talking about them to everyone I meet. I have recommended this book to many people already and will continue to do so. What an awesome gift for anyone that can appreciate a great read and feel so much smarter after reading this. Amazing job!Thank you NeyGalley and Double Day Books for the ARC ebook for my honest and objective opinion."
33,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101060033-woman-reading,4,"4☆ characterized in turns by droll wit and stomach - churning descriptions 

 Our bodies are a universe of 37.2 trillion cells operating in more or less perfect concert more or less all of the time. ... The miracle of human life is not that we are endowed with some frailties but we are not swamped by them. ... You truly are a wonder. But then so, it must be said, is an earthworm. 

And with this elegant turn of sentiment, Bryson embarked on a journey of the human body, from top to bottom and from outside in. Despite its subtitle and seeming breadth, it appeared to me to offer limited value as a user's personal handbook. The bulk of The Body  instead was evenly divided between being an idiosyncratic assortment of medical characters and scientists and a brief introductory course to anatomy and physiology. In regards to its utility as an user's handbook, I can easily summarize its conventional advice:- exercise more; don't be so sedentary- get sufficient sleep- eat more plant-based foods instead of processed, refined, or sugary foods - don't smoke or do drugs and drink alcohol moderately 

As with so much in life, getting the balances right is delicate business. Suicide by lifestyles takes ages.

Bryson's deadpan wit existed side by side with some very gross descriptions of past medical research. So beware if you're squeamish or planning to eat. Bryson mentioned many scientists in the context of Nobel prize winners, both the worthy and the slighted, those robbed by unscrupulous bosses or by ignorant skepticism. Many of these stories were quite old, but they made me realize that our medical advances have been relatively recent, within the past 60 years or so. Some examples of medical quackery (through modern eyes) included brain surgery with kitchenware (icepicks) and the injection of all sorts of liquids and multiple animals' blood directly into human subjects' veins. One stomach- churning account was how in the 1820s the surgeon W. Beaumont tested his subject's partially digested food by tasting it himself to confirm the presence of hydrochloric acid in the human gastrointestinal system. The other example was a very graphic testimony in 1810 by novelist F. Burney undergoing a mastectomy while awake and without anesthesia.The Body succinctly described body parts and their functions and many esoteric bits of knowledge. One myth he quickly dispelled was the self help notion that we only use 10 percent of our brain thus leaving 90 percent as an untapped massive potential. Alas, no, all of our brains are utilized. Bryson was quite clear, however, that many aspects still pose mysteries - from why we hiccup, yawn, or even sleep. The most fascinating chapter to me was about the brain. Humans can truly be idiosyncratic as we don't all see or smell the world the same way. How can we when our individual collection of odorant receptors will lead to differing experiences of smell. And then because of the distance between our optic nerves and brains, the brain forecasts 1/5th of a second in advance. 

... photons of light have no color, sound waves no sound, olfactory molecules no odors. ...All the richness of life is created inside your head. What you see is not what is but what your brain tells you it is, and that's not the same thing at all. ... color isn't a fixed reality but a perception. 

So couple that with the following, and the profound insight explains why race is purely a social construct. 

The paradox of genetics is that we are all very different and yet genetically practically identical. All humans share 99.9 percent of their DNA.""People act as if skin color is a determinant of character when all it is is a reaction to sunlight. Biologically, there is actually no such thing as race - nothing in terms of skin color, facial features, hair type, bone structure or anything else that is a defining quality among peoples."" - Nina Jablonski 

We need to overcome our knee-jerk mental reactions. This alone is sufficient for me to round up my initial 3.5+ star rating to 4 stars."

Bill Bryson explores what makes up the human body from head to toe, from birth to death, with his trademark wit and wisdom. He delves into how a healthy body functions and what can go wrong, how medicines and treatments have evolved over the years, discussing which scientists and doctors made important discoveries that benefitted humanity and which crackpot theories were eventually debunked. Best advice for living a long life? Eat healthy foods, the less processed the better, exercise, don't smoke, don't drink to excess. Take an aspirin and call me in the morning..I received an arc of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Many thanks. "
36,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/202724-jessica,4,"A lot more dry and technical than his other books I've read, but fascinating nonetheless! I really loved how he highlighted the unsung heroes, especially the women scientists, whose achievements go unnoticed or are attributed to flashier (male) colleagues.The bottom line, however, is that for all the things we do know about the body, there are about a million things we don't!"
37,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"I am a huge fan of Bill Bryson's travel books - he is a superb storyteller, and in the best parts of his science writing, this ability to provide fascinating facts and intriguing tales shines through.After taking on the whole of science in his first book, here he focuses in on the physiology, anatomy and diseases of the human body. Bryson does so with his usual light, approachable style, peppering the plethora of facts (and 'don't know's - it's amazing how much we still don't know about the workings of the body) with the little nuggets you can't help but share and stories of some of the odd and, frankly, horrifying goings on in the history of medicine.So, for example, Bryson throws in 'The chin is unique to humans and no one knows why we have one.' He speculates that it might be just that we 'find a good chin dashing' and quotes a Harvard professor as saying 'Testing this last hypothesis is especially difficult, but the reader is encouraged to think of appropriate experiments.'It's a long time since I read Bryson's first science book, but I suspect that his Short History of Nearly Everything involved more going and talking to scientists, so had more of the feel of a documentary, and more opportunity to bring in his travel writing skills. Here, there was more of a focus on presentation of facts, though always in a way that felt more like a conversation with a friend than an introductory textbook on human biology - and there are still a number of interviews.A good example of the way Bryson goes about exploring a topic is the way he deals with asthma. He starts with a story about the writer Marcel Proust, describing the many ways that Proust attempted to treat the condition, including enemas, opium and having the gas to his house cut off. From Proust we move on to the way asthma has become more prevalent and the remarkable variation around the world - not, as you might expect, paralleling the degree of air pollution. It was shocking to read that the highest rate in the world is in the UK, where '30 per cent of children have shown asthma symptoms in the last year.' This is compared with rates around 3 percent in China, Greece, Romania and Russia. He then goes on, using an interview with an expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, to show how most of our ideas about asthma are wrong. For example, he quotes Neil Pearce as saying 'the main thing I have achieved is to show that almost none of the things people think cause asthma actually do.'Along the way Bryson takes us on a tour of the body, starting with 'the outside' (skin and hair) and working through all the main parts, the vast numbers of microbes that share our body, body functions - such as movement, eating and sleep - and diseases, finishing with a whole chapter on cancer and another on the way that medicine has developed from doing more harm than good to its present state.This is the perfect book for anyone (like me) who had little to do with biology at school and to whom much of the functioning of human anatomy is a mystery. You know that with Bryson at the helm, the voyage through your inner workings is bound to be fascinating and entertaining. I wish there had been more opportunity for his humour and recounting personal adventures, as in his travel books, because this is where Bryson is at his best - but even when recounting facts he keeps the reader interested, never lingering long enough to get bogged down.Well worth a look."
38,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6181069-ingrid,5,Very interesting and informative. Easy to read.
39,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8111350-kendra,2,"It's nice to read a new book by Bryson in which he seems to have gotten over the bitterness (especially about aging) that made several of his most recent books unpleasant. And while The Body is written in something similar to his old, familiar, entertaining style, there are several issues that will keep me from buying it for friends. 1. it's hard to be precisely up-to-the-minute with books on science, but a lot of the data Bryson cites is quite old and misleading. Referring to the BMI, for example, is problematic because it is known to be a terrible indicator of, well, anything, and it's been long-condemned by medical professionals. There are other errors of fact as well: it's ""Down syndrome,"" not ""Down's,,"" for example. 2. It's ableist and sexist. The book could have used a sensitivity reading by a disabled person, who would have asked Bryson to remove a lot of the language of ""suffering"" and ""lack"" that appears. Bryson often refers to measurements and statistics about women by citing men first and then portraying women as the different or other. Although he does an excellent job of pointing out gender bias in scientific studies, his framing is redolent of those studies themselves. 3. It's not really necessary: as Bryson himself cites numerous other, recent books about the human body and human health, it's unclear why he though his addition was needed. Sure, the historical anecdotes are interesting, but they've been used numerous other times in other books on the same topic."
40,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77686200-indieflower,5,"Bill Bryson is so good at this stuff, imparting incredibly interesting information in a light, conversational tone that's easy to digest. Fascinating, informative, somewhat alarming and horrifying at times - such as the case of Fanny Burney, who in 1810 at the age of 58, underwent a radical mastectomy without anaesthesia, she not only lived long enough afterwards to write a detailed, stomach churning account of her ordeal but went on to survive another 29 years. I found it somewhat unsettling to learn how much doctors still don't know and the cheery news that it's only a matter of time before a really cracking flu pandemic decimates mankind 😬. This was a great, entertaining read, written with Bryson's usual dry humour and wit, a fun way to learn about this ""warm wobble of flesh"" we inhabit."

One of my favorites of December 2019.Very reminiscent of one of my all time favorite books in general, Bryson's  A Short History of Nearly Everything. This has that classic Bryson charm with lots of interesting factoids. Definitely a deep dive, kind of like hopping on the Magic School Bus with Miss Frizzle. Would revisit this one in the future. “Just sitting quietly, doing nothing at all, your brain churns through more information in thirty seconds than the Hubble Space Telescope has processed in thirty years. A morsel of cortex one cubic millimeter in size—about the size of a grain of sand—could hold two thousand terabytes of information, enough to store all the movies ever made, trailers included, or about 1.2 billion copies of this book.”“Pain is full of paradoxes. Its most self-evident characteristic is that it hurts–that’s what it is there for, after all–but sometimes pain feels slightly wonderful: when your muscles ache after a long run, say, or when you slide into a bath that is at once unbearably hot but also, somehow, deliciously not.”"

It doesn't hurt that his son is a practicing physician. Plus he talked to a lot of interesting people in the business. You'll likely skim parts, but it's well-worth reading. Bryson is a hell of a writer. 4.2 stars, highly recommended.Memorable anecdotes? OK, here's one: over your lifetime, you will eat something like 60 tons of food! And excrete about 7 tons of, well, ""solid waste.""● The storage capacity of your brain is estimated to be around 200 exabytes (Nature Neuroscience, 2013). Which was roughly equal to the entire digital contents of the world in 2013. I/O rates, however, are pretty pitiful.Best online reviews I saw: Nature's mini-review:""From skin to gut, the human body is a realm of wonder, and Bill Bryson’s tome explores it to its thrumming depths. The book bristles with data such as our allotment of cells (37.2 trillion) or daily faeces production (200 grams), but the star turns are Bryson’s wry forays into the histories of neuroscience, genetics, anatomy and immunology. Cue visceral gems such as diarist Samuel Pepys’s gruesome bladder-stone surgery, and US physician Chevalier Quixote Jackson’s retrieval of thousands of ingested items (including miniature binoculars and a poker chip) over his 75-year career.""https://www.nature.com/articles/d4158...WSJ has a more leisurely and thorough review:https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-body... (Paywalled. As always, I'm happy to email a copy to non-subscribers) ""According to Mr. Bryson, “running—serious, dogged, long-distance running—is the one thing we do superlatively well.” Our ancestors, with their big frontal lobes, social natures and marathoner builds, were perfectly adapted for co-operative persistence hunting. “We are not the speediest of creatures . . . but put us up against an antelope or a wildebeest on a hot day and allow us trot after it, and we can run it into the ground.”Being vertical has drawbacks. Our backs, hips and knees wear out with age. Our sinuses drain poorly and become viral cesspools every winter. And “we choke to death more easily than any other mammal.” To keep our big heads upright, our necks became longer and more centered under the skull. This had the happy side effect of making speech, and the vocal stylings of Aretha Franklin, possible. Unfortunately, it made our airways more vulnerable to accidental blockages by boluses of food."""
44,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,4,"If you’d like to learn more about how the body works but don’t want to read textbooks on human anatomy and physiology, this is the book for you. As Bryson writes, “We pass our existence within this warm wobble of flesh and yet take it entirely for granted.” We are the product of three billion years of evolutionary refinement, a biological machine of unimagined complexity, and yet most of us can’t even identify where the spleen is, or what it does.If this book doesn’t pique your interest in how your body works, then nothing probably will. Bryson takes the reader through each body system, describing the anatomy and physiology of each, but also providing historical information, expert interviews, and biographical details on the pioneers of medical discovery. Bryson, as usual, writes in an informative and entertaining way, presenting information in clever ways (for example, when he states that a portion of your cerebral cortex the size of a grain of sand can hold 1.2 billion copies of this book.) The book is filled with calculations and analogies like this to help the reader better contextualize the information.I also appreciate how Bryson doesn’t mindlessly repeat the cliches we always here without doing his research. It’s commonly stated that we only use 10 percent of our brains, or that our body contains 10 times as many bacterial cells as human cells. It turns out that these statements, among many others, are false, and Bryson shows you why. He doesn’t take anything for granted and researches all such claims.You will also come to understand—not only how much you don’t understand about the body—but also how much of the body no one understands. The body is unfathomably complex, and many areas and functions remain mysterious. If I had to say anything negative about the book, it would be the lack of illustrations. Some diagrams would be helpful, especially on the sections covering anatomy, as it’s hard to visualize the structures as he’s describing them. Also, don’t expect to dive too deeply into the functioning of each body system—the details are selective and you’re going to get equal measures of the history behind the discoveries. This is not a bad thing, as long as you’re expecting it. Overall, this is probably the best popular book on the subject, and a good entry point for further study in anatomy, physiology, human evolution, or medicine."
45,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6041973-josh,4,"This was my first foray into Bryson territory and it was an interesting experience.I finished this the day prior to Christmas just an hour or two before a nice meal. Did I feel a little guilty about what I was putting in my body directly after I read The Body? Not really, to be honest.I learned a few things here and there that I didn't know (hormones are even made in our bones!), but overall it was a reading experience that was helped along by his writing and humor.There are multiple times, practically in each chapter that he makes the statement ""fact fact fact...and no one is exactly sure why?"". That in itself makes you think.In summary, Bryson's facts and anecdotes give you: an overall sense of being in this world, educate you on just about every topic there is when it comes to your body and causes a sense of panic and a few funny faces while you read things you'd rather not know. If you're squeamish or worried about all these little things that crawl inside us or even on our scalps, face, hands, feet, etc, then...this may not be the best thing to cuddle up with this winter on a gloomy day."

This would definitely be a good one for readers who have wanted to better understand what happens inside us but who might be intimidated by real ""science-y"" books. I will say: Bryson is still a 60+ year old white man and that shows in some of how he approaches stuff in here, and his inability to humanize fat bodies or the weaknesses of ""overweight"" as the factor in many illnesses is a bit embarrassing.

There is no way you can read this book and still not believe there is a creator or want to get rid of that little life inside of his/her mother. Life is a miracle and so unbelievably complicated and perfect that it still cannot be understood by human beings -- only lived.Every molecule in our bodies has to work in perfect harmony in order for us to have a healthy life -- it is truly an amazing story. I have a degree in Applied Science and have studied biology, physiology, chemistry, etc., but this is the book that brought it all home!I have read all books authored by Bill Bryson because I love his humor -- however, this is not his normal humorous writing. This book is for education and interest. That he could take such a complicated subject matter and make it so entirely readable and understandable for any education level is genious on his part. It is a must read...."

In this case, his humor is very welcome since quite a few of the topics are... kind of scary. More than 8,000 ways to die from internal complications, antibiotics crisis, cancer..and hundreds of other diseases and malfunctions. This is not a book for a hypochondriac, but it has a ton of interesting facts. I particularly enjoyed hearing about doctors and scientists who played key roles in discovering diseases or treatments for illnesses. A lot of trial and error, a lot of poor judgement calls. A much more entertaining read than you might expect. Excellent."

I was hoping it would be something like ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" which was truly delightful and informative.

He explains the main things about each component of the body with enough detail to pretty much skim the surface on everything. He doesn't dive into the full scientific aspects but makes it readable and understandable to the masses that have a bit of scientific knowledge. The book is not for people who know nothing about the body because reading this book would be overload, but it's not for people who know a lot of knowledge about the body because they would probably know most of this book. But even people who know mostly about the body would appreciate the historic facts and backstories Bryson provides.The book goes over bodily things, what, how, why, where, and then goes into some interesting history of how we got to the what, how, why, where.A great book, definitely a re-read, tons of knowledge here. It's very textbook and it took me a long time to finish the book.I would have to re-read it for full notes but here's some that I jotted down:- we actually really don't know a lot about science, like we don't have cure's for many many conditions- spanish flu was the worst epidemic ever- Man cancer is really bad =/ treatments use to be so barbaric lol cutting off a boob with a knife- Sleep apnea, narcolepsy, insomnia, Y chromosome shrinking, a fetus having millions of eggs, reproduction- There can be so many issues with lungs. There is no cure for asthma and we don't know why or how we get it lol same with hiccups- Our immune system is super smart and can be super dumb lol""- Bipedalism (walking on two legs/feet) is actually a beautiful thing that humans have just recently developed in relation to the test of time. Even when apes walk they have to waddle because there legs, spine, even their neck/head isn't meant to stand upright.- Pancreas, spleen, gall bladder- Man... lobotomy's were really a crazy thing back then eh... sticking an ice pick past your eyeball and wiggling it around your brain gahhhhh- We have about 30 trillion human cells, and 30-50 trill bacteria cells so we’re just a big fat watery bacteria 85% of our cells are red blood cells which actually aren’t true cells at all because they don’t have the typical cell machinery like nuclei and mitochondria. Red bloods cells are only containers for hemoglobin. We'v about 20k human genes in us but 20m bacteria genes so really we are 99% bacterial and 1% you"

55,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61187238-pani,5,"Bill Bryson did it again! Honestly he can make every topic interesting! Even biology and human anatomy.Being a wonderful trave guide, this time Bryson takes us through a highly delightful tour of the human body. The book is packed with a lot of interesting information, but it’s not overwhelming or too much for a pleasure reader. It is full of astonishing facts - for instance did you know that it takes more time for food to go down in the digestive system of a woman’s body than a man’s? Or that you shed half a kilo of skin everyday? Or even a crazier one is that you get cancer everyday! Or you would do if your natural defences weren’t such troopers!The biggest takeaway I had from this book was that although mankind has had amazing accomplishments in medicine and science, we’re still a very long way from knowing how and why a lot of things work. Also, it is very possible to live a good life, we just have to take care of the body we occupy. Highly recommended!"
56,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5163359-jill-s,3,"Take a shot every time Bill Bryson says ""couch potato.""*I love Bill Bryson's writing, and this book started out strong. I found myself making little noises of surprise (huh!) throughout the first few chapters. There is a lot of interesting tidbits about biology and anatomy and all the other -ologies. Bryson brings his signature style of retelling fascinating and long-forgotten stories of the people who made scientific breakthroughs throughout history. These are the moments where Bryson really shines.Bryson's science writing does get a bit repetitive and dry towards the end, and increasingly abrupt. It does make the last quarter or fifth of this book a little bit of a slog.However, I had to knock this book down a star because Bryson's obsession with weight is truly distracting. It truly feels like he takes every opportunity, whether sensical or not, to comment on how fat we're all getting and how it's going to kill us all. I found this incredibly outdated and tone deaf, especially since much of the data he uses has been proven false, and his general tone is one of: fat people are lazy and sit down all day and if they just lived sensibly (this is verbatim, btw; ""sensibly"") then he wouldn't have to be burdened by writing about us jiggly fat lards. (Which seems rich coming from him since he, himself, is not known for being particularly svelt...but that's none of my business.) Every time I thought he was done with the fat shaming, he found another completely unnecessary moment to drop in how fat people are ill and miserable and are causing their own deaths. It truly infected a lot of the last 2/3rds of this book and was a ginormous wet blanket on this book for me.*Has anyone even said couch potato since 1998?"
57,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15962370-sarah,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading, and learned a lot from, Bryson's latest release, which meanders chapter-by-chapter through advances in medical knowledge around various human body systems and processes. However, I'm not sure that it's quite at the same level for bringing the layperson up to speed as his previous title A Short History of Nearly Everything.I was particularly struck by the number of medical and scientific pioneers who have never been widely recognised for their accomplishments, or at least not until long after their own demise. According to Bryson, there are many largely undeserved Nobel prizes out there!I should also mention that I occasionally found the copy editing rather puzzling - in several instances paragraphs ran on into completely different topics, where I feel a paragraph break would have been warranted. There was also a lot of inexplicable redirection in topics, only for the text to return to the original subject several paragraphs later. I felt the book as a whole would have been more effective, and certainly its content easier for the reader to digest, had it been edited more thoughtfully."
58,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4568901-avid,5,"This is a very informative and in-depth look at what the heck our bodies are/do. It explores disease and really cool capabilities and phenomena, in addition to just your regular functions. It’s not exactly bryson-humorous, but it does have a bit lighter tone for a science book. With bryson’s established quality/brand, this should be an easy handsell."
59,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18643650-mark-porton,3,"I was really looking forward to The Body - A Guide for Occupants - by Bill Bryson, I mean, really looking forward to it.Bryson takes us through the human body in a way that makes sense, each chapter is dedicated to a certain organ or system. He starts with the outside, the skin, and then systematically proceeds through chapters titled The Brain, The Heart and Blood, The Immune System, The Guts, Sleep and so on. This goes on for 23 chapters.I need to be careful not to be unfair here as I suppose your enjoyment of this lengthy book probably depends on what you expect from it. If you want to learn about most of the major elements of the body, particularly coming in as a freshman, this is the book for you. You will find Bryson covers each topic more than adequately and doesn't drill down too much to become academic. He touches each subject lightly and sufficiently. There is a lot to learn, and the historical insights are particularly fascinating. The latter is what Bryson usually does particularly well.My expectation here - rightly or wrongly - was to have a right, rollicking, gut busting laugh. I remember reading A Short History of Nearly Everything and there were many times in that book I just couldn't breathe, I found it that funny. Particularly the anecdotes about mad, desperate, profoundly intelligent scientists and audacious pioneers getting themselves into ludicrous situations. This is what I wanted here, chapter after chapter I was waiting for that massive belly laugh and it just didn't come. It's not only the story one normally finds funny, it's Bryson's impressive command of the English language that usually gets me. In many ways, there is nothing funnier than the written word. But for me, with this book, not this time. So, it is a good book and if you want a good all round education in pretty much everything to do with the human body with some interesting historical perspectives thrown in, you'll like this book a lot. If you are after fits of laughter, like I was, you may not get them - he's written funnier stuff.I can only give this one 3 stars, which is probably unfair as my expectations were so high.3 Stars"

It is quintessential Bill Bryson, at his best, full of humor, history, and LOADS of information about the body, all kinds of things you often wondered about (like how long food stays in your stomach or your intestines) or never thought about at all, like ow many times a day you blink (14,000). The research he clearly did for the book is extremely impressive, and I'll bet it was fun.It is taking me a while to read the book, not because I do not like it but because I am enjoying it so much. I limit myself to one or two chapters daily; there is so much content that it can be overwhelming in large doses. Let me give you one caution: it might be best to read this book when you are alone, because otherwise you are going to annoy your family members, whom you will interrupt VERY frequently because you MUST share the latest fascinating and/or funny tidbit with them. Of course, you could avoid the problem by listening to the book together; that would provoke some very interesting conversation!"
62,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36269827-autumn,3,Not recommended. If you want to read something about health find another book. This is just overall depressing. The End at the last was especially a downer. I finished much before I expected as about the last 100 pages are his notes. I really enjoy most of his books so this was a surprise to me!

It talked about the body, from up to down, inside and out. The author only briefly discusses parts of the body and tends to explain medical jargons in a way that an average person could understand. His discussions mostly begin with a historical background of the disease or operation, and then he correlates it with the disease and organ involved. Everything he talked about here (as far as I can remember) is medically correct and accurate. Highly recommended even to non-medical field related people who are just interested to know everything, but not the entirety, of the human body."
67,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11161028-kim,4,"Yet another excellent read from this author - I just love his style of writing that is informative and understandable without the tendency to baffle the reader with science, which I often find with books of this sort.

68,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/875657-ren,4,"I loved this, and I don’t really get the appeal of Bill Bryson - I always find his books kind of meh, so loving this one was a very happy surprise. Now I’ll try not to drop everything I’ve learned here into conversation as frequently as possible, but did you know that oysters can get herpes? Or that 4% of (lucky-ass) people say they’ve never gotten a headache? Or that men DON’T think about sex every seven seconds? (Why/how did we ever think they did in the first place?) This book will school you good."
69,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30833806-paul,4," I think for most of us Bill Bryson is an author we tend to associate with travel writing. I myself have spent a good few hours lost in his books. Throughout out, I have always been able to learn something of the places he has been to and also had a good laugh. This time he has turned his attention to a place a little closer to home. For all the time we spend in them, most of us know little about how the function. We all often take it for granted that they are doing what they are supposed to. Within this book, Bryson set out to give us a better understanding of just how our bodies work and for that matter keep working. The book is broken up into chapters dealing with different aspects of the human body. His aim seems to be to give us a brief understanding of each of there functions and at times how they can go very wrong. For me, this was a book that is a step or two up from your school textbooks. He gave me a better way to get into the material. In the process breaking down some of the bigger biological processes into much easier bites. More than once I was left feeling surprised at my own very limited knowledge on the subject. I think I can know peel off a great many facts to share with others. But as he admits for all we know of the human body we still have a great deal to learn. There are great swaths of information missing from our understanding. The human body is one of the most complex things and with each passing day, there are people out there in search of answers to all the questions he raises.  For a book that is very complex at times, Bryson try's his best to bring it to us on a level we can all understand. But with any such book, there will always be a great deal of information to take in. I am usually a fairly quick reader, but even for me, this book took a few days to make my way through. This is not such a bad thing I was able to stop at a certain point to delve a little deeper online and to think about what he was telling me. I would point out that his usual level of humor is missing from this book. While it does pop up from time to time. I feel this is more Bryson the educates than bubbling adventure. And while a great deal of the books is given over to just how we function, he also delves into what happens when it all goes wrong. In doing so he does not shy away from race and gender. He does his best to show that while on some levels we are all the same, these two factors I mentioned play a big deal in not only how our bodies react to illness but how we are treated when going to the hospital. I think I should count my self lucky to have grown up in Britain whilst we may not be on the top of any charters we are certainly nowhere near the bottom.  Having finished the book I appreciate this will not be one for everyone. I think a lot of die-hard Bryson fans will struggle to make it through. For me it was a great book to read, I'm always looking to expand my knowledge on all subjects. And to find one that helps me better understand my self can not be bad at all. This nook was never going to fill in all the blanks, but if you want to either refresh what you know or are looking to get a foothold in the subject of the human body Bryson is your man. "
70,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,5,"Bill Bryson is somebody else who agrees that we overtest, overoperate and prescribe too many medications, especially here in America, but, with variations by country, throughout the modern west. Nothing earthshaking in this book for me, but just a good Bryson science popularizing romp.That said, he did have one or two things that ""made me think.""One was about the idea that, due to nerve transmission speed, our eyes-to-brains system ""sees"" things with 1/5 second delay behind reality, but that the brain does its best job of confabulating what live time reality should be. Well, with recent reports on the German background of the famous, or infamous, Libet experiment, I got to wondering if maybe, even though Libet got some things wrong, BUT other things right (biggest wrong — whatever this delay is, it doesn't disprove free will in some version and it surely doesn't prove determinism), maybe there's something kind of related here.The other thing? I never knew before — even tho it has a subhead within Wiki — that Mona Lisa has no eyebrows. And is also light on eyelashes. I know many people have commented on its ""eyes follow you around the room"" effect, while also noting this isn't the only painting that does that. But — does the no eyebrows/light eyelashes help the effect?Bryson is also good on the basics of pointing out how modern medicine and biology refute the idea of ""race."" Skin color is literally one mm deep. Beyond the commonly known blood type groups, there are many others — which could be used to reclassify what a ""race"" is, if one did want to go down that road.Finally, Bryson ends with ""the end."" It's the human body. We die. Why? Without going Kurzweil, how much can we extend the lifespan? First, even as they remain in the news? Telomeres have only a small effect on the aging process. So, ignore any supplements or other claims to boost your telomeres. Second, the causes of aging are many. Third, on causes of death? Alzheimer's continues to rise, but dozens of other dementias exist. Cancer has many, many causes, and in part because of that, no cure is around the corner.In the background, with Bryson joviality, lurks a message of acceptance."
71,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75748905-elizabeth,4,"A great read if you enjoy wacky science trivia that starts at the skin and burrows all the way down to your heart, bones, and everything else packed inside us. We are definitely more than a bag of bones, and Bryson makes that abundantly clear. He does a comprehensive job of discussing each part of the human body, pointing out what we do and don’t know regarding physiology and medicine alongside the historical quirks of discovery. There are some nice pop culture references and silly humor scattered throughout to keep the info easy to digest. We never get too bogged down in the details, which is perhaps a curse if you want to know just a little bit more about something Bryson mentions. But hey, Google can’t hurt you there.This book will not be for those looking for detail. In fact, Bryson name-drops a few fantastic authors and experts in their fields, Siddhartha Murkerjee, Atul Gawande, Martin Blaser, and Jerome Groopman, to name a few. Their books a definitely worth checking out. Overall, The Body is definitely worth a read or two, so please go on ahead and dip your toes into it!"
72,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26416859-calzean,4,"Another beaut Bryson book. His usual attention to detail, little known events, plenty of facts, quirky characters and his quota of Dad jokes. It's an impressive coverage of the human body, what makes us tick and what doesn't. He highlights how much we do not know, that lifestyle has more to do with your health than medical science, that many advances were quite accidental and scientists seem to hate each other. A good book to have as a reference."

This covers so much trivia and titbits about the human body without being overly complex and pretentious, and it’s so accessible. It covers biology section by section, with a couple of side alleys into infectious diseases and other such matters. I learnt SO MUCH from this book, and just followed my Oma around the house giving her little facts about the human body as I went. I’m fairly sure I’ll have to buy my science obsessed mother a copy as well as she’ll love it. I don’t know exactly what to specify about this book as such a delight- all of it was really interesting. I suppose if there was anything I’d improve upon, it would be a couple extra bits, like wisdom teeth and the appendix, and a couple of other bits and bobs, and maybe a bit more historical information. But while it’s a little surface sometimes, it’s still marvellous to read about the wonder that is all of us. "
76,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,4,"Bryson has a great ability to explain complicated issues and provide funky facts so his tomes on how everything works in the universe, home and now in this one, on the body tend to be worthwhile reads. I got hooked on his writings with ""A Walk in the Woods"" where he attempts the Appalachian trail with a high school friend after living abroad for many years and have found his travel books about Britain, the U.S. and Australia to be very entertaining. And I guess that is why if one expects a similar level of mirth in his educational material one is likely to be disappointed. However, if some education is what you are seeking, this book will serve you well."
77,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1863589-robert-sheard,4,"3.5 stars, rounded upThis was actually far more readable and enjoyable than I would have thought, given its subject. But Bryson is a good stylist and can make even complicated scientific and medical ideas understandable for a lay-reader like me. This is essentially a tour through the body, outlining the history of what we've learned and how we've learned it about each subject. What's especially helpful is the number of readily believed ""truths"" that Bryson debunks along the way.The most frustrating chapter is the one on Medicine. In short, the USA healthcare system is a disaster of its own making through greed. For example, two objective facts:The USA, per person, spends 2.5 times as much on healthcare than the average of all other wealthy nations. And yet we rank just 31st in life expectancy. One has to wonder what we're getting for the outlandish costs.If nothing else comes out of the Coronavirus debacle in America, we should realize just how dysfunctional and corrupt our healthcare system is and fix it now."
78,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon,4,"Bill Bryson’s books are like the literary equivalent of the British panel show Qi. Like an episode of the long-running series, his books are filled with tidbits of trivia presented in a quirky and humorous way. While Bryson is often quite ambitious in tackling the subjects that interest him (attempting to explain the universe in 2003’s A Short History of Nearly Everything), no single book should be considered the definitive account on any topic.As indicated above, the disclaimer also applies to The Body. Bryson breaks down the human body and attempts to answer questions about what makes us.. us. The author tackles everything from the top of your head to the tips of your toes and everything in between. Why do we itch? Why are we filled with millions of microbes at any given time? Why are some viruses deadly and others pass through without even a sign they were there? Why on a long enough timeline, do we all eventually get cancer? These are just a few of the questions Bryson tackles in his new book.There were many moments where I audibly gasped reading this book and struggled with whether I should tell my hypochondriac partner what I read. I did read her one bit about a woman who scratched through her skull and into her brain during sleep and judging by Alaina’s scream, I hesitated to read any more unsettling parts aloud.It’s amazing the level of sophistication we have only now when it comes to surgery. Obviously, things evolve, but it is horrific to hear about the irresponsible way we even practiced lobotomies and brain surgery in the mid 1900s. No sterilization, just cram an icepick into your eye sockets and wiggle it around until you sever key components of the human brain. There’s no way we could have gotten to where we are now without having to experiment over the years, but I could think of better things to do than trying to transfuse our blood stream with beer and milk.One of the most interesting parts of the book deals with how the brain interprets the information sent by our eyes. Bryson writes that it takes one fifth of a second for what we see to be interpreted by the brain. So we are never truly seeing the present. Wild, eh? So, our brain makes up the difference by forecasting what the world will look like a fifth of a second from now. So, as Bryson says, “we are all living in a world that does not exist yet.”One thing I will say – I’m no expert in science let alone how the human body works. Maybe I have somewhat of an idea of how mine struggles to get through the day, but I couldn’t tell you if Bryson made any big errors or mistakes in this book. Luckily, there are reviews like this one who can speak more authoritatively on the matter. While the reviewer did point out a few errors, the majority of the book seems to be sound.I really enjoyed this read and definitely recommend it.. I feel like I learned a lot, or at least things that I can bring up randomly in conversations. For example, to build Benedict Cumberbatch from scratch would cost you $151,578.46. So, there’s that."
79,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21637893-chris-steeden,4,"You know what you are going to get from a Bryson book of this type. Quirky stories aligned to historical/modern facts about the subject at hand. The subject at hand is you. Well, your body. All of it. From top to toe and all bits in-between. From the time you were conceived to the time you die.What a great journey it is. I was boring the family by stopping them watching Saturday evening TV by telling them facts about their body that they didn’t really want to hear that I found fascinating. Do you know that 59 elements are needed to construct a human being. Carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus account for 99.1%. Did you know that the formal name for skin is the cutaneous system. The inner layer is called the dermis. The outer layer is called the epidermis. Skin and hair are made largely of the same stuff – keratin. There are so many more examples of this. You can see why they wanted to lock me away in the kitchen to read and stop bothering them.The thing is with Bryson is that he knows how to weave a really complicated subject into a text that is readable, entertaining and educating. Admittedly a lot of the facts and stats he throws at you are mind-boggling. I took about 5 pages of A4 notes. It could have been a lot more but I would have ended up just copying the book.The research is, of course, extensive. He spoke to so many people and must have read a load of medical journals and books. Some of the stories on these early, mainly Victorian, medical pioneers who would experiment on themselves to see if certain techniques, drugs and even surgery would work sometimes with great effect but a lot of the time failing resulting in terrible injuries including death.What do you think the most devastating disease in history is? It infected nearly everyone that was exposed to it. It killed 30% of its victims. 500 million died.In 1872 Charles Darwin published a book on expressions and it showed that all people, whatever their race, shared a common heritage. Fear, anger, surprise, pleasure, disgust and sorrow are universal. The most universal of them all is the smile. Keep Smiling everyone."

I first read A Short History of Nearly Everything when it came out, and I was stunned at how much I understood and liked science. I even understood string theory for a total of about six minutes. But it was something!I have been on the Bryson tip since then, usually with rewarding results. I have loved his books on travel, the English language, Shakespeare, and more. I couldn’t quite get into At Home, but I think I might want to retry that one, because I loved this book. It does everything that a listicle will do for your sense of understanding, but probes deeper and casts a wider net. It is so much more interesting than those pithy articles from the Internet.We get to almost all of it: birth and death, sight and taste, emotion and sex. Some of the historical names get lost in the morass, but that doesn’t matter so much if, when you’re reading it, it compels you this deeply. And indeed it compels, giving us history of communicable diseases, the dividing line between when a zygote becomes a baby, and how, exactly, my color blind eyes work.There should be a tendency to get grim. There are so many statistics, so many I don’t knows, that it might be simpler for Bryson to simply shrug and say science doesn’t know much. But one of Bryson’s strengths is that he loves to follow footnotes to sources. The Body is thorough; but that doesn’t mean it’s dry. I listened to the audiobook read by Bryson himself. I love his orating voice, and the way he emphasizes certain words in his half-British/half-American accent. He is very good at what he does here, in both delivery and content. If you really like Brysons earlier work, I highly recommend trying this one out. You won’t regret it."
81,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10601562-shawn,5,"My first book by Bill Bryson was ""A Short History of Nearly Everything."" Since reading it, I have frequently included a Bryson book or two in my yearly reading and have suggested them to others. The Body is sure to be another book I will regularly recommend (and in fact already have).The book itself winds through the system's of the body one after another. Bryson discusses what makes up the system, the important discoveries and discovers of parts in the system, always with an eye toward what makes for a good story. Finishing with the systems, he moves on to the functions of the body, illness and causes of disease, and finally death. Even knowing a good amount about anatomy and scientific history, I found myself learning while reading things book. This was particularly true when he discussed new research and interviews with scientists on the cutting edge of physiology or disease research. However, don't mistake this as a boring textbook. While this does not contain the wit and sarcasm of his travelogues or even Brief History, Bryson has a style of writing that keeps you engaged and reading well past the time when you should have gone to bed. I recommend this book for anyone interested in anatomy in particular or science as a whole. You are sure to learn something and have fun doing it. Thank you to the publisher and Netgalley for the opportunity to read a pre-release copy this book."
82,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74694059-melissa,3,"For me this one was just ok. It’s likely to be more interesting to someone who has little medical knowledge, as much of the material he covered I already knew. I did enjoy some of the historical context he provided. I was disconcerted by some of his errors, though, and it made me wonder what mistakes he might have made that I didn’t know enough to catch. For example, he stated that all senses except smell are routed through the hypothalamus. They actually go through the thalamus. That might seem like a minor error, but it’s pretty basic neuroscience, and even my Intro Psych students know it. It was also a little annoying to listen to him read the book even though I generally enjoy him as a narrator. He mispronounced a number of medical/scientific terms (systole, diastole, encephalitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, etc), which again seems nitpicky, but it took away from the experience for me. I did learn a few interesting things, though. For example, apparently left-handed kids who are forced to write with their right hands are at increased risk of stuttering, which I found fascinating.I don’t want to dog on this book too much. I think Bill Bryson is fantastic, generally. But I would recommend A Walk in the Woods, A Short History of Nearly Everything, and The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid far, far above this one."
83,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2475612-kyle-muntz,5,"I'm becoming increasingly convinced Bill Bryson is one of the great prose stylists of the English language. That sounds bizarre, I know, but look at this: ""The skin consists of an inner layer called the dermis and an outer epidermis. The outermost surface of the epidermis, called the stratum corneum, is made up entirely of dead cells. It is an arresting thought that all that makes you lovely is deceased. Where body meets air, we are all cadavars. These outer skin cells are replaced every month. We shed skin copiously, almost carelessly; some twenty five thousand flakes a minute, over a million pieces every hour. Run a finger along a dusty shelf, and you are in large part clearing a path through fragments of your former self. Silently and remorselessly we turn to dust.""This goes on for 500 pages without a single boring paragraph. Essentially, he uses every tool a writer has to supercharge information--and he's incredibly good at it. The book is often quite funny, but occasionally quite profound or even shocking. I've devoured each of his science-themed books in a few days, and it seems I won't be able to resist at least trying out the ones on language."
84,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84417243-jenn-of-the-bookish-society,4,"My first Bryson book was A Walk in the Woods. It was hilarious, all the while sneaking in some education. I went to read almost everything he has in print. So when I saw this title on my ARC list, I was pretty excited, even though human anatomy might be my least favorite subject.I could hold my own now if I needed to critique a television medical drama from the knowledge I gained in reading this ginormous 400-page tome of humanness. It's a partial history of science and part straight-up anatomy.It's the owner's manual that no one has thought to hand out. Only this isn't some hard to understand volume; it's in plain English. I didn't take Anatomy at school and the only text I've encountered while homeschooling was nowhere near as readable as this is. If you are a science geek, you'll devour this. If you are a Bryson fan, he'll drag you into being interested, and if you wanted to use this as a high school science text, I'd support you. I'm probably going to make it required reading at our house."
85,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2064374-gretchen,4,"I REALLY liked this book. I am biased because in my imagination Bill Bryson is a friend with whom I chat often and from whom I learn all sorts of fascinating things. In reality, Mr Bryson is an author whom I’ve never met but who entertained me for the last two and a half months with facts about the human body that I have repeated aloud so often to friends and family that every time they find my words interesting they ask me if I learned it from “your Body Book”. Most of the time the answer was yes. I learned so many things in each and every chapter. Perhaps the most important to me was that a person cannot “undo sitting” or negate its detrimental effects on the body by activity or exercise. As a result of this singular fact, I read many of these 400 pages while standing. True fact. This is one of those books that at the end I am better off, mind and body, as it happens, for having read!"

Bryson takes on the brain and skin and hair and the skeleton and the immune system and lungs and food and guts and sleep and birth and nerves and pain and disease and cancer and death. He tells the stories of the scientists behind the discoveries about the body. Everything is backed with science and footnotes, and that’s part of the delight in this book, but the other part are the anecdotes about the body and the people studying the body, and that’s a true joy.This is the kind of book that (probably) drives everyone else in your family crazy; you read a little and you can’t help yourself from reading parts of it aloud, and then you laugh together and walk away, and you read some more, and then you share some more, and on and on to the end. A new favorite nonfiction read."
87,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2641352-marie-uk,2,"I think whether or not you enjoy this book depends on your current level of knowledge about the subject matter. For me there was nothing new in the is book and to some extent an over emphasis on figures such as the length of this, that and the other. There were also blatantly wrong statements. Bryson describes a cancer hospital in the Netherlands, its patients (all ventilated according to the author) scooting around on toy cars or bicycles. I feel he must be referring to naso-gastric tubes rather than ones to help you breathe. Such a mistake is unforgivable not only on the part of the author but of the editors. Readers should be able to trust the information they are given in non-fiction"

When he takes apart our body, system by system, piece by piece we not only understand more about our inner workings but we have been thoroughly entertained along the way. He is the master of anecdote, the king of clever tidbits of knowledge and easygoing writing style gives you a greater appreciation for the intricate machine we call our body.

I appreciated how it went area-by-area through the body including some analyses of the lesser appreciated functions like equilibrium, sleep, and more.I think the title ""a guide for occupants"" lives up to its name.

Also moderately terrifying is how often Bryson and the many doctors and scientists he consulted for this book admit that this organ/procedure/portion of the brain does X...but we don't know how, or why. Honestly, the book could be alternately titled ""The Body: How the F*** Does It Work?"""

I don't think the bar is high for that, because the body is wow no matter what. But one of Bryson's serious talents is to distill big things down to understandable chunks, and he definitely succeeds in that here.But also, there is a LOT LOT LOT of fatphobia in this book. Like so much I *almost* put it down. So I don't know, if you're triggered by that, definitely avoid this."

Being active for an hour or more a day improved life expectancy by 4.2 years. ***The fact is, you can quickly undo a lot of exercise by eating a lot of food, and most of us do. ***A study of eighteen thousand runners in Denmark concluded that people who jog regularly can expect to live five to six years longer on average than non-joggers. But is that because jogging truly is that beneficial, or is it because people who jog tend to lead healthy, moderate lives anyway and are bound to have improved outcomes over us more slothful types, with or without sweatpants? ***In one well-known experiment cited by the British academic Steve Jones, a test subject ran a marathon on a treadmill while the room temperature was gradually raised from minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit to 131 degrees Fahrenheit—roughly the limits of human tolerance at both extremes. Despite the subject’s exertions and the great range of temperatures, his core body temperature deviated by less than one degree over the course of the exercise. ***As an experiment, we asked a lady who was completely blind—she had lost her rods and cones as a result of a genetic disease—to tell us when she thought the lights in the room were switched on or off. She told us not to be ridiculous because she couldn’t see anything, but we asked her to try anyway. It turned out she was right every time. Even though she had no vision—no way of ‘seeing’ the light—her brain detected it with perfect fidelity at a subliminal level. She was astonished.

97,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3049657-victoria,4,"I have read - and enjoyed - several of Bryson's earlier books, so his name always catches my eye. This one, his latest, is not at all a memoir, but instead a rather comprehensive view of human biology. This overview touches on many subjects - from the specifics of diseases, impacts of lifestyle choices, details on how organs function alongside quick biographical highlights of many Novel prize winners and others who have made significant discoveries in medicine and deepening your understanding of your own body.There is a lot crammed into this volume - with many interesting footnotes, anecdotes and facts that are fun to share as you read along. The chapters are clearly broken down by subject and though there are a few references to information revealed in later or earlier chapters, for the most part, there isn't even a reason to read this consecutively (so if you are the most interested in the heart - start there!). I think this would be a perfect book to slowly read - a friend of mine mentions that she has a few books always on the go like that (one on her nightstand for just before bed reading, another in the car for reading while waiting on her kids in the pick up line). Because I did read it consecutively, without breaks, it did stand out that Bryson really stressed the poor health of America over his adopted country of Great Britain. I don't think this would have been as obvious had I read this more slowly, over a longer period of time. It is an interesting read and one that definitely feels well-researched. I can see this as a nice addition to your home reference library. And I am curious to see what direction Bryson will go in next. "

Many of them were accidental. Others were more malicious. I had previously read about the horrific experiments conducted by Nazi scientists during WWII on prisoners and Jews but until this book, I was unaware that the Japanese did the same thing against the Chinese during the war at a location called Unit 731 in which it's estimated that 250 thousand people died.

He outlines the history of acquiring knowledge from the most conceivable moment up to the present day, citing the discoveries of various parts of the body when they occurred and by whom. Myths are dispelled such as taking vitamin C will help get rid of a cold or that we need to drink eight glasses of water a day. He discusses practices to help an individual live a healthy, quality of life such as couch potatoes (those sitting six or more hours a day) can benefit by walking around during commercials to burn 180 calories an hour or just standing to burn 107 calories an hour. Recommendations by the World Health Organization such as the daily recommendation for sugar intake is a maximum of five teaspoons are also presented. A muliitude of diseases have come and gone, only to replaced by another disease such as the Heartland virus in 2018. Now there is the Coronavirus which is new since the publication of The Body. How operations have evolved over the years with some horrendous descriptions of earlier operations such as the mastectomy of Fanny Burney, an English novelist, in 1810. Bryson reiterates Daniel E.

Let me find out more. This book is what I imagine would be the outcome of that moment. This is a sweeping and wide-ranging account of your body from head to toe (with cameos by the various non-human organisms that make us who we are). Bryson chooses to focus on facts and stories--what we know, and how we came to know this, which makes for some very engaging stories. Some themes recur throughout--how a lot of what we assume is common knowledge is myth (8 glasses of water a day, using only 10% of our brain, our body having 10 times more microbes as human cells), how we cannot trust corporates to do the right thing (the opioid crisis, the food industry shoving bad things down our throats, the lobbying by the tobacco industry), and just how little we truly understand when we dig deeper (how does an itch arise?) It's a tome for sure, but the length feels just right. If there was anything I had a problem with, it was the author's focus on the White world--there is a touch of Euro/America centrism that feels outdated in this age. "

Timing is everything and I was the first person to check it out at my library! The book is filled with amazing facts and stories about how the human body works, medical science, and the history of medicine. The author's particular writing style, relaying all these science facts within anecdotal stories, is what makes it so entertaining and fun to read. And it definitely helps with my retention of scientific information, especially as I get older! Several parts of the book were devoted to the brain, memory and aging, so, yes, I am sure I was his target audience! My main take-away from this book is despite all our advances and increased knowledge of the human body, we really know so little and so much of what we know is still theory and guesswork. I highly recommend The Body. It reminds me of Mary Roach's writing style. I will be looking out for more books by Bill Bryson."

As a result, he can unpack any topic into the most fascinating thing you’ve ever read. The Body: A Guide for Occupants is no exception. Each chapter focuses on a body part or process, similar to the format of his book At Home focusing on the house and its functions. As with his other books, he has a knack for tracking down mind-boggling statistics and facts. So while some of these you may recall from biology class, he manages to find other intricate details and relays them in a clear, witty manner. And while we have come such a long way in learning and discovering the body's inner workings, there's much that's still a mystery to medical science. I just kept thinking, ""Wow - this is the place that houses all of my thoughts, feelings and physical attributes and there's still so much I don't know about it."" We truly are a work in progress."

It’s amazing to me how much we have no knowledge of - or guesses at best.As others have noted, not for the squeamish or those bothered by descriptions of sickness/disease/etc. I’m generally not a squeamish person, but one woman’s first-hand account of her 1810 mastectomy was extremely difficult to read.Unfortunately, the gender binary is very much enforced, especially in the chapter on reproductive organs. I wonder if this is a reflection of the comparatively small amount of scientific research on gender as a spectrum. I think it would have been good to at least mention the concept of being trans though."

He has a wonderful outlook on things that I wish most people would adapt into their daily lives. Somehow, finding the humor in things that seem to not have a jot of it brings out the best in yourself and can calm you down.Anyways, that being said, there are facts galore in this look at what makes you you that may or may not distress you. Always entertaining and interesting despite being oft times gross and - well - grosser, Bill Bryson does not disappoint.The ending (which is about your ending) I found to be rather short. But life sometimes goes that way doesn't it."

It’s heavy on science, but in a good way with fun facts thrown in- like the surface area of our lungs (if they were spread out) would cover a tennis court. And we excrete millions of red blood cells a day. Wow!It’s a long book and sometimes I skimmed a bit of the history having to do with the researchers/discoverers of certain theories/drugs/genes/diseases/etc. but it was a very smooth blend of “here’s how this discovery in 1865 got us to where we are today”. Each chapter is a different part of the body and I feel much more educated on how our bodies work and the true miracle that we are!"

He's a wonderful author with an amazingly articulate and witty voice. This particular book is jam-packed with facts, to the point where I had to read it one chapter at a time or my brain would get overwhelmed. It's a dense book and might be a slow read, but Bryson's voice gives it life in a way that other authors would lose my interest. He keeps it witty and engaging the entire time. "
108,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5889908-linda-bond,5,"Ever since reading “Little Dribbling,” I have been watching for a new book from Bill Bryson. He’s known best for his science-related books, of course, so he is sure to please all of his fans with this latest offering. And what an offering it is! An homage to the great gift that is the human body, this narrative is filled with all of the facts – both fun and serious – you need to truly respect what The Body does for us. Between Bill Bryson and Malcom Gladwell, I am a happy literary-science camper. Got more? Bring it on!I met this book at Auntie's Bookstore in Spokane, WA"

As a medical professional, I had to undergo many years of learning about anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry to earn my degree. I loved learning about the science that makes us human, and I still do! Thus, The Body: A Guide for Occupants, was a real winner with me. Bryson has a way of relating information that makes reading nonfiction feel fun and engaging. I recommend this read for anyone who enjoys learning about science and humans and what makes us, us."
110,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12857-rachel,3,"Needs more funny.The human body is amazing in two different ways: one, for what we know about it and how we came to know it; and two, what we don't know about it and the efforts we have made to get answers. This book needed to choose one or the other, or it needed to tell it all. As it is, it seems stuck in the middle. I wanted more stories and anecdotes. Bryson seems to have forgotten himself in the writing of this trying to get through the various workings of different body parts."
111,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113980-trin,3,"Fun, Bryson-y...but I'm not sure there's anything in here I haven't encountered elsewhere--Mary Roach and many others spring to mind as examples of writers who've covered the same territory.

118,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92395661-banshee,4,"This book should replace the current biology textbooks at schools. It's much more accurate, up-to-date AND extremely interesting. I feel that I have learnt more about human body than I ever did during all my school years (a long time ago). The author gives us a tour of the human body through all its systems such as integumentary system, nervous system and respiratory system. We explore the role of every single element of the body, we learn about how we came to have the current medical knowledge and what we are still missing, as well as about everything that can go wrong in the marvelous yet imperfect machine that the human body is.The author focuses a lot on people to whom we owe everything we know today. Many of the geniuses that propelled the medical knowledge forward were often very flawed or outright horrible people outside of their profession. It gives perspective on the people that refuse to read extraordinary books written by morally doubtful writers. It's about separating people from their work.What I found the most terrifying just how much we still don't know about our own bodies. We can do close to nothing about autoimmune diseases (which I was unfortunately already aware of, since I myself suffer from one), cancer and other things in pretty every single human system.There were also many facinating trivia facts, for example: - Autoimmune diseases are ""sexist"" and 80% of sufferers are women. - Many women needlessly die of heart attacks, because they are misdiagnosed due to the male bias in what we know about the symptoms (women often have completely different symptoms than men!). - The race, which has played and unfortunately still plays such a huge role in human history and modern time, is nothing but a thin layer of cells in the outer skin. - The idea of growing human organs in animals for transplanting gave a creepy Oryx and Crake vibe *shudders*. - Humans enjoy animal suffering. They torture animal in labs and they call it animal testing. The problem is that animals are different species than humans and they have very different metabolism, suffer from different diseases, etc. So people inflict horrible suffering on them, and there are no real benefits for humanity, apart from sadists enjoying themselves. And guess where a lot of worst diseases come from, including the biggest epidemics? Animal farming. Karma is a bitch. *munches on a vegan burger* Except we all suffer for the pleasure of meat-eaters' taste buds. - Cancerous cells appear in our bodies a few times a week and are promptly detected and destroyed by our immune system. Until they aren't. If we live long enough, we pretty much all get cancer. Scary…
Personal note
So this is a note for my future self, to give the interesting context in which I was reading this book. As I write this review, we are right in the middle of Covid-19 pandemic. I didn't plan on reading a medical non-fiction featuring diseases and epidemics now. I was waiting in the library queue for this book for a few months, long before anyone suspected what times we would find ourselves in. My hold finally arrived when the first news about unknown virus in China started spreading around the world. I got opportunity to read this book slowly instead of hurrying through (since renewal for popular books is not possible), because the national lock-down happened, the libraries closed from day to day and I was left with all my check-outs for unknown amount of time. As such, when I reached the chapter about infectious diseases, I was in my third (or fourth?) week of working from home, just as most of the people who were fortunate not to lose their jobs. And then this quotation came up: The fact is, we are really no better prepared for a bad outbreak today than we were when Spanish flu killed tens of millions of people a hundred years ago. The reason we haven't had another experience like that isn't because we have been especially vigilant. It's because we have been lucky.Well, it seems that our luck has finally run out…"

120,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,3,"I had pretty mixed feelings about this book. I’m a big fan of Bryson as a humorist. I value a good laugh over many other things in life, and Bryson is one of the funniest people I’ve ever encountered. The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt kid is possibly the funniest book I’ve ever read in my entire life. I came across my first Bill Bryson book on the dusty shelf of a house in which I was staying in Europe a few years ago, it was The Lost Continent, Travels in Small-Town America. That book had me in splits for the rest of my trip and brought me so much joy. I still quote it on road trips in America. In short, I think Bryson excels as an essayist, a travel writer, and a humorist in general. But he has this other big passion, to catalogue. I enjoyed a Short History of Nearly Everything, but I went into this book with a rather more critical scientific eye because as a neuroscientist, my education is in the life sciences. The tone and writing of the book were excellent and entertaining, we already know Bryson is a dynamite writer. This book was totally enjoyable. But factually, I’m not as convinced. The book is impressive in its scope and detail, especially for a non-scientist, and Bryson’s joy in learning the material comes through robustly. However the actual biological information contained in this book is kind of a hodgepodge. Some sections are really well nuanced and do a great job of citing good primary resources. For example, the section on leptin was presented better than many endocrinology texts I’ve read, making it clear that leptin is a hormone that is thought to signal a paucity of body fat when it is low, and stimulates appetite to remedy the situation. Leptin does not work as a supplement for overweight people, because above a certain threshold, it does not affect appetite appreciably. It did not evolve to signal as a regulator of excessive weight gain. The section on the prostate was also really well presented. Bryson discusses at some length the false positive rate of many preventative cancer screenings, PSA among them. This section mostly draws on the work of Richard J Ablin, who invented the PSA test, making him a very appropriate primary resource. But then, throughout the book Bryson does things like cite Daniel Lieberman extensively about things like the biochemistry of nutrition, even though Lieberman’s education is in anthropology. He’s not an expert on any of the fields Bryson cites him for, he just speaks about them accessibly, and as a result, much of the factual content of these sections is questionable. As a neuroscientist, I took special issue with the portion on neurogenesis over the lifespan. Bryson claims that it is hotly debated whether humans make new brain cells as we age. This is not true, there is a strong consensus in neuroscience that new neurons are formed throughout the lifespan. Bryson points to two opposing studies, one finding that new neurons were made in the hippocampus, and others finding that they were not. This is a misinterpretation of the second study, which actually found that the new neurons in the hippocampus were formed elsewhere and migrated into the hippocampus. Additionally, he claims that whether or not we make new neurons is sort of a moot point because it is nowhere near enough to compensate for the rampant neuronal loss we experience with aging. This is completely untrue and based on studies largely conducted in the 1950’s-1970’s which did not correct for volumetric changes in the aging brain. The best evidence to date says that there is no significant neuronal loss associated with normal aging, or that we lose perhaps 2-4% of neurons over the lifespan in normal aging. While there is some shrinkage of neuronal outgrowths, cell loss is not typical outside of pathological conditions like Alzheimer’s disease. In short, this book is interesting, funny, and a charming read. But if something in it seems radical or hard to believe to you, I’d encourage investigating other primary sources of info about that topic. "
121,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237742-sharon,5,"In his Bill Bryson breezy prose, the author has chosen the human body as the subject for this tome and because that’s just the way he writes, it’s eminently readable - and enjoyable. I found myself saying Huh or outright laughing on many occasions. For instance, “Ollivere gently incised and peeled back a sliver of skin about a millimeter thick from the arm of a cadaver. It was so thin as to be translucent. ‘That,’ he said, ‘is where all your skin color is. That’s all that race is —a sliver of epidermis.’” That got a Huh from me when I first read it and another Huh as I reread it just now.When he divulges information, he adds a example that we can relate to illustrate his point. For instance when he tells us that the region of the forebrain is associated with pleasure which grows to its largest size in teen years. “That is why the sensations you feel as a teenager are more intense than at any other time of life. But it also means that seeking pleasure is an occupational hazard for teenagers.” Instantly I thought of my son and the impulsive things he had done with bad outcomes. And I had to read that part out loud to my husband. In fact, I had to read out loud to him on several occasions. I’m sure he’s glad I’ve finished the book.There are factoids scattered though the chapters, like how MSG got it’s bad reputation. We read about the rise in diabetes throughout the world which probably comes as a surprise to no one. But who knew that that type I diabetes in Finland has risen 550 percent since 1950 and continues to rise almost every where else at a rate of 3-5 percent. No one knows why. Huh!Or that people who had their tonsils removed while young have a 55% great chance of having a heart attack in later life. Really?!!I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as I do all of Bryson’s books, and if you’re wondering how a book on the human body could be engaging, take my word for it. It is."
122,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34016478-dori-sabourin,5,"Bill Bryson, through extensive reading, has compiled a book all about the body. He outlines the history of acquiring knowledge from the most conceivable moment up to the present day, citing the discoveries of various parts of the body when they occurred and by whom. Myths are dispelled such as taking vitamin C will help get rid of a cold or that we need to drink eight glasses of water a day. He discusses practices to help an individual live a healthy, quality of life such as couch potatoes (those sitting six or more hours a day) can benefit by walking around during commercials to burn 180 calories an hour or just standing to burn 107 calories an hour. Recommendations by the World Health Organization such as the daily recommendation for sugar intake is a maximum of five teaspoons are also presented. A muliitude of diseases have come and gone, only to replaced by another disease such as the Heartland virus in 2018. Now there is the Coronavirus which is new since the publication of The Body. How operations have evolved over the years with some horrendous descriptions of earlier operations such as the mastectomy of Fanny Burney, an English novelist, in 1810. Bryson reiterates Daniel E. Lieberman, professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard: belief that 70 percent of the diseases that kill us could easily be preventable if we would just live sensibly"
123,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16404987-john-behle,4,"Reading through many of the GR and literary journal reviews, a high percentage of readers like relating the stats from this latest offering from Bill Bryson. Several copies of, ""the flight attendant who survived a fall of 33,000 ft, cushioned by fir trees; the Spanish diver who held his breath for 24 minutes."" Bet you didn't know this one: a study of 60 people’s belly buttons found 2,368 species of bacteria, 1,458 of them “unknown to science.”Okay. Fun facts.My takeaway from this (I listened to the CD audiobook edition, wryly narrated by Bryson) is yes, the sheer beauty of our bodies, the wonderful safeguards, fail-safes that our being transmit to us...and the mind-body connection. Sometimes those transmissions are outright red neon warnings, such as, ""not one more bite...I'm full!""So much of our healthcare culture is waiting for the next miracle drug. Funding the latest screening device or test. Traveling long distances to the highest rated and marketed care facility. Then, who pays for all this?Yet, our bodies, our minds, our innate feelings counsel and guide us every moment. Bryson lets this mantra of self knowledge, self direction, bubble up and float through his book. We all know the placebo effect. It's in here. People reported feeling better after taking a placebo, even after being told beforehand, it's a placebo.Our bodies crave good health. Our bodies are designed and built to move. That same body will tell the occupant when to rest. How and when to nourish. How to educate the mind to detect and then act on these feelings better. The lessons are repeated until learned. Happy, sharing people live, as an average, longer.We just have to listen. "
124,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/671457-carin,5,"I love Bill Bryson! I have read every book he's written (even his dictionary! Seriously!) I love the most his books on giant single subjects and yet I'm also always astonished when he comes up with a new area for those. The Body may be his best yet.As always, it's utterly filled with trivia, bizarre fact, and anyone with just a passing understanding of anatomy and medicine will find something fascinating every few minutes. Did you know that if all your DNA was made into a single strand and stretched out end to end, it was stretch past Pluto and out of the solar system? Did you know that most stutterers are left-handed? And that stuttering is much worse in those who are left-handed but were forced to learn to write right-handed? Did you know that we get 2-5 cancer cells every single day of our lives, which our immune systems get rid of? And that kissing is a surprisingly bad way to spread a cold? My husband doesn't have any idea how lucky he is that I listened to this book while I was out of town and he was spared a massive amount of gasping and me telling him interesting things endlessly (he still got a few). And you need to have no prior knowledge or interest in the subject at all--I nearly failed my high school biology class.Mr. Bryson narrates the book himself, and I know some people find him an annoying narrator, but I do not at all. He has developed a bit of a British accent and I find him charming. It's the best of both worlds where he sounds fancy and slightly foreign but he doesn't pronounce words like ""laboratory"" in that bizarre British way.I found the book utterly delightful, completely fascinating, and I wish it had been twice as long."
125,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,1,"One of the earliest books I ever read was by Bryson, and I remember it fondly. So it was a little disappointing to read this book and realize how superficial of an author he is. He really says a lot of stupid stuff because, apparently, he doesn't know any better:* Claims red blood cells ""aren't true cells at all"" because they lack nuclei. Tell that to a prokaryote!* Claims some lady scratched through her own skull, which is a gross misrepresentation (source).* He defines organic chemicals as chemicals ""from living things"". Wrong. They contain carbon.* He gives a poor description of complex carbohydrates, and incorrectly claims they have the ""same effect on blood glucose"" as the equivalent amount of sugar. Tell that to a diabetic!* He provides a scientifically illiterate review of Ancel Keys and the Mediterranean diet.* He repeats the snake oil salesman's lie that ""doctors can go through medical school without being taught nutrition"".* Nowhere in an enite chapter on nutrition is there so much as mention of the word ""macromolecule""! Simply unacceptable.* He repeats the snake oil salesman's other lie that chemotherapy is ""like mustard gas"" which takes the cake for being both anti-medicine and profoundly ignorant of basic biochemistry.Don't tell me these are necessary simplifications to reach a larger audience.They're outrageous mistakes that any scientifically literate editor should have caught."
126,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22990116-laura,4,"Bill Bryson is one of my absolute favorite authors, so I was so excited to receive an advance copy of this book to read! If you enjoyed his previous books At Home and A Short History of Nearly Everything, then you'll also like this one. It's basically a fascinating, witty, and concise overview of the different systems that make up the human body, along with the diseases, viruses, etc. that plague us. As with all Bryson books, I loved his signature wit and the plethora of little known, captivating facts he includes. In fact, there were times when Bryson devoted only a single sentence to a particular fact, such as some unbelievable brain disorders (being convinced you're dead when you're really alive, being blind but sure you can see, etc.) that I wished he would have expanded on. Perhaps part of Bryon's brilliance, however, is in engaging the reader's curiosity and giving us plenty to ponder and research ourselves once the book is over. I know whenever I finish one of his books that I'm going to have a list of further reading and topics for discovery thanks to all the irresistible tidbits he mentions."
127,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4449127-emily,5,"4.5 starsAdvance copy provided by NetGalley.At the beginning, I was a bit overwhelmed by the waterfall of facts descending upon me, but once I settled into his style, I really enjoyed this. Besides the abundance of facts about human anatomy, a subject I felt I needed to learn more about, there’s fascinating medical history and biographical information about pioneers in the field of medicine. What struck me most in this book is that so many discoveries and theories that are common knowledge today were initially rejected. Scientists whose ideas were initially met with scorn were later awarded Nobel prizes. Another rather chilling recurring theme of the book is how little we know about the body, aging, and diseases, even in this modern age when we’re supposed to have it all figured out (right?). His notes and bibliography at the end are impressive, and I plan to use the latter as a source for future reading material. There’s a lot of territory to cover, so nothing is terribly in-depth, but the book is an interesting, thought-provoking overview of what we know so far about what makes us tick."
128,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4757911-joanne-clarke-gunter,4,"I enjoyed reading this book just as I have all of the Bryson books I have read. He has an easy, amusing writing style that always makes for pleasurable reading. There are many interesting facts in this book, but because I have read so many medical/disease/health care type books, there were also many things I had read before and already knew. The chapters on the brain and sleep were overviews for me since I have read a number of books on both subjects and the chapters in this book are rather short given the subject matter, but this book is attempting to cover all of the human body and so the chapters are necessarily short. The chapters on skin and hair, the heart and blood, and the skeleton are fascinating. This book is an interesting summary of most everything about our human bodies and is well worth reading. It is sprinkled with interesting anecdotes about various famous doctors, scientists, and patients that add greatly to the book as it documents the history of medical discovery about the human body and the advancement of that knowledge. "
129,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22778865-g-r-matthews,5,"Audio book.I think I have enjoyed every Bill Bryson book I've ever read or listened to, and that is the majority of his books. This one focuses upon the human body and does not shy away from any area. The information is, as always, exacting and delivered in such a way that understanding is guaranteed. You'll also be charmed by the little asides, stories, and interviews. The last section on cancer and death was excellent, if a somewhat depressing end to the book (I don't think it could have been avoided, much like death itself), and there was an air of reassurance about it.Some of the worst information you discover along the way is the awfulness of US healthcare statistics, and the awfulness of UK healthcare statistics (esp cancer survival) - for two very wealthy countries, something seriously needs to be change!Anyway, if you can cope with that, this book is an incredible read (listen) and I recommend it to everyone!"
130,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4826452-evan-wondrasek,5,"I loved everything about this book. But most of all, every time I read it, I learned something new. As much as it seems like we already know our own bodies, there is so much that I had no idea about.Overall, this book favors breath over depth, which is fine. There are lots of other great books out there to dive into topics like microbiology of the stomach or aging or genetics, but this book did a great job of giving a high-level view while giving just enough detail to understand it without becoming overly complex or boring. And, on top of that, the author was super funny and made it enjoyable to learn about some topics that were difficult, like aging, death, and dementia.I'm super excited to read this book again in the future, and this book also referred me to many other books that I hadn't heard of before that I'll probably check out next.This book is probably my favorite of all the books I've read this year."
131,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101492474-june,5,"I must admit that Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything was a slog for me, while Notes from a Small Island and A Walk in the Woods are among my favorite books, so perhaps I lean more toward his less science-focused works. The Body is a useful, approachable exploration with memorable stories (in particular, I feel like I will remember every astonishing story from the sleep chapter for a long time), but with less of the humor and lightness that some of his other books possess. Still, it's an accessible enough read that I can recommend it for my students, and it inspired me to take better care of my own body, so overall, that's a win.Thanks to the publishers and NetGalley for the digital ARC."

It is a very thourough summary of what happens in our bodies, with a lot of focus on what can go wrong. As usual some science history as well, and I have learned a lot of new things.But I have mainly learned that there is a lot that we don't know yet about how our body really works, and that we are a wonder of science. Also, it appears that being born and living in Europe has a lot of benefits when compared with living in the US. Good to know!I recommend it to everyone that likes science and science's history, people who like to know more and enjoy fun trivia. However, beware, if you have a tendencie towards hypocondria, nothing good will come from reading this. You will itch all over. "
133,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/340071-barbara,5,"Bill Bryson is a natural and gifted teacher. I've said that before in at least one review, but it is worth saying again. He is better known for his humorous travel books but when he decides to cover a subject, I pay attention. In this case, he provides a class in physiology that is better and more understandable than anything I've read elsewhere. The information he is providing is up to date with everything I've seen recently and also what I've heard from my doctor. The big bonus was that I listened to an unabridged audiobook production and Bill Bryson read it. Unlike many authors, he is a very good narrator. I got the print book from my library to read over a few sections that I wanted to review. I actually would buy this as a reference book if my library didn't already own it."
134,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/854699-brian,5,"In Bill Bryson's The Body, he talks about all aspects of the human body, literally from head to toe. He begins at the head, goes into the brain, the heart, the lungs, as well as almost every single major organ and aspect of our bodies. While this sounds like it can be an extremely dull topic, Bryson spices up the subject matter with interesting anecdotes, entertaining facts and just a relatability that can make anyone like and enjoy this book. Every chapter is equally entertaining and engaging. I thought this was a book that people should really try to read to learn more about what makes you you."

The answer is that he handled the level of detail very well, he went into complex detail but didn't drown the reader. I found it engaging and very interesting and not a re-hash of standard quotes.I would thoroughly recommend this book, even to experts. It is well written and moves along very nicely."
136,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21091961-jacques-bezuidenhout,4,"As with all Bill Bryson books, this was extremely fascinating.I did like that this book was a bit shorter and more focused on topic than the usual.With some of his other books, it sometimes drifts so far that you are not quite sure what your are listening to.Not worth digging into all the topics covered by the book.If you are even vaguely into Bill Bryson or Biology or simply like to know about a lot of things, this book is for you. I'd definitely recommend this one above some of the others I've done."
137,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13091714-anna,4,As usual for Bryson this brims with interesting facts and stories as we explore different systems and areas of the human body. Based on my previous reading on various of these areas some subjects are oversimplified and others overemphasized to an extent to give the reader a slightly skewed idea of the concept at hand. On the whole though this is a valuable work which dispels many common myths and educates readers on things they may not even have known they were missing.

Knew a lot of things mentioned in the book already but also learned quite a few new, useful facts about our bodies, lifestyle, illnesses, expectations ...Really liked little stories about discovery and development of Streptomycin, a very interesting story about Salmonella and so on. Liked B. Bryson's comments on various issues and his sense for humour. Well written popular science, always interesting cos it is all about us, well presented and not boring at all."

I had just finished ""A Short History Of Nearly Everything"" by Bill Bryson before reading this book. The structure of this book is similar to that one, if not the same. This book is easy to comprehend and very informative. I particularly liked the chapter that focused on nutrition. Bill Bryson has become one of my favorite authors and I look forward to reading more of his books in the future."

The Body took me a little while to read, but it’s long and I kept returning to re-read nuggets I wanted to remember. Everything Bill writes is thorough and full of facts you wished you could memorize for daily conversation and dinner parties. Another win for Bill Bryson as I work my way through his catalogue. "

143,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1740824-jo,4,"Bryson presents, chapter-by-chapter, an introduction to what each part of the human body does.

151,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: Wow. He can write I wish I could write half as good and as bravely. If you check out the references... amazing! It's a great book.Please consider checking out my Vlog: IG: WhereIsMayLing or Youtube: Diary of a Speed Reader. I am just starting these out and it would be amazing to have you take a look.p.1 I love that he has this beautiful staring place of his teacher who thinks it's cheap to recreate the body. But he actually goes through the 59 elements that make a person chemically. It's incredible. He settles on a little over $151k vs. the original estimate around $2-13. But the way he does is very cool and that's just the intro.p. 14 - The shout out to the book Living Color and the difficulty of skin color as an evolutionary thing to stop us from frying like sausage in the sun. Wow. I want to read this book now.p. 15 - He talks about the idea that flushing (which serves no other purpose) might be a way to demonstrate a fight response as a warning. Curious. Never thought about it, but interesting point.p. 21 - Dematoglyphics - this is what fingerprints are. adermatoglyphia - this is when you have no fingerprints. Fascinating. they don't actually totally know what purpose this serves. It is true that no two people have the same ones, which I still think is fascinating. They think it might have to do with sweat glands. But no one knows. p. 33 - ""Everyone knows that if you get chilled, you are more likely to catch a cold (that is why we call it a cold, after all), yet science has never been able to prove why - or even, come to that, if that is actually so."" We really don't know sh*t about a lot of stuff. He then talks about the idea that this is not a single illness, but a family of symptoms generated by a multiplicity of viruses. p. 36 - They talk about how virus findings are getting bigger and bigger. It then really argues that maybe we just don't know anything about this stuff. It's kind of true likely.p. 44 - They talk about the wide use of antibiotics, often when that is not even the solutions. They are used for Bronchitis even though it's not going to work and that's clearly stated. This makes us highly resistant, and the dev of drug is harder and more expensive.p. 48 - The mystery of the brain section is very cool. ""It makes up just 2% of our body weight but uses 20% of our energy.""Apparently no matter how hard you think, it uses the same amount of energy.p. 63 he talks about ""glia cells"" and how much we have no clue what they do even though they are most of what is going on in the brain. Oh man. It's amazing we feel so advanced given what we really just don't know.p. 74 -This story of craniometry and all of the weird ways that this was used to be super racist. He doesn't present it that way, which I think is him skating the edge of a very broad audience. p. 76 - Paul Eckman's work on microexpressions - ""flashes of emotion, no more than a quarter of a second in duration, that betry our true inner feelings regardless of what our general, controlled expression in conveying."" He says we miss them, but can be taught to spot them.p. 104 - This work on food throughout, while interesting is not as thorough as I would like it to be. It's ok. Other books might be stronger. I think we still don't quite know enough about nutrition.p. 137 - Interesting story about stents. I think I want to learn more. p. 140-141 - He talks about the idea that the hormone Insulin and the way in which we have no clue about how all the hormones work together. He later says that we thought all the hormones were produced in a few glands, but there is literally almost no organ that doesn't produce hormones including fat. We know like nothing.p. 145 - Things like Addison's disease and the weirdness of what cortisol is doing. It's like we don't understand that the body is an ecology.p. 146 Leptin - our bodies are built to deal with scarcity not abundance. We have all these natural things that get us to eat. p. 182 - I'm not 100% sure why he included this on fat people spend 2.5 hours less than skinny people on their feet. You could have excluded this entire section as weight-loss is really something that people are mostly still guessing about. I do like that he says that drs are now saying that the extra weight is likely a good thing.p. 189 - Adenosine is responsible for energy in our cells (btw.. it's also responsible for making us sleepy).p. 191 - He talks about how our bones could only possibly support certain heights. Like it's the wrong material if we were going to be the size of a dinosaur or has he puts it the giants in Gulliver's Travels.p. 192 - This story about Alkemade who somehow survived dying in crazy circumstances more than once. Wow. I need to learn more about this guy's stories.p. 208 - Allergies are not genetic. They still haven't figured out what is going on here. Lots of guesses on hygene differences and all sorts of stuff.p. 213 - The whole section on sneezing is gross, but intriguing, especially given what's going on in current times. Gross, but intriguing.p. 214 - The section on breathing and how it's even more about getting rid of the CO2 than the oxygen intake. Good to know if you ever start to panic about drowning and explains a lot of my scuba training.p. 219 - Asthma as a primarily Western disease, i.e. far more incidence and possibly due to lifestyle. I'm not so sure about this or the whole television thing. I think it's just lack of healthcare, as Western societies live much more richly than poor ones. p. 239 - More people on the earth suffer from obesity than starvation. It use to be that people spent 1/2 their income on food. Now it's 6%. I don't think I have done enough work on how people spend disposable income across different income brackets globally.p. 244 - The salt thing. I think it might be a little bit off. Each country is a little different on diet and their body issues. Like part of the salt thing is that people also don't hydrate.p. 252 - The food poisoning thing is real. And it's not talked about. p. 280 Men do not think of sex every 7 seconds. Apparently, it's more like 19x per day College women think about food more than sex. Interesting. p. 291- wow... women use to start their period in the 1900s at age 15, not it's 12. EEK!!!p. 332 - He's taling about how dangerous just the flu is. Wow. Good timing. p. 337 - They talk about cancer and how it's totally non-infectious and basically is your body killing you (suiciding on you) without telling you about it. p. 338 - He talks about how lifestyle stuff is a big deal as relates to cancer. Not sure if that's true, but I would like to really have that proven out.p. 353 - He shows clearly the opposite of Sapiens and precisely how the world has gotten better and lives are far longer. p. 357 He talks about the stats across countries. Like in Norway people are less likely to die than in the US off of any given illness. EEK!!p. 368 - in 2011, more people die of non-communicable diseases than of actual infectious diseases. Wow. He's saying the former is more lifestyle oriented (heart-attacks, cancer, etc). I think he means it more like the only known solutions are lifestyle changes, not in the blame way. p. 372 - He's talking about the aging process and how we are starting to address that and get a handle on it.p. lots of great books in the sources to learn more.

152,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4049388-anna,5,"Writing a popular science book that's understandable and fun for the lay(wo)man is one thing, but to make it fun and worth listening to for someone who does know the minutia of the topic is another. I've spent a lot of time and money learning and forgetting about the intricacies of the human body: sitting through hours of lectures; poring over pages of facts, figures, diagrams; and seeing it off the page as well. For me, this book could have ended up being a more watered down slightly less pedantic review book - and that would have probably bored me to death. However, The Body: A Guide for Occupants isn't written by someone trying to teach ""plebes"" about their field, it isn't written by a science writer at all. Bill MoFo Bryson is the author of this book, and if anyone could find a way to make something interesting to everyone regardless of background, it's him. I may be biased, several of Bill Bryson's books rank among my favorite books of all time (A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail, and I'm a Stranger Here Myself: Notes on Returning to America After Twenty Years Away in particular) so perhaps I'm just predisposed to liking the work he puts out. While there is a very basic rundown of the different parts of the body, their functions, and other related topics (conversations on public health, microbiology, epidemiology, etc...) there's also a lot of trivia, history, anecdotes that help everyone understand that we really know very little about the human body - but we worked hard to get there.The book is written in Bryson's characteristic fun and light manner, but it's full of information presented in a way that makes it feel that he's just as overjoyed to learn about each tidbit as you should be reading it. It's joyful education, even more so when listening to the audiobook which he reads. Listening to an emotive person joyfully explaining the different parts and functions of the brain is a completely different experience from listening to a droning soporific professor. I can't really speak for how info-dumpy it may be, a lot of it is just refreshing my memory of things I know followed by interesting bits of trivia or history that I either didn't remember or didn't learn. Honestly, the non-science parts were more interesting to me because it's fascinating to see what parts of history gets left behind. There's a lot of backstabbing in the research and academic world, that's for sure.I do wonder if he wishes that the book was released next year, because while his chapter on the pandemic that would bring our society to it's knees was pretty spot on, it would have definitely been different knowing what we know now. Though all the experts he interviewed were pretty accurate on the characteristics of a virus that could cause a pandemic, and how unprepared the world would be for it. People keep asking the question ""who could have known?!"", well, apparently a lot of people - enough that Bill Bryson has a whole chapter on it before the pandemic started.This is a fun book, and well narrated by Bryson. This is the perfect light but informative non-fiction book to listen to while walking the dog."
153,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059859-sean,5,"Head to toe - literally. So much recently discovered information. We really are still learning. Costa Ricans have only about one-fifth the personal wealth of Americans, and have poorer health care, but live longer. Moreover, people in one of the poorest regions of Costa Rica, the Nicoya Peninsula, live longest of all, even though they have much higher rates of obesity and hypertension. The also have longer telomeres.The theory is that they benefit from closer social bonds and family relationships. Curiously, it was found that if they live alone or don't see a child at least one a week, the telomere length advantage vanishes. It is an extraordinary fact that having good and loving relationships physically alters your DNA. Conversely, a 2010 study found, not having such relationships doubles your risk of dying from any cause.I bought a hard copy for reference, but listened to Bryson read this audio version."

I loved how each chapter was dedicated to a different part/system of the body and how simply summed up was the anatomy, physiology, pathology and history of mostly everything the author delved into. I also loved recognising various things that I’ve already learned in university, and others that I didn’t know or just didn’t understand that well. "

156,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48297482-steve-bera,3,"I like this author a lot and his wry sense of humor. However, it was hard to inject humor in a book like this that was mostly scientific. That aside, the book is well written and polished. Mostly the book had information we already knew, or didn't need to know. A strong conclusion at the ending, but one we already knew. So, this book is a small work of art that we probably don't need to read."
157,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8093511-patricia,5,Bill Bryson makes anything he writes about fascinating! Highly recommended.
158,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56491386-kirsty,5,"Like many readers, I very much enjoy Bill Bryson's non-fiction work.  I picked up his newest publication, The Body: A Guide for Occupants having not read any of his writing for such a long time, and was so pleased that I did.  I was reminded once more of how warm his prose is, and how fascinating his subjects.Many of Bryson's books are essentially travel writing, in which he writes about countries and regions which he has lived or travelled within - the United States, United Kingdom, and Africa are just three examples.  The Body is something a little different to these personal geographies, though.  It is far more science-based than much of his work, and does not include many personal stories, something which his books tend to be built upon.  It looks inward, trying to decipher what really makes a human being.The Body has been split into many chapters, each of which focuses upon a distinctive part of the human body.  These range from 'The Immune System' and 'The Brain' to 'Into the Nether Regions'.  These chapters are incredibly thorough; there is not an element of the body which has not been explored in some way.  He moves seamlessly from one topic to another.  With his chapter on the skin, for instance, he moves from bacteria found on the skin to the phenomenon of itching, and then the reasons as to why we lose hair as we age, all in less than two pages.Bryson writes about so many things here, including the beginning of forensic science; microbes and proteins, and their functions and uses within the body; viruses; advances in medicine; evolutionary changes within human anatomy; how different parts of us age, and the consequences felt; the myriad benefits of exercise; and the wonder found within the structure of our bones.  He writes about so many things that are known about the human body, and also the surprising number of elements which remain a mystery.  Bryson introduces several medical conundrums, interesting cases which cannot be solved.Bryson has chosen to begin The Body with rather a fascinating chapter, entitled 'How to Build a Human', which calculates how expensive it would be to procure all of the elements which make up the human body - clue: a lot.  This memorable prologue, as it were, sets the tone for the book, and feels perfectly placed.As ever, Bryson's writing in The Body is both absorbing and accessible.  He grapples with complex ideas throughout the book, but presents everything in a way which can be read and understood by newcomers to this subject.  He introduces myriad facts in marvellous ways, which really make one think; for instance, 'In the second or so since you started this sentence, your body has made a million red blood cells.'  One can see from the outset that Bryson clearly has quite a passion for this subject, and this shines throughout, as does his humour.  Throughout, Bryson consults experts in different fields, and also mentions a lot of books which focus upon biology along the way.The Body is a book which one can learn, unsurprisingly, a great deal from.  I have always been fascinated by biology and the human body, and have read a few books on the subject before, but I found myself learning new facts throughout.  Although there is such a great deal packed into the pages of The Body, and a great deal of impeccable research has clearly been done, it never feels saturated with information, and can easily be read from cover to cover.  The Body is, all in all, a fact-lover's dream, which demonstrates how wonderful the human body is, in all of its strangeness.I will end this review with a passage which I, personally, found fascinating: 'The most remarkable part of all is your DNA.  You have a metre of it packed into every cell, and so many cells that if you formed all the DNA in your body into a single fine strand it would stretch ten billion miles, to beyond Pluto.  Think of it: there is enough of you to leave the solar system.  You are in the most literal sense cosmic.'"
159,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113436767-brenda-farrell,5,"Really enjoyed this, an accessible, easy to understand account of interesting facts, comparisons and anecdotes. Perfect for someone not especially scientifically inclined. Learned a lot! Took a while to get through though."
160,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1509971-matthew,4,"In the same vein as ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", Bryson tackles his next ambitious subject, the human body. Once again, he does an excellent job of taking complex systems and ideas, and bringing them down to our level. I found this book truly fascinating,... and also a little gross at times. Some of the details he shared hit a little too close to home.Here is a sample of some things that I found really interesting: - The outer layer of your skin is almost entirely dead cells. So when you look at a person, what you are seeing is mostly cadaver. - When you sunburn, your skin turns red because your blood vessels are swelling up. That is also why you feel hot to the touch. - Your body produces 5-10 ounces of tears every day. That's almost a full can of soda. - If everyone in the world were as overweight as Americans, it would be the equivalent of adding 1 billion people to the planet. - Food stays in your body for about 55 hours if you are a grown man. It's about 72 hours if you are a grown woman. - Poop is primarily brown because of expired red blood cells. - Gravity affects us differently based on our mass. So, a child half your height only experiences 1/132nd of the force of gravity when falling. This is why kids seem so indestructible. Just like he did in ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", Bryson doesn't hesitate to say how much we still don't know about the human body. For example, modern opinion is that man is the result of millions of years of trial and error, where our most useful characteristics were passed on through survival of the fittest. But this doesn't explain why we have eyebrows. As far as we can tell, they serve no real evolutionary purpose, but they are very useful for self-expression. Also, we are the only species who experiences emotional crying. No one has a really good evolutionary explanation for why we do this. Bryson repeated over and over, ""the purpose of X is unknown"", or ""nobody knows why X happens"". Several times he described an attribute of the human body and then said that it was ""one of life's many imponderables"". There is no denying that we know far more than we did 100 years ago, but I'm sure the same will be said of us 100 years from now. Of course, any book exploring the science of the human body is going to end by talking about death. I learned that heart disease is the number one cause of death in America and kills more people than cancer, influenza, pneumonia, and accidents combined. We hear so much about cancer and are often worried about getting it (rightly so), but in reality we should be worried about taking better care of our hearts. One in three Americans dies of heart disease. Bryson also shared this little nugget: the average body in a sealed coffin takes between 5 and 40 years to decompose. Lovely thought. Bryson ended the book with a great line. After talking about burial and cremation, he abruptly says ""And that's you gone. But was fun while it lasted."" It was just a funny way to end, and it fit perfectly with his quippy sense of humor. Excellent book, and highly recommended. "
161,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,5,"Bill Bryson is one of the most widely read and beloved writers on so many subjects, be it travelogues to obscure locations, the history of the universe, and now the most ridiculous subject of them all, your body. Just kidding, not YOUR body, but the human body, and at all times Bryson is an erudite and irreverent guide through this endlessly fascinating subject, right up to the various ways the body expires.For me, the most interesting area discussed was the evolution of our knowledge of nutrition since those of us even just over the age of 30 can remember when nutritional and dietary suggestions were quite different than they are now. Bryson is an effective guide through a lot of the unscientific BS that pervades these discussions and offers an up to date account of proper amounts of exercise and nutritive consumption. He also details where some of these misconceptions may have come from, usually a misreading of a single study that was leaded to the popular media. Bryson is also quite clear where we still have no idea as to why certain things happen, or exist, or how to combat them and this forms at times the most distressing aspect of the work, though obviously necessary. The quick little asides and meanderings on how incredible some aspects of our regular functioning are, make for great reading especially in the chapter on all of the various chemicals your body uses and produces on a regular basis. As I mentioned, Bryson can be irreverent and waggish when discussing certain things and this pervades the chapter on sex. One clean but perfectly expressed point on why we may have evolved to engage in this practice instead of mere cloning by single-sex organisms occurs later in the work:""Sex may dilute our personal contribution to posterity, but it is great for the species. By mixing and matching genes, we get variety and that gives us safety and resilience. It makes it harder for diseases to sweep through whole populations. It also means that we can evolve. We can hold on to beneficial genes and discard ones that impede our collective happiness. Cloning gives you the same thing over and over. Sex gives you Einstein and Rembrandt - and a lot of dorks, too, of course.""Those wanting a more academic appraisal of these areas along with an examination of our evolutionary history should definitely check out Harvard Professor Daniel Lieberman's, ""The Story of the Human Body."" Lieberman is someone, also, that Bryson references heavily throughout the work. However those looking for an up to date appraisal of the human body from a masterful storyteller should also consider this fantastic volume. "
162,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15873658-ksenia,4,"Still trying to get some walking in (early in the morning before many people are out) so I was able to chomp through the last chapters of this in a couple of days. Recommend if you like a good non-fiction deep dive, bonus if you're looking for a long audiobook. "
163,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3570671-john-braine,4,"Does what it says on the tin. And reads exactly as you would expect from Bryson: well written, well researched, informative, revealing and entertaining. One factor that stood out for me was the sheer number of times that a scientific or medical theory took flight, was seized upon by the media, and stuck as a firmly believed fact despite subsequent research that proves the theory to have no scientific basis or 100% proven to be wrong. It's quite scary how much this happens. But because whole industries emerge to capitalise on what are ultimately urban legends, they are incredibly hard to quash. This book might as easily been titled Health, and there is unavoidable overlap in the subject matter, but it seemed the second half of the book was primarily focused on health and disease. And this is where a small but disappointing element here poked its head out. Although still a bit niche/controversial there's a steadily growing acceptance by medical professionals, that psychogenic disease is a grossly underestimated factor in our health, particularly in the area of chronic pain. The chapter on chronic pain was either disappointingly researched or deliberately ignored, despite evidence that would be hard to miss if investigating this area, so I suspect the latter. There were many points in the book, where the evidence was right there in his own words, yet he chose not to acknowledge it. There was even a chapter about Akureyri disease, which broke out in Iceland in the 1940s where no physical factors could be found and scientists concluded its genesis as psychogenic ""which means"" Bryson says ""they had no idea whatsoever what caused it"". It absolutely doesn't mean that Bill! It means it was psychogenic! I love Bryson but that is one of the most ignorant or deliberately obtuse lines I've ever read. A small factor overall. But it left a bad taste.To end on a better note, I actually wailed ""Oh no"" when I realised Bryson was narrating his own book. He does not have a good track record, whereas his regular narrator William Roberts does an amazing job of capturing the personality in his writing, an endeavour the author has failed to do in previous recordings. However, I think he's had some coaching, as he was a lot more engaging than past narrations. "
164,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301768-judith,3,"I like Bill Bryson. I read and enjoyed:"" A short walk"" & ""A sunburned country"", but I lost my patience with ""A short history of nearly everything"". I blame myself for that. What was I expecting? With this latest book, I have to say, it is not a book to read all the way through. It's probably the only book I'll ever recommend for those of you who like to have reading material accessible in the bathroom. You could read it in limited amounts of time and never run out of reading material or patience. It's really fascinating when taken in little bits at a time. For example did you know that if your lungs were stretched out and flattened they would cover a tennis court? And so on. But you can see why you wouldn't want to sit down and read it from start to finish or worse, listen to your partner reading it aloud to you in bed before you fall asleep which I guarantee you will not be long. For example, did you know that in 2018, a professor at Oxford found that low-dose aspirin is not effective at all in reducing cardiac or cancer risk in anyone weighing 154 pounds or more--but it does still post a serious risk of internal bleeding.etc.,etc.,etc. All good information in low doses. No pun intended."
165,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18229560-ginger,2,"I have really enjoyed most of Bill Bryson's books but really struggled to find anything likeable about this one. I normally finish a book in 2 days and this took me 25 days to finish because I kept putting it down. He lists some facts about each area of the body and the scientists that studied it, whether those facts are interesting or not. Sometimes he gets into the subject matter and briefly writes in an engaging way, but most of the time it reads like a list of bullet points he jotted down while reading something else. He cribs very heavily from Mary Roach's works and always gives her credit but trust me, it's more fun and engaging to read her amazing books directly instead of this summary of Bill's. It's tedious, I felt like most of the facts were obvious things I learned in primary school or summaries from better books I had already read, and found his super repetitive negative comments about fat people a bit hypocritical and mean. I've already had 2 of my home library clients return it and say they didn't like it and couldn't finish it, so I am not going to recommend it to anyone. "
166,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27986103-mike,5,"How can you not like this? It's another of Bryson's fact and trivia books, this time covering the body from top to toe - in a sense - and uncovering all manner of interesting information about how the body ticks, and about the people who made the discoveries. And how there's still a great deal we just don't know about the body, even though you'd think we were up with the play completely by now. As always the anecdotal material is fascinating: the scientists who literally killed themselves in various ways to make discoveries - or unwittingly killed themselves while making discoveries. The scientists who didn't discover something new but claimed they did, and caused the real discoverer to be cast in the background. The scientists who did all manner of appalling things to themselves and others in order to learn about how our bodies work, and the men and women who healed others by trying something different instead of something that killed as many as it cured. It can be almost overwhelming, but you read on, because after all, who isn't interested in their own body and what's going on inside it?"
167,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4384677-homerun2,4,"Bryson is always intelligent, quirky, and entertaining and The Body is all of that. He takes often dry factual material and enlivens it. The organization of the book, by body sections and systems, is clear. His interjection of strange stories about the personalities and lives of some significant medical researchers adds to the fun.The very last chapters are somewhat different. Instead of describing physiological facts, he begins talking about the health care systems in different countries. He compares death rates, death causes, number of tests run, and of course, cost. Some might find this off-putting but it seemed to me to be germane when talking about the body. He ends naturally enough by talking about dying and again discusses different death experiences according to various factors. All in all, a book that informs but holds your attention and encourages pondering. Thanks to the publisher and to Net Galley for providing me with an ARC in exchange for my honest review."
168,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77697536-mary-norfleet,5,"This is one of the most interesting and fascinating books I have ever read. It is also at times horrifying, especially when the chapters talk about research, pharmaceuticals and medical tests. I wasn't going to read it when I first heard of it because I thought it would be too ""scientific"" and hard to read. Having read most all of Bill Bryson's books, I should have known better. It is easy to understand and sprinkled with his own brand of laugh out loud funny asides. The amount of research that goes into any excellent non-fiction book is always amazing to me. Besides Bryson, I enjoy any non-fiction by Erik Larson, Simon Winchester and David McCullough. If you like to learn while reading an enjoyable ""story"", I high recommend all these authors. That said, Bill Bryon's ""The Body"" is one of the very best!"
169,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29560882-dave,5,"Well, Bill Bryson has done it again! This book moves into my top-ten list and I'd easily give it a higher than 5-star rating. Highly recommended!So why the superb rating? First, I enjoyed it to the point where I'd reread it sometime soon. Bryson's writing style is relaxed, humorous, and extremely easy to follow. Second, I learned a LOT, and his tendency to explore immensely interesting bunny trails contributes mightily to the enjoyment. He never takes himself too seriously. I feel like he is a ""reader's author"". In other words, he makes great effort to make his books page-turners for the average reader like me.I won't summarize the book, you can get that from the jacket. Just be prepared to laugh while you learn an amazing amount - read ""The Body"" by Bill Bryson."

Full of easily digestible scientific facts, historic stories, and unexpected connections that all relate to our bodies. It is entertaining to read while being quite educational and even mesmerizing at times. I would even recommend this read to a doctor, not just a lay person, particularly specialists that don't always look at the whole body in the diagnosis and treatment of disease... a lot of good reminders what and where to look. Fascinating for any age or profession/educational background."

172,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83008478-magdalena,4,"Very interesting read but the stories are too Americentric. Since I'm Polish it came to my attention that the author mentioned Marie Skłodowska Curie in only one short sentence (even though she died from exposure to radiation - it begs to be mentioned in that given context), and didn't even say a word about Leśniowski while talking about Crohn's (he was the first person to describe this disease). Makes me wonder how many interesting scientists, doctors etc. from different countries were also omitted (purposefully or not, it's hard to tell)."
173,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,4,"The Body: A Guide for Occupants (2019) by Bill Bryson is an entertaining, informative book that takes the reader on a tour of our bodies.The Body is really a lot of fun and the descriptions of skin, hair, stomachs, food, brains, bones, cancer, DNA and everything else and the people who discovered how they work and what makes them go wrong is really well done. There are just so many interesting anecdotes and facts and they really are delivered well.The Body is a highly enjoyable and is very much worth a read."
174,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12574631-aligermaa-tse,4,"I have recently read ""Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers"" by Mary Roach which also explores the mysteries of human body. Although it talked about human body from different perspective, I found both ""The Body"" and ""Stiff"" similarly fascinating. How is it that the most familiar thing to ourselves be such an enigmatic paradox. There will be many more years until we finally discover the true potential and solve the human body puzzle or we may never be able to. Regardless, Bill Bryson tried to explain this wonder in a simple and interesting way. Great book."
175,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7048635-epickkasten,4,"Much like his previous book, ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", ""The Body"" offers a brief and entertaining tour to the human body. If you are an avid science reader, a lot of the information provided here are probably not new to you and some can seem a little too superficial. Still, I think this book would be a great starter for anyone who's curious about the human anatomy and biology. (Aliens out there, take note!)"
176,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/778330-andrea,5,"Another entertaining and informative masterpiece from Bill Bryson. It's always fun listening to the author read his works. I learned so much new information about ""the body"" and even the stuff I had heard before was presented with a fresh outlook. Bryson is a true wordsmith and his delivery is always interesting and witty. But the author tackles difficult topics such as medical 'advances,' historical and modern medicine and he has an amazing command of his subject."
177,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4337911-renee,5,"I am so grateful to Doubleday books for the eARC of Bill Bryson’s The Body. This book embodies all of my favorite kinds of science writing - it takes a topic we are all familiar with, our bodies, and then lets the reader see their own body in a new way. I am constantly on the lookout for books to share with my anatomy students, and this has catapulted to the top of my stack! It is wonderfully thorough, but Bryson’s wit & writing style make it easy to digest."
178,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4639300-erica,4,"Not as many caveats re: research methodologies and current scientific blindspots, but still a lovely book. It is comforting to get information about a sweep of anatomical, psychological, and sociological subjects, especially as an occupant of a human body. Pretend you're a curious 14-year-old again and listen up: you might appreciate your own dwelling a little more in the process of sating curiosity."
179,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2365252-eva,5,"Lovingly presented with humour and kindness and great attention to detail. Even the scariest part of the book about all the things that can go wrong in a body left me with a sense of optimism, and I thoroughly enjoyed every bit - even (and especially) the bonus about the sense of hearing that comes with the audible version."
180,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36360668,5,"Just another amazing book by Bryson. Other than scientists and science lovers, its hard to imagine that anybody can understand (let alone enjoy) a science book. The writer takes you skillfully into an amazing journey inside our bodies and explaining not only the mechanism of our organs, but also the their history (naming, false believes, new discoveries..etc.).A useful and joyful read. "
181,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8742827-jack,5,"Bryson does another remarkable job of packaging information and making it both informative and entertaining. This is a ggreat addition to his growing body of work on history, science and anthropology. His style is light, without being frivolous. His facts are supportive without being boring, and each chapter seems to be as Goldilocks might have said- not too long, not too short, just right."
182,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37588443-ksenija,5,"As always, Bryson’s writing is easily read as he hops from one anecdote to another, reintroducing us to the sense of awe for inhabiting our incredible bodies. Abundant with wit, humility, origins, comparable sizes (which parts of you could be wrapped around the planet and which are the size of a greyhound bus), karmic irony and - of course - etymology. "
183,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5949298-simon-parsons,5,"(audio version) Bryson at his very best. A measured, well paced journey through what we know (and just as interestingly what we don't know) about the human body. Educational, entertaining, sometimes frightening, funny - doffing his cap to a number of unsung heroes of the medical world.I would recommend this book (certainly the audio version) to anyone."
184,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3063573-sarah,2,UGH. If I wanted someone to just read an anatomy encyclopedia to me then this book would nail it. Not sure how this topic could possibly be made SO DRY but this book was a slog. I got through 6 hours of the audiobook before giving up. No sign of typical Bill Bryson wit and humor anywhere to be found. I’ve always loved his user friendly and personable take on science but this is none of that. 
185,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1868999-krisette-spangler,5,"I always enjoy a good Bill Bryson book. This novel is a brief overview of just about everything having to do with your body and how it functions. I don't agree with Mr. Bryson about the origins of man, but I found the book informative without being tedious. And of course, it includes some of Mr. Bryson's dry humor to keep things fun."

This book gave me a renewed appreciation for my body, and quite frankly a stronger desire to treat it better. A lot of cool facts in this book - things that I didn't know or simply forgot about.

195,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44320074-benozir-ahmed,5,"Book full of facts about what we normally don’t think about. I was so engrossed with the book that I read the book twice back to back(read the highlights for the third time). However, If you are not into knowing the mystery of your own body then this book will not satiate you the way I am telling. However, after finishing this book, I am sure about one thing. I would most probably read all the books of Bill Bryson.My detail review only speaks about one thing : “Miles to go before I sleep”Note to self: Keep pondering upon the imponderables.QUESTIONS THAT NEED ATTENTION“Curiously, we don’t have any receptors for wetness. We have only thermal sensors to guide us, which is why when you sit down on a wet spot, you can’t generally tell whether it really is wet or just cold.”why are there no receptors for wetness???“so why have we invested so much energy and risk in producing mental capacity that we don’t really need? That is just one of the many things about your brain that your brain won’t tell you.”“We are the only creatures that cry from feeling, as far as we can tell. Why we do so is another of life’s many mysteries. We get no physiological benefit from erupting in tears. It is also a little odd surely that this act signifying powerful sadness is also triggered by extreme joy or quiet rapture or intense pride or almost any other potent emotional state.”Why do we cry then?“The active ingredient in all chili peppers is a chemical called capsaicin. When you ingest capsaicin, the body releases endorphins—it’s not at all clear why—and that provides us with a literally warm glow of pleasure. As with any warmth, however, it can quickly grow uncomfortable and then intolerable.”Why body releases endorphin when we take chili/capsaicin?“Horrifying as the German experiments were, they were outdone, in scale if not cruelty, by the Japanese. Under a doctor named Shiro Ishii, the Japanese built an enormous complex of more than 150 buildings spread over almost 1,500 acres at Harbin in Manchuria with the avowed purpose of determining human physiological limitations through any means necessary. The facility was known as Unit 731”.Need to know more about Unit 731“The number of spermatozoa produced by the average man in the prime of life varies from 1 million to 120 million per milliliter, with an average of about 25 million per milliliter. The average ejaculation is about three milliliters, which means that a typical sex act produces enough sperm to repopulate a medium-sized country at the very least. Why there is such a broad range of wriggling potentiality, and indeed why such an extravagance of production even at the lower end when only one sperm is required for conception, are questions that science has yet to answer.”why the wastage then??“A twenty-week-old fetus will weigh no more than three or four ounces but will already have 6 million eggs inside her. That number falls to 1 million by the time of birth and continues to fall, though at a slower rate, through life. As she enters her childbearing years, a woman will have about 180,000 eggs primed and ready to go. Why she loses so many eggs along the way and yet enters her childbearing years with vastly more than she will ever need are two of life’s many imponderables”why???“Almost thirty years ago, Zhores Medvedev, a Russian biogerontologist, counted some three hundred serious scientific theories to explain why we age, and the number has not shrunk in the decades since. As Professor José Viña and colleagues from the University of Valencia put it in a summary of current thinking, the theories fall into three broad categories: the genetic mutation theories (your genes malfunction and kill you), the wear-and-tear theories (the body just wears out), and the cellular waste accumulation theories (your cells clog up with toxic by-products). It may be that all three factors work together, or it may be that any two of the above are side effects of the third. Or it may be something else altogether. No one knows.”why we age???INTERESTING FACTS“A successful virus is one that doesn’t kill too well and can circulate widely. That’s what makes flu such a perennial threat. A typical flu renders its victims infectious for about a day before they get symptoms and for about a week after they recover, which turns every victim into a vector. The great Spanish flu of 1918 racked up a global death toll of tens of millions—some estimates put it as high as a hundred million—not by being especially lethal but by being persistent and highly transmissible. It killed only about 2.5 percent of victims, it is thought.”How excruciatingly the history is repeating while we can still do nothing about the present Corona outbreak.“According to one estimate reported by Ed Yong in The Atlantic, the number of viruses in birds and mammals that have the potential to leap the species barrier and infect us may be as high as 800,000. That is a lot of potential danger.”“Women are anatomically different in one other very significant way: they are the sacred keepers of human mitochondria—the vital little powerhouses of our cells. Sperm pass on none of their mitochondria during conception, so all mitochondrial information is transferred from generation to generation through mothers alone. Such a system means that there will be many extinctions along the way. A woman endows all her children with her mitochondria, but only her daughters have the mechanism to pass it onward to future generations. So if a woman has only sons or no children at all—and that happens quite often, of course—her personal mitochondrial line will die with her. All her descendants will still have mitochondria, but it will come from other mothers on other genetic lines. In consequence, the human mitochondrial pool shrinks a little with every generation because of these localized extinctions. Over time, the mitochondrial pool for humans has shrunk so much that, almost unbelievably but rather wonderfully, we are all now descended from a single mitochondrial ancestor—a woman who lived in Africa about 200,000 years ago. You might have heard her referred to as Mitochondrial Eve. She is, in a sense, mother of us all.“you blink fourteen thousand times a day—so much that your eyes are shut for twenty-three minutes of every waking day”“The length of all your blood vessels would take you two and a half times around Earth.”“The most remarkable part of all is your DNA (or deoxyribonucleic acid). You have a meter of it packed into every cell, and so many cells that if you formed all the DNA in your body into a single strand, it would stretch ten billion miles, to beyond Pluto.”“You have about 100,000 microbes per square centimeter of your skin”“Your lungs, smoothed out, would cover a tennis court, and the airways within them would stretch nearly from coast to coast.”“If you put all Earth’s microbes in one heap and all the other animal life in another, the microbe heap would be twenty-five times greater than the animal one”“you have about twenty thousand genes of your own within you, but perhaps as many as twenty million bacterial genes, so from that perspective you are roughly 99 percent bacterial and not quite 1 percent you.”“According to the virologist Dorothy H. Crawford, ocean viruses alone if laid end to end would stretch for ten million light-years, a distance essentially beyond imagining.”“A morsel of cortex one cubic millimeter in size—about the size of a grain of sand—could hold two thousand terabytes of information, enough to store all the movies ever made, trailers included, or about 1.2 billion copies of this book. Altogether, the human brain is estimated to hold something on the order of two hundred exabytes of information, roughly equal to “the entire digital content of today’s world,”“True smiles are brief—between two-thirds of a second and four seconds”“The human eye can distinguish somewhere between 2 million and 7.5 million colors, according to various calculations. Even at the lower end of estimates, that is a lot.”“Although we all have 350 to 400 types of odor receptor, only about half of them are common to all people. That means that we don’t smell the same things”“The heart has no time for distractions. It is the most single-minded thing within you. It has just one job to do, and it does it supremely well: it beats. Slightly more than once every second, about 100,000 times a day, as many as 3.5 billion times in a lifetime, it rhythmically pulses to push blood through your body—and these aren’t gentle thrusts. They are jolts powerful enough to send blood spurting up to three meters if the aorta is severed”“Every hour your heart dispenses around 70 gallons of blood. That’s 1,680 gallons in a day—more gallons pushed through you in a day than you are likely to put in your car in a year”“The journey of blood around your body takes about fifty seconds to complete.”“In the United States, plasma sales make up 1.6 percent of all goods exported, more than America earns from the sale of airplanes.”“Perhaps the most wondrous feature of the liver is its capacity to regenerate. You can remove two-thirds of a liver and it will grow back to its original size in just a few weeks.”“Cartilage is remarkable, too. It is many times smoother than glass: it has a friction coefficient five times less than ice. Imagine playing ice hockey on a surface so smooth that the skaters went sixteen times as fast. That’s cartilage. But unlike ice, it isn’t brittle. It doesn’t crack under pressure as ice would. And you grow it yourself. It’s a living thing.”“An analysis of 655,000 people in 2012 found that being active for just eleven minutes a day after the age of forty yielded 1.8 years of added life expectancy. Being active for an hour or more a day improved life expectancy by 4.2 years.”“As Lieberman noted in The Story of the Human Body, a worker on a factory floor will in a year expend about 175,000 more calories than a desk worker—equivalent to more than sixty marathons”“Every day you produce and consume your own body weight in ATP—some 200 trillion trillion molecules of it.”“Even with the advantage of clothing, shelter, and boundless ingenuity, humans can manage to live on only about 12 percent of Earth’s land area and just 4 percent of the total surface area if you include the seas. It is a sobering thought that 96 percent of our planet is off-limits to us.”“QUIETLY AND RHYTHMICALLY, awake or asleep, generally without thought, every day you breathe in and out about 20,000 times, diligently processing some 4,000 gallons (or 440 cubic feet) of air, depending on how big you are and how active. That’s about 7.3 million breaths between birthdays, 550 million or so over the course of a lifetime.”“In breathing, as in everything in life, the numbers are staggering—indeed fantastical. Every time you breathe, you exhale some 25 sextillion (that’s 2.5 x 1022) molecules of oxygen—so many that with a day’s breathing you will in all likelihood inhale at least one molecule from the breaths of every person who has ever lived. And every person who lives from now until the sun burns out will from time to time breathe in a bit of you.”“The main thing to bear in mind is that carbohydrates, upon being digested, are just more sugar—often quite a lot more. That means that a 150-gram serving of white rice or a small bowl of cornflakes will have the same effect on your blood glucose levels as nine teaspoons of sugar.”“Who would guess, for instance, that an avocado has five times as much saturated fat as a small bag of potato chips? Or that a large latte has more than almost any pastry? Or that coconut oil is almost nothing but saturated fat.”“Heinz ketchup is almost one-quarter sugar. It has more sugar per unit of volume than Coca-Cola.”“Your alimentary canal is about forty feet long if you are an average-sized man, a bit less if you are a woman. The surface area of all that tubing is about half an acre.”“For a man, the average journey time from mouth to anus is fifty-five hours. For a woman, typically, it is more like seventy-two.”“The technical term for gut rumblings is “borborygmi.””“The largest source of foodborne illness is not meat or eggs or mayonnaise, as commonly supposed, but green leafy vegetables. They account for one in five of all food illnesses.”“Two strains of E. coli have more genetic variability than all the mammals on Earth put together”“We shed skin copiously, almost carelessly: some twenty-five thousand flakes a minute, over a million pieces every hour”THE REST of the important excerpts are going to be continued in the comments. And I think I can avoid reading the book again thereby."
196,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1766263-jonathan,4,"Bill Bryson has made quite the career out of funny, informative, light reading books and *The Body* is no exception. Each chapter covers some portion of the human body, like discussions about blood, brain, nerves, sex organs, death and cancer. Here are a few tidbits of info for your perusal:+ If you blew [a virus] up to the size of a tennis ball, a human would be five hundred miles high. A bacterium on the same scale would be about the size of a beach ball.+ researchers infected the metal door handle to an office building and found it took only about four hours for the “virus” to spread through the entire building, infecting over half of employees and turning up on virtually every shared device like photocopiers and coffee machines.+ Giraffes, oddly, sometimes have gallbladders and sometimes don’t.+ To power our forward motion, we have a distinctively gigantic muscle in our buttocks, the gluteus maximus, and an Achilles tendon, something no ape has.+ If you are deprived of it for long enough, you will die—though what exactly it is that kills you from lack of sleep is a mystery, too.+ The prostate, it might be said, produces seminal fluid throughout a man’s adulthood and anxiety in his later years.+ It has been suggested, in fact, that if all men lived long enough, they would all get prostate cancer.+ That’s why you are constantly told to eat more fiber: because it keeps your gut microbes happy and at the same time, for reasons not well understood, reduces the risk of heart disease, diabetes, bowel cancer, and indeed death of all types.But the most amazing one to me was in the chapter on the brain. In discussing how long it takes an image to get from your eye to the brain (about a fifth of a second) :+ To help us deal better with this fractional lag, the brain does a truly extraordinary thing: it continuously forecasts what the world will be like a fifth of a second from now, and that is what it gives us as the present.Mind blowing. It was also amazing just how little we still know about the body, especially the ""Whys"". My wife is probably glad I am finally finished reading the book so I will stop interrupting her reading by narrating another wild fact from the book!My two biggest take aways from the book are that while there are indeed plenty of disagreements about what we need and don't need, the scientific community is solidly behind the need for both exercise and, believe it or not, fiber. Exercise continually showed up in the book, as it reduces the odds of everything from cancer to Alzheimer's. And while there might be some disagreement on how much of both exercise and fiber, both are essential to a healthy life. As one of fibers biggest boosters (again, much to my wife's chagrin), I felt vindicated!So while this isn't any kind of text book, it sure is an informative and interesting read. You will learn a lot of things you just didn't know before. And he also name drops a lot of other books for more in depth study, which I have added to my Want To Read list, like Clean: The New Science of Skin and the Beauty of Doing Less, Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex and Microcosm: E. Coli and the New Science of Life. Gotta get to reading!"

The lethal surgical procedures of yesteryear have been replaced by the unnecessary over-medications today. Even safe surgical procedures today need to be evaluated on an excel sheet for true life-quality gain vs cost vs percent effectiveness.Five pages from the end of the book, this statement captures what we 'know' quite well:Some people live longer than they out to by any known measures. Costa Ricans have only about one-fifth the personal wealth of Americans, and have poorer health care, but live longer. Moreover, people in one of the poorest regions of Costa Rica, the Nicoya Peninsula, live longest of all, even though they have much higher rates of obesity and hypertension. The also have longer telomeres. The theory is that they benefit from closer social bonds and family relationships. Curiously, it was found that if they live alone or don't see a child at least one a week, the telomere length advantage vanishes. It is an extraordinary fact that having good and loving relationships physically alters your DNA. Conversely, a 2010 study found, not having such relationships doubles your risk of dying from any cause.This book reminded me of We Have No Idea: A Guide to the Unknown Universe. Both books go into depths about the latest knowledge in their fields (Astrophysics, and the Human Body). We think these scientists know SO MUCH. But you come away from both books realizing that we are no where close to having these fields REALLY figured out. Every page of both books reveals great knowledge, yet abundant need for more research. Do you know we don't have 'wet' receptors? When you sit down on a wet bench, you can really get quite wet before your feel the TEMPERATURE difference. Too late!Babies born vaginally pick up microbes from the mother not gained in C-section. These are now being realized to be protective microorganisms. This can predispose you for certain diseases.The benefit of mother's milk is incredible. But the infant formula industry is worth $70 billion. So lets outlaw breast-feeding outside your home confines?This book came out prior to Covid. But the Diseases chapter speaks right to this topic.""The fact is,"" he (Washington University's Michael Kinch) says, ""we are really no better prepared for a bad outbreak today than we were when Spanish flu killed tens of millions of people a hundred years ago. The reason we haven't had another experience like that isn't because we have been especially vigilant. It's because we have been lucky.""I listened to the Audio Book read by the author. He is a good reader. I bought a hard-copy too so I can highlight key points. The notes and full index in the appendix are handy to look items up."

It's a marvelous machine--no, far better actually, Bryson realizes and writes: no machine made by man has yet had (and likely never will) the complexity, strength, flexibility, endurance, and intelligence of the human body. It's a good place to live. Bryson has written about pretty much everything from hiking the Appalachian Trail to living in England to--well, everything (A Short History of Everything was the first of his books I read), always with a sense of humor and curiosity about the world around him. He is an American transplant to the UK where he met his wife and they have spent most of their married years, but he retains an American view of the world (yes there is one, identifiable by passers-by on the street even without hearing the accent, a British coworker and friend assures me) and the body even as he interviews experts and includes examples from both countries. As Bryson tours around and through the body chapter by chapter it is astonishing how much is unique about humans from other members of the animal kingdom, how intricately things fit together and work in the only way they possibly could, and how little we know about how and why the body and its parts work. Bryson describes these intricate mechanics, chemistry, and physics as the end result of genetic mutation or environmental adaptation and often gently deflects away theories of intelligent design, even when the statistical probability of evolution approaches impossibly small numbers. This isn't a medical textbook or how-to guide to personal health and body maintenance. It is just a fun exercise in curiosity about the shell our minds, souls, and lives occupy, and the scientists and medical doctors and experimenters who have poked and prodded it through the centuries. The usual suspects are in play (da Vinci, Harvey, Salk) but leave it to Bryson to highlight the often oddball men and women who haven't been given the credit they deserve. It is astonishing how little was known two centuries ago, last century, even last decade and how wrong prevailing theories and treatments were then; it raises the question of how astonishing current medical practices will appear to our grandchildren just a few decades hence. It was also written and published before the corona virus pandemic exploded, so it does not specifically address the virus, although he does write about why pharmaceutical companies are investing less and less time and money in research and development of drugs to treat these new environmental risks; as a consequence, Bryson concludes prophetically, ""In the event of a really catastrophic epidemic--one that killed children or young adults in large numbers, say--Kinch believes we wouldn't be able to produce vaccine fast enough to treat everyone, even if the vaccine was effective."" (p. 334) Of course, any medical cure is far from a sure thing. Bryson notes how while we are by far healthier globally on average due to the defeat of major infectious diseases--tuberculosis, pneumonia, and most influenzas--by a small set of treatments, more people now face health risks from lifestyle choices. Indeed, the average American life span suffers in comparison to the citizens of most modern advanced economies, despite spending far more per capita on health care than other nations. We're overstuffed (eating 20% more calories per day on average than citizens of healthier European countries, Bryson says), oversedentary due to desk jobs and television obsessions, and oversedated on medications that have marginal benefits or lead to prescription drug dependency. This is still the best time to be alive for every human in every country, and America is still a great country with great doctors and nurses, but pushing away from the pizza, putting down the remote, and considering improvements to the economic and political climate of health care could benefit every body.It's no sin to be glad you're alive in the body you've been given. Enjoy it with the curiosity and the attention it deserves courtesy of Bryson. "

But it didn't take long to settle in and enjoy Bryson's style; his candor brings a nice voice to the book. He methodically goes through each body system, but keeps it interesting with multiple historical, scientific, and/or humorous anecdotes about each. Trivia for DAYS!  I think laywomen and medical professionals alike will enjoy it equally.Copied and pasted a bunch of quotes here---just for the hell of it.“The most remarkable part of all is your DNA. You have a metre of it packed into every cell, and so many cells that if you formed all the DNA in your body into a single fine strand it would stretch ten billion miles, to beyond Pluto.8 Think of it: there is enough of you to leave the solar system. You are in the most literal sense cosmic.”“Just sitting quietly, doing nothing at all, your brain churns through more information in thirty seconds than the Hubble Space Telescope has processed in thirty years. A morsel of cortex one cubic millimeter in size—about the size of a grain of sand—could hold two thousand terabytes of information, enough to store all the movies ever made, trailers included, or about 1.2 billion copies of this book.”“For each visual input, it takes a tiny but perceptible amount of time—about two hundred milliseconds, one-fifth of a second—for the information to travel along the optic nerves and into the brain to be processed and interpreted. One-fifth of a second is not a trivial span of time when a rapid response is required—to step back from an oncoming car, say, or to avoid a blow to the head. To help us deal better with this fractional lag, the brain does a truly extraordinary thing: it continuously forecasts what the world will be like a fifth of a second from now, and that is what it gives us as the present. That means that we never see the world as it is at this very instant, but rather as it will be a fraction of a moment in the future. We spend our whole lives, in other words, living in a world that doesn’t quite exist yet.”“There are thousands of things that can kill us—slightly more than eight thousand, according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems compiled by the World Health Organization—and we escape every one of them but one. For most of us, that’s not a bad deal.”“I’ve said it before in another book, but I believe it’s worth repeating: the only thing special about the elements that make you is that they make you. That is the miracle of life.”“All that is really going in your mouth is texture and chemicals. It is your brain that reads these scentless, flavorless molecules and vivifies them for your pleasure. Your brownie is sheet music. It is your brain that makes it a symphony.”“In breathing, as in everything in life, the numbers are staggering – indeed fantastical. Every time you breathe, you exhale some 25 sextillion (that’s 2.5 × 1022) molecules of oxygen – so many that with a day’s breathing you will in all likelihood inhale at least one molecule from the breaths of every person who has ever lived.1 And every person who lives from now until the sun burns out will from time to time breathe in a bit of you. At the atomic level, we are in a sense eternal.”“Make no mistake. This is a planet of microbes. We are here at their pleasure. They don’t need us at all. We’d be dead in a day without them.”“The nucleus accumbens, a region of the forebrain associated with pleasure, grows to its largest size in one’s teenage years. At the same time, the body produces more dopamine, the neurotransmitter that conveys pleasure, than it ever will again. That is why the sensations you feel as a teenager are more intense than at any other time of life. But it also means that seeking pleasure is an occupational hazard for teenagers. The leading cause of deaths among teenagers is accidents—and the leading cause of accidents is simply being with other teenagers. When more than one teenager is in a car, for instance, the risk of an accident multiplies by 400 percent.”“The most universal expression of all is a smile, which is rather a nice thought. No society has ever been found that doesn’t respond to smiles in the same way. True smiles are brief—between two-thirds of a second and four seconds. That’s why a held smile begins to look menacing. A true smile is the one expression that we cannot fake. As the French anatomist G.-B. Duchenne de Boulogne noticed as long ago as 1862, a genuine, spontaneous smile involves the contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle in each eye, and we have no independent control over those muscles. You can make your mouth smile, but you can’t make your eyes sparkle with feigned joy.”“Capgras syndrome is a condition in which sufferers become convinced that those they know well are imposters. In Klüver-Bucy syndrome the victim develops urges to eat and fornicate indiscriminately (to the understandable dismay of loved ones).46 Perhaps the most bizarre of all is Cotard delusion, in which the sufferer believes he is dead and cannot be convinced otherwise.47”“(Thin people have more gut microbes than fat people; having hungry microbes may at least partly account for their thinness.)”“Getting old is the surest route to dying.”“Pain is full of paradoxes. Its most self-evident characteristic is that it hurts–that’s what it is there for, after all–but sometimes pain feels slightly wonderful: when your muscles ache after a long run, say, or when you slide into a bath that is at once unbearably hot but also, somehow, deliciously not.”“Heat is lost at the surface, so the more surface area you have relative to volume, the harder you must work to stay warm. That means that little creatures have to produce heat more rapidly than large creatures. They must therefore lead completely different lifestyles. An elephant’s heart beats just thirty times a minute, a human’s sixty, a cow’s between fifty and eighty, but a mouse’s beats six hundred times a minute—ten times a second. Every day, just to survive, the mouse must eat about 50 percent of its own body weight. We humans, by contrast, need to consume only about 2 percent of our body weight to supply our energy requirements. One area where animals are curiously—almost eerily—uniform is with the number of heartbeats they have in a lifetime. Despite the vast differences in heart rates, nearly all animals have about 800 million heartbeats in them if they live an average life. The exception is humans. We pass 800 million heartbeats after twenty-five years, and just keep on going for another fifty years and 1.6 billion heartbeats or so. It is tempting to attribute this exceptional vigor to some innate superiority on our part, but in fact it is only over the last ten or twelve generations that we have deviated from the standard mammalian pattern thanks to improvements in our life expectancy. For most of our history, 800 million beats per lifetime was about the human average, too.”""Altogether, 80 percent of all autoimmune diseases occur in women. Hormones are the presumed culprit, but how exactly female hormones trip up the immune system when male hormones don’t is not at all clear.”“Passionate kissing alone, according to one study, results in the transfer of up to one billion bacteria from one mouth to another, along with about 0.7 milligrams of protein, 0.45 milligrams of salt, 0.7 micrograms of fat, and 0.2 micrograms of “miscellaneous organic compounds” (that is, bits of food)”“An interesting thing about touch is that the brain doesn’t just tell you how something feels, but how it ought to feel. That’s why the caress of a lover feels wonderful, but the same touch by a stranger would feel creepy or horrible. It’s also why it is so hard to tickle yourself.”“An increase of only a degree or so in body temperature has been shown to slow the replication rate of viruses by a factor of two hundred—an astonishing increase in self-defense from only a very modest rise in warmth.”“Most of us have experienced that abrupt feeling of falling while asleep known as a hypnic or myoclonic jerk. No one knows why we have this sensation. One theory is that it goes back to the days when we slept in trees and had to take care not to fall off. The jerk may be a kind of fire drill. That may seem far-fetched, but it is a curious fact, when you think about it, that no matter how profoundly unconscious we get, or how restless, we almost never fall out of bed, even unfamiliar beds in hotels and the like. We may be dead to the world, but some sentry within us keeps track of where the bed’s edge is and won’t let us roll over it (except in unusually drunk or fevered circumstances). Some part of us, it seems, pays heed to the outside world, even for the heaviest sleepers.”“Dreaming may simply be a by-product of this nightly cerebral housecleaning. As the brain clears wastes and consolidates memories, neural circuits fire randomly, briefly throwing up fragmentary images, a bit like someone jumping between television channels when looking for something to watch. Confronted with this incoherent flow of memories, anxieties, fantasies, suppressed emotions, and the like, the brain possibly tries to make a sensible narrative out of it all, or possibly, because it is itself resting, doesn’t try at all, and just lets the incoherent pulses flow past. That may explain why we generally don’t remember dreams much despite their intensity—because they are not actually meaningful or important.”"
211,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3219987-steve-lovell,4,"Consider this the next time you are contemplating a deep, deep pash with your dearest one - ‘Passionate kissing alone, according to one study, results in the transfer of up to a billion bacteria from one mouth to another, along with about 0.7 milligrams of protein, 0.45 milligrams of salt, 0.7 micrograms of fat and 0.2 micrograms of miscellaneous organic compounds (ie, bits of food).’Bill Bryson was only getting started with ‘The Body’ when he thrust at us the above information. There’s much more hair-curling stuff to contend with as one reads on in the tome. In here, for instance, you will be illuminated on how the daily activities of double-decker bus conductors and drivers in London gave rise to the present urgings for each and every one of us to exercise daily. It is fascinating to think that our best guess is that, sometime between 1900 and 1912, a random patient with a random disease for the first time could visit a random doctor and have a fifty-fifty chance of profiting from that encounter. Nowadays, to be healthy, as one would expect, it helps if you are part of the population of the western world. You receive added benefits, of course, if you are wealthy. But even the rich, if they are born in the good ol’ US of A, can expect to have a much lower life expectancy that those of us residing any other developed country. The causes for this include the dire state of their health system, obesity, gun culture, accident rates, drug abuse and the list goes on. A sufferer of cystic fibrosis in Canada will, on average, live ten years longer than some poor soul, with the identical affliction. living south of its border with the US I wonder if Trump, with his ‘Make America Great Again’ has devoted any of his immense intellect to those facts. He’d probably label it under ‘fake news’ in any case.In the pages of this book you will also meet the heroes, many unsung till Bryson came along, who paved the way for the great medical discoveries of history; get a taste of some of the excruciating surgical practises of the past (early mastectomies being particularly gruesome) and meet the charlatans who were believed by many, to the world’s detriment. One odious character was Barnard Davis who became obsessed with the so-called discipline of craniology. His collusion with George Augustus Robinson’s widow to plunder the graves of our island’s first peoples, to add to his skull collection, the globe's biggest at the time, makes for hard reading.Overall ‘The Body’ is quite the revelation. And it is, at times, not exactly comforting what we find out about its workings, especially as I am in possession of an increasingly ageing one. He doesn’t stint on what can take you away in the end either.Bryson mostly places it all in lingo the layman can readily comprehend, with the turn of phrase he is noted for, topped by dollops of humour. He’s no spring chicken himself, Mr Bryson, but long may he have the ability to pursue his wide range of interests and to transport them into print for our enlightenment. With this publication he takes a lens to every facet of the human being in a thoroughly readable and forthright manner. He is a gem of a wordsmith.And in the end, at the end, it’s good to know that, ‘In 2011, an interesting milestone in human history was passed. For the first time more people, globally, died of non-communicable diseases like heart failure, stroke and diabetes than from all infectious diseases combines. We live in an age in which we are killed, more often than not, by lifestyle.’ - or is it? What’s that news I hear coming out of China?"
212,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1659159-edward,4,"“Guide” is an appropriate word as Bryson leads the reader into the many and mysterious complexities of the human body . He begins with the chemical components that make up the body, the major components being oxygen and carbon, the rest being smaller, mostly trace elments, fifty-seven or so of them. From here, he works his way down the body from the head to the extremities, inside and out, and relates all of this information in clear and occasional wryly humorous language  The human body is made up of configurations, some of which we share with other mammals, and some which are uniquely human. Some of these differences can be explained by evolutionary processes, some remain a puzzle as how they developed or why they’re there, the appendix or tonsils being good examples. One thing that Bryson is very good at is giving the history of discoveries about the body. A few explorers’ names are familiar but for the most part these individuals have long since been forgotten, even though the discoveries of these unsung heroes, particularly in the area of diseases, have been important. Research on the body is ongoing, and it’s doubtful it will ever cease, as the body is always changing in subtle and complex ways that we don’t fully understand and will always need further study.  Perhaps the best way to get a sense of this book is to look at the table of contents. Bryson begins with the body’s covering, the skin, and this leads to a discussion of the trillions of microbes that pass through our coverings and their openings.  That taken care of, Bryson take on the brain, its covering, the head or skull, “down the hatch” of the mouth and throat, an excursion into the “chemistry department” (what goes wrong, for example, in the case of diabetes), then back to the skeleton, the immune system, lungs and breathing, and finally into the intestines or gurts. What makes the book particularly interesting are related topics that these body parts give rise to. The skeleton, for instance, leads into chapters on equilibrium, movement, and exercise. The immune system is connected to diseases (when things go wrong). Related topics are nerves and pain, medicine, food (“food, glorious food”) and diet.  It’s not just the parts of the body that are being discussed, but how the body functions, and dysfunctions, how it works, or doesn’t work, in all kinds of ways. A healthy body is always of interest, and even though our end, death and the disintegration of the body, is inevitable, human beings have always wanted to get to the end in reasonably good shape. The book, then, in addition to being a guide to the exploration and explanation of body parts, , is also a guide as to how we best occupy and use that body. The answers are not always evident, but Bryson seems to have done thorough and credible research into these murky areas.  "
213,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81618966-erin-ferguson,5,"Bill Bryson is a talented author -- he not only knows how to make science accessible to a lay audience, but he also knows how to make it relatable (i.e. using clear analogies, connecting it to the reader's personal life, etc.). For anyone with a science background, this book may not be for you as it only touches the surface of each body system (ex: I found the chapter on the brain fairly basic). However, Bryson gives some great backstory into revolutionary discoveries and the lives of influential scientists that I found interesting. Additionally, I really enjoyed reading about the body systems I am least familiar with, especially chapters 1 (How to Build a Human), 13 (Deep Breath: The Lungs and Breathing), and 15 (The Guts). Overall, a very entertaining read, and I am always awestruck by how intricate, reliable, yet finicky the human body is. (If you need fun facts to impress at parties -- this is the book for you!!)Favorite facts!(Pg 4) You blink fourteen thousand times a day -- so much that your eyes are shut for twenty-three minutes of every waking day. (Pg 212) Every time you breathe, you exhale some 25 sextillion (that's 2.5 x 10^22) molecules of oxygen -- so many that with a day's breathing you will in all likelihood inhale at least one molecule from the breaths of every person who has ever lived. And every person who lives from now until the sun burns out will from time to time breathe in a bit of you. (Pgs 351-353) [The story of Schatz discovering streptomycin & his supervisor Waksman taking credit] ""Twenty years after Waksman's death, the American Society for Microbiology made a somewhat belated attempt at amends by inviting Schatz to address the society on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of streptomycin's discovery. In recognition of his achievements, and presumably without giving the matter a lot of thought, it bestowed on him its highest award: the Selman A. Waksman medal. Life sometimes really is very unfair."""
214,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4587974-scott,4,"Bill Bryson is a wonderful explainer of stuff. He takes complex subjects and makes them easier to understand as well as anyone I've ever read. In his latest undertaking, he lays out in fascinating detail the people and events that have led to much of our knowledge of the human design. The anecdotes he tells and language he uses are often hilarious.Even though Bryson is an outstanding and entertaining teacher, this is still not a book to be taken lightly (at least for me). There are many complicated names for body parts and systems that perform unfathomable functions, which can make this read a bit overwhelming. But that is not to suggest that this is not an enjoyable book. It most definitely is. You will pick up many fascinating tidbits along the way. To quote some examples:•	""if you formed all the DNA in your body into a single strand, it would stretch ten billion miles, to beyond Pluto. Think of it: there is enough of you to leave the solar system.""•	In speaking of all the microbes that we contain, ""if you put all Earth's microbes in one heap and all the other animal life in another, the microbe heap would be twenty-five times greater than the animal one.""•	""Every time you breathe, you exhale some 25 sextillion molecules of oxygen - so many that with a day's breathing you will in all likelihood inhale at least one molecule from the breaths of every person who has ever lived. And every person who lives from now until the sun burns out will from time to time breath in a bit of you.""There are also some amazingly eye-opening facts about the state of medicine and the colossal cost of health care in the USA, how we stack up in life expectancy versus the rest of the world, and much more. A very provocative book that explains how far we have come, but also how much we still don't know about the mysterious and miraculous thing that is the human body. Well done as usual by this author."
215,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7364022-gabe,4,"As always for Bryson, the book was well written. He is a great storyteller. It was a nice summary of how our organisms work. It had some curiosities, he's paid tribute to some forgotten scientists. I haven't learnt that much as from Short History of Nearly Everything, but I still enjoyed it I was soo affected by the story on breast surgery! It was really moving and graphic."
216,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42348880-bence-gaspar,5,"A superbly entertaining account of the body, offering an interesting anecdote or fun fact on every page. One can’t help but marvel at how amazing a structure the human body is. Bryson’s style is brilliant as always."
217,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5213585-adina,2,"I've read and enjoyed many Bill Bryson books, especially At Home. That was a book about the evolution, social significance, history, and many quirky details about how we humans inhabit a home. I hoped this book would be the same. Instead it is more like reading an encyclopedia with quirky details. I found myself thinking ""will I remember any of this?"" Ultimately I stopped at about 40% deciding the other books on my TBR shelf would be more compelling. "
218,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241516-collin-mickle,4,"Bill Bryson is the reigning king of the Hey Martha. It's an old newspaper term for an irresistible fact, something that makes you look up from your morning paper and blurt across the cornflakes to the person at the other end of the table: ""Hey Martha, didja know...?""All Bryson books are Hey Martha treasure troves. But The Body: A Guide for Occupants reads like it was designed to make Martha cry uncle -- or sprinkle strychnine in the reader's cereal. A sampling (forgive me, Martha): The average human is 61 percent oxygen! The DNA in your body, if stretched out, would reach past Pluto! You shed more than a million skin flakes an hour! (That one had me reaching for the duster.) Your taste buds are replaced every 10 days or so! And on and on, until your eyes start to close (which they do, on average, for 23 minutes of every waking day!)When the book is working, which is most of the time, the reader is borne along on a tide of factoids, an enjoyable if sort of glib experience, like having a very chatty roommate who's cramming for the MCAT. When it slows down, as it does especially in the last two chapters, it becomes a little ponderous, like that same roommate has gotten really high and wants you to just, like, THINK about stuff, man. (""Death is, for most of us, the most terrifying event imaginable."" ""Aging has inescapable consequences for us all."" ""Nothing in medicine is simple."")In the end, though, this is a deeply researched and entertaining book that only suffers in comparison to Bryson at his best."
219,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42162715-carol,5,"This book was so utterly fascinating that I blew through all 383 pages in about five days. I thought it would be a dry, scientific exploration of the human body that would require determination to get through, but I was wrong. The author brilliantly addresses each part of the body in relatively short chapters, starting with the wonder of our outer skin, then the microbes that inhabit us by the trillions, then the head, the brain, the senses, circulatory system, and so on. It is captivating prose, to be sure. I was riveted to each page which was surprising, considering the length of the book. The author doesn't offer mind-numbing scientific or technical information but rather stories about the progression of medical knowledge over the centuries, and at times the absolutely horrific ways that health and illness were dealt with in the old days. The author also inserts hilarious comments and observations from time to time which were delightful, as were the fascinating trivia that will be sure to entertain at my next party. For example, did you know that a severed head may well be conscious from two to seven seconds after it's parted from its body? Or how about the fact that over the past 50 years, it's been found that men's sexual organs are actually growing smaller and no one knows why?! How's that for a great conversation starter!? Anyway, this is a fantastic book which, in my opinion, joins the ranks of Sapiens and How Not to Die as a thought-provoking and life-changing experience and I couldn't recommend it more."
220,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33625087-cmrmahesh,5,"This is yet another of my favorites from Bill Bryson. If you haven't read his earlier work ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", you should. I place it at par with Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens though I am comparing apples and oranges here. Combing back to The Body: A guide for occupants, it is a combination of extensive research and superlative storytelling so that even laymen can understand the subject. And this is pure bliss to read. Each chapter begins with the structural properties of the organs and then moves on to how it functions. All the while mentioning funny/serious anecdotes and the amount of research and difficulties in bringing the state of medicine to its current form. He then moves on to mention why a specific part works that way. (most common reason being unknown). You wonder at the number of unknowns present in our body and how the field of medicine tackled historically.At the end of the book, he explains diseases and their effects on our bodies. One of the statements that struck me very odd:""For the first time, more people globally died from non-communicable diseases like heart failure, stroke and diabetes than from all infectious diseases combined. We live in an age which we are killed, more often than not, by lifestyle"".This makes us wonder how far we have come from being hunter-gathers to couch potatoes and call that as progress wrt lifestyle. If this book doesn't make you thankful for your body, if it doesn't push you to take more care of it, then perhaps nothing will.A Must read."
221,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1930002-c-mckenzie,5,"Bryson lives up to he reputation for making a very large and very complex ""landscape"" comprehensible, informative and wryly entertaining.I learned a lot about this package I inhabit, and Bryson's guidebook dispelled many misconceptions I had. The chapter on viruses was an eyeopener, and of course, very timely. I recommend The Body to anyone interested in a flash course in your grand, complicated and extraordinary design. It's not light summer reading, and the final chapter is just that. Final. Very."
222,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4461733-paperclippe,4,"I've always loved Bill Bryson, ever since finding a copy of his ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" on the book shelf at my Aunt Kim's house. I spent a long week one summer by the pool not getting cool and splashing, but getting tanned and sweaty because I couldn't put the damn thing down. ""The Body"" reminded me the most of that aforementioned tome of all of Bryson's works except maybe ""One Summer"" (unrelated to my pool-side adventures). It was full of Bill's wit and humor without distorting the facts, some of which were more than a little disturbing. I'm not talking about gross body stuff; I'm fine with gross body stuff. But did you know that an equal volume of Heinz ketchup has more sugar than Coke? I didn't know that and I didn't want to know that. This book doesn't go too in-depth into one particular area of anatomy as the title might suggest, but nor does it skimp on the details. Much like ""A Short History,"" this is a wonderful and easy-to-read overview of the human body with all it's weird quirks and mysteries and frankly bad ideas. It's almost like ""A Short History of Human Anatomy,"" and I enjoyed it. The only thing it was missing was a little bit of that characteristic Bryson humor and charm. It's understandable that that might go by the wayside in such a fact-rich text, but I did long for it a little more. That said, it definitely didn't diminish the readability or overall pace of the book. And I don't think I'll ever eat ketchup again. "
223,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1806073-alicia,5,"I am totally here for Bryson's walk through the body. I actually borrowed the print copy after waiting for the digital copy and realizing that I needed the tactile print book rather than the digital version to be able to digest as much as possible- and I still won't remember HALF of what Bryson talks about but still find it endlessly fascinating. He has elements of goofy humor as well as intriguing factoids and biographical sketches of discoverers (including women who made finds that were barely recognized) Similarly, his approach is unscientifically scientific. For the layperson reading the book about the body he doesn't talk down to the reader nor does he include unnecessary jargon that impedes my ability to understand what he's telling me. Rarely did I finish a paragraph and not know what I was reading. I did learn quite a few pieces about how the body works and like many of his books, while he's British himself, includes a bunch of strategic information about the United States. It was equal parts knowledge-acquisition and entertainment while placating the couch scientist in us all. The storytelling was strong in how Bryson approached the understanding of body functions and design. "
224,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36858923-angela,4,"This is a very interesting book. It talks about everything concerning the human body. It doesn't go into extreme depth which is good because I, not being a scientist myself, would not have understood much. But it does contain some very interesting facts about life. It debunks a few myths and mentions some very interesting trivia. It certainly makes you look as life and yourself in a different way. When it comes to the chapters about deceases and bacteria and viruses I dare say one is in danger of becoming hypochondriac or OCD with cleaning. I did have a lot of fun reading this book and sharing some of the more extraordinary facts with my husband who loves knowledge but can't really keep his attention on a book that is as big as this one. I personally couldn't wait to have some free time to sit down and devour this. The greatest thing I learned from this book is that there is a huge amount of thigs that remain unexplained. Humanities scientific knowledge remains so small, don't let the size of the book fool you. There are a lot of problems to solve, a lot of diseases to cure, and then comes the question of wether we should because we are playing Gods. "
225,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/935604-wes-f,5,"Wow!--what a book! Amazing tour through the whole body, section by section. Bryson makes it all so interesting, engaging, insightful, and awe-some. Yes, awesome in the sense that one has to just step back and give praise to the Creator who designed such an intricate, amazing, incredible, complex, unrivaled piece of machinery--the human body. Oh, wait, it's not just a hunk of random man-made machinery...it's a divinely designed body, mind & soul that cannot be replicated. One of the common themes that crops up is--despite all the years of studying, the best minds still don't understand why or how this part of the body or mind works in such & such a way. A great treatise on all the amazing facts of how our bodies and minds work--and of the medical discoveries & the discoverers down through the centuries, as only a great writer like Bryson can pen. His writing just continue to get better in my opinion. I got this as a Christmas gift from one of my children--read it on my iPad. Check it out!"
226,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18870347-wendy,4,"3.75* Listening to this book (read by the author) reminds me of sitting at a biology/anatomy lecture hall. Not that that's a bad thing. Bill Bryson is a good author and he's made this topic very interesting and readable. One learns about the human body and trivia and tidbits about the same. For example, one can put together the different elements to ""build a human"". But putting elements together does not really mean that life will begin. So, the fact that humans are living, breathing, and thinking is plain amazing. This book delves into each of the body's systems (nervous, digestive, etc.) and also elucidates such points as pain and thoughts . We are introduced to the famous and forgotten names of scientific pioneers who have helped decode the mystery that is the human being. If one has an interest in how our bodies work and what we can do to be healthier, this is definitely a good book to read."
227,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16929426-tracy,4,"Bryson, as usual, is a delight. He delves into the workings of the body, from skin to spleen and brain to bones, with humor and curiosity. What we don't know could fill the universe, it seems. Interspersed are tidbits on the weird and disturbing history of medicine as well as the scientists - brave, strange and maniacal - who contributed to our hard-won knowledge of human biology and disease. A puzzling and gratifying read. "
228,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5895921-matthew-pilgrim,3,"It took almost 30 years for me to start treating my body with more care. It was around that age that the negative consequences of constant streams of soda and gummy candies began to show themselves. This book gave me more insight into the processes that make my body function properly or improperly. The most interesting parts were the profiles of the eccentric scientists who made great discoveries while having wild personality quirks. I'm not sure whether it has helped me take better care of my body, but it was entertaining! "
229,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17149877-tamara,5,"Listened to the audio narrated by Bryson while traveling with the family. My husbands first audiobook. We thoroughly enjoyed this book, and brysons humour. Definitely recommend. "
230,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27694088-michael,5,"I love Bill Bryson's style. The tone and level of detail in ""The Body"" is nearly identical to ""A Short History of Nearly Everything,"" but perhaps with a greater focus on modern knowledge. Bill takes us on a wandering path through the organ systems and sensations of everyday life, while inserting anecdotes about discoveries and unfortunate medical conditions.His stories remained interesting and helped me to retain the trivia facts which were tumbling out of every line. My one complaint is that the writing got a little repetitive in the phrasing of each chapter and his formula for identifying the Nobel Prize winning scientist for each major organ system or field of medical research.I enjoyed it; this book is relatively quick and packed with humor, practical information, and a compilation of mini-historical narratives."
231,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8699405-anna-gooding-call,3,"This was...OK. I got it as a free ALC from Libro.fm, which was very nice, and Bryson's reading voice is great, but I didn't find myself enthralled. Bryson's at his best when he's personal and funny, and I don't feel that he ever hit his groove with this skimmy, trivia-heavy book. Whence the days when he struggled entertainingly to pitch a tent? Here's the book I was hoping for: wryly and with great self-deprecating wit, Bryson relates the struggles of his own aging body to the science of aging. Too real, maybe. Even so, I'd have read a version of this that drove deep into some of the weirder mysteries of micronutrients and things. My entire review is up at my website, so go read that if you're unsure."
232,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,4,"This is another highly entertaining book by Bill Bryson. I'll happily read anything he ever writes on any subject whatsoever. In The Body he takes on the wonderful and complex thing that is the human body he makes it comprehensible to the reader. He does this with humor and an eye for fascinating details. Along the way he tells the stories of the scientific heroes who have made important discoveries about how the human body works, and he gives them the praise (and occasional censure) that they deserve. Bryson simply does not know how to be boring and this book is enjoyable from beginning to end. I, on the other hand, DO know how to be boring, and I've been boring my family with facts about the human body for the past few days. They are going to be relieved that I'm finally done with this book."
233,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3812935-debbie,4,"Bryson’s latest has his trademark high-level research. He details the intricacies of the human body in extraordinary detail, yet it is an easily accessible read for any layperson. Typical of Bryson, readers will learn about far more than the title topic, such as the debut of an infectious disease and not just its consequences to The Body or one man’s devious co-opting of credit from another scientist who actually discovered “xyz.” As delightfully informative and revealing as his book is, what disappoints me is that Bryson continually credits “accidents” of evolution for our remarkable physiology rather than even once looking up and crediting God or intelligent design, but no; in fact he mocks such a belief. So, for a believer, read this book, absolutely yes, but let it inform and underscore how “fearfully and wonderfully” are made. "
234,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58422714-m-v-f,4,"this is a lazy history of the human body, but fantastically written. it is not meant to be a medical textbook, but i do think i’ve recalled more trivia + interesting facts from reading this book than my undergrad degree in medical science. i am not saying that everything is explained well enough to enable you to start diagnosing weird maladies on hapless patients, but it's enough to get you interested in the odd, fleshy body of yours. what i loved most about this volume is that bill bryson has paid particular attention to the unsung heroes of medical science, practice, and discovery - the ones who were ignored and ridiculed by the rest of their professional colleagues for their outrageous discoveries, and the lab assistants who put in the hard yards but came last in the acknowledgements of discovery."
235,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931581-cathy,4,"Before this book, I had not read any of Bill Bryson’s work. I had heard of his talent and the light but informative style he so skillfully uses, so when this book came up for me to review on NetGalley, I snatched it. And now I am going to move some of his other books up on my to-read list. If you’d like to know more about your whole body and like to be entertained while you learn, Bryson’s for you. You should end up with plenty of tidbits to share with your family and friends. *I received an ARC of this book in exchange for my honest review.

This is the first book I've read by Bill Bryson and it won't be the last! He does an amazing job and providing a lot of information in a clear and interesting way. One warning though....there are parts, that while super interesting, are also uncomfortable to listen to. It contains frightening info about antibiotics resistance, gruesome historical medical treatments and cringeworthy ways people have died or failed to die when it seems like they should have. Also, take a walk and eat a vegetable. It is amazing how much your body depends on you moving around a little and eating reasonably. "
237,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2490922-melanie,4,"One of the better Bryson books. He methodically winds his way through the human body, starting with the skin and hair, and bringing the reader on a journey through all of the organs and body systems, our microbial selves, sleep, diseases, medicine and even death. My favorite parts were his forays into the history of our knowledge of how particular parts of the body function and how that knowledge changed and developed over time. He didn't go back much further than a couple of hundred years, and mostly looked at Western knowledge. It might have been interesting to widen that perspective, but I certainly enjoyed learning what he offered with his signature wit woven in. It was also lovely to hear him read the audiobook."
238,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15950236-aaron-noy,4,"Bryson has a knack for making everything entertaining and easy for the layman to understand so overall this very enjoyable. He tends to give a lot of focus on odd facts and quirky characters from the history of science, which leave you wanting to badger those around you random tidbits. What stuck me most is how little we still know about how our bodies work.This felt a little rushed and shallow in places, which is understandable as its such a vast subject and certainly isn't meant to be exhaustive. It's definitely not as fun as 'A Short History of Nearly Everything', his earlier layman's guide to science, which had a wider array of mind boggling facts and historial heros and oddballs to draw upon."
239,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73363410-brett-w,4,"Any of you watch Billy Madison? Remember during the final phase of the academic decathlon Billy gave an answer to which his principal said - Mr. Madison, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it.Well, after reading this book I’m the total opposite. I can’t say anything without sounding like a complete genius. Anyways, really enjoyed it. Tons of great info about the human anatomy, the history of healthcare and medicine, health trends, and classic Bryson one liners and anecdotes. Check it out."
240,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199883-aditurbo,1,"DNF. I can't believe I'm DNF-ing a Bill Bryson book, but that's how it is. I was so looking forward to reading this one, as I read and loved all of Bryson's books up till now. However, this one doesn't feel like a Bill Bryson book at all. It's very dry, there's none of Bryson's wonderful humor in it, as there was in his ""History of Everything,"" a superb scientific read. There are some sort of nasty, or at least snarky comments here and there, and as others here have mentioned, unbased conclusions which seem to be based on the author's views. I identify with his views, but would like my popular science books to prove things to me based on scientific knowledge and not opinion. Not sure what happened here but I don't have to continue reading this. "
241,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1624588-bonny,4,"I knew that I would want to listen to The Body as soon as I read the exciting news that Bill Bryson had written a book along the lines of A Short History of Nearly Everything and he himself was narrating it. And I was not disappointed! I was fascinated, entertained, and surprised at just how much we don't know about the human body. Nobody does minutiae like Bill Bryson, but he does it with humor and wonderful storytelling. My background is in a health-related profession, so I thought I would know much of what was contained in this book, but there was plenty that was new to me. This is a valuable, educational, and interesting book that I highly recommend. "
242,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108705241-matthew-oxman,3,"A solid book, although probably would have been just as good at 150 pages instead of 400. The book seems carefully researched and thorough, and I genuinely enjoyed reading it. However, it started to seem like a collection of factoids and I got the feeling Bryson just consulted the Wikipedia article for whatever part of the body he was writing about. The book didn't really have any overarching theme, other than that the body is complicated and has a lot of stuff going on. However, I'd still recommend it (or at least skimming it) to anyone with an interest in the human body -- you will definitely learn a lot.  "
243,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58702014-j-lee-hazlett,4,"4.5 stars. A riveting book, serious/scary at appropriate moments but cut through regularly enough with Bryson's typical humor to prevent depression or hopelessness in the reader. Dropped half a star due to a couple of items that are questioned amongst medical experts but were presented as hard facts. Considering the range of topics covered and the massive amount of things we simply don't know for certain about our bodies, however, Bryson does a great job overall in his highlighting of controversies and uncertainties. I learned many things I didn't know, and now have about 10 more books on my to-read list due to shout-outs in this text. Utterly fascinating, and worth the time to read."
244,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19423048-blake,3,"This book is what you’d expect. Pleasant and entertaining writing from Bryson, but obviously too broad to be at all insightful. My main gripe, and I can’t remember if I noticed this before in his other books, is that at least half the content is historical gossip about the people who discovered things. Even then there’s just not enough time to do them justice, and Bryson comes off as ignorantly judgmental at best (“so and so discovered XYZ but he was a philanderer” etc. - so what?). Learned a some interesting facts (which I’ll likely forget within the next few weeks), and it’s not awful, but I can’t really recommend it."
245,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58244775-jen,1,One star = DNFI always give 1 star if I DNF a book.I think I would really have liked this book if it had stuck with the factual stuff about the body & not pushed the evolution theory. I ditched it as soon as that started as it doesn’t align with my personal beliefs and I didnt want to listen to hours of it. I get thats an individual thing and will clearly not affect others enjoyment of this book. Of what I did listen to (very little) the facts were fascinating & the narration (by the Author) was really good.
246,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/121828-pat,5,"Just outstanding. My degree is in biology, and I've worked in various health-related fields my entire adult life, but I *still* learned so much from this book. If you have any interest in the miracle that is the human body, and the politics, taboos, disparities, and costs that go with it, do yourself a favor and read this book. Completely engaging and enraging, Bryson has come a long, long way from his early, simple travel books. Side note: I know a book has been great when I find myself reading all the endnotes and references, just because I don't want it to be over yet."
247,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5620172-amy,4,"This is a book of narrative trivia - A coherent text that will provide you with the ""Did you know ...?"" conversation starter. For example, ""Did you know that one of the reasons women were excluded from drug trials was because their menstrual cycles might affect the results?"" <-- Um, wouldn't that actually be a reason to include the women, but, I digress.My only complaint is that with each new section of the body there was frequently ""there's a lot we don't know about this"", ""this hasn't been studied very much"", and other similar sentiments.All in all, I enjoyed the book."
248,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6756276-sngsweelian,5,"Bill Bryson doesn’t disappoint as he provides a very entertaining and informative guide to the various parts of our body, including their functions, problems, medical practices from the past to now and many more fascinating stories about the scientists and doctors who had contributed to the annals of medical knowledge. Reading the book makes me even more of a believer in a Grand Designer, even though Bryson evidently wrote from an evolutionary perspective. Regardless, the book is definitely worth your time. Highly recommended. "
249,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57271790-darlene-nichols,4,"A brief description in non medical terms of how the human body works from head to toe. Included was a fascinating, sometimes appalling history of medical advancements over the years. That and the countless interesting facts, myths, and mysteries made it memorable and shareable. To sum it up, there is much we (as in doctors and scientists) don’t know about the why’s and how’s of the human body, but I I’ve learned a great deal more after reading this book. Give me an ailment and I’ll give you a fact and an interesting story! "
250,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3127538-liz,3,"Another popular look at science for non-scientists. Don’t get me wrong, as usual Bryson is a professional, writing a well researched and easy to read look at the human body. But again for me it is another tome, long and on a too broad of a topic (which seems to be his history in recent books), and which lack the charm and humor of his earlier works. I think I will need to re-read one of those to regain my appreciation for his writing. I think if his next work is again in this direction I will most likely not read it."
251,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1620239-allison,5,This book was FASCINATING!!! I loved how he explained the intricate workings of our human body in an easy to understand of often humorous way. The chapter on flu and how illness is spread was horrifying (being that we are at the height of cold and flu season)! Knowing there is virtually nothing you can do to keep yourself from being exposed to the microbes flying around was very unsettling. (I think I'll go live in my bubble now lol) I would like to buy this book to have on hand to reference every now and then because this book was chock full of details and history!
252,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2350547-dan,5,"Bill Bryson is the kind of writer that could make literally anything interesting and captivating. He is an absolute master at knowing what is entertaining about the seemingly mundane, and he knows exactly what kind of tidbits make someone say “huh!”“The body” is a curated tour through the important parts and systems of *cough* the body. Each detail is expertly picked and explained without ever overstaying its welcome; each backstory on the discovered science is always relevant and often funny. I loved this book and would recommend it to any inquiring mind."
253,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/977989-dave,4,"I prefer Bryson’s travel books, because he is gifted in telling stories and creating characters—especially his own. His information books (like this one) are most fascinating when he ponders the unsung—like the researchers who discover diseases and cures (hooray for Albert Schatz!), or expresses wonder at what is still unknown, or criticizes cruelty and stupidity. But he does all of those a lot in this one, so I would call it most fascinating. What a great writer!I read this as an ARC, which was fine, but I miss the index and the notes. Good bibliography."
254,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51575454-mary,4,"For the most part, I enjoyed this book. As usual, Bill Bryson's wonderful sense of humor comes through as he leads the reader on a tour of the miraculous human body. Along the way he gives examples of the many unsung heroes whose work (and often whose sacrifices) advanced the world's knowledge of how our bodies work. However, at times, the amount of information was a bit overwhelming in its detail. And, I must confess, I skimmed the last chapters dealing with such gloomy subjects as pandemics, cancer and death. "
255,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2431634-chris,5,"Bill Bryson is back with another interesting science book, this time about the human body. Bryson reads the audiobook, which, to me, brings out his excellent dry humor. Even though the details about the brain seem lifted directly from an episode of the PBS show, The Mind, Explained, I still enjoyed Bryson's take on it. I learned a lot about the body and the people who made the discoveries and breakthroughs including those who were not given the credit they deserved (e.g., Gray's Anatomy was illustrated by Henry Carter not the publisher Henry Gray). "
256,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5121309-nilendu-misra,5,"Definitely the best book of 2019. You will never believe you stayed up till 3 am to finish an essentially biology book. With hilarious stories, spot-on metaphors (trying to understand brain by EEG or FMRI is like trying to guess how the game is going by listening to the crowd from outside) and an avuncular narrative style - Mr. Bryson delivered perhaps the best book in his career so far. One for the (old) ages. "
257,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8484509-elisabeth,4,"As I've come to expect from Bryson's books, this was highly readable, educational, and entertaining. I was particularly pleased with the etymological asides (being very interested in linguistics as well). There's just something to be said about a read that is so full of interesting (and often surprising) knowledge that it makes you wan to go 'Did you know that....' to other people all the time (though I'm not sure how much the people in my surroundings appreciate that). "
258,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26072770-jenny-kim,4," This was an easy, breezy, Biology 101 for those who are fascinated by human body, me. I enjoyed this read unlike the Short History of Everything which I just couldn't get into. As usual, Bill Bryson throws in his signature humor and back stories not taught in school which made this an interesting read. However, as mentioned, this is basic, and there were a few cases in the book where he will bring up something and not explain it at all and leave it, which miffed me."
259,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52216459-paul-spence,4,"While this does not contain as much humor as most Bryson books, it is fascinating with the research and facts about how truly remarkable the evolution of the human body is. It was fun to hear about the history of the scientists, doctors and researchers whose names have become familiar to us with everyday health issues. Possibly too much of a focus on the scientific names and associated processes, but overall an enjoyable and engaging read. "
260,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937839-gary-schroeder,5,"A good book to start the new year off with. Bill Bryson can make just about any topic interesting and with ""The Body"", he's chosen one of the most interesting subjects of all. You'll find yourself saying ""hmm, I did not know that!"" at least once per page if not more. Stuffed with interesting facts and surprises about your own flesh suit, you'll be amazed that anything in the body works at all...for there's so very much that could go wrong. Highly recommended. "
261,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23295044-bruce,4,"I liked this a lot. At the same time, it reads a bit like a Ripley's Believe It or Not for grownups, focused on things like the history of breast cancer surgery and the regenerative power of bone cells. Nice, fairly breezy survey of a whole bunch of areas, perfect for intermittent reading, interesting but not life-changing. Classic Bryson. With the exception of his Australia book, I've enjoyed everything he's written."
262,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10757200-stacy,5,Listened to this book and I loved it. I tried to read it at first as I love Bill Bryson but it was way to dry. But listening to it was soooo interesting. I learned a lot! Bryson has a dry sense of humor and it comes out in his narration. The book is organized by 'system' so you can skip around if you are particularly interested in some area of the body. There is an overview as well as little tidbits and quirky facts. Highly recommend the audiobook!
263,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196189-shannon,5,"I listened to the Audible version--Bill Bryson himself reading! I thoroughly enjoyed my hours with him. This book is crazy informative about so many efforts and discoveries made by so many people, both sung and unsung. This book dismantles some myths we hold about medical history and shares a lot of anecdotes. Most of all, it made me appreciate all that bodies do every day. Highly recommended! "
264,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1726429-jenn,4,"This was a great read. Definitely a high-level flyover of a ton of information. I appreciated his honesty about how hard it is to draw conclusions about food and disease, as well as his explanation of what it actually means to increase your chances of disease—unexpected in a popular-level book like this. My one complaint is that, contrary to my usual feelings, i wish the author had not read the audio version. "
265,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8435102-joan,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. What a wealth of information. It's been a long time since anatomy and physiology in college. This book is so reader friendly and contains so much interesting facts and bits of information. I was shocked at some of it, especially in the medicines section. I was surprised by other facts, such as the time it takes food to go through the body. I plan on reading this fascinating book again."
266,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4872872-naomi,5,"Amazing book! Reads like a fun chemistry textbook. I had to make myself stop sharing facts and stories with my family, but I found it all so fascinating. If you're also amazed at how many remarkable things our bodies do every minute, read this book. Bryson is humorous and writes so compellingly that I couldn't wait to read about what bacteria has been found or scientific discovery happens next!"
267,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65227345-laura-kranich,5,"Reading this kind of a book really makes you appreciate the fact how amazing life and our bodies are and that we have managed to evolve this far. This book contains lots of interesting facts, too many to remember all at once. For that reason I think that I'll be reading it again some time and then it'll be just as fascinating as it was now."
268,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23015988-lynn,4,"I didn’t think I could enjoy a non fiction book but heard Bill Bryson being interviewed on CBC radio and just could not resist him. What a charming, informative, engaging book about this physical miracle we are all walking around in. Highly recommended for all humans who have a body. I’m going to do something unprecedented: read this book again. "
269,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2756498-christine,4,"This was a fun read. This was the first book I read by Bill Bryson. I love his style. I love how he took the body and made it interesting, lots of info about different parts of the body do, how that was discovered and he didn't preach at me on how to take care of it. I definitely want to read more books by Bryson now. "
270,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/966800-will-manuel,5,"I learned a LOT reading this book. Bryson does a great job describing the body’s systems, but also passes along entertaining stories about the people who made huge discoveries. It fascinated me, but confirmed my choice not to go into medicine. "
271,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64610041-emily-brown,5,I haven’t read Bill Bryson in over a decade (maybe closer to two) but I’m remembering how much I love the way he writes and how he can make any topic fascinating. I’m looking forward to reading more of his works.
272,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51913728-annie-caruthers-wood,5,"The Body was one of the most fascinating books I’ve ever read. The author is able to take a subject that should be about as exciting as a text book, but inserts humor and unique stories that keep you hooked. "
273,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25878823-guilherme-ferreira,5,"An interesting journey around the systems that compose our body. Full of curiosities this book is a biography of human body sciences, so I recommend it to anyone wanting to know more about our biology or just curiosity to learn more about ourselves."
274,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3710894-rebecca,4,"A thorough, detailed, and often hilarious explanation of anatomy and medical history.Thanks to NetGalley for the free advance reading copy. "

290,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,3,"An informative book about the main systems of the body (nervous, digestive, circulatory, skeletal, immune, etc.). A lot of the book explains how we learned things about the body. Some were mildly interesting, but I didn't care about most of them, and would've preferred the book without them. Bryson frequently points out how limited our knowledge of the body is even today.Bryson writes from an evolutionary perspective, stating that all life is the result of ""a long and interesting accident,"" and that all life forms share a common ancestry back to ""unicellular blobs."" Interestingly, several times he uses words that imply the human body was purposely designed, such as ""creation,"" ""ingenious,"" ""invention,"" and ""designed."" As a Christian, I believe God created life and all life has a purpose, but that our bodies (and all physical reality) have been negatively affected by the Fall (the cause for disease, suffering, and death). As a result, our bodies don't work exactly as God originally designed them. Despite having this foundational difference with Bryson, I enjoyed learning more about the human body.I read this to learn more about how the body works, as well as how to live healthily.NotesResearchers infected a metal door handle with a pretend virus, and in only 4 hrs it had spread through the building, infecting half of employees and showing up on nearly every device.Viruses can stay active on surfaces for up to 3 days.It's estimated that brain can hold over 200 exabytes.Amygdala handles intense and stressful emotions. It gets more active when we sleep, which may explain why dreams are often disturbing.We use entire brain, not only 10%.15-20% of people in permanently vegetative state may be perfectly aware. The only way to definitely know a brain is working is if its owner says it is.We have way more than 5 senses; we have around 33 sense systems (balance, acceleration, position in space, passage of time, appetite, etc.).MSG isn't a toxin; it appears naturally in many foods, including tomatoes. It's been highly scrutinized, yet never found to have deleterious effects when eaten in normal quantities.Smell accounts for 70-90% of flavor.We don't know why blood types exist. One advantage they give is preventing diseases from spreading throughout populations, because different blood types have different resistances.The reason puberty starts earlier now than it used to is almost certainly better nutrition.Sitting for 6+ hrs/day increases mortality risk in men by 20% and women by ~40%. It also doubles risk of Type 2 diabetes and fatal heart attack, and makes cardiovascular disease 2.5x more likely. It doesn't matter how much a person exercises the rest of the time. ""You can't undo sitting.""We don't lose most of our heat through the top of the head. It's only 2% of body's surface area, and often covered with hair.Taking a lot of Vitamin C doesn't help get rid of a cold.There's no clear evidence that avoiding saturated fat reduces risk of heart disease. Fat is not significantly associated with cardiovascular diseases or mortality from them.Average age of first menstruation is 12.5, almost certainly because of improved nutrition.Breast cancer screening and prostate (PSA) screening each save only 1 in 1,000 lives.Even if we had the cure for all cancers, we'd only increase life expectancy by 3.2 yrs. Eliminating all heart disease would add 5.5 yrs. People who die of cancer and heart disease tend to be old already, so something else would kill them.There's no evidence that taking a lot of antioxidants counters effects of aging.Having ""an active and questing mind"" keeps Alzheimer's at bay.Dementias of all types are rarer in people who eat healthy diet, exercise at least moderately, maintain good weight, don't smoke at all, or drink to excess. Healthy living decreases risk by ~60%."
291,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14779621-d-k-powell,5,"You can't really go wrong with Bill Bryson. I've read most of his collection over the last 15 years and yet to find one that I could consider a dud. The closest to that was his 'One Summer 1927' which I would classify as 'extremely interesting', rather than 'absolutely fascinating' as I would any of his other books.'The Body' undeniably fits under this latter category. It is an utterly absorbing book and would be 'un-put-down-able' if it were not for the fact that you sometimes just need to step back and marvel at how stunning the human body really is.This is Bryson's gift. You feel he is as interested in the subject as you are; that he marvels at the very things he writes about; that he is compelled to write a particular book because it will eat him up if he doesn't. He makes you want to go 'wow' with him.He's also, at times, extremely funny, though in books of this sort he tends to be more witty rather belly-achingly hilarious. It helps to keep the pace light. This is a thick book densely packed with facts about the body. In all other circumstances we'd call this a text book and reading such a thing is reserved as punishment for students. With Bryson, it feels nothing like a text book. His storytelling gifts allow him to present remarkably deep information and make it feel like he's spinning a yarn in a pub. You can't help but take in every word.Bryson covers more or less every part of our body and there's no point going into detail about that, revealing interesting bits of information or anything else because, well, how do you decide which to include? From which chapter? Even from which page?! Rather like his 'A Short History of Nearly Everything' and 'At Home' , you can pretty much flick open anywhere and read something which will make you think 'well! - I never knew that before!'. you greatest danger will be boring others with things you've just read. Yes, it's one of those kinds of books.In short, this review is almost superfluous, I find it hard to imagine anyone writing a review trashing this book. I write it simply because I adore the man, loved the book and, occasionally, you come across someone who hasn't read his stuff before. Like a newly-converted evangelical, I'm going to want to make new believers as I go. So there you have it: buy the book, it's brilliant."
292,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26857064-anal-ghosh,4,"As the title indicates, the book is a comprehensive biological account of the masterpiece that is the human body. All that you have learnt in multiples years at school, has been encapsulated in great detail, but that's just one aspect of it. The typical Bill Bryson dry humor is laced to the functions of different body parts & physiological processes, landmark discoveries by scientists, and the evolution of medical science over centuries. The amount of research done is clearly enormous, with Bryson rummaging through archives and traveling continents to meet pioneers in respective fields to present the most authoritative viewpoints. Personally, it felt good to see my hippocampus activating to familiar terms from school time (malleus/incus/stapes, duodenum/jejunum/ileum, etc.) albeit in much more intuitive and fun way :)However, some chapters become a bit too dense with textbook level detailing, and could have been edited better. Another facet that struck me was that the research, stats and evidence presented were very heavy on the first-world countries, but generalized to the entire world. P.S. - The book was published in Oct 2019, and the chapter on diseases ends with - ""...the reason we haven't had another pandemic like the Spanish Flu a century ago isn't because we have been especially vigilant. It's because we have been lucky"". Very poignant given the current times we live in."
293,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109732126-alaris,1,"I haven't read any of Bryson's other books, so I may have made a mistake in choosing this as my first one (and paying $30 for it...sigh).Many people say Bryson's typical humor wasn't present in this book, but I did find his language, opinions, and anecdotes entertaining. In fact, those are the only reasons I kept reading as long as I did.I'm an undergraduate biomedical science major. As I haven't even graduated yet, I usually consider myself to know practically nothing about anything. However, I found that I knew just about every fact that Bryson included in the book. I've taken a lot of biology and chemistry courses and generally like to read and learn about the human body, and I sadly found that Bryson had nothing new to offer.A criticism that I've heard about Bryson is that he simply writes ""collections of facts,"" which I thought sounded interesting, and I thought I would enjoy collections of facts as that's basically what non-fiction books are. However, after reading this book I understand why people say that his books are just collections of facts. I don't know how to explain it, except that I came to realize very early on in the book that it precisely was just a collection of facts put together with some fun pop-philosophy anecdotes, and I didn't enjoy it.I also didn't like how he constantly said, ""...and we don't know why,"" or ""... x and y function together to achieve z, but the purpose is a mystery."" It feels like lazy writing. There are so many interesting tidbits that he could have expounded on. I obviously don't expect him to provide completely correct conclusions of the unknown, but those are great places to outline current or past experiments, or what experts think possible reasons might be. Instead, he just says ""We don't know!"" on almost every page.I gave this book two stars instead of one because I think this book would be really entertaining for people who know nothing about chemistry, biology, or how their body works. There are a lot of good and correct facts in this book, so it would be useful to read for someone who knows nothing about the body. I think I may have really enjoyed this book in my teens, when I was just exploring my love for science and the human body, and someone else in the midst of that discovery may find that this book has a lot of amazing insight for them.However, I gave it only two stars instead of three because while someone who might no nothing about the body learn a lot from this book, I think he could have written it a lot better. Like I said before, it's just a collection of facts. I've read my fair share of pop-science books, and this one falls short in a way that's hard to explain. He will, as is typical, explain a concept and then give it a name.For example, he explains, ""When a human body adapts to altered circumstances, the process is known as phenotypic plasticity."" This indeed is an acceptable definition of phenotypic plasticity, but I honestly didn't see the need for it. He explained that definition in the middle of describing why people have different skin colors, and I felt like he just included that term and definition in the middle of a random paragraph. I feel like if he wanted to help his readers learn what phenotypic plasticity is, he should have led the topic with that term, so that readers can synthesize the meaning from the initial definition provided along with the examples he gives. However, he wrote the book with that definition just in the middle of the page that talks about how we have different skin colors, and it makes me wonder, why did he put that term in the book? It doesn't seem to really have any purpose except for, here is a word that scientists use! I felt that way throughout the entire book. I often wondered, ""what is purpose of the paragraph/sentence?""Not only did I often wonder why he included some random fact or why he placed it where he did, I also felt like a lot of the book was his personal opinions. If you were to remove his own ideas and thoughts from the book, and leave only the facts, it would be a lot shorter. His opinions were definitely interesting and entertaining, but this book is advertised as a factual book about the human body and such, I'm not really interesting in learning a few facts peppered with anecdotes or Bryson's thoughts on how he sees the world. I think most readers familiar with Bryson knew that this was how he writes books and enjoy that aspect of his books (which I respect). I was going in blind and learned that maybe I just don't like Bryson's writing style.For example, I didn't really enjoy reading a general fact about the body (that I thought was mostly common knowledge most of the time) such as, ""Since you started this sentence, your body has made millions of red blood cells"" and then read his personal, flowery thoughts such as, ""We pass our existence within this wobble of flesh and yet take it almost entirely for granted.""He just added so much opinion and too little fact in this book, in my opinion. I don't care about his views on death, or how we spend our life, but I was forced to endure those descriptions if I wanted to learn some facts. He also came across as sort of rude (?) condescending (?) I think he was trying to be funny, but a lot of his ""jokes"" were rude in my opinion. One joke he made was the we all just sit in front of the TV just eating junk food, yet our body takes care of us anyway. I didn't really enjoy that because I don't live that lifestyle and most of my friends and family don't either, so that and many other of his jokes fell flat with me.His book was VERY US centric as well. I didn't think I would mind, because I live in the US, but it took away from the novel. For some reason he feels the need to convert euro to dollars. He found currency amounts in euros from european scientists working in europe, and for some reason he felt the need to convert every dollar amount into US dollars, with a small footnote explaining that he converted from euro in summer of 2013. Does he think I'm too dumb or American to convert from euro?So yeah, I didn't like this book, but I can see how others may enjoy and get a lot out of it despite its shortcomings. "
294,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27873313-jana-ra-a,3,"This is my second book by Bill Bryson. The first one, ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", was a revelation (Goodreads: bit.ly/3b2DK1Z). It provides bountiful information on the third planet from the Sun and our haphazard efforts to classify everything under the sun in neat little taxonomic boxes, so much so that I was almost discouraged before I got used to Bill Bryson's style. ""The Body: A Guide for Occupants"" follows the same pattern. It is almost frightening in terms of its scope and yet, somehow, entertaining enough. I read ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" in January 2017 and, judging by my review, I enjoyed it quite a lot. However, now, three years later, I can't remember a lot about it, except that it was packed with information and that some parts were interesting and some even hair-raising. There are no big ideas or concepts that would linger on or information that I would find compelling enough to remember (e.g., Geoffrey West's ""Scale"" (Goodreads: bit.ly/2rNems0), Robert M. Sapolsky's ""Behave"" (Goodreads: bit.ly/3b7w9z2), and Sarah Blaffer Hrdy's ""Mother Nature"" (Goodreads: bit.ly/2V5lX4F) were magnificent in that sense). The same will be true for ""The Body"", I think. If I were a loquacious extroverted type who chooses to shower people with information at parties, or wherever, I would probably find it a useful source of trivia, but I am not, so other than an entertaining read, I can't really say that ""The Body"" will stay with me for a long time either."
295,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63773-kelly-sedinger,3,"There are times when outside events impact the experience of reading a book, and this is one of them. In gentler times I'd likely give this closer to four stars, if not four outright; I'm generally a big fan of Bill Bryson's writing, and this is perfectly good Bryson. My problem is that...well, look. If you're planning on reading this soon, maybe wait until COVID-19 is solidly in the rear-view mirror. It has nothing specifically to do with COVID-19--the book is several years old--but there are passages that hit harder than they should right now, and Bryson has always had something of a keen interest in the myriad ways that nature can, does, and will kill us, and they are terribly often things that we still know almost nothing about.It's a good book, but I really wish I hadn't read it when I did."
296,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18647109-brett,3,"I was gifted this book as it was listed on the Washington Post’s top books for 2019 list, and thought it would be informative, especially in light of the pandemic (though it makes no reference). It seemed like Bryson spent a lot of time trying to recognize scientists whom he felt were under-acknowledged (a nice gesture). There certainly were a lot of neat facts to share at a dinner party. Overall, it left me: impressed at the miraculous construction that we have as humans, wishing the book was organized in a less breezy anecdotal fashion. It also underlined the importance of staying physically active for a long life!"

Reading this book felt like taking an extensive Biology 101 class, with Bill Bryson going through all the important details of the body, medicine, health, as well as providing context on the history of these different facets. At the same time however, it scared me a lot of times, as it really put into perspective how much of a miracle it is to be alive. "

After reading this book, I have a much deeper understanding of the human body, but he also gave me the space to marvel at its wonders. This is the second book I've read by him, and his writing is delightful. He can make just about anything go from boring textbook facts to incredible and interesting. "

In The Body he tackles every bit of the human body from head to toe and birth to death. With each chapter he drops in charming anecdotes about who discovered this and way it was named this way and which jerk stole someone else’s discovery........you know.....quirky trivia to drop at dinner parties you don’t want to be invited back to. I have just finished listening to this twice......I picked up so much more the second time. I will shelve it for awhile, but plan on listening to this again in the future. I love that Bryson narrates his own books. And I will read anything he writes! Keep em coming!"
