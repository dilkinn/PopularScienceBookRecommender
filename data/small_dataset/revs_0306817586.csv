0,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3209040-courtney-johnston,4,"I loved this book, and it wasn't just that cheeky Brian Cox going on all the time about being covered in tweed and chalkdust (somebody please hand me a fan).'Why does E=mc2' is my fifth book from the Royal Society science book shortlist. If Marcus Chown is magical cellulite cream, this is physics bootcamp - no corners cut, no let's-take-it-easy-today-shall-we. Cox and Forshaw don't just want to explain this equation - they want you to understand it, to understand its power (predictive and descriptive) and understand how, despite being just a diminutive collection of letters and symbols, it underpins nearly a century of contemporary science, and captures some of the most fundamental characteristics of the universe.I feel like the target market for this book - a person who gave up on maths in fourth form, and stumbled through sixth form physics before escaping the next year to classics class, my natural home. Cox and Forshaw are punctilious in their care for the mathematically challenged, to the point where even I wished they'd quit apologising for bringing the maths in to it - because for once, I was following it.I'll need to read the book at least one more time to really get to grips with the subject. But I started to feel the magic tingle of understanding when I read sentences like 'temperature is essentially nothing more than a measure of the average speed of things', or when I looked up from the book and listened to the waves breaking and thought of them as energy, drawn from the moon's gravitational force, dispersing itself through friction and sound (yep - an unusual beach read, I'll concede, but perhaps that suggests the book's measured pace and gentle writing).I felt my usual moment of cosmic connectedness when I read in here about the Super-Kamiokande experiment in Hida, Japan, where neutrinos are 'seen' passing through a cylinder filled with 50,000 tonnes of pure water at the bottom of a mine shaft. Knowing that every second every part of my body, everthing I can see - everything I can't see - is being lanced through by innumerable particles spat out from the sun fills me with a sense of wonder that is the nearest I come to a religious sensation.In addition to their explication of the equation, Cox and Forshaw do a good job of describing the sense of wonder physicists themselves feel, not just at the deep movements of the world, but at the almost magical way that mathematics can be used to describe them. Writing about the master equation that lies at the heart of the Standard Model of Particle Physics and sums up - well, basically everything - they note:It is certainly impressive that we can shoehorn so much physics into one equation. It speaks volumes for Wigner's ""unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics"". Why should the natural world not be far more complex? Why do we have the right to condense so much physics into one equation like that. Why should we not need to catalog everything in huge databases and encyclopedias? Nobody really knows why nature allows itself to be summarized in this way, and it is certainly true that this apparent underlying elegance and simplicity is one of the reasons why many physicists do what they do. While reminding ourselves that nature may not continue to submit itself to this wonderful simplification, we can at least for the moment marvel at the underlying beauty we have discovered.Highly recommended if you have the itch to scratch, but a word of warning - if you're not interested in understanding why the theory of special relativity is so important, then this is not the book for you. The authors are intentionally avoided adding to the (understandable) hero worship that surrounds Einstein, and this is not biography-as-science: this is a maths and physics primer, kindly and interestingly written. "
1,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Cox and Forshaw pack Einstein’s theories of relativity and much more into 250 pages. They state upfront that their book is intended to be challenging. And it is, despite simplistic analogies and explanations tucked in between some pretty dense material. Their underlying premise is “From the simplest of ideas”. Einstein noticed that Maxwell had shown that the speed of light was a constant and from this he constructed the Special Theory of Relativity. Then Einstein thought about the fact that all objects fell at the same rate as Galileo demonstrated. He turned this idea into the General Theory of Relativity. The first half of the book centers around a derivation of E=MC2. Many complex topics are addressed along the way. The authors employ high school algebra and geometry but their manipulations can be intricate. The derivation is not done historically. They use Pythagoras’s theorem to compute the value of time dilation, the difference in time between a stationary observer and one in motion. They note that the observer in motion and stationary observer are interchangeable. Each can perceive the other as the one moving and the one for who time slows. There is no absolute motion as Galileo validated.Time, size and distance are observer dependent but the solution must be invariant, looking the same to all observers. To achieve this space and time must be combined into a single entity with four dimensions. The authors introduce us to Minkowski space which blends space and time. In spacetime Euclidian geometry won’t work. In it Cox and Forshaw use a modified Pythagorean formula that avoids going back in time which would violate the principle of causality, e.g. you can’t kill your parents before you were born. To measure distance in spacetime, the constant c, is introduced to calibrate. It is the universal speed limit and the speed of light. Everything moves through spacetime at this speed. If at rest the movement is all through time. If moving through space then time slows proportionately from the point of view of a stationary observer. Thus both moving and stationary observers agree on movement through the combined spacetime and invariance is achieved. To complete their derivation the authors introduce momentum, the product of mass and velocity. Momentum is a three dimensional vector in our everyday 3D world and four dimensional in the 4D world with the added component of time. The time component of the momentum vector in 4D space is mc, mass times the universal speed limit. Momentum is a conserved quantity as is mass which is equivalent to energy. Mass and energy are different manifestations of a single underlying physical quantity. Energy, mass and momentum form a spacetime object known as the energy-momentum four-vector. From this the authors produce E=MC2. The details are in the book. The foregoing is just intended to give the flavor and flow of the book.The second half of the book is easier to digest as Cox and Forshaw give a broad overview of assorted physics topics. They describe the vast amount of energy in a tiny amount of mass and how that mass is converted, not just in nuclear reactions but in chemical reactions and other everyday phenomena. They venture into particle physics and quantum mechanics describing the emission and absorption of photons from electrons and subsequent changes in their “orbits”. The authors discuss the Higgs boson as the origin of mass, even though this was just a prediction when they wrote the book. They even go back to the Big Bang and the disparity between matter and anti-matter. They then present the equation for the Standard Model, explaining what each term represents. They discuss how the model was put together and the various contributors, Glashow, Weinberg, Salam, Feynman, and Gell-Mann. Finally such a wide ranging review would not be complete without General Relativity to which the last chapter is devoted.I enjoyed this book. However the presentation was a bit disjointed. The authors write for readers at varying levels bouncing back and forth between simple explanations and more difficult detailed ones. They insert apologies to those for who the material might be too complicated and for those who might get bored. While the math itself was not overly difficult, following it in terms of the concepts it represented was more demanding. Still I applaud the effort to put some accessible math behind concepts that are deep and not intuitive. Regardless of level this is a book for a non-scientist reader with a strong interest in the subject. Cox and Forshaw said the book was meant to be a challenge. It was and that made it worthwhile."
2,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3216-danielle,3,"I was expecting, from the first few paragraphs of the book, that I was going to breeze right through this. It didn't really happen that way. I had to take college physics, which included the basics of relativity and quantum theories, so I probably have a bit more knowledge than the average non-physicist. All the same, there were areas of this book that just did not seem to click at all, even after reading paragraphs over and over again. Usually the parts that didn't click were the ""easy"" examples such as how the distance between the moon and the Earth get further apart as the spin of the Earth slows. For anyone that doesn't know about conservation of rotational momentum, this is not an easy thing to figure out. Especially since they don't even mention momentum until 5 chapters later. I think many of the examples were well chosen, and the histories/biographies of the scientists leading up to Einstein were very interesting, but the book lacked a bit of flow and at times seemed to be lacking in proper explanation for the chosen examples until much later on (or sometimes never toward the end). The end of the book definitely seemed a little bit rushed, mainly due to the ""just take our word for it"" approach for what they deemed hard to understand topics. I understand this was attempting to make Einstein's theories accessible to lay people, but I feel it felt a little bit short."
3,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31197106-david,5,"I would love to say that I understood every word and every example of this book, but unfortunately there were many times I felt like the concepts were far too complicated for me. I'm not an unintelligent person but my math and physics knowledge is rather old and rusty.I'll give it another 2 or 3 read through before making any firm judgements on the books. I feel I have learned something from this book...I just don't know what it is I've learned.."
4,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1003783-c,1,"Absolutely senseless. If he ever gets close to talking about the matter at hand, another long passage about a motorcyclist will pop up to ""explain things""Look. The reason you use so many horrible analogies is because you are a horrible explainer! Convey it the first time, don't waddle about."
5,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31021-kristin,4,"On a good day, high school physics class used to leave me feeling kind of (for lack of a better word) high. This book brought back that old, familiar feeling, but in an even better way. In the end, I walked away with a much clearer understanding of Einstein's theories of special and general relativity than I ever achieved slogging through high school physics. (I think our teacher must have been unable to articulate and synthesize the underlying questions that the equations sought to answer.) The authors--very slowly and gently, bringing in maths only when absolutely necessary--walk the reader through the major breakthroughs in science/physics that paved the way for Einstein's e=mc2. Then, they show us how Einstein arrived at e=mc2. This process is broken down into a few key steps: 1)an understanding that the speed of light is constant and therefore space and time must be ""variables""; 2) the mathematical definition of spacetime and the formula needed to relate events within it; and 3) the definition of vectors in spacetime. When vectors are broken down in spacetime, e=mc2 is revealed. It really is as simple as that. With an understanding of these key relationships, the elegance, beauty, and profound repercussions of the equation become crystal clear, even for those of us who never pursued physics beyond high school. I did struggle with a few sections, particularly the bits about electromagnetism, the conservation of rotational momentum, and--I hate to say it--the ""tiny physicists in elevators"" analogy. In spite of my mushy understanding of those parts, I was still able to ""go there"" with the authors in the end. The English major in me was a little miffed when they had a go at Murray Gell-Mann for taking his inspiration for the name ""quark"" from Finnegan's Wake, but otherwise I enjoyed the authors' playful, easygoing tone.

7,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"I’ve got rather mixed feelings about this one. I think writing a simple account of very difficult material is hard to achieve and so every such effort should be praised wherever it is found – but there is a fine line between simple and patronising and I’m not sure this one respects that line all of the time. It is clear these guys know their stuff, but I found it hard to concentrate on parts of this book as they would go into a longish chat about how hard the maths is and so how they have made the maths easier to understand than it should have been and by the time I’d drifted back to paying attention I felt I might have missed something along the way. I read this book, rather than listened to an audio book – where drifting off is more excusable - so I wouldn’t have expected drifting off to have been an issue. It also hasn’t helped that I started this and then spent three weeks in New Zealand with only having 30 pages left to read. I’m telling you all this because my problems with this book may have been related to my drifting off while reading it and with the long break in the middle of reading it.The best of this is how well they explain why it is not possible to travel faster than light – a really quite nice geometrical proof they offer. They also give a really nice discussion of the Higgs field and why finding the Higgs Boson is quite so important and why some physicists might choose to call it the ‘God Particle’. There are also some rather veiled digs made at Creationism and Intelligent Design which might have been better being said out loud rather than the curious sotto voce chosen here.All the same the bit I enjoyed the most was the part of Einstein’s special theory of relativity that has troubled me for years and I’ve never had a satisfactory answer to. This book doesn’t really answer all of my concerns – I’ve a feeling I would need to learn lots of maths and lots of physics to really understand what happens, but this book has been the best explanation I’ve found so far. My problem has been in trying to understand why the twin paradox happens? The twin paradox is where you have a pair of twins and you stick one of them in a spacecraft and her brother gets left here on earth. The twin in the spacecraft zaps off at near light speed for a few years and when she returns her brother has been dead for a million years or so. My problem with this has always been the ‘relativity’ part of it. If she is travelling off at near light speed and he is here drinking coffee at earth speed, why shouldn’t she consider him to be as moving off from her at near light speed and her not really moving at all? The answer, I’ve been told here and also told by Paul Davies in How to Build a Time Machine is that if she was going at near light speed the whole time then there would be no difference in their relative times and no way for either to know who was moving or who was still – but to get to those speeds she would need to accelerate and in coming back she would need to decelerate and it is those changes that make their relativity no longer work and for her to age effectively more slowly than someone left on earth. This was something nearly explained in The Fabric of the Cosmos, I think, although, not as well as is done here. In that book he talks about being in a spinning box in the middle of the universe and seeing the stars turning around you – how do you know it is you that is moving and not the stars. (When you think about it this is an amusing example, given Ptolemy, but his point is that you can tell you are moving and not the sky moving around you.) I think this all relates to Newton’s first law, the law of inertia. If a body is experiencing an accelerating force it therefore experiences the universe differently from one that is experiencing a lesser force. But I don’t think anyone ever really has explained to me why this might be the case. I might have missed it here, though, perhaps they did explain it. If they did I still don’t really get it. All of this stuff makes my head spin and so no matter how simply people seem to be able to write about it I still feel like I’m caught in some twisted logic I can’t quite follow. Why should accelerating make time slow down?All the same, the authors have gone out of their way to make this book as clear as they can – if I still don’t quite follow it is probably my own fault."
8,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"For those trying to nudge themselves into Einstein's world a little more, this book's title has great appeal. At some very general level, the equivalence of energy and mass can be understood, but the role of light (""c"") and light squared remains a challenge. The authors do a good job of describing how mass converts to energy (heat/photons/light carry away mass; when wood burns, energy is released and mass is reduced). In the reverse, energy adds to mass. When energy (heat) is added to mass, mass increases because energy itself has mass. At the heart of the understanding of reality, the authors make it clear that mass and energy are the same thing. They are not ""disconnected entitites."" Matter is, in short, ""capable of popping into and out of existence"" but (presumably) continues to exist as energy. This all prompts one to wonder what underlies and connects these two disconnected entities and why does conversion from one to the other occur. Is the ""pull - push"" phenomena related in the sense that mass pulls energy into itself and energy seeks to escape mass? Is concentrated energy in mass gravity? Is energy escaping mass ""liberation""? [The authors make a few references to ""liberated energy""]). If, as the authors note, the sun loses 4 million tons of mass every second in the form of radiated energy, does this mean that the earth is gaining some mass from that energy? While the authors are quite lucid here and there, their discussion of the role of light in Einstein's equation was frustratingly opaque. Intriguingly, they seem to suggest that the speed of light is not the central factor. It is, rather, a way to measure distance in a time direction, but it is not clear how time (spacetime) relates to the discussion that energy and matter are equivalent. The authors are clear that time and space are one thing, and that light years (a unit of time) can be used to measure distance. The authors seem to say that ""c"" is relevant because particles of light are massless. It's almost as if they are saying that at the speed of light there's no mass but only pure energy (but if this is so, how do photons/energy add to mass; if mass is shedded by radiated light, doesn't mass go with that light in some way?). Elsewhere, the authors say that spacetime is like ""cosmic maple syrup"" with some mass (Higgs field?). When that happens, does light pick up mass? The authors say other things about light that are also unlcear: that there's a cosmic speed limit and that there is such a thing as ""allocated speed"" and a cosmic ""speed quota,"" and that everything hurtles through spacetime at the same speed. All of this is somehow related to the ""c"" in the Einstein equation. At this point, it's an achievement for the lay reader to simply identify what he or she does not understand. This is all challenging stuff. Perhaps the real problem is the inability to transfer our earth-bound perspective as that has evolved to be into these cosmic realms that operate on such vastly different scales. "
9,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1652517-merilee,5,"Superb review of latest in particle physics and spacetime. Cox explains things as clearly as possible, but I believe I will need to reread this before I could begin to explain any of it to anyone else.

10,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,4,"Who was this Adventure in Space-Time Written For?The challenge of writing any popular science book is that the audience has different levels of knowledge. The author needs to choose the appropriate level of knowledge to aim the writing at. It follows that the reader’s appreciation of the book depends on what they know. To understand my perspective, you should know my background:A long time ago I completed first year university science before switching into computers. I have since read a number of popular science books on relativity and quantum mechanics. I am presently taking on-line university physics courses to get a deeper understanding. I have thus seen many of the ideas in this book before, and understand the mathematics.The book begins with the claim, “We do not assume any prior scientific knowledge.” While the language is often simplistic, and they even explain the meaning of a divide sign, I think this is a compromise that does not really work. Frequently they give a hokey apology (I got very tired of chalk dust) and then present complex mathematics in prose. Important steps are often skipped. I can tell you that I had to read much of this book several times, and do the math on paper to try to understand it.Electricity and Magnetism Dance at the Speed of LightEinstein’s insight into the special role of the speed of light derives from Maxwell’s equations of electricity and magnetism. Following Einstein, the authors devote a chapter to this subject. This is fine with me, because I am taking my electricity course for precisely this reason. Briefly, experiments in the 19th century showed that a moving magnetic field generates electric current, and an electric current generates a magnetic field. These mutually reinforcing forces create an energy wave, which can be described by a wave equation. This equation gives us the speed at which the wave must travel, which turns out to be the same as the speed of light. Thus light is just another type of electromagnetic wave.Einstein assumed all movement is relative, and that the laws of physics are always the same no matter what is perceived to be doing the moving. Maxwell’s equations give us the speed of light without mentioning the motion of the source or the observer. His genius was to take this result literally, and conclude that the speed of light must always be constant no matter how it is measured.The book claims (on page 27) the speed of light is determined by the ratio of the strengths of the electric and magnetic fields. But peeking into the actual wave equation, I see that c = 1 / √(ε*μ), where ε and μ are the electrical “permittivity” and magnetic “permeability” constants respectively. That looks like a product to me, which makes intuitive sense if they are reinforcing each other. But this stuff is over my head, so did they oversimplify, or do I have it wrong?Riding the Relativity Railroad with PythagorasNow we get to the classic thought experiment of measuring the relative passage of time on a train from the perspective of an observer on the platform. The passenger measures time by shining a light from one position to another one meter above it. The observer on the platform sees the light taking a longer path because the light pulse is moving along with the train. As the speed of light is constant, the passenger’s clock must therefore appear to be running slower. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the rate at which time appears to slow down, known as time dilation. While it is cool that such basic math can be used to derive relativity, for some reason the author chooses not to call this by its usual name of Lorentz factor.This stuff seems to make sense when I read it, then I wake up in the middle of the night and it does not make sense any more. For example, I wondered if the above result is only true at the exact moment when the train passes the observer. No, it turns out that time dilation does not depend on the direction of motion. This is still not obvious to me, and I could have used an explanation in the book.I find it easy to get confused about which clock is running slower. I have to remind myself of (what I call) the Spoiled Princess Principle: You are the center of the universe. You do not move, everything else moves relative to you. Your clock always runs at the same rate. It is everybody else’s clock that is different.Stretching time does not seem as strange as the fact that space contracts in front of you when you are moving. The example he gives is that if we go fast enough, we can get to the Andromeda galaxy, which is three million light years away, in fifty years of our time. Are we going faster than light? No, my spoiled princess, remember that is only how it appears to you. How it looks to the people who sent you is coming up next.According to the equation, light, which goes the speed of light, takes no time at all to reach its destination. I don’t know why they don’t talk more about this. It suggests that a photon traveling between you and Andromeda is everywhere on its path simultaneously. Does this not mess with causality? Is there any connection with wave nature of particles in quantum mechanics?The Imaginary Single Speed in Minkowski Space-timeI was aware that travelling in space means that you also travel in time, and nothing can go faster than light. But the introduction of Minkowski space-time was a revelation. It begins with the observation we just made that distance in space changes depending on the relative motion of the observer. We can add a fourth dimension in time such that some quantity (distance “s”) is invariant no matter what speed the observer is moving. This new dimension is multiplied by the speed of light (c*t), so it becomes expressed in the same distance units as the other dimensions. But if we assume this is a Euclidean space, so that the Pythagorean triangle relationship s^2 = x^2 + (c*t)^2holds, we can get events that finish before they start. This violates causality, which means this model does not work. He then tells us “there is no other option” than to assume thats^2 = x^2 - (c*t)^2Not true, it is only one of many possibilities. But, of course, he knows the answer in advance. He then constructs a hyperbolic curve to demonstrate this relationship. It solves the causality problem, but visually the arithmetic is clearly false.I had to hunt around to discover that Minkowski space-time uses an (unfortunately so-called) “imaginary” time dimension, meaning a multiple of the square root of -1. Squaring it gives a negative number, hence the minus sign. Now it makes mathematical sense, but why did he not explain this? I still do not understand why, given that it is the time dimension that is “imaginary”, he subtracting the space dimension instead.Anyway, the amazing result is that the speed of light is not just a limit, it is the only possible speed! When we think we are standing still, we are zooming through the time dimension at the speed of light. When we move in space we have to slow down our movement through time to compensate.The Mystery of the Time Travelling TwinsI think the twin paradox is the key mystery in special relativity. One twin takes a round trip to Andromeda on a fast spaceship while his sister remains behind on Earth. When the travelling twin returns, he thinks it took one hundred years, but the Earth, including his sister, is now six million years older. The apparent speed-up in space is compensated by a vast increase in elapsed time, at least from someone’s point of view.After all the work we have done, I thought I was finally going to understand it. But at the end we are told the whole calculation fails because it does not take into account the acceleration required to turn the spaceship around. How can he do this to me?Lets jump ahead to the final chapter on General Relativity. We learn that acceleration and gravitational attraction are equivalent. We also learn that clocks run faster in weaker gravitational fields. This must mean that clocks run slower under higher acceleration. Is this why the travelling twin’s clock slowed down while he was turning around? Then why did he not make the connection?Well, lets go ask Mr. Internet. I’m back! Yikes, you would think this would have been figured out by now, but apparently not. The most common view is that, contrary to this book, the acceleration is irrelevant. Apparently the special relativity formula is correct, and there are ways to explain it with simple math. It would have been nice if he did this for us. So then, why do the effects of General Relativity make no additional difference? Ah, forget it, nobody answers my dumb questions.So wow, we can go anywhere in space as quickly as we want, and travel far into the future! The problem is that we are not photons – we have mass. Why does he not mention that it takes an ever increasing amount of energy to accelerate mass? Near the speed of light the energy required becomes infinite. I think of it as all the energy is going into moving in time rather than space, but I can’t connect this thought to what I learned about Minkowski space-time. Anyway, don’t expect to book your sci-fi trip anytime soon. Lose some weight first (like all of it).The Energy of Momentum in Space-TimeTo introduce the concept of momentum, we get a crash course on vectors, mass, Newton’s second law, and energy. Then we realize that a momentum vector in space does not work in relativity, so we must find an equivalent in space-time. The now familiar distance vector in space-time is transformed into a momentum vector, which is mass times velocity. To get there, we multiply by mass and by the velocity of light, then divide out the distance. Figuring this out from the text took a lot of work on my part. By trying to simplify, he actually made it a lot more difficult than it needed to be. In the end, we get of the standard momentum component (mass * velocity) in the space direction, and mass times the speed of light (m*c) in the time direction, both multiplied by the Lorentz factor (γ). Because the total momentum must be conserved, the time direction (γ*m*c) must also be conserved. Therefore γ*m*c^2 is also conserved. Now he makes an approximation for the Lorentz factor, which is reasonably accurate at low speeds. The result is:m*c^2 + (1/2)*m*v^2This is interpreted as the sum of the energy contained in the mass (m*c^2) plus its kinetic energy. At zero velocity, we still have energy in the mass. We have just achieved the stated goal of the book. But what happens if we don’t cheat on the math? I can’t help thinking there is an important consequence at high speeds, such as what happens when you accelerate mass?A Good Learning Experience with Room for ImprovementAfter proving that E = m*c^2 he cannot resist going on to presenting the Entire Standard model, with its master equation that shows how every particle reacts with every other particle. So far I have been feeling sorry for the scientifically challenged trying to read this book, but now I experienced being one of them. The verbal description made sense, but without knowing what the symbols or operators mean, constantly referring back to the equation just got in the way. I think this book could have been better if they accepted they are writing for two different levels of knowledge. The equations could then be presented properly in a text box, accompanied by a text description of what they mean, followed by a philosophical summary for the non-mathematical reader. Better still, they could provide supplementary material on the web to answer my questions. I suppose this review is really a long confession of ignorance. I learned a lot from this book, and more from the research to make sense of it. While I still don’t completely get it, this journey into the mystery of space and time was well worth it."
11,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10486977-themadhatter,4,"Actual Rating: 3.5 Stars.The writing of science books is a difficult task. On one hand, you have a ready market of science nerds that will instantly pick up your book (an easy sale), but they want hard facts, maths and challenging concepts. On the other hand you have a large mass market audience wanting desperately to learn more about science but if you dive in with the hard facts, maths and challenging concepts you are (possibly) going to lose some of them along the way and turn them off science. So what do you do?Brian Cox has made a living on bring science to the masses and having heard him speak a few times now when he has been in Australia it is always such a delight to see the diverse crowds that rock up to see him talk. If any-one was able to please both groups - I would put money on it being him.While I found this book to be a really solid read (and will definitely read it a second time), I unfortunately think the audience of the book is unclear. The book starts out quite gently with some very easy to get your head around concepts about space and time, the speed of light and special theory. I was speeding through these chapters feeling pretty confident with everything I was reading and coming up with a few good examples to incorporate into my work. Then there is a sudden switch to spacetime momentum vectors that had me trying to recall study from years ago and wishing desperately that I had a pen and paper (note: next time bring pen and paper). So just when you go ""yes...we are ramping this up a little"" it then switches to quite inane topics again (let me explain scientific notation to you....hmmm...if I got through spacetime diagrams and spacetime momentum vectors I think I got scientific notation and why scientists use such big numbers). The jumping back and forth between baby steps and elephant steps just made me feel a little confused (and dizzy). I also wonder if the authors solo wrote specific chapters as the voice (way of explaining) did seem to change throughout and that also mixed up my rhythm with the book a little (and added to the dizzy). Overall, I think the authors did an admirable job on a difficult topic/market. So hats off to them both. So if you are a hard-core physics geek, maybe skip the book and grab a textbook. If you are totally new to this field ...jump in but be prepared for a shaky journey. If you are in the middle, bring pen and paper and enjoy the bumps.Reading ChallengeAussie Reader's 2020 April Opposites Challenge: Read a book of fiction and a book of non-fiction"
12,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8413178-liam,4,"2020 TBR Challenge: Read a book you don't remember why you added or boughtI really enjoy Brian Cox, I watched his series Wonders of Life ages ago, and I've always liked seeing him on various panel shows etc. He is incredibly intelligent (to state the obvious), but gets across ideas in an accessible and easily understood way, and has a great sense of humour to boot.This all extends to Why Does E=mc²? - I still don't think I fully grasp any of the concepts explored in it, I have never had a brain that is wired in the right way to 'get' physics intuitively like some people I know, but this book certainly got me the closest, and inspired me to do some research off my own back to see if I can at least say I understand something.Why Does E=mc²? regularly made me laugh out loud with some of its analogies and turns of phrase, which are a fantastic and welcome break after several pages of frowning, squinting at the page, and grappling to understand relativity.Probably a book I'll read again to try to cement my understandings. Very much enjoyed it."

A bit difficult to follow at times and I still have a few technical questions that I'll need to look-up myself, but I still learned a lot! While the progress we've made is astounding, I can't help but feel a bit of despair at the thought of how this progress was achieved sometimes (see the Minkowski spacetime ""why not try Pythagora's theorem with a minus sign???"") and all the ""forced"" assumptions we've made when shaping our theories (e.g. the demands of causality when shaping up the spacetime ""rules"")Definitely recommend it!

But this isn’t for you - it’s for all people that are curious about Einstein and our universe, can follow a logical discussion, but are not technical enough to follow a more detailed explanation. Not that this isn’t detailed, but Cox and Forshaw go to great lengths to hold your hand along the way and explain it all, using analogies and not a lot of maths to make their point.And it works. You might feel a bit lost at times, but things will fall into place. And hopefully you will also be able to appreciate the beauty of Einstein’s ideas."
17,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5640245-brigitta,0,"(I never say this, but thank goodness I read this book in Hungarian. It was difficult enough without having to try and decipher what are the Hungarian equivalents of all the terms.)I have been meaning to read this book every since it came out in Hungarian, but now it seemed like just the light summer read I needed… which, of course, it isn’t, but I’m fairly certain that I’d find some parts of it very complicated even in winter, so what the hell. My main motivation to read this book was Brian Cox himself (I know, I’m that shallow), because I’ve been fascinated with his lectures and telly programmes, and since I had my fair share of brilliant and brilliantly mediocre science teachers in my time, I had to realize how important presentation actually is. For a long time I considered myself devoid of any kind of scientific interest, but then I had to realize that everything is interesting if explained properly – and I think this book is further proof of my theory.Interesting, however, doesn’t necessarily mean easily accessible. The authors certainly try and explain even simple concepts, e. g. what exponentiation means, but let’s be real, if someone meets exponentiation here for the first time, best of luck with the rest. In any case, the authors make it clear that if you don’t want to bother with the maths, you can skip the hardcore parts and still enjoy the rest – which is true, but sometimes I felt my brain bent in ways it doesn’t usually bend, but it was a nice experience, I missed it. I have noticed that several readers criticized this book for either talking down to the audience or for being to complicated, but once again, let’s be real, this is what happens when you try to talk to a wide range of people with heterogeneous backgrounds. You can’t please everyone, but I think the authors handled these challenged as well as they could be handled.I have to admit that a significant part of this book went over my head, despite all the best efforts of Messrs. Cox and Forshaw, but I don’t think that’s a problem. It challenged my views, I have learnt a lot and it definitely raised my interest and inspired me to learn more, so I got everything out of this book that I’d hoped for."

I bought this as further reading on an iTunes U course I'm doing, thinking that it would offer further insight. The first half of the book is so patronising that I could barely bring myself to claw through it (but unfortunately I have a Magnus Magnusson approach to reading). This merely added to the annoying impression that the authors are explaining all the n a s t y, d i f f i c u l t s c i e n c e y - w i e n c e y v e r y s l o w l y t o y o u. B e c a u s e y o u ' r e s t u p i d. The over-use of analogies in an attempt to ""simplify"" the mathematics, theories, discoveries etc, does nothing but confuse you, and I would recommend, if you do decide to read this book, that you skip anything referring to motorbike riders, billiard balls, cannon balls, or anything that starts to look like an apology for teaching you something in a book about science, that you have chosen to read. On the upside however, once you reach the apex so to speak, and your tiny, limited little brain has been gently guided through all the scary bits that lead to Einstein's equation, then things get kind of interesting, and much less patronising. Chapters 6 and 7 were much more enjoyable and far easier to understand once the authors felt they could trust you not to dissolve into a quivering wreck of unteachable mush.So all in all, a bit of a disappointment, but there are nuggets of lovely knowledge in this book which I'm glad I've discovered. Now on to my next challenge!"
19,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7138526-john,2,"Why is E=mc^2? It was an enormous ask, and Cox and Forshaw were never going to deliver.It is easy reading, but unless you understand maths you won't get it at all.When I read on page 77 ""although we did not prove (the maths)"" I began to feel cheated, and then they tried to explain in several thousand words space-time vectors, which could have been done in two lines of maths, then I thought to myself it would have been much easier if they had used the maths throughout, and dispensed with all those words and all that repetition.It is not a bad read, but I wouldn't want to read it twice."

21,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34019657-jorge,4,"""In following the book up to this point, you may well be juggling a lot of mental balls as you read this sentence"". Cox and Forshaw say this at some point halfway through the book, but it might as well be applied to my feelings when finishing it. I don't really know how to criticize, comment or even rate it (for the most of the reading I was pretty sure I would leave no rating at all). I started in August, read a couple of chapters and loved it; never had I understood relativity and physics so well since I was reading Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"". Then, everything went worse.Maybe it was the fact that I left the book on the shelves for a couple of months, maybe it was that I was reading it in English language, maybe I didn't read it thoroughly enough, or maybe, and most probably, I'm just stupid, but I struggled to understand most of the chapters that followed, regarding spacetime, Einstein equations, the fabric of reality and so on. Some things I did not get a single word; some others, I understood them (kind of) but was unable to explain the concept to others, usually a good way to know if you really understand something. From particle physics onwards the reading was much more enjoyable, and I wasn't forcing myself to finish the book anymore, 'cause I was back to understanding it, but still... My brain was at the point of melting form a good deal of pages.So, I just don't know. 4/5 because Cox and Forshaw are good writters and explainers, and they know how to make the text appealing to the reader, keeping mathematical complexities at a minimum; still, loses one star because their intention was for non-scientists readers to get a good grasp of Einstein's theory and its importance and, at least in my case, they only achieved that to a very limited extent."
22,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7552897-sebastian,4,"So, first of all, this is a lovely little introduction to relativity, both special and general, produced with just the right amount of math to make all the concepts clear without too many confounding and always unhelpful analogies (though at times it did feel a bit patronizing – they spend quite a while explaining, for example, the concept of a variable that, if you don’t already have in your toolbox, pretty likely means you will not be able to follow any of the math anyway).Now, how this was supposed to work as an audiobook is just beyond me. Had I not already gone through the math several times previously, and had I not entered this book with a pretty solid idea of all the stuff they were about to cover, I would have been hopelessly confounded by the “explanations”. Don’t get me wrong, some of the descriptions, histories and analogies are spot on and convey quite beautifully the mind-bending ideas of relativity. However, to kick things off and at certain crucial points, the authors use actual math, and while (I assume) that can be relatively easily followed on paper/screen with anyone capable of doing basic algebra, it was damn near impossible to follow in audio format after a while, especially when they are doing a complex bit of formula juggling and then reference a variable that they derived and set aside a couple of minutes earlier. Maybe there are people whose brains are capable of storing, handling, and juggling ephemeral audio data like that, but mine sure as hell isn’t.That feeling of a lack of consideration for the format was further compounded by the fact that the audiobook has an index, where the narrator “helpfully” spends about an hour reading off an enormous list of words with corresponding page (?) numbers."
23,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63319555-rachel-welton,4,"There are some books that are enhanced by metamorphosis into audiobook, and others that need to remain firmly in the realm of the written word. Jeff Forshaw manfully reads out the equations but I couldn't manage to conjure them up in my mind's eye. The numerous analogies were enlightening, and I certainly feel I have learned things that I didn't know before, however often there was a big, unexplained leap from analogy to completion, possibly at the speed of light, or failing that at the square root of c^2-v^2 which tends to 1 if you get near a neutron star.... where was I? Oh, yes, I need to go through it a couple more times before I will have absorbed it all."

30,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6098128-huw-evans,5,"Brain (sic) Cox is one of the current pin-up boys of science; ex pop musician, he is now a physicist working at the LHC in Switzerland when he isn't gadding about the world for his latest TV series or recording The Infinite Monkey Cage for BBC Radio 4 (listen if you get the chance - it is brilliant). There are many explanatory books about the theories of Relativity, most of which are so up there own backsides that they are unreadable unless you have a degree in theoretical physics. Cox and Forshaw conquer by stooping low enough to make the subject intriguing, interesting and intelligible.  Of all the equations known to man Einstein's final statement of the Special Theory of Relativity is probably the one that is best known to educated man. Ee equals emm see squared (and I apologise for altering the title, I can't get my computer to generate a squared symbol) generated a wholly different view of the universe to the one that had held sway since the time of Isaac Newton. The problem was that, as experimental physics became more precise, nice and accurate, the answers generated by Newtonian physics were not supported. The difference may have been in terms of more decimal places than Newton ever envisaged but there was a level of inconsistency that could not be ignored. As Richard Feynman said (paraphrased), ""If the evidence doesn't fit the theory is wrong"".The other equation most people remember is ascribed to Pythagoras; the square of the hypotenuse in a right angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. From this, via Newtonian laws of motion and electromagnetism Cox and Forshaw take us on a journey to explain how Einstein came to his conclusions and what their impact is on our understanding of the universe and (almost) everything within it. The steps taken are gentle, well explained and the mathematics is not particularly taxing. Physics, theoretical and experimental, has evolved over time as our abilities to investigate have improved; it is the downside to being a particularly clever monkey. Asking questions about how things work has been our curse, the ability to find some answers our blessing. We are now at the stage where we can force streams of particle to accelerate to near light speed, smash them together and analyse the results to see whether they match what has been predicted.This book is as much about the history of human thought and discovery as it is about mathematics. It is also about numbers that are so small or so large that they are mind boggling. It introduces that mathematics of spacetime in a way that arouses curiousity, rather than fear. Moreover it is a very honest book; it does not claim that Einstein's theories explain everything but that it produces a picture that is more accurate than the previous theories. Until the next one."
31,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"This is a great introduction to understanding how energy has been converted to mass and back into energy, creating every bit of known matter. The first part of the book introduces the reader to the concept of e=mc2, in very simple and easy to understand terms. In the second part of the book, the authors breakdown the equation to teach any curious learner the math behind the equation. Even if you are not interested in breaking down the math, I would still highly recommend this book if you are curious about special or general relativity.I found the 3rd part of the book to be the most enjoyable. The authors give a fantastic and extremely easy to understand survey of the various types of stars in the universe. Stars are one of my favorite things to read about, and I have read my share of books about them. I would definitely say these authors excelled at explaining the relationship between mass and type of star as well as the forces at work to keep stars active. There is a beautiful dance that exists between the inward pull of gravity and the outward push of fusion and electron repulsion. The way the authors organized this discussion was so simple and beautiful. I think anyone interested in the dynamics of stars would love this book. They did not mention my favorite star, the brown dwarf. That was a tiny bit disappointing.The final part of the book gave an extremely brief summary of the standard model as well as a summary of some of the particles accelerators and wave detectors. The authors chose not to bog the reader down with the various particles of the standard model. They were more interested in trying to help the reader understand how these particles are at work in e = mc2. I would definitely recommend this book for someone who is looking for an introduction or a refresher. "
32,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7833883-si,5,"I've been a fan of Brian Cox for years. His infectious enthusiasm, his ability to boil down complex concepts for an average dude without a physics degree, and his clear passion for what he does, make him compelling viewing.So after seeing him and Jeff Forshaw lecture on the subject of this book, I decided to get a bit more in depth and check out the book.It’s excellent. The guys are able to help me to understand and visualise relativity. This is easier said than done with such a counter-intuitive topic, and they do it with style.They look at space, time, spacetime, relativity and mass. They bring in a bit of chemistry making things clear that I didn’t get at school.The last book I read on this topic was Hawking’s Brief History which was rubbish. Badly written and impenetrable.I came from this book with a much clearer understanding of E=mc^2, particle physics and where we’re going with the latest research.I’ll read it again for sure. "
33,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1937339-s-p,2,"From the man that bought us the 1997 New Labour election theme tune, comes a book about the origins and meaning of Einstien's E-Mc2.The main problem with the book is there is far too much going on about 'deeper understanding' and time spent telling us how things are being explained to us poor intellectually subnormal non physicists in v e r y s i m p l e t e r m s so we can keep up. If you can get over the condescending tone, and the jumbled narrative (too many tangents), the information is easy to comprehend - in that the book does what it reputes to do, explains why E-mc2 in language that make sense. It could, with a bit of revising, drop about 100 pages - maybe use the space to move into more of the quantum stuff, or even allow more space for more organised explanations of background information. "
34,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1795309-robb,3,"I felt like this book went back and forth between being written in real simple terms to being hard to follow mathematics written in narrative form. It went back and forth between being exciting to being boring in its presentation of equations, and that's coming from a math major who enjoyed every math class I had in school. Some of the concepts in the book, which are considered by some to be basic and foundational to modern physics, are truly fascinating to ponder. I love stretching my brain thinking of the implications of how much energy is all around us, and what it would be like to travel close to the speed of light. So I would say I really enjoyed about half the book, and the other half was either hard to follow or boring. "
35,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5256904-nicol,3,"This was really well written for the lay person, covering the early history of physics and how we came to these equations and what we use them for...but I had to renew the book at the library for another month because one isn't enough to fully absorb all the information this book covers. I'm sure it's a breeze for an MIT student, but since it was written for my level of science (meaning zero) I need more time to wrap my brain around these concepts that are completely new to me (because my high school physics teacher lost me from day one and that was a long time ago). But with my hobby being radio astronomy, I really want to understand what's behind the surface of our Universe and how the heck it works. Brian Cox is a stellar teacher."
36,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5848237-j-f-lawrence,5,"I had never been able to grasp fully the 'basic' explanations of relativity before I read this excellent book. Ok, Iwas fine with the concept of space not being absolute, but that was about it. I certainly had no real idea why time should pass at different speeds according to one's frame of reference or why spacetime makes sense of things. And as for why energy should be equivalent to mass x the speed of light and why this matters for causality, well forget it.But thanks to 'Why Does E=mc2 and Why Does It Matter?' I can honestly say that the Einsteinian account of the universe makes complete sense. I feel considerably smarter after having read it, and no longer will physics graduates kick sand in my face."
37,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3172434-joanna,5,"I loved this book - it actually takes you through the processes of deriving e=mc2 and provides the necessary context on people and theory to understand the meaning behind what this equation means. Good detail. Good big picture. Also sheds some light on the experiments the lovely people at CERN are doing. I had to re-read several sections (some many times) to really get it but it was well worth it. The math gets pretty deep towards the middle (you can skip it, but it's there if you're inclined to follow) and I remember sitting at the Munich airport waiting for my flight home from a snowboarding trip working out the equations by hand on the back of a napkin stained by apple strudel trying to find my way to e=mc2...and I did! Awesome light bulb moment."

It makes it so much easier to understand if you have a passing knowledge of Pythagoras. Loved the explanations of how the counter-intuitive properties of the universe were derived from simple rules. Lots of 'ah-ha!' moments for me, especially when talking about ""everything travels at the speed of light"", and ""distances are smaller at faster speeds"".A really enlightening book, although I was only just hanging onto the maths at the end when pulling apart the Standard Model equation."
39,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15656262-john-rauch,4,"The information in this book was incredible. The delivery sometimes made it more difficult than necessary. I don't believe that every book should have to be ""beginner"" level, but if you're going to claim that anyone can read it, maybe spend a little extra time working out some good analogies to explain simple concepts or give explanations that don't always require advanced math to grasp. I think I understood the majority of the book, but there were some sections I had to read multiple times to understand, then once I did, could easily think of better ways to explain it myself. Aside from that, I think this is a great read for someone really interested in physics."

I couldn't believe they pulled off a non mathematical treatment of 4-vectors (although it may not have been worth it for the layperson). Some of the later chapters were a bid hurried, but their generalization of the speed of light to the speed of massless particles and their treatment of energy mass equivalence in everyday life was fantastic!"

It does a fantastic job of explaining how things that seem to contradict our own good senses work and why. Time is relative. What does that really mean? How does it impact our experience of the universe and technologies? Answers in here. Space and time are malleable and subjective. Real objects do shrink when they move. To use an example from the book, if you were trying to fit a 4m car into a 3.9m garage, you could if the car was moving at 22 percent of the speed of light. Before it bursts through the back wall. But you get the point. The book then goes on to explain spacetime- a way of understanding the universe that's- well universal. Accurate regardless of the observation point in space. They derive this concept and again, it's fascinating.But ultimately, while it describes the brilliance and experimental validation of Einstein's relativity, he also leaves you excited for the next step- at the precipice of a totally new understanding of the universe. He talks about quantum theory and that it can't be meshed with relativity... and reminds us that as soon as something better comes along, relativity may be revised or replaced. But that doesn't make it any less special and in fact, that's the exciting thing about science! Relativity replaced Newton's understanding of gravity and it will continue to evolve as we discover new things. Newton's understanding, which we know now to be more an approximation, helped us engineer bridges and skyscrapers. Einstein's gave us the GPS satellite system. What will we get with the next great theory?That being said, this book was published in 2009. So much has happened since. I actually got to look up the results of one of the ongoing experiments he described and saw the results, which was kind of awesome. Ultimately, this book peaked my interest and had me looking for more. And gave me the framework to understand the importance of experiments taking place right now. A few good quotes:""Einstein was undoubtedly one of the great practitioners of the art of science, but as we have emphasized throughout this book, he was led to his radical revision of space and time by the curiosity and skill of many. he was not a freak of nature and his intellect was not supernatural. He was simply doing what great scientists do: He took simple things seriously and followed through the consequences logically.""""'From the simplest of ideas'... if there were ever to be an epitaph written for humanity's greatest scientific achievements, it might begin with these five words. Taking delight in observing and considering the smallest and seemingly most insignificant details of nature has led time and again to the most majestic of conclusions.""""Our musings on the nature of space and time have led us to understand that the earth is doing nothing more than falling in a straight line around the sun. It's just that the straight line is in a curved spacetime, which manifests itself as a (nearly) circular orbit in space."""
55,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62747656-shreyansh-jain,4,"Picked this with up some apprehension after the semi-disappointment that ""Quantum universe"" by the same authors was, but happy to conclude that this book was much better.The explanations for constancy of speed of light, Minkowski ST, invariant distances and momentum were pretty good. The English explanation of standard model and especially the Higgs mechanism was quite good. There are many details that were fudged over or poorly explained (the super condensed write up on white dwarfs - neutron stars - black holes, or how exactly does general relativity not enmesh with standard model, or the lack of dark matter from the book altogether). But I guess that is to be expected when you are looking for a ""condensed"" course on relativity AND quantum electrodynamics from an author who insists upon the assumption that even the slightest amount of math would turn his readers away.A good effort overall but wanted a bit more. I would recommend this to high school or freshmen nerds to spark their interst in theoritical physics and to develop a real appreciation for the genius of Maxwell and Einstein. There arent many authors in this niche so your options are somewhat limited if you want to learn about this stuff when not preparing for a graded exam."
56,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66196977-benj,3,"Quite an enthralling ride, but I got pretty lost about half-way through. I suspect that the problem is that the authors know their subject so well, they can't always see when they have to slow down to allow the layman time to catch up.I also found a couple of their mathematical processes a bit dubious. Trying to calculate an absolute space/time distance s, and broadly based on Pythagoras, they postulate that s2 is equal to ct2 + x2 (sorry, I can't work out how to make the 2 a superscript to denote squared). When that is shown to be false, they then say that the only alternative is s2 = ct2 - x2, which is so obviously bad logic that they have to include an appendix to justify it. I don't doubt that they're right, but their explanation was unconvincing to me.In another case, they're happily working through some equations, and then decide to change one of them to a completely different one. They prove arithmetically that these two equations are so nearly the same that it doesn't matter, but I would have got my knuckles severely rapped if I'd tried anything like that in A-level maths. As this equation is the one that eventually leads to E=MC2, I felt a little bit cheated."
57,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28920845-josefine,4,"Such an interesting book for all of us who want to understand, but maybe don't want to spend many years studying theoretic physics at Oxford (though that does sound pretty cool).Let me relieve you: No, I must certainly did not understand everything in this book. If we are being fair, I actually think I only fully understood to about chapter 5. After that things went fuzzy. However, I am walking away with this book feeling just slightly smarter, and with a more abstract idea of the universe, which is what really matters.What this book needs, is to be accompanied by some youtube videos. They do, for the most part, a great job of explaining the thought experiments, but I feel like it could have benefited from some visual aid. Preferably a bit slower.That said, with some videos, a future reread, and maybe a possible chat with an expert in the field, I feel as though I should be able to scrape together the parts I missed out on.Can recommend to everyone who is curious about the universe we live in. Nothing is absolute, everything is relative!"
58,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14106330-amy-suzanna,3,"With this book it appears it was a case of third time lucky. I'm fairly certain that I've only made two previous attempts to read Why Does E=mc²? before, but it might have been more. About third of the way through, I remembered why I'd always given up - the maths may be fairly tricky, but the mildly patronising asides about how difficult it is and the lengthy (and in my view oversimplified) analogies annoyed me. Now a decade old, the science in this book is still important and often misunderstood. Explaining the concept of spacetime, quantum physics and how the standard model we currently use is not  quite  right, can seem impossible, particularly if your audience is not scientifically minded and/or has very little knowledge of maths. My problems with the writing style are merely personal taste, an annoyance tainting what is otherwise a very good book. I can't help thinking, however, how differently the ending might be if it was written today. In 2007, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN had yet to find the Higgs boson and therefore prove a prediction that quantum physics had long been based upon. Perhaps now is the time for Professors Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw to produce a new edition."
59,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5919112-daniel-bratell,2,"I want to love a book like this, a book that guides the reader or listener to amazing scientific insights. Unfortunately I did not because the book's general attitude rubbed me the wrong way. Don't ask me why.A few tangible things:* The book (at least the edition I consumed) is dated. For instance, the Higgs boson was found by the Large Hadron Collider a couple of years after this book was written. * It explicitly avoids even letting the user get a glimpse of any complicated math. Just to be able to pretend everything is very simple. A lot is very simple. All is not very simple.* It avoids mentioning things that complicates the current picture, except when saying over and over again that some day we might figure out even better theories and models. For instance, if time is like any other dimension in spacetime, why can't it move backwards? All in all it dumbs down things a bit too much. I'm probably just not in the book's target audience, so what book should I read instead?"
60,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67204030-louis,4,"grabbed this quickly from the audiobook section of the library as my toddler was pulling the shelves apart. Very Glad I did. While I had to let go of the fact I wasn't going to follow the math in my head while commuting; however, I did go home and reproduce the ""proof"" of relativity using a train moving like an example they use in the book. and any book that inspires someone to do math must be at least half decent. I really liked how they bounced around from the math to the thought experiments. as someone who sees's big picture and concepts fairly easily it was fun to understand and then try to follow the math. enjoyed both parts of the book. the history of building up to E=mc2 and then the 2nd half talking about modern physics was fascinating. I didn't really understand how the title applied to it though. Great epitaph. the kind of teaching I hope my boys get in high school. either form reading or a real teacher. "
61,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,4,"This book presents relativity extremely well for the layperson. It might even edge out Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe for the explanation of why time expands and the derivation of the formula Einstein gave for addition of velocities in special relativity.The formula can be explained once you get time expansion and a distance formula (almost the Pythagorean theorem, but a version for non-Euclidean geometry).The latter half of the book, in which they present and explain most of what they call ""The Master Equation,"" which covers the non-gravity forces in the universe, lost me. I could follow along at an extremely high level, but not much more than that.But it made physics really accessible. If you're curious about understanding what relativity really means, this is a great, non-scary book.My edition also credits Jeff Forshaw as an author."

I have learned so much on those topics from reading (multiple times) his essay collections. True joy is to be found in those books (including his funny personal anecdotes). This book was really hard to read despite the marketing that it is aimed at science laymen. While it is true I could understand some individual parts of what he was saying - from a higher, macro level I have no idea what the point of the book was. It was a confusing mess. It did not help that he would frequently start to explain something and then state ""we'll get to that later"". This left me with so many dangling thoughts, I was totally lost as to what his point of all this jabber is supposed to be. Had to force myself to finish reading and was left completely unfulfilled at the end."
63,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24452449-zihad-azad,4,"Admittedly, I am not a big fan of popular science books. Science without the unromantic exploration of mathematical rigors is simply a bland list of the writer's claims. Plus, books like these give people who don't understand science the false impression that they do; and that's just dangerous. Look at how many people on social networks pretended that they understood the underlying concept of the gravitational waves. That was one of my cutest days on the internetHowever, I liked this one. Well, I am little biased towards Brian Cox. I kind of like the guy. Plus, he has this Feyman-esque capability to come up with fantastically simple analogues for seemingly recondite concepts. I always struggled a bit with Minkowsi's Space-time hyperbolic. This book finally connected the dots for me. So thanks for that"
64,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78342970-nina,4,"I found this book both frustrating and riveting. I'm abysmal at maths, so portions of the book that were heavy on the mechanics of the equations mentioned left me a little bored when I couldn't completely follow (not to mention depressed about not being good at adding). But then the non-math heavy parts were very engaging and it was hard to not get caught up in the enthusiasm of the authors. There were places I wished for more of an explanation and things I found would have been useful if they had been mentioned earlier, but overall I was very glad I stuck with the book. I got a sense of what went into that one small equation that says so much about the universe. It's pretty awe-inspiring.Also, a million points to any book that makes you stick your hand in the air and smile as you imagine heaps of neutrinos passing through your thumb. Very cool."

It explains many mindbending concepts of spacetime, quantum mechanics and relativity. If you don't have much interest, this will sail right over your heads. Though it explains in a very layman language without use of maths. This books covers so many dizzying mindbending concepts ,it can be hard to process as many of them are also related to each other."

They are challenging, inspiring, mind-blowing, exciting, and usually deeply thought provoking. This book seemed to lack all of that, except for the challenging part. I expected more out of Brian Cox. I think he is a good TV host, but he fails where Carl Sagan succeeds. He is no Carl Sagan. I still gave it four stars because I learned stuff even if I didn't understand everything. I went in thinking it was going to be different than it was. That is not the fault of the authors, that is my own fault. So four stars for subject matter. Meh on mind-blowing, life changing thoughts on the universe. I will have to go elsewhere for that. I'll give him another shot, but if his next book doesn't do it for me, then I am out."

This book offers a beautifully lucid and understandable explanation of Relativity and, as a bonus, the Standard Model. Although you won't walk away with an expert level understanding (obviously) it will certainly upgrade your layperson's understanding of just how fascinating and beautiful these theories really are. Covers concepts in depth that most books only touch on - things like symmetry, invariants, particles with zero rest mass, and the fact that light moving at the universal speed limit is actually largely a coincidence - the real explanation of c turns out to be much more interesting. Definitely worth the read for anyone interested in modern physics."

This book explains why – for example – time really does slow down when clocks speed up (and so why we age more slowly when we travel more quickly). Abundantly illustrated with easy-to-grasp analogies (as well as a lot of background tales from the history of science), Professors Cox and Forshaw do an excellent job of opening this subject up to the ordinary reader – it’s clear they’re used to explaining counterintuitive theories to folk whose experience is limited to the everyday.

I also love the fact that they tell you a equation, then what it is for, and then they give you really life examples of it so you could understand it from every aspect. I also feel like I learned a lot from this book that I wouldn’t really learn in school. I also feel like that 250 pages is not to much and not to less and that it was a good happy medium.

So despite the simplistic start, halfway through I was drowning.It starts so simplistic that by the time you don't know what Cox is talking about it's too late. You reread a few paragraphs and then a few pages and then you know you're not figuring this out without starting over. So you push through to the end knowing full well that you're never going to understand how a massless photon can have energy and e=mc^2 can be true. You mark off in goodreds as good as me can.

I have to admit I still do not fully understand. My intuition is still limited to Newtonian physics.However, the power of logical reasoning and empirical evidence tells me I have to trust Einstein's theory of relativity and quantum physics. The new paradigm has to be closer to the truth of the universe.At least I learned that the fabric of space-time itself implies mass, energy, and momentum are interchangeable through the famous formula E = mc2. The book even goes further to quantum physics to explain how matter could be created and can have mass.Sometimes it is harder to let go of my prior gut feeling and follow the flow of logic."

I found the first half of the book (chapters 1-5) more enjoyable than the second half because I think I found it more understandable. In this half the authors explain the concept of spacetime and how Einstein came to form his theories of special and general relativity based on the works of previous scientists before him. Overall a challenging but mind-opening and satisfying exploration of physics. "

In oder words, the whole thing discuss how Einstein's breakthrough changed physics triggering a paradigm swift in science. And you shouldn’t be intimidated by it because Brian dares to deduce Einstein's equation from a simple model. This is an empowering methodology. Here goes my favorite example. Before this book I thought that light was setting the speed limit in the universe. But now I know that a photon is a massless particle traveling at the universe’s speed limit."
129,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875081-arvind-balasundaram,5,"In this small, easy-to-read, volume, physicists Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw take on the challenge of explaining Einstein's famous equation in simple terms for the lay-reader. They succeed brilliantly, resorting to only one mathematical equation - the central equation representing the Standard Model of Particle Physics - on page 175. The beauty of this account is that it is motivated by the premise that a deeper level of understanding of the workings of the universe is actually so elegant that it need not be the exclusive purview of what the authors refer to as ""supermen in possession of a unique insight inaccessible to the rest of us"". No physics duo has done more to demonstrate this, and Cox & Forshaw's account is a must-read just to convince oneself that science is at heart ""a modest pursuit""and accessible to all.The book begins with a straightforward account of the very intuitive Aristotelian view of space and the Galilean view of time, and demonstrates the shortcomings implicit in the absolute structure built into both concepts. The work of Faraday and Maxwell is introduced to motivate the notion of a field, and how light is, at root, a symbiosis of electric and magnetic fields. The authors then show how the mathematical beauty of Maxwell's equations were the inspiration to Einstein, since it required somebody to consider seriously the implication that something can move at the same speed regardless of how fast one chases after it. This, in combination with Galileo's assertion that absolute motion cannot be identified, served as the axioms for Einstein's theories of relativity.Cox and Forshaw then use the non-absolute nature of space and time to help the readers visualize the four-dimensional construct of Minkowski spacetime. Invoking the scientific concepts of invariance, causality, and distance, the authors motivate the need for a non-Euclidean geometry to map spacetime, and to discuss the significance of c, the speed of light, when movement and time passage are considered in this context. They go on to consider how mass and energy are viewed here, with energy being seen as the sum of a pure total mass component and a kinetic energy component. This allows the Victorian physics world view - objects have latent energy stored within them that is released in chemical reactions - to be changed: Einstein made the latent energy irrevocably intertwined with the concept of mass, so that the more latent energy something has, the more massive it is.This framework allows the authors to introduce the Standard Model and the relationship between quarks, leptons, and neutrinos, and the four forces. The concept of antimatter and gauge symmetry is explained, using analogies like the the clock face with only one hand. The reader learns how the gauge symmetry requirement in Nature's most fundamental particles requires the introduction of a Higgs mechanism to explain the existence of mass in the Standard Model. Using easy-to-understand Feynman diagrams, the authors demonstrate how Higgs particles get created via weak boson fusion, a process recently observed and validated at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. This may be the best account yet of the basis for the Higgs mechanism, why it is necessary for Particle Physics, and how mass may have originated in the universe.The overall arguments help the reader re-create scenarios that may have resulted immediately after the Big Bang. In most cases, in particle collisions, matter and antimatter cancel themselves, leaving mass-less photons as the only energy residue. In exceptional instances, matter remains, and this very tiny residue is what made stars, planets, and all of us. How fascinating this is, and it gives the reader goose-bumps as Cox and Forshaw reveal these mysteries as only they can do. The book concludes with an explanation of gravity and how Einstein first conceived of it as a warping of spacetime. The fact that his hypothesis, a product of pure curiosity and reflection, was later proven in experiments involving eclipses and neutron stars many years later, is a testament to the reader that they could be scientists, if they re-learn how to look at and observe the world around them.This book is a marvelous achievement, taking ideas and equations that were always considered the domain of geniuses, and bringing them into the living room of the general reader. All the authors ask for is the reader's curiosity for 242 pages that flow easily. The end justifies the journey many times over, providing the reader with a fresh picture of the structure and workings of the universe, delivered continuously and at a comfortable pace. A tour-de-force in science writing.... "
130,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14083950-daniel,4,"The authors of Why Does E=mc2? are physics professors at the University of Manchester. Brian Cox is well-known as the presenter of a series of popular TV documentaries on physics themes, and Jeff Forshaw was one of his physics lecturers. They're the same age but Jeff got a head start in physics by not being in a pop band for five years.The first half of the book is about why E=mc2. The second half is about particle physics and the significance of the pending discovery (at the time of publication) of the Higgs boson.The selling point of the book is that the authors think they can explain why E=mc2 such that anyone with even the most basic understanding of maths can follow the argument. I don't think they've succeeded, but it's a noble attempt and no real criticism to say they've failed to teach a significant amount of degree-level maths and physics in less than 150 pages. I doubt anyone has come closer. If you don't already have a thorough knowledge of physics, you'll certainly learn something. I thought I had a pretty good handle on relativity theory before reading this -- the conclusions, that is, rather than the working out -- but among the first things I learned was that I didn't really know much about it.Science fiction tends to focus on the time dilation aspect of relativity, which may be why I was so familiar with that. But there's a lot more to relativity than time dilation. I'm not sure what was more surprising: that when you travel very very fast, the space in front of you shrinks; or that a spring weighs more when it's compressed than when it isn't. I always thought E=mc2 referred to the energy that would be liberated if e.g. particles were converted entirely into energy in a matter-antimatter annihilation; but it turns out that all stored energy adds to the mass of the matter in which it's stored. Just not very much, at the scales we're used to dealing with, which is why no-one ever noticed it before Einstein deduced it.Our brains have evolved to navigate a world in which we interact mainly with comparatively slow, low-energy objects, and this has shaped the model of the world that we call 'common sense'. The discovery that the world sometimes behaves very unlike our 'common sense' model predicts, and the ability of many people to accept that discovery as fact, is surely one of the great achievements of human civilisation.No doubt beings who spent all their time moving at more than 90 per cent of the speed of light would have 'common sense' models of the world that incorporate relativistic effects, and would be surprised when they deduced that slow things behave quite differently than they expected.The book answered a question I've always had about the speed of light: is the speed of light the universe's speed limit because light is somehow 'special' enough that the laws of nature are defined around it? Or is it the speed limit for another reason, and light just happens to travel as fast as possible due to one of its quirks, like having momentum without mass? The answer is that the universe's speed limit would be the speed limit regardless of whether light or anything else happened to travel at it.And it was good to finally read a thorough explanation of those Minkowski spacetime diagrams that tend to show up when people talk about relativity.The stated aim of the book -- to explain how we know E=mc2 to people who know less about maths and physics than I do -- may be too ambitious for any book of this length. If you're capable of understanding Pythagoras's Theorem -- and you don't even have to know what that is when you start reading, only be capable of understanding it when it's explained -- the authors say they can explain all the steps that lead to E=mc2. They even explain what the little 2 means, just in case. I didn't need the little 2 explained. But they lost me. If you google 'how can Pythagoras's Theorem have a minus sign?' you'll find a lot of people talking about page 77 of this book. The edition I read has an appendix which explains the minus sign. The appendix did not seem to be pitched at the same level as the rest of the E=mc2 explanation and by the time I reached it I'd forgotten most of the context, so it didn't work for me. A footnote on page 77 pointing to the appendix would have helped a lot. It would be even better if the explanation could be incorporated into the main text.NB: Speaking of little number 2s, throughout this review I used the HTML 'SUP' tag to make all my little number 2s little. But they aren't little, at least not in my browser. Grr."

134,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5992644-mg-mason,4,"Professor Brian Cox, most known for his television series Wonders of the Solar System, followed a year later by Wonders of the Universe as well as popular radio science discussion programme The Infinite Monkey Cage, has become one of the country's most recognised and popular scientific figures in a field not normally known for being sexy and ""down with the kids"". In that respect, to many people Cox must seem like an enigma - a young and trendy guy who started public life in the band D:Ream (known for Things can only get better) and now inspiring young people to take up the hard sciences again and creating an interest in Astronomy not seen since Carl Sagan's Cosmos. I went to the Basingstoke show of Uncaged Monkeys last year (the stage version of the radio show) and was pleased to see it was a sell out. Ben Goldacre, Stephen Jones and Simon Singh were also on the guest list. Science is getting big again and it is getting trendy too.Anyway, gushing aside let's get on with the book review. Physics is not one of the easiest of the hard sciences to comprehend and understandably it has not generally sold very well in the popular science category. It has become a bit of a joke that a lot of people buy A Brief History of Time but rarely get beyond the first couple of chapters. Do Cox and Forshaw succeed any better than Hawking in explaining the brain-aching complexities of physics? Is the passion there? Is this book likely to get young people going in for physics in the way that Dawkins has inspired interest in biology? Perhaps...Where it is a challenge for the average person to read and absorb the principles of Einstein's theory, it must be a challenge in the world of physics to attempt to explain these concepts in terms that a lay audience might be able to comprehend. The objective of this book then must be to achieve this through the theory and how it works in practice. The authors largely do this rather well. You find yourself nodding at the examples when the theory is being explained but when we get to the bigger ideas, the wider picture your head does start to ache. Not, it seems because it is difficult to understand, but because the actual theory goes against what our eyes are telling us most of the time. To fully grasp the concept you must break the individual-centric view and that is the largest obstacle to overcome. I hate to say ""go with it"" because that is not what the authors want. They need you to understand one chapter and fully get it before moving on with the next - and that is the biggest challenge here. It is easy to understand at the time you are reading it but a few pages down the line what once made sense can easily be lost to you.I'm pleased to say that I stuck with it, I got it (mostly) but now it will probably be relegated to the ""reference"" section of my bookshelf. It will take you time, it is not the sort of book that you can fly through (I started this at the end of January). You will constantly need to keep going back to remind yourself about this or that concept despite that the authors always include handy little reminders (""remember in Chapter 2 when we gave the example of..."" sort of thing). Through flicking back and forward, I have probably read this through twice. If you want to understand physics, there is probably no better popular science book on the market to so thoroughly explain E=mc2, but that doesn't mean that it is easy reading.See more of my book reviews at my blog"

It's really E=mc^2 + 1/2 mv^2, for low values of v."
136,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2563673-aaron-cordova,5,This book does an admirable job of actually giving the reader an intuition for the abstract concept of space-time. Amazing!
137,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40116144-dan-adelman,4,"I'd heard and read good explanations on the Theory of Special Relativity before, but they always seemed to stop short of Einstein's most famous equation. The first 3 chapters lay that foundation for people new to the subject, explaining the axioms that guided Einstein in formulating the theory. (Cliff Notes version is that Maxwell's equations show that light travels at speed c, and Gallilean relativity states that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating frames of reference. Therefore, it would seem that light must travel at speed c regardless of your frame of reference. The implications of that conclusion are of course pretty staggering, including that space and time are not as invariant as we thought they are.)The real meat of the book comes in the chapter 5, ""Why does E=mc^2?"" It is at this point that one of the biggest problems with the book became most glaring. Like many other books on physics for laypeople, Cox and Forshaw were warned by their publisher that readers don't like math. They weren't able to forgo math entirely, so they kept the math to a minimum. They would often go to lengths to apologize for showing math and explaining concepts that any 5th grader should know, like saying that T^2 means T x T, or showing what a square root symbol looks like. (Amusingly, they were equally apologetic to math-literate readers for talking down to them.) I get the sense they wanted to write it for a math-literate audience but didn't want to write off math-phobes completely. It's a shame, since they tried to describe some of the math in paragraph form, when it would have been much clearer if they had broken down the steps algebraically.The 2nd meatiest part of the book was chapter 7, ""The Origin of Mass,"" which goes into the standard model of particle physics. It showed the actual equation of the standard model and broke it down into its component parts, which I found fascinating. (I knew a bit about the standard model, including the different forces, types of particles, etc. before reading the book, so some parts may be confusing to someone not already familiar with the basics. Still, if you gloss over the details, it's still possible to get the big picture.) The chapter culminates with a discussion about the Higgs Boson. At the time the book was published, the Higgs still hadn't been discovered, nor had gravitational waves, which are mentioned in the last chapter. I find it interesting that both have been confirmed in the short time since this book was published (2009). I think that demonstrates that the physics covered in the book isn't just about explaining concepts from over 100 years ago but leads right up to some of the latest discoveries happening right now. This book gives the layperson the tools to grasp the significance of these discoveries and put them in the broader context."
138,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175748-thermalsatsuma,5,"This is probably the best known equation in science but knowing how it is derived and what it actually means is a whole different story. In this book Professors Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw start with Galileo's profound insight into the nature of relative motion which led him to the inescapable conclusion that the Earth was not the centre of the Universe. They then progress to the observations of Faraday and Maxwell on the curious link between electricity and magnetism describing simple experiments that everybody has probably tried at some point in their life. They show how Maxwell was able to accurately predict the speed of electromagnetic waves with his equations establishing the importance of experimental evidence as well as elegant theories. Using maths no more complex than Pythagoras' Theorem and a little bit of algebra they lead the reader along the same paths of reasoning that Einstein followed to develop his theory of special relativity, examining the strange consequences of the speed of light having a fixed value. Almost without realising it, you are in a strange world where space and time become a single entity dependent on the observer. Again, the effects that are predicted by the theory have been demonstrated in practical ways, and indeed how things like GPS satellites have to account for the warping of spacetime and the time dilation effect to correct their internal clocks compared to Earthbound timekeeping.The final chapters take the boldest leap of all, talking about the standard model - an equation for describing how all subatomic particles and forces interact with each other with just a handful of symbols. Most importantly they stress how any theory, no matter how elegant, is absolutely dependant on experimental proof which is why the LHC experiment at CERN is so important and interesting - it will either find the elusive Higgs Boson to complete the standard model or it will open the way to a new and more complete description of the nature of matter. This is certainly not a dry book - there are plenty of wry observations and humour along the way, including an description of the link between mass and energy by comparing the mass of a hot meat pie purchased at half time at Oldham Athletic on a wet Saturday afternoon with the same cold pie at the end of the match. This book should be accessible to just about everybody - the areas where the maths gets a little tricky are clearly sign posted and the reader is encouraged to follow the working so that they can appreciate the lightbulb moments as the conclusions fall into place.Read it and wonder at the sheer strangeness and charm of our universe."
139,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29125653-jon-carton,4,"As someone with a deep interest in all things science and space, but with no formal education beyond the basics, I have to say that this book impressed me. The authors make an admirable effort to portray modern physics and how it has evolved in a way that was both accessible and enjoyable to read, and in my opinion are largely successful in this endeavor. The book covers many theories and scientific principles, dealing with topics such as waveforms, fields, Einstein's General and Special Theory of Relativity, Gravity, time dilation, the projects at CERN, and many others. These topics are by no means easy to wrap your head around, but the authors manage to explain them, even if only simplistically, through metaphors and descriptions from our own every day experiences. For example, readers are gently introduced to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity with the analogy that to someone on Earth looking up at the progress of a plane, they can say that over a 2 minute period, the plane has moved 20 miles. However, to someone on the plane who gets up from his chair to go the toilet, when he walks back to his chair 2 minutes later, it is still in the same place that he left it - he does not have to walk for an extra amount of time to 'catch up' to it. Movement (and as we discover later, time) is relative to each observer.I don't have my book to hand to ensure the above example is 'as-is-written' in the book - I'm working from memory - but hopefully it does Einstein's theory justice for a basic explanation, and at the very least demonstrates that through reading this book, I, an average-joe person, has at least learned a basic grasp of one of the most important theories in physics today. This is not to say that everything within the book was always so easily described. There were a couple of times where I had to re-read certain parts, particularly when it starts to dissect the mathmatics behind E=mc2. But then, you're reading about physics - a topic that is considered complex and difficult, and something that even physicists themselves don't understand at times! Cox explains each aspect multiple times in as simple a manner as is possible. Approach this book with an open mind and you will find an enjoyable little gem of knowledge. Overall this book provides the best introduction to Einstein's theorem of E=mc2, as well as some of the founding principles of physics itself, that I have so far come across. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about modern physics and this famous equation as a first introduction, whether you have a scientific background or simply want to learn something new.

Quothe the Dwight, “False.”After reading (grinding?) this book, I do have a deeper understanding of Einstein's general and special theory of relativity, but it was neither easy-to-understand or fun—but the authors are having fun... Imagine you're reasonably fit, and you have always wanted to go backpacking. You think a couple guides on your first solo trip would be wise. You hire Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw, two lean twenty-somethings that have backpacked this particular trail 781 times, and have even summited Everest. They bounce with energy and are always excited. Now imagine Jeff pointing to a craggy peak away a piece called, “Understanding Energy”. It doesn't look too far, your legs are feeling sound, “OK, lets roll!” you say. But instead of a direct line, Jeff and Brian take you on a long circuitous route. Sometimes Brian offers his arm across a puddle, “No thanks, I'm good."" Then later bounds like a mountain goat through perilous terrain, all the while saying, “Just follow me, this is so easy!” Three or so re-readings later, you feel like you can pick your way through the terrain. You're a sweating mess and Jeff and Brian are running in place to keep their heart rates up. By the end of the book, you've visualized each of them finding a faulty handhold and plunging to their demise… “Wasn't so simple, was it Bri-an.”The bottom line: if you have an understanding of physics, Newtonian, Einsteinian, and are familiar with the works of Maxwell and Faraday—and you're not easily annoyed, then this book promises a deeper understanding of the fabric of the universe. You'll understand that mass is interchangeable with energy, and that working with only those two can never bring you any closer than an approximation (Newtonian Physics); for something even closer, we must factor in the speed of light. (Physicists have yet to uncover the Grand Unified Theory.) You will come to understand spacetime, that it is a pliable thing dented and creased by mass and acceleration and you may even be able visualize it as the fourth dimension; this was first for me. You will also play with star fusion, light, quantum physics, visit CERN in Geneva, and more. This book doesn't require intelligence so much as it requires mental flexibility, focus, and imagination… and the ability to not strangle the authors in the process."
141,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5261252-stephen,0,"My problem with this book is essentially the title.Given the title, I expected this book to be focused on Relativity. It was, to an extent, but it was about far too many other disjointed things as well -- at the expense of the main subject, in my opinion. Explanations, especially at this level, can be much more succinct than this. The writing clearly intended to be conversational, but ended up having far too much in common with monologues given from those in love with their own voice. The first two chapters are frankly throw-away material; the topic begins to be genuinely explored at some point around Ch. 3. From there however, the authors do not stay on track and instead go on and on writing about any manner of cosmological wonder or insights that seems to pop into their heads - much of which simply distracts from the topic at hand - given the title at least. I suspect that if the publisher had given Forshaw and Cox a limitation of perhaps 110 pages, the two of them would have created one of the best explainers ever written on the subject, but in this effort a lack of brevity and focus spoiled much of the effort for me. These critical comments aside, I would recommend this book (probably very highly) to any high school student who has no knowledge of relativity and who may not have read much in the sciences."

Then they explain the applications of this equation in modern physics, including a nice overview of particle physics. There are many other books that cover this territory. But the authors of this book aim to explain all of this in lay terms, for readers who don't have much of a background in math or science, ""using mathematics no more complicated than Pythagoras' theorem,"" as they say in the introduction. The authors do this without condescending, and without boring readers, like myself, who aren't put off by the math. I learned much of this material in the year of physics I took as an undergrad, but the details have long since faded from my memory. In college, we flew through relativity at the end of a semester of classical mechanics. I followed how we got from point A to point B, but mostly as the explicit steps and derivations in my notebook. What I particularly like about this book wasn't that it recapitulated the derivations I saw 25 years ago, but rather that it gave me a much better intuitive understanding of how Einstein went from the physics of the late 19th century to his theory of relativity.The authors derive E=mc^2 about two-thirds of the way into the book. The remainder of the book is devoted to the ""why should we care?"" part of the title. The bulk of this is a long foray into particle physics and the ""Standard Model"" of modern physics. While this material was also fascinating and well-explained, it also provided the one (minor) weak point in the book. For most of this (long) chapter, I was thinking, ""This is all very interesting, but what does it have to do with Einstein's formula?"" In the end, the authors tie it all up nicely, but I would have appreciated a bit more context earlier in this discussion.I enjoyed this book, and learned (or re-learned) a lot in reading it. But I'm not really the target audience, and I can't speak to how well this works for readers who are less comfortable with math and science."
143,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7308179-jerry,3,"This book gave me some insight into how the speed of light gets into Einstein's famous equation. Space and time are not two different things. They are not two different absolute things. Space (distance) and time are relative. They depend on the speed of the observer. And also the choice of which of two observers is in motion is arbitrary. Each can reasonably say they are not moving and the other is the one moving. What is absolute is spacetime. Spacetime has 4 dimensions, three in space and one in time. Distances between events in space time are absolute. To represent all 4 dimensions in the same units, time can be converted to distance by multiplying time by c, the speed of light. All observers can measure a distance between two events in spacetime and get the same result even though they would observe a different time by their clock and different distance in space. Everything travels in spacetime at the “speed of light” c. This is the cosmic speed limit. To preserve causality, event A that causes event B can not happen in spacetime at a time after event B, it has to happen before event B. In a 2 dimensional diagram of spacetime with a time dimension and 1 space dimension, lines 45 degrees from the origin represent the cosmic speed limit. Anything traveling faster than this could catch up and happen before its causal event, thus violating causality. We can travel along the time axis without moving in space, thus sitting still as time passes. But we can not move along the space axis without moving in time because that would imply infinite speed. When objects approach the speed of light, the cosmic speed limit, time slows down and distances get shorter. Since everything travels through space time at speed c, if we travel a great distance at a great speed we are using more of our available travel potential on space leaving less for the passage of time. The math of relativity requires that something with zero mass must travel at the cosmic speed limit, c. Light has zero mass so must travel at “the speed of light.”"
144,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44823137-yana,3,"I have very mixed feelings with regards to this book. On the one hand, it introduced me to lots of fascinating concepts I had only heard of but never truly understood, but on the other hand, I don't feel I understand them now either. The writing ranged from condescendingly simple to very confusing - confusing, for example, in that it transformed relatively simple mathematical proofs into jumbles of narration that were very difficult for me to follow, although I was well acquainted with the actual math. (Just write the vector in vector notation, please!) I don't feel like someone who had never encountered the math before would have understood it, and the way it was presented made it unnecessarily hard even for those who have some knowledge to grasp it. Mathematical notation exists for the sake of clarity and simplicity, after all!I also feel like the author would describe a simple, intuitive concept for (p)ages, but gloss over more boggling and counter-intuitive ideas, so I felt I had to go back and re-read certain passages several times. Although certain things were very well explained, like the mass-energy conversion that is at the heart of the most simple energy-releasing processes, i.e. burning. The motorcyclist analogy I did not understand, but the nice geometrical proof of why things cannot go above the speed of light was really good. The last few chapters were also fine (except the last, about general relativity - I felt like I wanted a much more in-depth explanation), but I just felt the quality of the explanations really fluctuated and the whole thing lacked a bit flow; there were some rather abrupt changes of topic and too many ""we'll explain it later""s .For all that criticism, it was an overall enjoyable read, and it has spurred me into researching relativity and the like a bit more, and I certainly learned something new and exciting about the universe. So, a solid 3-star!"
145,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13378211-rachel,5,"Physics seems a whole lot more interesting than when I was at school. Maybe it was disinterested teens learning from disheartened teaching, maybe I was just never that into it, maybe I was drawn to the arts and away from maths and logic. Whatever the reason, I'm glad physics has caught up with me, dragged me by the hand and clung onto me, shouting look, look, look! Because, and I genuinely mean this, it's interesting. Why does E=mc2? by Professors Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw aims to make the previously inaccessible accessible. Using Pythagoras theorem and relatively little maths, the pair manage to explain why energy is equal to mass times the speed of light (a constant) squared. Not only do the authors explain Einstein's world changing theory, but they (hopefully) make you understand it too. Somehow, I feel ever so slightly more well informed about the world I live in from grasping how, where and why this equation has come to be. I didn't have a Eureka moment so much as a slow trickling thought of ...hang on, that makes sense! I get it! To a point, because let's face it, the full intricacies and nuances of Einstein's theories will never be properly understood in a 200 and something page popular science book - physicists spend their lives understanding it. But thank the universe this book was written because suddenly physics doesn't seem a dusty subject full of old men but the cutting edge frontier of human knowledge. This equation has allowed us to go to the moon, observe distant planets and galaxies and created countless modern conveniences that we take for granted. My recommendation? This should be compulsory reading for all. The world could do with more information and understanding based on the logic and reason of science, rather than deniers and fantasists."

But the fact is, it has no difficult mathematics, and the tone of the book should be understandable to people coming from non-scientific backgrounds, and as such, it is an excellent starting point.A fun fact, the book was published in 2011, before the announcement by CERN in 2012 of the experimental discovery of the Higgs boson. Thus some of the parts of what you read in this book are confirmed, and you will also understand what the big deal was with said announcement."
147,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14898644-andy,4,"Cox and Forshaw do an excellent job guiding the reader through the scientific journey that led to Einstein's famous equation. Those lacking a strong background in physics (such as myself) should be cautioned that many passages will require a second, third, or even fourth reading before the concepts start to sink in. That said, after finishing this book I am confident that I can explain the following concepts in simple, easy-to-understand language:(1) All motion is relative(2) Space and time cannot be considered separately (except for approximations)(3) Energy and mass are, in many cases, interchangeableThe authors' lucid explanations, illustrations, and real-world examples allow them to explore these ideas without needing the reader to be a mathematician or physicist.The only thing keeping me from giving this book a 5-star rating is the last 3 chapters. After establishing the rationale behind Einstein's equation in the first part of the book, the authors proceed to dive into increasingly esoteric explanations for the origin of mass itself. Here, Cox and Forshaw are unable to maintain the clarity they achieve in the first 5 chapters. Their explanations of the Higgs Mechanism and survey of the Standard Model of Particle Physics are nowhere near as accessible as their explanations of the concepts mentioned above. Despite the ramped up complexity near the end of the book, I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about the relativity of time and the significance of Einstein's famous equation.

148,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38439963-mike-sherman,4,"I apologize for not knowing more about the other author, so I'll just discuss Brian Cox. When I was reading this book one thing was incredibly obvious: Brian Cox LOVES his job. Like, a lot. It rubs off well on the book and gets you interested. Then, stuff will go on a bit too long and get you disinterested. Sometimes the math was a bit too much, and I've generally been extremely strong in mathematics. I wouldn't say it's incredibly difficult, but reading this on an ebook it was often difficult what each variable was referring to. But, even though it was tedious at times, it was definitely worth it. Few books will leave you feeling so smart. The feeling is a strange one. Everything you always assumed about the universe and the world around you is mostly a lie formed by our assumptions. I liked the book a lot, but some chapters were simply unnecessary. I still don't understand the need for the entire (long) chapter on the different subatomic particles and the Higgs particle. I found it interesting, but it had very little to do with the book. Cox probably should have spent more time on the last chapter, which really should be half of the book (the other half being E=mc2).Make sure you take notes, as you should with any good educational book. You will remember much less than you think and the notes will make an excellent reminder every once in a while. I would definitely recommend this book but go in recognizing you'll get a bit bored at times and the pages won't go by nearly as fast as reading a fiction novel."

If you want to understand Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity this is a relatively (hah!) accessible book and is a fairly entertaining read. I give it 5 stars because it's my go to book every few years when I read about some new physics discovery and want a pretty quick refresher on some of the theory behind it. If you are wanting to understand it for the first time, it's a great read. If you have more than a passing interest in physics, don't read about it regularly, but want to refresh your mind on E=mc^2 every few years, this is for you.Fun facts:c is a measure of velocity. It's the universal speed limit. It's not so much the speed of light, it's the speed light travels because photons have no mass and anything that has no mass but exists will travel at that speed BECAUSEWe're all travelling at the same speed through a curved space-time. We all have the same angular momentum. Some things use their velocity through time, and some through space.* - Reserved for nonfiction. Worth a read if you're interested in the subject.

150,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186293-darkpool,4,"This review is of an audio edition, although I did get the paperback out of the library as well so I could re-look at some of the equations and diagrams if need be. I'm really pleased I did this, as it became apparent that in adapting the book for audio some stuff had to be omitted; most notably the 'master equation' in the chapter on the origin of mass. It seemed very odd the way they kept banging on about the master equation on the audiobook without ever giving even a hint of what it looked like. When I saw the equations - 4 lines of fractions, powers, upper and lower case letters and just about every Greek letter I've ever met - I understood why it was excluded, but I felt some better way of explaining its absence than just skipping over it would have been preferable. To be honest, I struggled with the particle physics section. I can say, however, that my understanding of space-time, and Einstein's famous theories has greatly improved. I know some reviewers felt patronised by the tone of the book at times, possibly they weren't really the target market. I chuckled a bit at being advised to skip over the maths if I found it difficult, but appreciate that maths is a big mental block for some. The analogies given to help us understand the concepts where clear, imaginative and at times highly amusing. Co-author Jeff Forshaw was a great narrator, and I loved the Mancunian accent. "
151,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1000163-laura,3,"It's appropriate that this is the last book I read during 2013: I came into the reading year with a flerph by way of Joseph Citro's Lake Monsters (flerph = lazy raspberry) and I've gone out with a fizzle.Now, to be fair, this fizzle is not because of Cox and Forshaw's book, which is interesting and very well read. The fizzle is because this book is so very over my head, and because I made the mistake of pausing for about a week when I was a couple of hours into it. That meant that all of the math formulas and physics the authors had laid the foundation for in the first few chapters were well and good out of my head. And then, once I picked it back up, I never really caught back up with the material.The history of physics and math did stick, as did some of the early principles, like the impossibility of absolute time and motion. And what did stick was, in all truthfulness, so super cool. But either Cox and Forshaw gave me more credit than I deserved by saying that readers needed only a rudimentary knowledge of math, or I did myself the worst disservice by listening to this instead of reading a hard copy. I'll try to re-read this, which will be easy since it's short, and since Forshaw, who narrates this book, sounds quite a bit like Neil Gaiman, and that is very nice to listen to."
152,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1908418-rob,4,"A mostly friendly book for newcomers, with more math than the popsci fare I consumed recently. This book explains the math & geometry behind relativity. Cox holds your hand through the manageable special relativity and Pythagorean theorem, then to the increasingly complex topics: spacetime, energy and general relativity. The more complicated math (the ones I'd like to see) were omitted from the book. Derivations can pop into existence. It's annoying, but considering that Einstein years working out the math... Cox knew this type of great editing will get the laymen through the end of the book. The author advises you to skip the math if you don't care for it, though. General relativity is better appreciated with a holodeck; since the book doesn't come with it, a great imagination is necessary to visualize the objects/events in spacetime. Why Does E=mc²? swings from consumable popsci text to the not very friendly math. Videos are superior in teaching something in 3D, but this book entertains, and chances are you'll find a better (still shallow, but better) understanding of the subject matter. 3.5 stars"

I had a traveller staying with me for a couple of days in Thailand and there's one thing I like the most is open-minded people (from my point of view) to recommend me books! The reason I hesitated a little bit is that there was one thing I wasn't that good at the school was maths and physics but then the authors definitely put things together in a way you can actually grasp the beauty of it (everything you could possibly imagine comes down to numbers and equations)Still when I saw equations, numbers, signs I've never seen before my eyes were reading it like a foreign language (maybe the one I have no idea about) and I trying (unsuccessfully) to understand it. Ok! I might have no understood the equations but certainly the authors brought to light in a simple way stuff like mass of matter, speed of light, energy produced by the sun/body, and etc...wow what a delight to read and get informed about this. If you're the kind of person who question the existence of matter, space and all that form it this will blow your mind and it's ok if you decide to skip the more scientific explanations of things. At the end you'll have a great picture of all that exists. "

Writing here with Jeff Forshaw, they set out to explain Einstein's famous equation so we can all finally understand it. I was a student of biology and chemistry so I have a science background coming into this, but physics is a subject I could never quite grasp. Whilst I really enjoyed this book, I can't boast that I understood it all. The first half was clear enough even when introducing a lot of the maths to explain spacetime, I felt like I was getting it. But from there on it gets more difficult. I think part of the problem is that the equations they are explaining could've been laid out better, I kept getting frustrated at continually having to flick back to see what equalled what and found myself getting a bit lost. Overall, a lot of the concepts were fascinating but be prepared to put some work into this book and possibly having to read it more than once to fully absorb everything, which is what I will be doing!

In previous books one has been asked to perform thought experiments in regards to concepts offered but here the proof is in black and white in for form of maths. Despite this, you are told that you don't have to completely understand the figures to appreciate the beauty of the science. As with any book on this subject and open mind and willingness to embrace some very strange concepts is required.All in all, I enjoyed this book. It was very hard-going at times and although I read it mainly at bed time, I wouldn't recommend it for that relaxing bed-time escape.

Granted, there were parts that I didn't make a total effort to comprehend (if they think I'm honestly going to try and puzzle out the details of the Standard Model, they're mad), but in those instances I was okay with just taking their word for it.Some chapters were better than others; my favorite sections were the ones discussing things like how stars work (which was already somewhat familiar to me, thanks to the aforementioned Netflix series).If you've got any interest at all in physics, even if you don't know the first thing about the subject, this is a great place to get started.[END DANCE MODE.]"

The mathematical concepts demonstrated require only a basic level of algebra, and maybe a little understanding of basic geometry, but nothing you didn't already learn in high school. And at it's heart, that is the real purpose of the book: to demonstrate to you that science is not really hard; all you need is a little curiosity and some passion for exploring concepts.The book will walk you through the basic steps that Einstein did to discover the equation E=mc2. Along the way you will discover the beauty of the universe and towards the end of the book they will step into a bit of the theory behind quantum mechanics, but not too much of the math at that point as it is a bit more complex than the layman may be able to follow.I loved the final statement from Mr. Brian Cox, that the universe does not care about ego, and will knock down a theory as fast as it gets constructed if it does not pass experimental evidence. This is how science works and progresses forward with better models than those that came before. This is how we grow and discover the universe at large."

Cox introduces the theory to readers in simpler terms for the more ordinary person to understand. However, make no mistake, this book is not necessarily for everybody.In Why Does E=mc2(And Why Should We Care?), Cox explains Einstein's theory of relativity in a much simpler, yet still very complicated, way. Cox, with the help of Jeff Forshaw, explain the theory through the use of many confusing metaphors and comparisons to other theories. Through the use of these comparisons and contrasts, Cox shows us that some of these other theories cannot coexist with the theory of relativity, and some cooperate with it. Absolute time, space, and speed are just a few examples.I would recommend Why Does E=mc2(And Why Should We Care?) to most readers interested in science and physics. However, I do not recommend it to most readers that do not have extensive prior knowledge on the subject of physics. This is because many of the comparisons, explanations, and metaphors throughout the book are very confusing otherwise."

The only problem is that I don't think I'm any clearer now than when I started.I have no doubt that this is in large part due to the fact I was listening to it as an audiobook rather than reading it so don't want to put the book down too much. The book started off okay but quite quickly descended into multiple equations that I just found impossible to follow in my head which meant that large swathes of the book became impenetrable - and since each section relied on the previous it meant that everything went pear-shaped for me quite early on.The book is a good attempt to explain how Einstein reached his famous equation but in the end, at least as an audiobook, the ideas just required too much abstract and mathematical thought in order to properly ensure understanding."

Step forward professors Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw with this great book. In taking things right from first principles they keep things so simple that I finally understand why the speed of light comes into the theory of relativity. Relativity is not really a difficult theory to understand if it is explained properly by somebody that is not only knowledgeable of the subject but able to elucidate the facts in a way that a layperson can actually grasp without being swamped in scientific jargon.

I am still mulling over the not entirely convincing explanation of the definition of distance in Minkowski spacetime and on the rather sleight-of-hand way that the famous equation emerges from conservation of momentum. I felt that deriving it this way was a bit of a con for a book whose title suggests the reader will acquire a better understanding of why it's true, not just how to prove it.I wasn't so sure about the long section concerning the master equation of the Standard Model. I'm not sure if something was lost in the editing (a few mistakes in the book made me think it had been rushed out) but I couldn't follow large parts of this section as the authors refer to things in the equation that aren't visible to anyone who doesn't know what the components mean. Still, it's interesting to see it, More to the point, it's interesting to know that such a thing exists and I guess I could read more on it elsewhere if sufficiently motivated."

I thought it would be interesting to read a book expounding the relevancy of Einstein's equations in our world. However, science is definitely not my best or favorite subject, and I was a bit worried it might not keep my attention. I was pleasantly surprised. The authors seemed to direct the book at newcomers to physics, and their explanations were clear and easy to understand. I did hear other reviews mentioning that some might find the math too difficult, and others found it embarrassingly easy. I could see how this might irk people while reading the book; at times, the authors took the time to explain basic concepts such as the pythagorean theorem. I could see the purpose behind this- some readers are bound to have a more tenuous grasp on mathematics than others- but apart from the sometimes unnecessarily extended use of rhetoric, I found the book interesting and well-written.

It is an easy-to-follow popular science book, yet more profound than that. Most of all, it isn't a book that just throws out ""facts"", results and theories towards you. It gives the readers an opportunity to look into minds of the great, to think like a physicist and to understand how theories of Relativity and some other scientific ideas came into being. Finally, aided by this book, I came to understand Einstein's theories of Special Relativity in detail. It really has given me more insights into this subject than any other book I've read on the same topic. The only thing that left me somehow unsatisfied, is its brevity on theories of General Relativity, of which, the book only explains its concept. Although the mathematics should be difficult, I'd really like to learn more, by following a similar way that this wondeful book has guided us through previously. "

It's more likely, however, that I just don't get it.After several books on quantum theory, is tumbled on this in my library and realized I had never really asked myself the titular question.

I especially liked the path to viewing gravity as the curvature of spacetime.My quibble (because I always have one) is that I don't like being told it's okay to skip the maths if you don't enjoy that kind of thing.

Cox spends several paragraphs each chapter apologizing to the layman about the two to three equations he presents in the succeeding sentences and then presents an equivalent to the Pythagorean theorem. I get it Brian, you are excited to share physics with the lay man, but you don't need to assume that no one has ever had calculus or, indeed, even algebra. Give us some credit and explain things with equations. If you want to pander, give the equation and explain in detail what it means so we can chew over it."

However, I still absolutely loved this book and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.The fact of the matter is (hehe, matter...physics...get it? oh nevermind), while Brian has done an excellent job of trying to take the reader from point 'a' all the way through to point 'y=x^3' for those of us normal folk who live in the universe where space and time are absolute and a quark is something a duck does, the concepts were still not always totally clear and required several re-read through's before I could begin to consider of the ideas as part of reality rather than just another Iain M. Banks book (i.e. science fiction).Granted, it could all have just been me, but this IS my review so I get to say whatever I feel right? So, that said, go buy the book; it really is an excellent read. I know I personally...have already begun to read it again. ;)"

Why Does E=mc2? is a great book. Both Cox and Forshaw have a brilliant way of simplifying what could potentially be a headache for the reader, or anyone who doesn't hold mathematics as a strong point. I was able to explain otherwise complex theories in a simplistic way to friends, which made me sound far more intelligent than I am, but also shows just how great this book is at describing Einsteins theory of relativity and physics. If you're not interested in Physics or have a hard time following mathematics then I would avoid this however, if like me you're fascinated by Physics, then challenge yourself and give this a read. Your mind will blown at numerous times in the book! "

I did physics a-level but went no further so my knowledge is not brilliant but even so I found the first chapter a bit condescending. It's so hard to write science books for a lay person so I don't really hold that against it. Things went downhill from there though. I made the mistake of trying to read the book at work where I found that there were just too many distractions and consequently I got lost pretty quickly and just couldn't retain my interest in it. I much prefer Ben Miller's physics book for what it's worth. It won't stop me from persevering with physics though; it's like a relationship in which one person is clingingly possessive of the object of their affections while the other brusquely tries to brush them off. Oh physics, why don't you love me?!"

I know only what my high school class taught me, and even then I don't remember all that much. this is not my typical genre of book, but I decided to try to venture out of my comfort zone a bit.I enjoyed the overall theme of this book, and how they tried to bring this whole concept down for the layman such as myself. I had never really considered the famous equation or that there was so much theory behind it. the authors did a really good job explaining everything.however, there were several points later in the book where they really got into the weeds and I found myself either re-reading passages two and three times, or just skipping sections entirely. that is really what kept me from giving it 4 or 5 stars.all in all, I really did learn from this book."

This obscures the tiny change in mass as a result of the change in energy associated with the chemical reactions, but that isn't made even vaguely clear.The enthusiasm of the authors for the beauty of the laws of nature and their power to predict and their benefits to us is clear and in places infectious, but the balance between comprehensibility and comprehensiveness is a difficult one not always achieved to my liking."

It talks quite a bit about the standard model of particle physics and general relativity too. Unlike most books written for the general public, this one does not shy away from mathematics completely, and this is greatly to its credit. I did not follow the math in all of its details, but it is not necessary to do so to appreciate that these astoundingly accurate theories, which between them cover all of the known forces in the universe, are based on relatively simple math. The hard part is not the math, but the ability, which takes some practice, of letting go of our poor intuition about how stuff actually works.(Well, okay, the math for general relativity is apparently not simple at all, and it is appropriately not covered in the book.)"

It's narrated by one of the authors, Jeff Forshaw, and the experience of listening to him was transformative. I will read this again in paper or ebook format, but his humor and emphasis (and accent) will stick with me.The authors succeed entirely in explaining E=MC^2 and why it matters... but they also explain why it matters that we ask these questions, and they left me with a new vision of reality that is achingly beautiful.Einstein's formulation of relativity theory was a crowning achievement of human imagination & willpower... but Cox & Forshaw's clear and clever (and remarkably short) explanation is a crowning achievement of literature and teaching."

I liked that Dr. Cox does not try to deify the man but rather focuses on his achievement and stresses the fact that scientific progress comes not through individual genius but though dedication, determination, collaboration and ingenuity. I came away with a much simpler and deeper understanding of the famous formula because of Dr. Cox's clear explanation of space-time and the importance of the cosmic speed limit 'c'.In the second last chapter the book veers off to explore the standard model of modern physics. This very brief introduction to such a complicated idea was a bit confusing to me but seemed to be mostly contextual, to place e=mc^2 as a pivotal step to the creation of that model and our modern attempts to find the elusive theory of everything."

(And Why Should We Care?)By Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw (Da Capo Press)To move beyond a cursory understanding of Einstein’s iconic equation, put yourself in the adept hands of physicists and science educators Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw. Using clear language and a few clearly explained equations, they demystify physics’ most counterintuitive claims, connecting the dots between space-time, electromagnetic fields, invariance, and Galileo’s earlier theory of relativity. Cox and Forshaw place these ideas in context, ultimately demonstrating how the Large Hadron Collider, where Cox works, is an essential tool in a new level of understanding the laws of our universe. "

While I did feel that in places some of the explanations went on a bit too long and the analogies were quite long-winded, I think the scope of this book and the wealth of information it gave was great - covering a lot of different areas from Physics related to relativity. Explaining relativity in terms most people can understand is no easy feat, but Why Does E=mc2 manages to do it reasonably well. There are parts of the book that seem a bit confused and in a few places a jump is made with no clear explanation of how we got there, but overall it gives a friendly approach to what is generally viewed as a complex and unreachable theory to the everyday individual."

The language is very ordinary, and complicated maths (in fact, almost any maths) is avoided....though mathematical explanations are available in appendices for those who want them.The balancing act between simplicity and condescension is a tricky one, and I did feel sometimes that the authors tipped over into condescension a little, but that's probably better than making things over-complicated and losing readers.On the whole, I found this book very interesting, and I even learnt a couple of feacts about relativity that I hadn't known before. If you're interested in physics/science, but don't have a strong mathematical background, I'd really recommend this book. "

He introduces you to Special Relativity, teasing out its basic concepts, its nonlinear geometry, and its implications for the measurement of time, distance, mass, and energy. Any non-physicist interested in special relativity should read this book (yes, physicists, you can read it too). The level of mathematics is pretty primitive--simple algebra and Euclidean geometry--but the gist is explained well even without resorting to one's high school math. Of course, by now there are zillions of people who understand special relativity, and I'm glad to count myself among them. But as for General Relativity...?"

I admit I got lost during the whole derivation of Minkowski spacetime, but my concerns were actually mostly cleared up in the appendix. One of the sections that interested me most though was the section on the origins of mass, where the roles of the Higgs boson and other elementary particles were described. It's amazing how Einstein's theories could not only be so accurate (as shown by experiments), but also influence other fields, like particle physics and quantum mechanics. This universe is a mysterious place...I'd recommend this book to anyone who's interested in relativity, but that also has a head for maths, else you'll just have to take their word for it that certain equations are true."

As someone who liked physics in high school, but since then never dealt with it again, It was never too hard to follow but at the same time not too slow and patronizing. Makes you really think being a physicist is the most exciting job in the world. I listened to this as an audiobook and was surprised how well it works without being able to see formulas and diagrams. Part of the reason is probably that the authors try to avoid as they say any maths more complicated than Pythagoras and that diagrams wouldn't help much anyway visualizing multidimensional concepts."

And then reaches the famous equation by adding momentum into the discussion. The concepts may be mind bending, but the maths is very basic and explanations clear and concise.The enthusiasm of the authors is infectious, and I came out of this book desperate to know more about relativity, particle physics and science as a whole.If you ever wanted to honestly say ""I understand Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity, it's not so difficult"", this is a must read."

Cox Rambles on, goes off on pointless tangents and generally makes something really simple into something really complicated. Seeing as the whole book is just about deriving E=mc^2 and that takes the average physicist about 8 minutes to do you would think it would be simple. You would expect that for a wider readership Cox would expand, slow down and generally make easier the intermediate stages of the derivation. However, Cox doesn't make it easier. He maintains the high level, charges off down unfamiliar roads and makes the physics I know and love seem almost alien. I don't think I will be reading any more by this author. "
184,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5266448-lucas,5,"Excellent and intuitive explanation of relativity. The first several chapters provide an amazingly clear explanation of how to derive special relativity from a small set of intuitive premises (using very few equations, which you can skip). I highly recommend it to anyone interested in understanding Einstein's theory. My only objection would be that his caveat about Einstein's brilliance in the final pages does not emphasize the extent to which Einstein's ideas were in the air of the time among Poincare, Lorenz, Hilbert and others at the time. I'm not convinced physics would be materially different today if not for Einstein, and I don't think Cox makes that clear."

Topics of particular interest were the relationship of space and time into ""Spacetime"", how ""c"" is the universal cosmic speed limit and that the speed of limit just happens to be the same as c - because light is 100% energy and 0% mass (photons).I don't think I absorbed all of the information in the book as the subject is quite heavy going. Now I am listening to an audio book version where I have listened to about 60% of the book.I am sure Why is E = mc2 is worthy of re-reading, maybe after reading another book or two on the subject."

Orzel himself said on his book that this is a good introduction to Einstein's theories without any mathematical knowledge. Actually I failed to finish reading this book before. The reason is, probably my lack of basic knowledge on relativity. But I had just read Orzel's relativity book so this time I could read through. Cox and Forshow are always good guides for someone like me to apparently very complex theories. For someone like me who have non physics background, I would recommend to read together with Orzel's book. I thought it's interesting that Orzel has a dog and Cox and Forshow choose cat on their cover. "

Cox, with his British wit and charm and frequent reminders of chalk-covered professors, brings without much math this most elegant and incredible of equations to life beginning with the simplest of notions and proceeding to rock the phenomenological world off its hinges. None of this is to say the book is simple, there are concepts here not for the faint of intellectual heart, but as a conceptualization, Cox brings both special and general relativity to a plane that is accessible and mind-expanding."

The reason I had to give this 3 instead of 4 stars though is because I was offended by the constant need to apologize about the smallest amount of math. I don't know if I should blame the authors for this per se, but I only found it distracting and sad that the simplest algebra had to be explicated. Nevertheless if you can skim over the 'I'm sorry but math is important and here's why and if you don't like it it's okay you can skip over the next part' parts, it's worth the read to get insight into special relativity."

This book tries to explain the space-time theory. It explains the basic assumptions, provides a few calculations as evidence, then takes a leap into assuming that this is all proven. It does not address any counter theories or the apparent intuitiveness of the theory, or even the geometry used to demonstrate it. That said, its a good book for getting into the mind of the modern day physicists, who blindly follow other's beliefs just as much as many religious people today do. Science: the new Western religion."

Followed by 2 chapters about other theory's like standard model and general relativity. Over all, I think it was a very good book in popular science genre, a bit nearer to the academic science than the rest of similar books. Which I think is because special relativity is a very simple theory.

You don't need any math background to read the book although the authors do have to use some basic algebra in their explanations. All in all this is one of the best books I've read on the why behind this equation.

Re-reading was something I had to do for a lot of the very abstract ideas proposed in this book.

The answer is honestly no. There was lots of mathematics in the book, which lost me most of the way. But I definitely got a better idea now, and I loved some of the anecdotes and stories in the book, and it had a few great comparisons which made it easier for me to understand.

One of the more interesting parts was about the global positioning satellites and it didn't come until the end.Part of my problem is that I would read before I went to bed and there were a lot of easy places to stop reading so I would fall asleep and then have to re-read the stuff from the night before."

Like Hawking, Cox and Forshaw are extremely adept at putting across complicated ideas to a lay audience, although they do not shy away from using maths as much as Hawking (A Briefer History is, after all, A Brief History of Time with less maths in it). They are also just as engaging and witty. I often found that an idea I had not grasped in one book was explained in a way I could understand better in the other book. Both highly recommended."

Many aspects are successfully covered by this approach though later segments relating to the so called Standard Model are less coherent. All in all this is book makes accessible some of the most fundamental elements of physics and provides enough substance for the layman and science graduate alike."

It may be that this is a bit of an unfair appraisal, especially since I didn't even finish the book.

The origin of the concept of mass is investigated during a visit to the Large Hadron Collider, where the ""God"" particle was recently discovered. After discussions of energy and mass, the writers explain why the speed of light is involved in the famous equation.Serves as a nice introduction to basic modern physics."

Doesn't get too involved and for anyone whose been interested in the field for a while will probably find it lacking. However its not marketed for us so I'm not reviewing it that way. For a pop science book it avoids math but still has more in it that Hawking's a brief history of time. Somehow surprising as publishers try to avoid math like the plague.

What I learnt from reading non-technical physics books is that Understanding the book depend mostly on your previous knowledge of the subject regardless of the author way in presenting his goods.

I would've rated this much higher if it wasn't for the derivation of E=mc^2 at the beginning. I was disappointed that the authors described the mathematics as no harder than the simple Pythagorus equation when I struggled to understand it as a Mathematics undergraduate.

It took me awhile to complete the book, because I had to take it slow to feel like I understood the concepts presented, but it was worth the effort. I would absolutely read another science book by Brian Cox."

It gave me a much better understanding of the theory of relativity and it how relates to spacetime and nuclear physics.I would probably need to read the book several times to do the book justice and to probably grasp the physics. I found the book to be more readable than Manjit Kumar's book on particle physics, which I also read recently."

At times it was difficult to follow, but I did come away amazed by how little I understood before about relativity, spacetime, gravity, and the nature of mass.

It turn out even condensed Einstein requires the rereading of sentences, like, five times. And the chapters on particle physics were impenetrable (clearly the authors' specialty).In the end, I have a much better understanding of relativity than I did going in. And apparently relativity brings with it a number of other super interesting facts about the physical world. I'm just glad I ended up choosing history as my major. "

279,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3924184-ruxandra-balboa-p-ysti,4,"This popular science book is written on the pattern of a riveting novel starting from our intuitive perception of time and space... from there a world of personal and scientific exploration opens that leads us to a deep understanding of E=mc2. Never pedantic, always fluid. "
280,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9455083-laura-carr,5,"This book is so easy to understand and explains so much! It's also quite funny which makes it easier to read and I felt like I'd achieved something when I finished it. I was like 'I know, I'll go and get a degree in Physics! I must be well on my way already!' Then I didn't."
281,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369876-voracious,4,"Didn't finish it. It was all going along quite nicely till near the end of the 'Spacetime' chapter, and then I lost the thread completely. I might try again, because the book is really very well written - clear and straightforward without being patronising."
282,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7726383-claire,3,"The first half of the book was really good. Well written, easy to understand and put in a really interesting way. And then the second half suddenly became inaccessible, seemingly written by a completely different person!"
283,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10777746-pctrollbreath,4,This was quite an interesting book. I will admit that my brain felt a bit frazzled after some of the maths sections but I am glad I stuck with them. The book is well explained and the author communicates their enthusiasm for thhe subject very clearly.
284,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6937347-colin,4,"Beyond the stuff you'd expect of Brian Cox (an abundance of superlatives, long rambling passages telling you how beautiful and straightforward everything is) this is a pretty coherent, engaging account. And there's no irrelevant scenery for him to stand in front of looking windswept."
285,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8276475-paul,4,"Enter with a modest understanding, or at the very least, an appreciation of physics. Far more accessible than the average text book and much wittier. I'm on a science book reading kick currently and this title didn't disappoint."
286,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14204118-richard,4,Very concise explanations but I think the book should of been special relativity specific as opposed to incorporating the standard model of fundamental particles. This book helped me massively during my project for college and was the most reliable source I found.
287,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14050482-michael-walker,3,One of the most difficult times I've had with reading a book on Physics. I really like Brian Cox but something in this made it much more complicated than it needed to be and that's not something I expect from him.
288,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3220488-em,2,"Two stars isn't really a reflection on the book itself more on the woeful state of my own mathematics and physics.The ""Professors"" have done their best to make the book accessible to non-scientists but it was a step too far for me!"
289,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18267069-john-preston,3,The authors alternated between giving too much details especially with the math and not enough jumping to conclusion without explaining. I enjoyed the last few chapters When they wrote just about concepts abandoning the math
290,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10267105-stephane,5,The authors have done a great job at explaining some of EInstein's work in a simple way...I listened to the audiobook and although I had to sometime rewind to really get some of the concepts explained I found the overall book very accessible and very satisfying.
291,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24154092-alex-harris-macduff,4,"Very easy to understand, but very difficult to remember. There is a lot of maths in this book, so it's only really enjoyable if you're properly invested in finding out the answer to the titular question (it's not forty-two)."
292,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14644783-joshua-storrs,5,A mind blowing change of perspective on how you see the universe is hidden somewhere in each chapter. This book is a fantastic description of the theories of special and general relativity for people who are unfamiliar or intimidated by the mathematics involved.
293,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12054573-kevin,3,"It's a good read but i'm afraid my little grey cells aren't to taking it in at first bite, no fault to the authors, it lies squarely with this reader. However once I've read something a bit easier like ""War and peace"" I'll take another run at it. =)"
294,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/165324-hom-sack,1,"I probably didn't understand the authors' explanations. Their arguments were not convincing. Again, ""Why does E=mc**2? and why do we care?"". The book is short, but not short enough. I couldn't wait for it to end. It was just too boring."
295,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6998711-james-gray,4,"Amazing book... by far the best physics book I have read to date. Unfortunately, two-thirds the way through it was way over my head. I will have to re-read it again and again and again. I cannot wait!"
296,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17582837-lupeng-jin,4,"By virtue of the reputation of Professor Brian Cox and his gently charisma shown on BBC, I picked up this book for deepening my understanding about physics, especially the general relativity by the forever genius in human history - Albert Einstein."
297,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18669595-austin-riba,5,"I kinda sorta understand special relativity now! General, not so much. But this book does an excellent job at explaining the geometry of Minkowski space which is extremely difficult to comprehend and must be even harder to explain. This book is also a great particle physics primer."
298,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33094559-antonios-hadjigeorgalis,5,I really enjoyed this book. It was written in a very easy to read manner so that no matter how little physics you know you will be able to understand the concepts. I left this book with a much more clear understanding of the physics described.
299,0306817586,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7473370-natalia-jagielska,3," And I thought, at first- yes, an accessible astrophysical literature, finally, I will understand it- but as it continued, the maths started to meddle with my eyes. Maybe I am too young, not clever enough, never studied physics... Still, at times, interesting, I got to know few things "
