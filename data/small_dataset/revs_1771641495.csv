0,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1938805-brian,4,"This is a great intro to a fascinating subject, written with the casual reader and layperson in mind. It is almost unbelievable that we know so little about such an important part of our body (scientists know more about bees than they do about our belly-based bacteria). Our digestive system is the only part of our body that operates outside of the purview of our brain. Perhaps this is why we have so many emotional expressions that we tie to our belly (""gut reaction"", ""butterflies from being in love"", etc.)Here are some other nifty things I learned:95% of our body's serotonin is produced in our gut.Our gut bacteria have 150 times more genes than a human being.Saliva produces a painkiller called opiorphin - stronger than morphine and only discovered in 2006.The surface area of our digestive system is about 100 times greater than the area of our skin.Studies have shown that our gut bacteria has the ability to influence cravings in our brain for particular foods.The total mass of bacteria in our body equals roughly 2.2 kilos.A fun, informative read. I look forward to advances in science that will help us to recognize our own personal gut flora and what we can do to best care for it."
1,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,4,"*review based on Audible audiobook*This is a book which is perfect for audio. Written for the layperson, it is informative and funny, but without the added benefit of an amazing narrator (who is able to get the tone just right), it may have seemed a little bit silly. Another reviewer noted the abundance of exclamation marks- in the text, that might be annoying, but when read aloud by Katy Sobey, the jokes and wry exclamations seem just right.The content was interesting and entertaining, both educational and practical. Despite my background in healthcare and personal experience with an irksome gut, there was lots here I didn't know and tips I could put into practice. This is not just a boring run through of the mouth-anus journey, Enders uses up-to-date research to show how scientists are finding out more and more about how the gut can affect the body in surprising ways. From how having a baby by caesarean section can leave the child more prone to asthma, to the links between certain gut flora and depression, risk taking, and suicide, this book is a trove of fascinating information. It also has a section on what your poo should look like. In other words, it has it all. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to know a bit more about how their body works."

I understand that the author was trying to keep it ""light"" so her readers wouldn't start yawning and dozing off on facts parts, but I think it would be better off without it... Oh well, maybe I'm just not the target reader for this book. In general - pretty good, informative and rather recommended, especially if you didn't know you shouldn't put your fingers in your mouth after scratching your butthole. You're welcome!"
4,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,3,"Recommended for those who would like to know more about how their bodies work, but are afraid of biological/medical jargon. Written by a young woman in medical school, this work explains things in lay-person‚Äôs terms and is very accessible.A pretty good section on our reliance on gut bacteria to mentor our immune system and help us to process our food. She explains very clearly why too much cleanliness is not necessarily a good thing. (Did you know that the whole ‚Äúcleanliness is next to godliness‚Äù idea was part of the campaign to stop the spread of tuberculosis? That our society‚Äôs disparagement of public spitting dates from this epidemic?) I guess I was expecting too much of the book however‚ÄîI know that the gut & the skin develop from the same embryonic layer and that there are quite a few links now between gut problems and skin rashes. I was hoping for a more detailed discussion, but it occupied only a few sentences in the book.Also, I continue to search for something that will explain the connection between gut bacteria and food intolerances/sensitivities and suggest useful methods to cope with such things. This was mentioned in passing, but no ‚Äúhow to help yourself‚Äù guide. Rats!A good, basic explanation of how the digestive system works. "
5,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13070326-heather-k-dentist-in-my-spare-time,3,"DNF at 80%. I'm over the gut. I really, really enjoy science books, especially anything having to do with medicine/the body. That make sense, of course, seeing as I have a degree in a medical field, but I really can't get enough of learning about the human body. However, after listening to Mary Roach's Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal, which I enjoyed very much, I thought I was ready for another round of intestinal delight. I was partly right. What Mary Roach does is she breaks up a never-ending stream of facts into a story-line, of sorts. That wasn't really done here. While I found the information interesting in Gut: The Inside Story of Our Body‚Äôs Most Underrated Organ, I missed the personal anecdotes and stories from ""Gulp,"" which has very similar subject matter. Also, while the narrator of ""Gut"" was pretty good, she didn't hold a candle to the narrator of ""Gulp."" I still liked learning about the alimentary canal and intestinal tract, and I still bored my family to death with random gut facts, but it got to be a little... drab for me. Time for me to move on to another body part. "
6,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48716353-ella,5,"I absolutely loved this! I learned so much about my own body it‚Äôs crazy! I am pretty sure I have been raving about this book to my friends and family so much they could probably say they have read it as well haha I had to share everything I learned since it feels so crucial we all are informed about what goes on inside us. All the bacteria, all the processes are fascinating and I ended up watching a lot of videos on YouTube about this (some were quite disgusting I have to admit üôà)Highly highly hiiiiighly recommend this to pretty much any human being out there (maybe even to cats haha as there is a chapter relevant to them as well) "
7,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,4,"This book gives us a warm and friendly journey through the gut. Written in easy terms for the layman, and generously illustrated by the author's sister, this is a very accessible description of the journey of food through our bodies, and the critters it meets on the way down.Giulia Enders is a doctoral student, and she wrote the book in response to a friend wanting to know more about the gut. To do this she did a lot of research, as is shown in the bibliography at the end. Regarding the bibliography, she notes that the books and papers cited cover issues not found in standard medical textbooks. To be honest, I found some of her ideas a little wacky, or to put it another way, she gives equal weighting to all the ideas she puts forward. I felt that someone with more experience in the field might have been a bit more discriminating, or created more of a hierarchy of solutions. Enders sort of throws open the doors and leaves us to pick and choose.I may be so wrong in saying the above. Her book has had fantastic reviews from most of the major newspapers - and I certainly learnt a lot from it. Plus I enjoyed reading it - and given the subject matter that is quite an achievement.One final whinge. There was no index. I think that was a real oversight.I end with a sprinkling of notes - mostly taken directly from the book - purely for my own record.(view spoiler)[ How to pooSquatting has been the natural pooing position for humans since time immemorial. Haemorrhoids, digestive diseases like diverticulitis, and even constipation are common only in countries where people generally sit on some kind of chair to pass their stool. Of course this is not the only cause for these problems, but the difference in countries where they squat rather than sit is noticeable. Our position on Western toilets can be rectified (especially when we are having problems), by A) Inclining your upper body forward and B) Placing your feet on a low footrest in front of the toilet. This way all the angles will be correct.Teeth and jawsTooth enamel is the hardest substance produced by the human body. And it needs to be, since our jaws can exert a pressure of up to 80 kilograms on each of our molars - or approximately the weight of a grown man. When we encounter something hard in our food, we pound it with almost the equivalent force of an entire football team jumping up and down on it before we swallow it.TonsilsBefore we reach the age of seven, our tonsils are still an important training camp for our immune cells. For reasons not yet understood, removing the tonsils of a child younger than seven can lead to an increased risk of obesity. Tonsils of children below this age should stay in, unless there is a very good reason for taking them out.The removal of tonsils can improve things for people with psoriasis and it can also help certain people with rheumatic diseases. (It helps those people whose tonsiller crypts are shaped so they easily trap bacteria.)Gluten sensitivityOne person in a hundred has a genetic intolerance to gluten (coeliac disease), but a considerably higher proportion suffer from gluten sensitivity. The latter is not a sentence to a life of gluten avoidance. Those with this condition can eat wheat without risking serious damage to their small intestine, but they should enjoy wheat products in moderation. Many people notice their sensitivity when they swear off gluten for a week or two and see an improvement in their general well-being. Suddenly, their digestive problems or flatulence clear up, or they have fewer headaches or are less plagued by tiredness.Lactose intoleranceLactose intolerance is not an allergy or a real intolerance but a deficiency. The body requires a digestive enzyme to break the chemical bond found in lactose. Lactose breaks down when it comes into contact with the gut wall (& the enzyme), and the resulting single sugars can then be absorbed. If the enzyme is missing, similar problems arise to those caused by gluten sensitivity, including belly ache, diarrhoea and flatulence. In 75% of the world's population, the gene for digesting lactose slowly begins to switch off as they get older. The older the person, the greater the probability that she will be unable to break down lactose.However, lactose intolerance does not mean you must cut out milk products altogether. Most people have enough lactose-splitting enzymes in their gut, but their activity is somewhat reduced - say down to about 10-15 % of their initial level. So you can simply use trial and error to find out just how much your body can deal with, and how much dairy produce it takes to make the problems come back.Fructose intoleranceThe most common food intolerance in Germany (the author's country), is a problem with digesting the fruit sugar fructose. This can be the result of severe congenital inability to metabolise fruit sugar, but most people affected by fructose intolerance actually have a condition more accurately described as fructose malabsorption, and only experience problems when exposed to large amounts of the sugar. When fructose is described on food packages as 'fruit sugar', consumers often assume it is a healthier, more 'natural' option. This explains why food manufacturers choose to sweeten their products with pure fructose, and consequently why our digestive systems are exposed to more of this type of sugar than ever before. Furthermore, globalisation and air transport mean that many Western consumers are now exposed to a previously unheard-of overabundance of fruit.Fructose intolerance that appears later in life is thought to be caused by a reduced ability of the gut to absorb fruit sugars.The fructose intake of the average American is currently 80 grams a day. Our parents' generation took in only around 16 to 24 grams a day. (hide spoiler)] "

In the year or so I have had a fascination with my own gut, after my doctor surmised that my stomach problems were because I have IBS. Since then I have read countless articles and watched countless videos on the subject, in an attempt to help me manage my gut and its problems better. So naturally, when Gut by Giulia Enders was released, I had to get it and read up on the subject from a more scientific point of view.This book was a truly fascinating read, and I learned a lot of things that I didn't know before. Unfortunately, I didn't have the foresight to keep a notebook and pen beside me while reading, because I would have liked to have had a list next to me that I could go back through again in more detail. However, some of the things I learned were why antibiotics are only a good thing in the most extreme cases, why not all creatures can vomit and why it's a good thing we can, how babies born naturally as opposed to with a caesarean section are better protected with bacteria in their early months, and how it's not actually probiotics that will do our guts the best but prebiotics.There were definitely sections of this book that interested me more than others, such as sections on allergies and intolerances, vomiting (despite my fear of the subject), and how the brain and the gut are a lot more linked than we might have previously thought. However, particularly with the latter section, I would have loved to have seen a bit more information as I felt they were way too short in comparison to other sections. I also wish there had been more of a focus on issues such as IBS, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease - although all three were mentioned, I was hoping for a bit more information on what causes them, and what can be done to manage their symptoms.I enjoyed Enders writing style for the most part - she manages to balance some of the more fact-heavy sections with light-hearted humour which was nice (particularly for someone who is relatively new to popular science). However, there were times where I found the constant jokes less funny - she uses a lot of metaphors throughout the book to illustrate her point, but they did seem at times more for comedic value than to help further clarify her points, and a lot of them I could have really done without. I did however like the pictures that accompanied the text, drawn by her graphic designer sister Jill Enders, and they were actually very helpful at seeing certain elements of Enders text more clearly - for example, in how our food travels through our body.Overall this was a fun and very entertaining read, and I did learn a lot from it. Although there were things I would have changed and gone into more depth about, this is probably a really great starting point for science n00bs like me, who want to know more about our own body and its role in our everyday lives."
9,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,3,"Rating 3* out of 5. I'm not charmed. I found the writing childish with too many exclamation marks and didn't find things as funny as the author obviously did at times. I like the first 100 pages the best because of the numerous new things I learned, but the for the rest of the book I mostly just wished it would be over already. It's supposed to be fun and engaging and probably is to most people - to me it just fell a bit flat."
10,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,3,"This is a jaunty, easily digestible pr√©cis of intestinal biology, an enterological cornucopia of facts and figures and buttock-clenching anecdotes. Expect a lot of often fascinating talk about poo and farting, rather like a Monty Python sketch without the punchlines, as well as layman's introductions to the latest research into probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, the human biome, and the mysterious relationship between your gut and your brain. I learned a lot. I also made several strategic alterations to my diet, so it clearly connected on that level.The author, Giulia Enders, is still studying for her PhD, and the book came about after a TED-style talk she gave at a Science Slam event went viral in 2012; if you understand German, you can watch it here (she's so young!). She writes about her subject with a smile on her face, fending off embarrassment with a no-nonsense, almost mumsy joviality, leavened with a few judicious euphemisms. It's all rendered into perfect colloquial English thanks to David Shaw's translation, which, at least in this edition, is refreshingly British in idiom. I'm not sure how it compares to Mary Roach's Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal, which I haven't read, but if you're interested in what you eat, how your body works, or just want to binge on some high-fibre factoids, Gut is a solid pop-science choice."
11,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15945083-nigel,5,"I find it quite hard to know just what to say about this book. It is one of the most interesting books I've read in quite some time. It is also one of the most improbable page turners I've read. The illustrations are wonderful and quirky.It's a book about what happens in the passage between the mouth and the backside. At times maybe it is not for the faint-hearted. You will learn quite a lot about your poo! However you will also learn a lot about your gut bacteria and their impact - frequently surprising - on your life.It is actually quite a scientific book. The book talks about the bad guys - Helicobacter for example. And then the next section talks about a bacteria that can be beneficial to you - Helicobacter... Some section really did make me go ""wow"". As an example the section on Toxoplasmata - a genuinely quite nasty inhabitant of the guts of cats but sometimes they stray.I'd be surprised if most people who read this don't start questioning aspects of their (or their families) lifestyles. Allergies and intolerances are far more prevalent now - does this book possibly explain some aspects of that? Why if we kill off all the bacteria we possibly can by cleaning everything are we still experiencing similar rates of infections?Entertaining, thought provoking, accessible and well written - I'd be happy to recommend this one to anyone with any interest in the subject. It might even change the way you sit on the loo :-)"
12,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739465-monica,4,Nice and short little primer on the digestive system. Learned quite a few things I didn't know.4 StarsListened to the audio book. Nicely narrated by Katy Sobey.

It also included a lot of information I hadn't known, either because it was new, or because I hadn't been paying attention.Recommended.Ta, L."
14,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21381864-anatoly,3,"This was a nice and an interesting read. Although written in simple language and full of humor and funny anecdotes, this book is quite informative and encompasses a great deal of knowledge. But, this is also it`s downside. This is a really good start for those who don`t have any prior knowledge on the subject or don`t have a scientific background. But for those that are looking for something less light and a bit more scientific I would recommend something else. "
15,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"If you are looking for a book on gut microbes and want to avoid pseudoscience and delve into a book which contains solid science, this book is an excellent choice. Oddly, I find that ratings for pseudoscience books like Perlmutter's Grain Brain are often higher than they are for books written by responsible scientists who will not make claims or provide any suggestions that are not scientifically studied and replicated. My guess is that real science, which doesn't yet have all the answers about microbes, is far less sexy than pseudoscience books that can make any claim or suggestion they like, while playing fast and loose with the actual available evidence. The Good Gut by the Sonnenberg's contained a hippie vibe as well as solid science. This book has less of a hippie vibe but is far more rigorous than even the Sonneberg's book. So even if you were hoping for more of a hippie vibe, I would actually recommend this book over The Good Gut, only because it's actual scientific content is better. Adding to that, Enders is a fantastic writer and her tour of the human digestive system was absolutely fantastic. I have not found such a wonderful description in any other book. "
16,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3798335-karina,3,"A lot of overlap with Mary Roach's Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal, naturally, and - as it turns out - I prefer Roach's style. This one has cutesy illustrations and a title that makes a horrendously cute rhyme in the German and Norwegian editions, which is obviously a plus."
17,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12508032-jyotsna,4,"So, where do I start? It took me a really long time to finish this book and honestly, this is one of the best books I have read this year. Your digestive system is the underdog of your body and if you don't take care of it, the implications that it has on the other aspects is immense. You are what you eat. The book explores everything a layman can understand - from eating to antibiotic resistance - everything that you will need to worry about when dealing with your digestive system. Conclusion: A great read! It is very informative and this is a must read if you suffer from gastric issues. Also, love the author's sense of humor."
18,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3057525-sadie,4,"The (original German) title nails it: Darm mit Charme (charmful gut / gut's charm), for this is a very charmful book indeed. It was not only super interesting and helpful, giving the reader lots and lots of insights of what is really going on down there, below the stomach area, you know, in this bundle of intestines that somehow transforms food into, well, poop. But that's not all it does by far - and even though we know about some of the gut's extra powers, might have read or heard about its inhabitants who keep the flora in peace, abouts its intelligence and about its super powers to fight diseases, we (well, at least I) don't really dwell too much on these informations. Because hey, there's the shiny brain with its super intellectual powers, there's the heart keeping up the beat, there's the skin that needs its treatment - but the gut? Ah well, toilet talk.And this is where Giulia Enders enters. Not only does she present this awesome amount of interesting information, it's also how she does it. The charming part. Her writing is adorable, not in the ""lemme tell you about poo poo, twinkie winke""-childish nonsense kind of way, but in a way that is respecful yet close to the subject... and full of love. What I mean is: Her adoration and awe of the gut shines through on every page, in almost every word, and it totally took me over. I loved her style, all the little tidbits, the often sweet and/or funny comments. That, combined with the wonderful illustrations contributed by her sister made this book a very special treat for me.Plus, it told me about the sea squirt, an animal whose only goal in life it is to find a place to settle down forever. And once it found it and settled in, it eats its own brain, for that organ is no longer neeeded. Oh, sea squirt - maybe you were right all along?"
19,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6120135-mary,5,"Ok, I'll go (down) there, Enders presents a tour de force of the alimentary canal focusing on the importance of gut and its beloved, misunderstood bacteria. This book makes it to my very short list of most helpful books ever. Plus she's a gen-u-ine scientist, clever, funny, likeable and has mastery over the substance and content of her book. She makes the case that the human body is gut-heart-lungs-brain. Other researchers contend that gut bacteria should be classified as an ORGAN! Thank you sweet Jesus for not letting me tolerate the smell of cat urine (if this concerns you, google toxoplasmosis asap) That said, I have absolutely no qualifications to evaluate this book. It's a gut reaction.I would love to see the original German phrases and folk sayings that had to be substituted into American for the English language translation. Just knowing that Enders is German made this journey all the more delicious. The way she lovingly (and at times lusciously) describes bacteria and how we imbibe them made me want to run outside with a bottle of kombucha, frolic in the dirt, roll down to the beach and kiss some strangers. Eskimo kiss a dog's nose for dessert?I learned a lot, altered my way of thinking and lol'd throughout this book. Must read for anyone with the interest and the fortitude (excluding, of course, MDs and scientists who [think they?] know more than she does!)"
20,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,2,"Second in importance, only to the Brain, in our miraculous body is what is called the Gut. Gut is the shortened name of gastrointestinal tract which is the long tube that starts at the mouth and ends at the back passage. It includes the Liver, Gallbladder, Stomach, Pancreas, Large and small Intestine, the Appendix and Anus. The author claims that much of our health is determined by the Gut including Allergies, intolerances and reflux. The one interesting bit of information the author provides is that 130 or so years ago it was discovered that Tuberculosis was caused by a bacteria and since then bacteria has been associated as dangerous. However the fact is that more than 95% of the World‚Äôs bacteria are harmless to humans and many are beneficial. She advises making the aim of cleaning to reduce bacteria but not to eliminate it. You can achieve this by diluting such as washing fruits with water. This will wash away some bacteria but still leave a harmless amount. The other way to control bacteria is by keeping things dry. Bacteria cannot live on dry surfaces. What she offers to help your gut is to eat prebiotic foods. Prebiotic foods feed the good bacteria in your gut. The most nutrient dense prebiotic foods are Asparagus, Bananas, Onions, Garlic, Cabbage and Beans.I otherwise found this book a disappointment. It did not keep my interest throughout the book."
21,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,4,"Any human, healthy or not, would probably learn something of considerable help when reading this book- that's how many exact facts are here. Some of which you have probably wondered about (especially if you've had kids or changed diapers or had travel/motion sickness) or even have had side effects of constipation or dry mouth from travel or medicine. Tons of other excellent and pertinent details that doctors never truly discuss with their patients. She also has consistent humor and intellectual kindness in her giving you a ""heads up"" when the more messy or unpleasant aspects are minutely detailed. She knows what to tell you and how to impart it.This taught me about foods, about different peoples having different bacteria in predominance in the gut- and all kinds of issues with pace of digestion and antibiotic ""after effects"". Some of the information here will also give you some extra red flag help to determine illness or depletion or all kinds of other organs' issues that you would not think are at all connected in case and effect.The graphics were cute and so poignant!

Including some that I will never forget and with which I permanently scarred my husband by having him which YouTube videos on what they are. I'm looking at you Tonsil Stones (don't look up videos on this on YT unless you are not squeamish). This book really motivated me to add some more fermented foods into my diet, and to look at my gut as something I can improve to help all areas of my life. I love books like this where you walk away with a new wealth of knowledge. Plus since with grad school the only books I seem to finish recently are audiobooks while I drive to campus and then walk around it for several hours, the narrator of this book was fantastic! "

I especially liked learning that the appendix is not a useless appendage and that it is surrounded by immune tissue. The tonsils are also surrounded by immune tissue and both of these appendages play a role in our health. The information in this book was presented in an easy to understand way.

Our eyes have been opened, in part due to books like this.Gut is written with the layperson in mind. You don‚Äôt need to be a scientist. In fact, Enders is quite funny and even charming as she describes all things gut.For me, Gut was an easy listen. As I mentioned, parts of it may make you a little squeamish.

I learned so much about the digestive system (A SECOND BRAIN?!), am now totally enthralled by it, and am motivated to eat in a way that is kinder to my happy bacteria friends.I took away one star because sometimes Enders gestured towards some almost-pseudo-science, and I felt there were some questions that were either never addressed or that were glossed over. (What happens in the gut when we sleep?!) Maybe that last part is a bit harsh, seeing as how she couldn't possibly cover EVERYTHING in 260 pages. Nonetheless, there it is.

And get to know about things which are often embarrassing but nonetheless important and even miraculous.The best thing about the book is that it‚Äôs completely devoid of complex medical jargon and therein lies its success. It can become an effective companion for just about anyone. Though from the title it may seem like it‚Äôs a long boring rant about our digestive system, but it‚Äôs far from that. The author writes in a fluid and crisp language that‚Äôs easy to grasp and hilarious at the same time. Backed by strong scientific research and studies the book touches on a whole lot of interesting topics- from the friendly microbes in your stomach to the food you should or shouldn‚Äôt eat. And even on how to check on your poop once in a while to make sure they are of the right consistencey!This charming book succeeds in putting across some important information of how our body functions in an entertaining and informative manner. The content of the book is so important that it‚Äôs worth your time reading this. Coupled with lots of humorous illustrations by the author‚Äôs sister, ‚ÄúGut‚Äù is an important book that‚Äôs not too preachy and a book I am glad to have read."

Giulia Enders‚Äô writing and passion for the gut is charming, endearing and, at times, a little infectious (dad joke).The only reason the book didn‚Äôt score higher is that Enders occasionally over simplifies the topic (making it come off a little juvenile). Her heavy reliance on tangential anecdotes also starts to get a little tired towards the end of the book.

Not for the faint hearted or chronically hypo-chondriac reader and certainly to be read or digested in small doses.... There's a lot to take in! Nevertheless the most complacent and habit driven consumer should find some pause for thought in reading this excellent and often humorous distillation of current understanding about that most underrated but highly important organ... The gut. Hats off to Giulia Enders who has done a magnificent job in bringing all this complex and often confusing information to the lay reader. Giulia is driven by passion having self diagnosed her own terrifying descent into having open sores all over her body which would not respond to treatment as somehow linked to a course of antibiotics. Now an MD and gut specialist in her own right Giulia is determined to impart her hard won knowledge to as many people as possible. I urge you to read this book and pass it on to as many friends and family as you can. If just one of those people decides to breastfeed their baby, becomes less obsessive about cleaning so that ""good bacteria"" have a chance of recolonising, becomes healthier as a result of slightly modifying their diet, recovers from a long standing allergy or gut problem, or improves their resistance to infection so that they are no longer susceptible to a rampant microscopic invader it will have been well worth it. Personally, although the book is really well subdivided and has lots of great and often amusing illustrations I found the audio version, which Giulia herself narrates, easiest to digest."

And anyone who has ever been addicted to nicotine knows how well this works. What we need is, more books like ""Gut"". That a grown up can be a child again and discover the uncharted landscape of her body. To be amazed of how unbelievely complex and advanced system every living human is. Only then is there hope that people will respect themselves enough to eat well and treat their organs well. Because our organs are ours for a lfetime and how on earth could anything be more important than nurturing them so they'd cooperate with us until our final days. ""Gut"" points this out incredibly well. It gives interesting info without being boring or ""textbook like"". Accompanied with fun illustrations you soon discover that you've read half of the book in one sitting - a page-turner about poop, among other topics! It is about your gut but it is also a sharp reminder that everything is connected in our body and don't you dear think that you can eat shit and overwork and food supplements and sleeping it off once a week won't have any consequences. Our gut is very sensitive to stress and Enders has lots of scientific material to prove it. 4 starts only because in the last chapter Enders packed too much info too densley and the ""fun factor"" of reading was therefore a bit diminished.

‚ÄúAround 90% of the serotonin (one of the hormones of ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù) in our body is produced in the gut.‚Äù
No wonder why there is a proverb ‚ÄúLoves goes through the stomach‚Äù. We just love to eat, at least I do. :D And that is the second reason I chose to read this book. The book is written very simply, yet very informative. I love the way Giulia Enders talks about the topic; there is always something funny and intriguing. I enjoyed the scientific parts as well. It‚Äôs easy to grasp. I also fancy her enthusiasm on the topic. Not to mention the illustrations drawn by her sister Jill. So amusing.Now, I‚Äôm very familiar with my gut flora, and I‚Äôm super happy about it. More serotonin, yay! :)Also, as a matter of fact, I want to share with you what was the title of the Bulgarian translation of the book. Literary, it was ""A gut with charm"". I love this translation because it's intact with the book itself and it makes it even more appealing and at the same time preparing the reader for the style in which it's written. Cute!P.S. If you wonder what was the reason I chose to read this book, then we have at least two things in common - we both have a gut and we are both curious. :)P.P.S I plan to write a more resourceful review containing everything I learnt from the book.

Her book was the same. She makes the digestive track fascinating!! We have a universe of microbes and bacteria within us - many with ‚Äúminds‚Äù of their own. Our gut influences what we eat, what we crave, and how much weight we hold on to. I found it interesting that humans give so much credit to the brain, but it is the gut that is in the thick of things. The gut has a remarkable system of nerves to gather information for the brain. It has a huge surface area that makes it the body‚Äòs largest sensory organ. Everything else pales by comparison. The gut is a huge matrix sensing our inner life and workings. I have never thought about all the figures of speech attached to the gut and our digestive organs. We can be ‚Äúscared shitless‚Äù or ‚Äúshitting ourselves‚Äù with fear. If we don‚Äôt complete a job we need to ‚Äúget our ass in gear.‚Äù We ‚Äúswallow our disappointment‚Äù and need time to ‚Äúdigest‚Äù a defeat. A nasty comment leaves a ‚Äúbad taste in our mouth‚Äù and when we fall in love we get ‚Äúbutterflies in our stomach‚Äù.

Our personalities, and the roles bacteria play, some of which can trick us into eating unhealthy foods. The book provides an evidence-based approach to demonstrate how the gut flora influence biology, physiology, personality, and inheritable traits in offspring. Taking a light hearted approach, the books engaging writing style, funny comments and illustrations guide us through awkward questions from simple as ""how does pooping work"", through common problems like allergies reflux, vomiting, constipation, etc. Finally, the book ending with the influence of gut bacteria on our minds and emotional states.

And the writing style was light (which I thought was nice for the general public) however there were some passages which were a little too jokey, if that makes sense, without adding a huge amount to comprehension. Not a huge deal, though I just felt the book would be stronger if the tone were shifted a bit. It won't go too far into helping you understand particular digestive issues or what you should do about them, but will give you information to understand how the got works which can help you in further reading and understanding, etc."

There were also many facts that I had no idea about and things I've only heard about and vaguely knew what they meant.

It's written in a style that really doesn't appeal to me though, and as a result of the wordy style, it is also a bit too long. I'm not sure if it's somewhat poorly translated as well, or if the original is at fault, because I found many sentences hard to follow (as they defied standard Swedish sentence structure and logic unnecessarily, which requires you to read them twice to figure out what's what in them) and some explanations were pretty weird and vague, probably due to extreme simplification. The translated title in Swedish/Norwegian really beats the original though."

There are still many things we don't know about the relationship between the gut and lifestyle diseases like heart disease and diabetes, but there are lots of research going on right now in this field.

It is very informative if you don't have a background in medicine or microbiology (or biology in general), and want to know more about your gut.

So much that early this year after having a dream about it I immediately went and ordered it from Amazon. It didn't disappoint one single bit. In fact it exceeded expectations because I had my serious brain activated and ready to take in complicated words to describe complicated processes but I actually ended up laughing! The author is just amazing at explaining scientific concepts and connecting details while utilizing humor and pop culture. Would you imagine a book that talks about poop also talking about ballerinas, giving you a sauerkraut recipe, describing motivated swimming mice vs apathetic ones, and the importance of keeping your virgin olive oil cool? I bet not. But she does so and is even able to connect them. A funny and educational book that will get you thinking more deeply about your eating habits, your moods and your (in) ability to focus. Highly recommended."

Gut is a tour of your innards, of the surprisingly clean but bustling twists and turns of the digestive system. ""Wait a second,"" say you, ""I've had this tour before. Mary Roach did it in Gulp!"". Well, yes, and she did take you the entire way -- from the mouth right out the other end, none the worse for the wear. Gut is different, however. The author is a touch more serious, for one thing; while never lacking in humor, she doesn't provide a constant effusion of fart and poop jokes. Enders provides more of a thoughtful study of how the gut impacts us, particularly in our microbiome. This is a mix of Roach's Gulp and I Contain Multitudes: a study of our intestinal habitat and the fauna thereof. I bought this primarily because I was interested in the ways our gut can influence our psychology. I've heard reports of there being neural cells active within the gut, and while there is a chapter on the ""vagus nerve"", it wasn't as extensive as I hoped. The author conveys the impression that the nerve collects and conveys feelings of general un-ease and distress within the body, providing the brain with its first reports of problems within. More extensive are the chapters on the bacteria within us -- how they change depending on our diet, how they can contribute to our health or diminish it , that sort of thing. This ground was covered more extensively in 10% Human and I Contain Multtidues, but a review of this subject is perfect in a book on the gut: 90% of our bacteria live there, after all. If you're interested in the digestive system -- and who isn't, really? -- Gut is a quick, fun read that takes its reader more seriously than Gulp, and includes more concrete information from an actual M.D. Related

Teachers like that can take a boring subject and bring it to life. That's what this book does for biology, specifically the human digestive system. The author is just brimming with enthusiasm and wit, and it's infectious. If you think learning about the science of digestion is a yawn fest, you're right, but this book will make it as engaging and interesting as it's possible for such a subject to be. When I still found myself bored with this book, it was only because the subject matter, not the writing.Occasionally, I wondered about the legitimacy of the research supporting the information in this book. Just a wee bit, it's not like my pseudoscience bullshit alarm bells were ringing. She makes fascinating, exciting claims, which might feel surprising because 1) some of the findings are very new and not yet well known, and 2) the life of our gut is a lot more exciting than most of us think. It almost feels magical sometimes. But she was honest about how much (or little) research support there is for certain discoveries. For example, she talks about probiotics and the theory behind them, but said point blank that the supporting research just isn't there yet. Research takes a lot of time and money. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try any new, harmless treatment before the verdict is completely in, as long as we are clear about how unproven they are. What bothers me is wild claims used to sell expensive placebos, and that's definitely not what this book is about.Overall, I fairly enjoyed the book. I didn't learn much that I found personally useful, but it was interesting. I've got this whole orchestra playing in my body, day and night. It was fun to meet some of the players."

Enders advises readers on everything from cleanliness (wring out kitchen sponges; bacteria love them because they‚Äôre warm and damp, but drying can keep them somewhat cleaner) to diet (cold cooked rice, potato salad, asparagus, leeks, garlic and onions are all nutritious offerings for the good bacteria in our digestive system) to combating nausea (ginger has proven effects, as does the acupuncture point P6). But I have to admit that I didn‚Äôt enjoy reading this as much as I expected based on the reviews. Maybe because this just isn‚Äôt my favorite subject, and I read it from start to finish, pushing through sections such as the one on laxatives that didn‚Äôt particularly interest me in order to reach the more interesting material, like the influence of the gut on the brain. Maybe because I‚Äôm used to books with an overarching thesis to pull it all together, where this felt more like a series of disparate topics and a lot of (often intriguing or useful) factoids than a coherent whole. Maybe because so many topics are breezed through so quickly, often in metaphorical language that can help readers picture what‚Äôs going on, but that doesn‚Äôt provide a full understanding.

The take home message is that our gut is complicated and a unique mix of microbes, good and bad. "

I loved the humor in it, and the cute little drawings by miss Enders' sister, and several times I was laughing out loud. Due to my education I knew a lot about the intestines already, however several facts in this book were new to me. The chapter about bacteria I found especially intriguing. I was previously unaware of the extent of our dependence of the bacteria living inside of us. Miss Enders brings forth many interesting theories about the different kind of bacteria we host, and how they are able to affect us. Very much recommended for laypeople interested in medical science. "
69,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1356469-fiona,4,"Gut is written in the form of a nice little bed-time story complete with cute little illustrations drawn by the author's sister. It takes you on an adventure down through your mouth, into your stomach and then out the other end. Enders is full of useful bits of advice - how to feed your friendly gut bacteria to how to sit on the toilet.Basically it is a book that deals with poo, vomit, your liver and bacteria but it is written so nicely it won't put you off your lunch time salad. Which, hopefully you have washed before consuming."
70,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7811714-karole,2,"Good information but I got fed up with the writing style very quickly. Too many analogies that just don't work or maybe it's just that they are overused. I wish the writing style had matched the quality of the information, in which case it would have been a more useful book. There was simply far too much filler prose that didn't enhance the point the author was trying to make and by the end of the book I felt patronized with childish explanations and analogies. Too bad as I believe the information is very important and should be more widely understood. "

Written by a young medical doctor and cartoon-illustrated by her sister, Enders gives you a thorough education about your digestive system. If you have ever had a gastro issue of any kind [food intolerances, abdominal cramping, constipation, etc.], you will find answers, remedies and comic relief in these pages. This in not a medical text but more of an owner's guide with information about each part of the digestive tract and the effects of medication, bacteria and various foods on your gut flora. "
72,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50913511-robin,1,I couldn't decide between one or two stars for this book. For a book with such a great back cover description (two stars!) it was a surprisingly tedious and disjointed read (one star). It read like she threw it together during an all nighter. It wasn't successful at being witty or smart or even providing any cutting edge information. The illustrations were ridiculous and unnecessary. I really think she needed a great editor- maybe that would've helped...

Learn about your insides!___The gut accounts for two-thirds of our immune system, extracts energy from all our varied food, and produces more than 20 unique hormones. Some scientists think studying the link between the gut and the brain offers at least at much promise as stem cell research.To squat on a sitting toilet, put your feet on a low footrest and incline your upper body forward slightly.Our saliva is basically filtered blood. It also contains a painkiller stronger than morphine (opiorphin). That's why after a meal your sore throat often feels better.Tonsils are a training camp for our immune cells below the age of seven. Our esophagus is connected to the side of our stomach so the pressure from our abdominal muscles don't apply pressure directly onto it. If it wasn't we might end up vomiting after laughing.The stomach's asymmetrical shape allows quickly digestible things and liquids to be shunted straight to the small intestine, while protein can hang around longer to be digested at the side.Any fat we eat goes through the lymph system straight to our heart. That is why our blood vessels can get clogged up by excessive fatty food.There are many allergies to fatty food because they end up in the lymphatic system, where they are recognised as foreign bodies and trigger an immune response. This applies to milk, eggs, and peanut allergies. Almost no one is allergic to greasy bacon, because we are made of meat and have few problems digesting it.The rumbling belly comes from the small intestine, not the stomach as commonly believed. They don't rumble when we're hungry, but when there is a long enough break between meals to finally get some cleaning done.An empty stomach is no defense against vomiting, since the small intestine can expel its contents as well.The mouth begins producing saliva in great quantities once the vomiting process has begun, to protect our teeth from acidic gastric juice.One of the main purposes of movement is to shift us to a healthier equilibrium. Gut bacteria density increases the further down one goes. Gut bacteria are responsible for blood groups. Colonisation resistance: the majority of the microbes in our gut protect us simply by occupying spaces that would otherwise be free for harmful bacteria to colonise. Cows get their protein from bacteria in their gut that feed on complex plant carbohydrates, and eventually end up getting digested.The tradition of a weekly bath only really took hold in the 1950s. The entire family would bath one after another in the same bathtub.Sweetness is in itself not unhealthy, we simply eat only the most unhealthy kind of sweetness.Kitchen sponges should only be used for cleaning the worst of the dirt off. Using them to dry plates is like licking them clean."
89,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6390337-catherine-oughtibridge,4,"This book was bought for me, as a gift. Under my own impulse, I would have left it on the bookshop shelf after looking with mild amusement at the rather good doodle style illustrations that do an excellent job of explaining the science. Giulia Enders‚Äô sister Jill Enders is the one to thank for these. However, the book ended up on my bookshelf.Six months later, in search of something a bit different and reasonably light to read, I picked it up.I consider myself more interested in the brain, how I think and feel and how I can change all this to make me a happier, more content, likable human being. I prefer to think of things in terms of psychology than biology. Probably due to an unnecessary grudge against my school biology teachers. Giulia Enders however introduces the gut in a manner that would have been acceptable to both me and my biology teacher when I was fifteen. Apparently, my stomach is really much higher in my body than I imagined. And my small intestine really does agree that a siesta ‚Äì or at least a bit of relaxation ‚Äì is a good idea after lunch. Enders also points out what I feel I should have recognised as the obvious: we feel not solely with the brain in some mystical fashion, but because it keeps us alive.‚ÄúAnyone who suffers from anxiety or depression should remember that an unhappy gut can be the cause of an unhappy mind. Sometimes, the gut has a perfect right to be unhappy, if it is dealing with an undetected food intolerance, for example. We should not always blame depression on the brain or on our life circumstances ‚Äì there is much more to us than that.‚ÄùThere was also a chapter on the cause of various intolerances and some fascinating (and sometimes icky) detail on all the living creatures ‚Äì bacteria, yeasts, fungi, worms ‚Äì that you may or not want living in your body.It‚Äôs a super easy to read book. The bit on bacteria goes on a while, and you might lose focus at this point, but the pictures and the sometimes unexpected but clear explanations of how we work make it worth reading and easy to digest. "
90,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526638-claudia-turner,2,"Enders has a lot of good information here about gut flora, the microbiome and just basic facts about the gut, which you can find with any research at any university library. She also says our bodies are made of meat so that‚Äôs why meat is easy to absorb (by this logic gorillas, elephants and giraffes should all start eating a bunch of meat too!) and soon after this talking about fructose intolerance as if high fructose corn syrup is the same as fruit. Any doctor or scientist who actually studies nutrition (without the influence of the meat and dairy industries) and viable research has talked about how hard meat and animal protein are on the body, and how important fiber and fruit, lots and lots of whole foods plant based non-processed food, legumes and fruits are for reversing disease, balancing body alkalinity, developing the microbiome and general health. So yes the gut and brain are connected. We‚Äôve known this for awhile. But here is another PhD lost in her nutritional advice and yet a bestseller. Between her and Atkins and the plague of obese and perpetually sick and dieting western societies I am just over here slapping my forehead. Please read How Not To Die, Cheese Trap, the China Study. Literally anything by a scientist who has done the research. Enders begins the book talking about the scientists and academics behind closed doors discussing research they never share. Apparently she is not one of them..."
91,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7364394-nick,2,"I think I read this book and wanted it to give me things that it was never offering. I wanted a book thoroughly exploring the gut-brain connection. Specifically exploring the link to mental illnesses. I also wanted an outline of a diet that is gut friendly, maybe even delving into the food industry.The book didn‚Äôt promise that. It promised an exploration of the gut, a new frontier of research, providing a comprehensive overview of the multitude of ways the previously ignored gut is very important in our lives. It touched briefly on my specific interest points, but only for a page or two.Perhaps my rating is not fair then. But I think even if I had had a less specific interest in mind, the infancy of research with the gut means I wouldn‚Äôt have taken anything particularly tangible away from this book, other than the gut seems very important and it needs more research."
92,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76096526-vera,4,"Interesting and curious, but I‚Äôve would preferred clearer guidelines. For me personally the second part of the book where the author plunges into different types of bacteria living in our gut was a bit boring and maybe too scientific, while the first and third parts with practical advice such as how you really should clean the apartment or why olive oil is very healthy, but you shouldn‚Äôt fry with it, were quite enjoyable. All in all after all the hype about the book I was expecting more from it (like better structure and being more entertaining), but I still liked it and got some useful tips and better understanding of my body which is never a bad thing :)"
93,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178078-kevin-fanning,4,"Picked this up because I was curious if probiotics are a real thing or a yogurt & kombucha marketing concept. (The answer here is they are real but just dumping random probiotics into your system because ""gut health!"" is a marketing concept.) I also really liked the sections on v*miting and c*nstipation! Very interesting! Towards the end the book talks a lot about the bacteria of our environment, and it's intended to remind us that some bacteria is good, and bleaching and washing everything all the time isn't good for us in the long run. BUT all I came away with is how everything is covered in bacteria all the time and my next visit to a bathroom involved a mild freakout. Good book though. "
94,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1638380-bistra-ivanova,3,"A sweet and funnily written book with tons of info on guts. The author, a young German doctor, is fascinated with their complex and intelligent nature and is a little bit unhappy with their unpopularity and the fact they're so underresearched. A huge amount of our serotonin, or happiness hormone is produced there. They are of course very important for digestion, health, food cravings, etc. They don't like gluten, even if in small quantities is not super harmful. My colon hypnotherapist gave me the book and I enjoyed it. However, I expected a little bit more practical advice and not so many biological details - at some point, that became a little boring (angel face). "

The book is a primer to your knowledge about the happenings inside your own body. Written in lucid English and packed with humor the book breezes through while touching upon so many things we experience everyday inside our gut. It reads like a book of Fiction a explains biology like never before. I have picked up so many does and don't from this book which will go a long way in living a healthy lifestyle. It opens us to experience the circus inside us and it is so much fun to experience the dance every single moment we live. Go for it. "

The what , how and why of our gut , the importance of both good and bad bacteria and working of our body's immune system. everything is covered.

102,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21813363-olosta,3,"2.5* barely, for the part about gut bacteria, which was at least interesting.Not gonna lie, having heard so many accolades about this book I was disappointed. Perhaps because I have read it shortly after the superbly written, witty The Body of Bill Bryson's, but also because probably I was not the right target audience of this book. Even with my (admittedly secondhand) minimal medical knowledge, I found very little information in there I didn't know before. But my beef is mostly with the writing: the style is infantile, incoherent, with forced metaphors that become tedious very quickly. Similarly, some of the attempted humour was funny, but most of the jokes were forced and at times embarassing.Just when the passage broaches an interesting subject, it veers off into a new topic, only to return, quite confusingly, to the previous topic for another couple of sentences - and then start a new subject right away. Frustrating? Absolutely.With this book, I'm starting to understand the purpose of ghost writers - please, employ tpeople who can actually write, if you can afford them. Otherwise the result will be this mess of a book that had the potential to become a brilliant story, but sadly, didn't fulfill its promise."
103,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3269254-jake,4,"it should always go without saying that a non-fiction/science text for the general reader should be interesting and informative, but it's always nice to be clear. this book is very interesting and informative.but the really great thing about this book is how charming it is. the charm of the darm!as someone who has had gut problems in the past and more recently, it was nice to not only arm myself with the facts and knowledge about what's really going on inside, and things you can do about it, but to read something with such positivity and delight and infectious enthusiasm. not only that, but it unashamedly is written to remove taboos about the gut and how we talk about it (which i am 100% all for - we're not in school anymore, let's be adults and not be embarrassed by tummy sounds please?). this positivity and frankness will be refreshing and beneficial for anyone who has found themselves despairing at their own intestines and felt uncomfortable about it in the workplace or socially. this book is lovely and enders is clearly not only very intelligent but so wholesome and skilled in making the complex and taboo something accessible and funny. her sister's illustrations are beyond cute."
104,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67034748-steven-deobald,4,"A brilliant book which deserves both a space in every middle-school Biology (or Health) classroom and every adult's bookshelf. Enders seamlessly weaves together a fun story, complete with cute illustrations, about the journey of food through our entire system. Along the way, she touches on contemporary scientific revelations about our microbiome and reveals the structures and behaviours of our innards in colourful detail reminiscent of no other book I've read. While she's making our inner biology a fun topic for dinner parties, she periodically drops in some reminders backed by unconventional reasoning.Every page evoked a response from me. Sometimes she left me craving broccoli or fresh, homemade yogurt. Sometimes she'd leave me dumbfounded by collecting adjacent scientific research into a neat pile that defends what many of us know intuitively about our overall health based on the foods we eat. And sometimes she'd refresh the most basic behaviours of civilized society with new (or forgotten) information: brush your teeth, eat your veggies, talk to your doctor, get enough exercise and sleep every day.Based on the reviews, I had expected Gut to be a fun read. I hadn't expected it to make me so excited about improving my own health. It doesn't hurt that Enders write with so much excitement and enthusiasm for her field.The writing does lag a little in places and it would be hard for this book to break into 5-star territory for me. My one HUGE gripe, however, is that her references aren't cited! Uggghhh. Just because a book is intended for a casual audience does not make it okay to drop a comment like ""five recent studies have shown"" into the book without explicitly referencing all five of those studies. I sincerely hope she adds endnotes in a future edition."
105,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,4,"Gut was a really charming and interesting book. I say ""charming"" because of passages like this one:Japanese researchers fed volunteers luminous substances and X-rayed them while they were doing their business in various positions. They found out two interesting things. First, squatting does indeed lead to a nice, straight intestinal tract, allowing for a direct, easy exit. Second, some people are nice enough to let researchers feed them luminous substances and X-ray them while they have a bowel movement, all in the name of science. Both findings are pretty impressive, I think.I say ""interesting"" because it touched on topics I find interesting and did so in convincing, non-sensational ways. For example: embodied cognition, citing experiments where you can improve mice resilience by feeding them probiotics (I'm paraphrasing) and prove that it's a neural impact on the brain because if you cut the vagus nerve (running from the gut to the brain) then the positive impact of the happy gut biome on, say, memory or stress tests goes away.I always like science books that go against the grain. Not to be provocative just for the sake of provocation (and hopefully: book sales) but out of a genuine interest that hasn't been tamed and domesticated the way science--as a social institution--so often does. We need our honest iconoclasts, and this is a great example of one."
106,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11565771-christina-tucker,5,"This book takes the concept of ""you are what you eat"" to a whole new level. It should be standard in any high school health education curriculum. I'm sad that it took me 35 years to learn what eating healthy was really all about. And this book has shed even more light on that idea. Packed with evidence for what she shares, we ought to think twice about Homo sapiens as the dominant species on this planet. Our entire existence is highly influenced by beings that most don't even realize are there and outnumber us in ways the mind cannot fathom. She writes in a way that most should be able to understand, despite the complex scientific names and terminology. I listened to this on audiobook and it was well performed by a lady with a lovely voice. A must ""read"" for all!"
107,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870255-stephen,4,"While it is sophisticated and cultured to talk about the food that goes into one's mouth, it is uncouth to talk about what happens to it from there. Giulia Enders, a German candidate for a doctorate in gastroenterology, has written an informative and highly readable book which does just that. She wrote her book in German -- ""Darm mit Charme. Alles √ºber ein untersch√§tztes Organ‚Äù; the English translation by David Shaw does an outstanding job of capturing the humor of the original. Assisted by silly cartoons drawn by her older sister Jill, she takes the reader on a tour of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. She details what happens to food and drink as it passes through each part of the system. She then discusses the population of microbes which occupy the locales along the way: the ones that are helpful and the ones that cause illness. There follows an appreciation of what healthy gut flora do for humans, perhaps influencing even mental state and behaviour. The book concludes with recommendations of how to keep the micro-denizens of the bowel happy and healthy. This would be the perfect book to keep next to the toilet in the guest bathroom were it not for Enders' recommendation that people squat, poop and leave rather than sit at length on the commode while reading. "
108,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25112936-ishma,3,"I was on the fence about buying this book, because I didn't think I'd need to read an entire book about the digestive system. The narrative combines child-like enthusiasm with knowledge of a doctor, and the story is told with enthusiasm. This book is about the gut, so if you're squeamish about poop or uncomfortable with experiments performed on mice, you might want to steer clear, as the book does cover such case studies. The book is conversational, funny, explains medical terminology, and the chapters flow in a logical fashion. Another thing that I really liked was that the book is full of cute illustrations created by the author's sister that demonstrate what she's talking about. Some of them had me chuckling - pleasant break from information overload. I learnt a bunch of new things, besides refreshing and solidifying information that I was already aware of. I'd recommend it, because we all have a gut, whether it works properly or not, and it's good to know how to maintain it. The only thing I found troublesome what that she recommends solutions to medical problems here and there. If you're looking for solutions to a persistent problem, just see a doctor instead of self-diagnosing."
109,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45364364-kelvin,3,"Funny at times with incredibly cute personifications of the various components of the digestive system and packed with information but at times the writing feels like a middle schooler‚Äôs summary of a science fair project. If that‚Äôs oddly specific, let me explain. I like to read about stories that illustrate the author‚Äôs point woven between explanations (otherwise I would have gone straight to the research manuscripts) and this book felt a bit too much like reading a wikipedia page, albeit a charming wikipedia page. However, I think she took a very good balance between unnecessarily hyping fresh theories and being stuck in the past. Gut makes quite a few arguments about the importance of the digestive system to our health from its interaction with the immune system and the brain and the research that has started to uncover the effect of disturbances of gut equilibrium has effects reaching farther than the mouth to rectum tube. If you can tolerate moments of textbook-ish writing and if you‚Äôre looking for a fresh take on the digestive system and insight into the budding importance of microbiology, then this actually quite a fantastic book."

Enders shares Roach's ability for writing very funny stories about deeply technical topics. Gut goes a little deeper into reeling off science facts at the expense of the smooth flow that Roach manages in her books, but I love both styles.My understanding of the tonsils has massively increased from its previous state of close to non-existent. We have more tonsils than the Palatine tonsils you can easily see. Who knew? We‚Äôre born with Waldeyer's tonsillar ring. Not as long as Wagner‚Äôs Ring, but it still constitutes more lymphatic tissue than I would have thought. And if you think the picture of surgically removed tonsils on the Wikipedia page is gross, don‚Äôt watch any YouTube videos on removing tonsil stones (tonsilloliths).The sections covering our microbiota and microbiome were particularly interesting after reviewing my ubiome.com results from a DNA sequencing of marker genes from the bacteria in my own gut. I‚Äôve done the SmartGut test four times. I need to work on boosting my Akkermansia muciniphila and Bifidobacterium, but I‚Äôm rocking the Lactobacillus."

Did it inspire me to be more mindful of my body? YES!I am so surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. I am not a science-y person. I am fascinated by aspects of our bodies and the world, sure, but I would never have willfully picked up a medical book to read in my free time. In fact I can't recall a time I ever read non-fiction for fun outside of specific historical books. I guarantee I would never have read it if I hadn't received a free copy of the audiobook, and I am very thankful to Audible Australia's Editor's Extra program for putting this book on my radar.I appreciated the descriptive analogies where the author imbued various parts of the body with hilarious human traits. It not only lightened the load of what could have been heavy reading, it also provided some excellent comic relief. I found a lot of the content very useful even just to better understand my body and appreciate the complexity of what goes on in there every moment of every day. I now feel better equipped to have discussions with my Doctor and I have a new found appreciation for my gut."

Reading this book ought to be mandatory, but then, not all things can be mandatory - there'd be no time for fun.But seriously - even if you know a lot about the gut and how it works, this will probably teach you more. I've dealt with IBS for years now and done my share of research. I probably knew 50-70% of what she wrote before, but the new information was very interesting, and anyway, she hammred in and rehashed some of the old knowledge for my benefit.The reason for the four stars is this: sometimes her analogues get very silly. Now, I'm a fan of silly and entertaining non-fiction that is also truthful and passes on knowledge ... but sometimes it went a bit overboard, like the bacteria with the mexican hats. (Readers will surely remember this - imo - cringeworthy explanation of how the immune system deals with bacteria.In any case! It's a short book and easily read. So please get to it.

All-in-all I thought it was fairly well written and there's a lot of interesting facts and stats that I wasn't aware of. However, I do have a few qualms with the book. A lot of the metaphors used I found to be quite patronising. I also have a few conerns of how she handled certain chapters - especially on allergies, as she made it seem that pretty much everyone will be susceptible to allergies. Also I didn't feel she tackled coeliac disease very efficiently, especially as the disease causes flattening of the villi which is repaired only by a gluten-free diet. I felt this was a pretty big thing to leave out!However, I did enjoy the book and found a quick and light read with a good insight into our gut microbiome and the news ventures into research that are currently being conducted in this area.

I love learning about the sciences, but honestly do not enjoy reading scientific journals. This book, while definitely written for the casual reader, contained a lot of exciting and intriguing facts. And as another reviewer mentioned, the author‚Äôs enthusiasm is contagious.Anyone who‚Äôs just starting to get interested microbiology or gastroenterology would enjoy this book, as well as people interested in other disciplines such as psychology. It‚Äôs interesting from a behavioral psychology point of view because the book talks about how bacteria has the power to change a person‚Äôs behavior, even increase risky behaviors that we‚Äôre normally biologically programmed to avoid. It also contains useful information that applies to everyday life, like how to properly use laxatives and how to prevent salmonella contamination. It also had information on Celiac disease, which I found interesting because I know people who suffer from it.It‚Äôs definitely a book I‚Äôd recommend and go back to."

Guilia Enders is adorable enthusiastic about bacteria and gut health and her words are fun to read and (mostly) easy to understand. Her sister‚Äôs fun illustrations were a high point too. It definitely got more challenging science-wise as the book wore on - I got the gist, but it perhaps could have been clearer in some places. This book is definitely going to change my life though - I‚Äôm now going to be much more careful washing veggies, choosing what to eat, and keeping kitchen cloths as clean as possible! As someone who‚Äôs had depression and anxiety problems over the years, this was a really interesting read as it connects mental health to gut health VERY convincingly. I‚Äôd recommend to anyone with similar experiences whether you‚Äôre into science or not - you never know, the source of your problems may not be brain chemistry but gut biology. One other thing to say is that this book contains mention of suicide and self harm, particularly on pages 196-202, with no warning so be aware of that if it might affect you.3.5 stars for me!"

I am always skeptical when I read health books; I feel like there is always an agenda being shoved down my throat or I just sense a lot of BS. This book didn't feel like that at all, which I really appreciated because I was just genuinely interested in the role the gut plays in our bodies. So for those reasons I will give 4 stars. This is a book I could read again, more in depth. Top take aways:-Our gut is the largest organ in our bodies. -Our gut is very complex. -There are good and bad bacteria that reside in our ""gut flora"". -The gut sends signals to our brains through a large nerve. -When our gut flora is unbalanced (meaning we do not have enough good bacteria), inflammation happens. -Inflammation can affect our mental health. -Probiotics are good bacteria, and prebiotics are foods that help probiotics thrive. -Sugar binds to tryptophan; when we intake too much sugar, we lose tryptophan. This is negative because trytophan helps in producing serotonin."

Overall, not a bad book, but its contents could be easily transformed into a series of 4-5 short articles containing more information than Ender's work."

What differentiates ""Gut"" from other books of Popular Science/Health genre is the light humor, funny analogies and silly banter that the author never forgets to sprinkle throughout the text, without compromising on imparting evidence-based facts, thorough analyses of multiple research on the gut system and clear-cut advices to keep the gut healthy- which is the primary aim of the book.The chapter where the author delves deep into the gut-brain connection, convincing the reader that the gut has a brain of its own, was the most informative as well as indulging for me. The chapter on Gut flora is another part that will leave you amused.

An incredibly well written informative book on just how important our guts are for our mental state, health, immune system and indeed the part of the body that has the most neurons after the brain. One of our primary interfaces with our environment: how tasty it is. :) Enders is passionate about this subject having had serious health issues that cleared up once she understood the role of gut bacteria in our health: the good bacteria. This is not a self help book but a science book but with the knowledge gained from reading it most people will be able to take action to improve their health.

Giulia Enders seems like a bright, promising student of medicine, and I'd be happy to read any of her future books once she establishes herself in the academia. I am also very curious to compare this book to Mary Roach's Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal. Great intro into the subject, explained in layman's terms.

A big focus is put on the role of the intestinal bacterial flora and several useful dietetic suggestions are offered. Also one can find detailed elaborations on some significant participants of human's microbiota, e.g. helicobacter pylori and toxoplasma gondii.What might be surprising (and at times annoying is the writing style) - it seems that the author really liked to be ""cool"" throughout the piece - not necessarily something expected or "

I think when humour is injected into a traditionally non-humourous subject, it can either help or hinder. It can either make the subject more interesting or it can be jarring for the reader. In this case, the author hit the right amount and type of humour. She also explained the topic and the various sub topics in a way the lay person could understand them, without making it feel as if she were dumbing things down.The gut is an area that I'm finding increasingly interesting in regards to health, including mental health. It has been described as being a second brain, and having read this book, I can understand why. The parts about gut flora were especially thought provoking. "

I was interested at first sight, due to my unanswered questions about how lactose intolerance works - and had very high hopes for this book.The first half is an engaging, fast and exciting read. The second half took me forever to get through. Although it's informative, the second half is filled with names of bacteria, latin names, and acronyms. As someone without a background in biology, it felt more like reading a textbook. Even though Enders tries to throw in personal anecdotes, it fails to make the second half a faster, more cohesive read.Overall, an informative read.

Cleanliness in the gut is something akin to cleanliness in a forest. The goal is to have the beneficial plants in a healthy equilibrium, not a pristine environment. We can help the forest along by sowing seeds and hoping new plants will take root. Careful consideration must be taken if there are pests, not spray pesticide indiscriminately all over the place. This is what is happening with the overuse of antibiotics and disinfectants - killing both bad and good bacteria in our gut and in our environment. Despite being ""cleaner,"" the rates of allergies and autoimmune diseases are increasing. There is a lot of information to digest (pun intended) and would probably benefit from a second reading."

Many times I thought of people I know and wondered if they had been harbouring undiagnosed gut conditions which may otherwise have been dismissed as stress, psychosomatic or IBS as a catch all for 'probably your gut' - which, it turns out, is an enormously complex organ. I have to admit that as a lapsed scientist there was quite a lot to take in which might have been more easily absorbed (forgive the pun) if supported by diagrams or some more anecdotes. By the time we got to the section on bacteria I was a bit lost, overwhelmed by all the names as much as anything. It deserved a more careful listen, but I wasn't quite facinated enough to re-listen.

A few contestable scientific facts aside, the importance of our gut in our health cannot be overemphasized, and this book makes knowledge on this subject quite accessible to everyone.

Also interesting was the detailed coverage of the gut bacteria and how they contribute to our moods, food cravings and overall health.The writing is a tad amateurish (and so were some of the illustrations) but that does not lessen the joy of this brilliant book.

Quite educational to be hornest, but to me it was too much. I like learning new things, and next time I'll read it, I will have another starting point.

The style is light and very readable (or listenable) but tbh I didn't really find it ""cheeky"" or funny, as the blurb keeps saying. Maybe it's lost in translation (the book is originally written in German), and there are a few too many attempts to appeal to toilet humour or the tabooness of poo. I really think that was out of place in the book - after all, we're reading a scientific treatment, albeit one aimed at the general public. Once you're already in taboo land, I don't think you need to keep referencing it. After all, the fascination of how things really work is well made.The only thing that really peeved me about this book was the author's blanket description of c-sections as ""convenient"". No woman who's ever had one forced on her unwanted, put up with the army of people in the room, had her first moments with her child stolen from her by people she doesn't know, or recovered from the major surgery (not to mention the mental trauma) while managing a newborn would ever describe it as ""convenient"". I'm so sick to death of the public conversation about c-sections being about women somehow getting out of hard work and everyone judging them for it. For a book written by an aspiring doctor, this description done only to make a minor comparison in this work was extremely disappointing. It was the last place I thought I'd read a judge-y comment like that. You might think this is a small thing, but doctors glibly think many things are small when they never bother to ask their patients what matters to them. I think this was a cheap shot that shouldn't have been there. "

There is a lot going on down there that they didn't teach us in health class or biology. Not overwhelming to read for someone with no science background, but may be a little redundant for people who already have an established concept of the digestive system. Thoroughly enjoyed the book and now I know how poop works! Also, the illustrations were fun :)"
160,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2164930-bucket,4,"There was actually quite a bit here that I didn't know -- about how sphincters work, about the gut-brain connection, about the components of our intestines, and about the components of poop. I was mostly fascinated and the book very rarely plodded.I think the German-ness of the author added to the fun of this read. Some of her humor and way of thinking were very different from how an American's would be, and this was refreshing."

I totally recommend if you're suffering from stress, pain, constipation, depression or even if you want to learn more about how the gut and bacterias work in our body.

163,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65613190-charlie-gorichanaz,3,"Lots of great information, some of which I will act upon. I usually cook eggs and vegetables in olive oil, figuring it is healthier, but now I know delicate oils are less stable under heat and tend to capture free radicals from the air, possibly damaging my cells later.

It's accessible, lighthearted, and educational, and I learned a lot about what goes on inside our stomachs and digestive systems. The drawings by the author's sister are whimsical and well suited to the text. It's a very good translation--the author's tone comes through very well and it avoids the stilted quality can plague bad translations. If you are interested in the human body but don't have a lot of background in the topic, and you don't need your medical reading to take itself too seriously, this would be a good book."

It seems like it wouldn't be something interesting, really who wants to read about digestion for fun? But I swear to god it is fun. A lot of the reviews use the word ""charming"" for this book, and while that seems weird it's pretty good. Even the parts about different kinds of poop are interesting haha. And there was lots of cool information about how much the gut influences the mind and emotions. What a weird thing to not be common knowledge, huh? Anyway, super cool book, anyone would like it."

How does how you are born influence your immune system? There is so much to learn. This book is a good place to start."

222,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21505448-heather,0,Is this a bad book? No. But as a Registered Dietitian with plenty of knowledge about the GI tract I'm definitely not the target audience. If you have little knowledge about the GI tract and enjoy flowery descriptions and quips every other sentence to grab your attention then this might be an enjoyable book for you to learn more. Maybe it got better but I'm gonna go ahead and quit at 20%. 
223,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6471303-olena,4,Informative and funny book. The author has a lot of enthusiasm in the topic and it was energizing for me.

But if I missed even 30 seconds or a minute of material, I'd be lost for a long time. And it just wasn't interesting enough to keep rewinding and playing back. So I would probably have to listen to this book in entirety 2-3 more times to actually retain all of the info contained therein."
225,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27300058-ralph-zoontjens,4,"Great 'How it Works' book for the intestines. With many entertaining sections about gut-related topics on the cutting edge of science this book is easy to read. It goes especially in-depth on the topic of bacteria in the third part of the book.Some highlights:- Our intestines are sugar-coated! On the microvilli is a silky layer of sugar, the glycocalix, which is 7 kilometers long if folded out - 100 times larger than the skin.‚Äì We have an inner and outer sphincter (the anus) which cooperate.‚Äì Our saliva contains a pain killer that may explain why we get comforted or analgesic effect when we chew gum or anything at all, and why animals lick their wounds.‚Äì Bad breath is often caused by tonsil stone which you can remove yourself.‚Äì The shape of the stomach makes food go down smoothly while liquids move to the small intestine on fast track.‚Äì Medicine will take effect faster when absorbed through our colon since it bypasses the liver to get filtered out.‚Äì Fat goes through the lymphatic vessels straight to the heart before it gets pumped towards the liver. This is why eating good fats like extra virgin olive oil helps to reduce blood vessel clotting.‚Äì Don‚Äôt use olive oil on a frying pan as the heat alters its characteristics. Use butter or coconut oil instead because they are most stable under heat despite its saturated fatty acids. Olive oil is good when used cold and there are numerous indications that it prevents vein clotting, cellular stress syndrome, Alzheimer and macula degeneration.‚Äì Soy and quinoa are two plants that contain a complete set of amino acids.‚Äì There are two nervous systems: one controlled by our brain and the other of the gut that control the ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù muscle system without our knowing it. Reflux is a symptom of the two nervous systems counteracting each other.‚Äì Vomiting is an act that takes coordination of all the organs within our gut in reverse order. Not all animals are capable of vomiting.- In case of stomach acid irritations, sleep with your torso upwards under a 30 degree angle.- Fibers are great for stimulating the intestinal walls, especially psyllium rinds and prunes. You can also buy them in a paste form at the pharmacist.‚Äì Heightened risk-taking behavior can be attributed to toxoplasmosis.‚Äì The gut receives a lot of sensor information and provides us the ‚Äúbig picture,‚Äù hence playing a huge role in how we perceive the world through insula- sometimes more so than our brain. Also, it plays a huge role in how we feel emotionally.‚Äì Good bacteria help us digest the food and convert to vitamins and keep the bad bacteria at bay. Bad bacteria make us sick but it also trains the body to develop defense mechanisms against all microbes through immunity cells.- Every person has a different mix of bacteria, it is like a forest where different species compete and a few of them make it to possess most of the territory, like a core team. When we introduce new bacteria to our gut, these generally only work for a short period after which the core team takes over again. Which bacteria inhabit our gut also depends on the architecture of our intestinal cells, the climate, and food it is presented with.- There are 3 different species of bacteria: 1. Bacteroides are good at breaking down carbohydrates. 2. Prevotella are good at processing proteins. 3. Ruminococcus supposedly exist as well and like to break down walls of plant cells.- Some bacteria produce fatty acids to nourish a part of the body, such as gut and liver, while others feed the whole body. This is why some foods with the same amount of calories make you fat while others do less so.- For IBS (Irritated Bowel Syndrome), lactobacillus plantarum and bifidobacterium infantis are recommended to lessen the pain.- Lactobacillus reuteri lowers LDL cholesterol. Bacteria that lower cholesterol produce propionate, the ones producing acetate will heighten cholesterol levels.- Prevention methods for bad bacteria: diluting, drying, cooling and cleaning. For cooling, under 5 degrees Celsius is best, to kill E. Coli you need to wash over 40 degrees and 70 degrees also exterminates salmonella.- Antibiotics (meaning: against life) do three things: perforate bacteria, poison and sterilize them.- Be cautious when using antibiotics; overusing them will make you more and more resistant. Biological meat is best because the cattle do not receive antibiotics mixed into their food.- Mustard, chamomile, ramsas or sage oil extracts may reduce bacteria and viruses.- Probiotics are in: sauerkraut, pickles, sourdough bread, creme fraiche, swiss cheese, salami, olives, ayran, yoghurt (right-handed is much better), soy sauce, kombucha drinks, miso soup, kimchi, lassi, fufu.- Prebiotics prepare a good environment to stimulate good bacteria growth: potato salad, cold sushi rice, wheat, chicory, asparagus, salsify, parsnip, leek, onions, garlic, artichoke and Jerusalem artichoke."

This is one of the most interesting and informative health books I've well listened too, in a very long time. The narrator, Katy Sobey, has a fantastic voice, didn't miss a beat and kept me engrossed the whole time. Incredibly we don't know much the gut and some of the most other important parts of our bodies. Also, our bodies are amazing things, aren't they? This book really made me think about just how much every little cell, bacteria and all the other little scientific-named beings are helping us be ourselves. I highly recommend this. "

However I realise even more now that the gut is a very important organ. It needs to be looked after properly and in particular its selection of bacteria. Our nervous and immune systems are connected to it. Trouble is we are all different so there is no one precise thing that you can do and the research is either vague or not done yet. Oh and I did learn posture on the toilet is important!!"

Distributed for free, I wasn't quite sure what I was getting into.Enders' friendly writing, relatable anecdotes and detailed coverage of the gut led to an engaging experience. There's plenty of insight available, especially for those without much initial knowledge on the subject (like myself).

252,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39650-candace-madera,4,This book not only helps you to understand the gut better but also how the body functions as a whole. Western advertising and subsequently western diets are so far from what our bodies need. It's hard to make an informed decision when so much is added to the foods we buy.

254,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,5,"[I recently posted a review of Mary Roach‚Äôs GULP. I mention this because that book is likely to be the primary competitor if you‚Äôre looking for a tour of the alimentary canal in book form. While I‚Äôd recommend both books and point out that the two have different thrusts, if you‚Äôre set on reading just one book on poop and farts this year, the two reviews should help you determine which work is more up your alley.] In this highly readable and humorous book, medical student Giulia Enders teaches us how to poop, what to do when we can‚Äôt, how our bodies extract resources from the stuff we shove in our pie holes, and what the bacteria that outnumber our body‚Äôs cells by an order of magnitude do for (and against) us. The book is in part a work of popular science, but it‚Äôs also a guidebook to the digestive tract. In other words, Enders not only tells readers about the wondrous job their digestive system does, but she also offers advice as to how to keep it running efficiently. The book is divided into three parts. The first part lays out what the gut consists of and how it does its job. The second part introduces the reader to the enteric nervous system, which is the part of the nervous system that governs the digestive tract and determines when we vomit, poop, and‚Äîto some degree--experience emotional turmoil. The final part addresses the body as an ecosystem. The human body consists of 10 trillion cells and another 100 trillion microbes‚Äîcells that could theoretically live independently of your body provided the right conditions.The strength of this book lies in Enders‚Äôs ability to put the complex physiological actions of our body into simple, understandable, and whimsical terms. This may mean anthropomorphizing a colon, but so be it‚Äîyou‚Äôll still get the drift. A prime example is the ‚ÄúSalmonella in Hats‚Äù section that equates antibodies with big floppy sombreros that interfere with the germ‚Äôs mobility and virulence. The author‚Äôs enthusiasm for this ‚Äúunder-rated‚Äù organ is infectious.The book employs amusing, off-beat line drawings to help convey relevant ideas and to support the stories that the author uses to clarify the complex actions of the gut. The art is well matched to the tone of the text, which makes sense given they were drawn by the author‚Äôs sister. As I mentioned in my GULP review, GUT is a very different book despite all they have in common. Enders spends the bulk of her time in the middle of the alimentary canal, where Roach spends most of her time talking about what happens at the two ends. Enders's book is about the typical Joe‚Äôs digestive system, where Roach specializes in extreme cases and narrow (but fascinating) questions. Enders's book is more of a tour of the digestive system rather than a series of tales of interesting things that happen in and around it. While Roach‚Äôs book deals in bizarre cases, Enders‚Äôs book is actually more light-hearted and informal in tone. (Whimsical is a good descriptor for GUT.)I‚Äôd recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn more about how their digestive system works and what they can do to keep it working at its best. It‚Äôs funny and packed with fun facts. "
255,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10181342-samuel,3,"Interesting, though annoying written for a 12 year old with reading difficulties."
256,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60309172-dinesh-perera,4,Very interesting. Thought the appendix was useless before listening to this audiobook.
257,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4722985-rob-thompson,4,"Gut takes an entertaining yet scientific look at an organ that is just as interesting and important as the brain ‚Äì the gut. By tracking a piece of cake as it works its way through the digestive system, you‚Äôll come to appreciate the gut for the sophisticated and impressive ecosystem that it is. This underrated human organ is increasingly linked to killer diseases ‚Äì and optimum health.The book also suggests that microbes are an important part of a healthy mind and body, and we can help them do their job by using probiotics, changing our diet and introducing more prebiotics. To make sure we maintain a healthy community of microbes in our gut, we must also be wary of antibiotics and be conscious of the effects they have on our microbiome and the food we eat.Written by Giulia Enders (a German writer scientist) the book has sold more than two million copies in Germany and that was published in English, French (more than one million copies sold), Italian and other translations in 2015.My highlights:The gut is a unique and impressive organ ‚Äì nothing to be ashamed of! Our digestive system has a nervous system of its very own, allowing our digestive system to independently perform all of its functions. The work it does takes place without the involvement of our conscious mind, which makes the gut a very unique human organ. Another incredible fact about our gut is the mind-boggling amount of bacteria living inside of it. Our entire digestive system contains up to 100 billion bacteria. This accounts for 99 percent of all microorganisms in our entire body!From the esophagus, our food enters the gut and the small intestine. As new food continues to be swallowed during a meal, your stomach expands to accommodate. It‚Äôs so flexible that it‚Äôs nearly impossible to eat more than it can handle.Interestingly, emotions can have the opposite effect on the stomach. Stress and anxiety can cause your stomach to contract and you‚Äôll find yourself losing your appetite. The real digestion takes place in the small intestine. Contrary to popular belief, when you hear your gut growling, it isn‚Äôt telling you it‚Äôs hungry; it‚Äôs actually your small intestine cleaning up.  The ileocecal junction allows the body to absorb any remaining fluids, including B12 vitamins and gastric acid.Like the stomach, this area can also be affected by stress and anxiety. This can result in the unpleasant experience of diarrhea.At a minimum, the entire digestive process takes ten hours. But it‚Äôs possible for digestion to take up to 100 hours, from the first bite until the end of the process. The origin of allergies and lactose intolerance are assumed to reside in the gut. There‚Äôs an interesting theory about the role your gut plays in the allergies you experience. Lactose intolerance falls into a similar category. Anyone with lactose intolerance knows what happens next: flatulence, gas pains and diarrhea. Unfortunately, as we get older, 75 percent of the population will experience a genetic change that will shut off the production of the enzyme responsible for breaking down lactose.Surprise, surprise: the gut can influence our brain! As we follow the paths of communication between the brain and gut through the central nervous system, the question arises: Does our gut also influence our emotions?Science has been looking into that very question. And experiments conducted on mice indicate that the probable answer is yes. Depressed mice that were given bacteria to support digestion quickly became active, showed fewer signs of stress and performed better in learning and memory tests. It all supports the theory that a healthy gut leads to a healthy mind.The gut contains a rich and vital world of microbes. As well as having its own nervous system, the gut also accounts for 80 percent of our immune system. It seems that microbes in the gut can influence our consciousness. There are as many as 100 trillion microorganisms in our digestive tract, a community called the gut flora. And they may have an intimate relationship with our brain.Is it possible that microbes in our gut tell our brain what kind of food we‚Äôre craving?It might sound a little out there. How exactly do microbes in the gut send messages all the way to the brain ‚Äì a place that is protected from all but the tiniest of particles?The answer? Amino acids. Bacteria produce amino acids like tyrosine and tryptophan, which can pass through the brain‚Äôs protective layers. Once inside, these substances get transformed into biochemicals like dopamine and serotonin, which make us happy and drowsy. You can think of it as a reward system for giving your body certain nutrients.Instead of feeling disgusted by microbes, we should learn to integrate them into our lives We now know that probiotic bacteria can produce fatty acids that protect your stomach and help the immune system.These benefits have been found to extend to what we call prebiotics as well. These are fibrous foods that manage to go undigested through the small intestine and produce healthy bacteria in the large intestine. It is recommended to eat 30 grams of prebiotics a day, though people on average often consume only half that much.There are more microbial cells than human cells in your body and they‚Äôre essential to your health.About 85 percent of the microbes on your hand are different to anyone else‚Äôs, giving you what is known as a ‚Äúmicrobial fingerprint. The influence of microbes extends to determining how much you weigh and how anxious you are.Microbiome-gut-brain axis. Bacteroides fragilis, it not only reversed some symptoms but also repaired cognitive and gut problems.Gamma-Aminobutyric acid, which is a neurotransmitter used in sleep supplements that can calm the brain, but can also lead to depression.A truly important factor in how much you weigh are the microbes in your gut.In fact, scientists have proven that microbes can determine the weight of a mouse.The microbes in your gut can even influence your anxiety levels and how your brain functions.Probiotics and prebiotics are two ways to improve your microbiome.Take probiotics (a type of live bacteria) and prebiotics (non-digestible carbohydrates, mainly fibre) to feed the good bacteria in our guts.ÔªøProbiotics are supplements that encourage the repopulation of a healthy microbiome. Think of it like putting high-quality grass seed on a distressed lawn.Most prebiotics consist of dietary fibers such as inulin, or nutrients such as lactulose or galacto-oligosaccharides, all of which are beneficial to bacteria.Prebiotics, which are basically foods that microbes love to eat.Probiotics contain strains of bacteria or live microorganisms that are often described as ‚Äúgood bacteria‚Äù or ‚Äúhelpful bacteria.‚ÄùThe overuse of antibiotics can be harmful to our health and result in dangerous antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics are indiscriminate. When we use them to kill disease-causing bacteria, they also kill a lot of beneficial bacteria and severely damage our microbiota.Administering loads of antibiotics to livestock has dire consequences for us. Harmful antibiotic residues get carried into our food and water, and the microbes inhabiting farm animals develop antibiotic-resistant microbes.The majority of antibiotics in the United States aren‚Äôt produced for humans, but for farm animals.ConclusionThe key message in this book is that our gut is an incredibly fascinating organ, comparable to the brain in terms of complexity and importance. Our large intestine harbors a rich world of microorganisms that serve our well-being. When we make conscious food choices, we can influence these microorganisms. It is a fun, informative read; recommended for anyone who wants to optimise their health."
258,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34242821-mariia-morozova,4,"What I particularly liked about this book is very clear language Giulia Enders uses to describe complicated processses of our 'inner gut world'. I learnt many things, and, most importantly, it made me have much more questions after I finished the last page: I never asked myself question about antibiotics, didn't know what probiotics and prebiotics mean, different parasites like pinworms etc. Now I am willing to read more on the topic and keep digging into it. It sometimes seems to me that all our lives depend on what we eat, after reading this book I am even more convinced. Information I found most interesting for myself:1. How people go to the toilet in different ways around the world, what the best way is and why2. Saliva kills bacteria. When we sleep it is not secreted that's why bacteria rule the mouth at night and in the morning we have bad smell3. 90 percent of the body's serotonin is made in the gut. We need to watch what we eat and who our gut's dwellers are.4. Types and pictures of feces :)5. Our small intestine likes to keep her house clean. But she starts doing it only when it's quiet. If we snack all the time she can't do it. 6. About nausea. Apart from obvious reasons for having it, there is also a stress-related reason. Nausea wants to save us time so that we don't waste energy digesting food, but solving our problems 'upstairs'. Ginger blosks nauseous centre. 7. Fibre! 30 grams per day! For better peristalsis! To feed good bacteria so that they have strength to fight bad agents!8. Stress is bad for the gut.9. Gut's microbiota weighs up to 2 kilos and hosts up to nearly 100 trillion bacteria.10. Breastfeeding is important for baby's immune system. 11. Cholesterol in good proportions is a saviour. Depression, agressiveness and forgetfulness are signs of not enough cholesterol in the body. No fat - no vitamin D and sex hormones.12. Salmonella (chicken, eggs, dies in high temperature), Helicobacter (can be good and bad) and toxoplasma (cats feces, dangerous for pregnant women!), pinworms (scratch - hand to the mouth, parasites).13. Antibiotics don't kill bacteria, they kills viruses; anti bios - against life14. Healthy gut has many probiotic bacteria; pro bios - for life 15. Prebiotics feed good bacteria and make our gut stronger, Fibre; pre bios - before lifeOur body loves us and all bad things like diarrhea, hiccup, nausea, gases, constipation and tons of others... all of them are done for only one reason - to get rid of the intruder, to go back to normal state.

259,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2593154-hell,5,So much fun. Pictures. Interesting information in an easy to follow way. Information about cats and babies toward the end. I hope there‚Äôs a follow up with a book involving more details of the things that can go wrong in the gut or just new discoveries. And what made her sick? I missed it. I‚Äôll have to look again. I want her to write more. Fantastic. Loved the fun pictures. I think her not being American gave the book a nice outside perspective that felt impartial? Or more so than we Americans might be of ourselves. 
260,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6741295-nicholas-stanley,4,This was a fun book. Definitely approachable and not too much clinical language. My family is tired of me sharing fun facts about their GI functions.
261,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,3,"I went through a long phase where I pretty much only read books like this, pop science books about ordinary subjects. It‚Äôs a pretty good example of that subgenre. It‚Äôs just sophisticated enough to let the average reader know that the author is very well acquainted with her subject, but not so pedantic that it turns off laypeople. So how much do you already know about the digestive tract? If you‚Äôre like me, you will know more after listening to or reading this book than you did before. For example, I didn‚Äôt know that the small intestine is lined with waves of something like cilia on the inside to push the food along, and that they are totally self-cleaning. I also didn‚Äôt realize that those two rough patches on the insides of my cheeks are where the saliva comes in. Like most people, I figured I must have bitten myself there pretty hard at some point and just not remembered.But the author just hints at some of the more fascinating aspects of her subject. For example, in an early scene she describes a man who had terrible, terrible breath, and ended up committing suicide the next day. Clearly, there was some relationship between whatever was causing his halitosis and whatever was making him so depressed. I thought it was just a teaser paragraph and that she‚Äôd really delve into the subject in depth later, but when we got to that section it wasn‚Äôt as thorough as I had hoped. Does that mean it‚Äôs too complicated for the likes of me? Or that there was just too much to put in this book? Or what I think the more likely reason, that the relationship between gut bacteria and human thought is not as well-understood as we‚Äôd like. Ever since I heard about toxoplasmosis, the idea that bacteria or a virus in the gut could change the chemistry of the brain has fascinated me. I could have happily listened to a book just on this subject. But alas, it was merely a chapter.The author gets cheeky and graphic sometimes, such as describing the different types of poo and the various stages a person goes through when vomiting. I kind of like scatological humor, but it‚Äôs not a good book to listen to while you‚Äôre eating. Actually, I think this would be a better book to read rather than listening. Sometimes, especially when she was talking about organic chemistry or microbiology, I found I wasn‚Äôt following along very well. Or maybe the subject was just a little dry for me.Still, it‚Äôs a pretty good book if you like science and medicine. "
262,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22392990-eoin-flynn,4,"An excellent read, despite the often childish prose. The microbiome of our guts has become an object of cult fascination in pop science over the past 5 years or so. This book is an excellent overview. Not as detailed, well written, or as useful in your everyday life as The Diet Myth, written on the same topic by the renowned epidemiologist Tim Spector, but almost as good. The style of prose will appeal to many people. There is an undeniable childish enthusiasm to it, enhanced by the juvenile drawings peppered throughout. But it wasn't for me personally. A relatively short read too. Read it, you'll likely change some of your dietary ways if you're unfamiliar with the topic. And you're already familiar it will provide validation. "

I can't help it, I find all the gut bacteria and the processes going on in our body fascinating. IS THIS BOOK FOR ME? A guide to the secrets and science of our digestive system. Why is our gut important? How to sit on the toilet the right and healthy way? What‚Äôs really up with food intolerances? How does the gut affect obesity and mood?

265,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5899412-shelby,4,"Why would you want to read about the digestive system, you ask? Well, because a couple of years ago I read Mary Roach's Gulp, and it taught me the origin of the legends of fire breathing dragons! Also, your mental health relies on your gut more than you know. Those gut flora are such interesting things that do a large amount of work for something so small!"
266,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3093693-angie-boyter,3,"This book is absolutely jam-packed with fascinating information but I frequently had to force myself to continue reading because of the writing style. Some of this may be due to the translation, because there were instances where, for example, it was hard to figure out what a particular pronoun referred to, and I had to go back and reread. More of it, though, was due to a breezy, sometimes folksy, sometimes metaphorical style that just did not seem to fit, like when she likens an immune system fighting bacteria to a hatter putting hats on the bad germs to find one that fits. Why that is an appropriate metaphor still eludes me, since the objective of the immune system is to destroy the bad bacteria, which I do not think is the objective of most hatters! Also, she sometimes neglects to define terms that the reader would not know, like opisthokont, which is so arcane it is not even in the Kindle dictionary! She said it includes animal and fungi but does not say whether other life forms are included or what defines opisthokont. "
267,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711341-marfita,3,"Knowing that this was translated from the German (Darm mit Charme) keeps forcing me to pronounce the title ""goot"" - despite the intestines hanging off the word. And it is gut, I enjoyed it. Enders's writing is reader-friendly while being informative. And it seems oh so German and frank (haha, see what I did there?). Enders tells us that the digestive system has its own brain and it communicates with the one belonging to the nervous system as well, both affecting each other. She describes the system in a way that makes it interesting and attractive. Her sister's illustrations are light-hearted yet enable the concepts to stick in your mind. I now have an indelible image in my mind of intestinal villii and what foods are pre-biotics. The book might not be for the faint-hearted, especially if they are germ-phobic, but they should probably read it anyway. Bacteria is not necessarily bad for you (are you listening, Debbie?) and, in fact, it might be crucial to your well-being.I seem to be over-hyphenating today. Sorry!There's something about translation or perhaps the very Germanish of this that makes the narrative a little stilted. Enders's tone is playful but somehow still seems to come off as stiff. I also wonder about the wealth of US statistics cited. Were they in the original or did they replace the more eurocentric statistics? Of course, I might be more interested in US statistics, but maybe not. I certainly wondered about all the US stats. We do seem to be obsessed here with antibacterial products (not at my house, obviously). Is it the same in Europe? "
268,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32268379-leigh-stuart,4,"Overall fun and fascinating look into the inner workings of the human body and it's relation to some of the most maligned organisms on Earth - bacteria. Enders covers the basics of the digestive system, starting with saliva and ending with how wonderfully well the internal and external anal sphincters coordinate their difficult task of letting it all loose when the time is right. She uses layman's terms for the most part and keeps the tone light and as readable as possible.My only regret would be the lack of rigorous organization in her otherwise interesting text: sometimes she brings up questions or possibilities of cause and effect (bacteria and schizophrenia; toxoplasmosis and reckless behavior come to mind), rambles on about the subject and then never clearly gives an answer, even if the answer might be the obvious 'We just don't know for sure.'One thing is for sure, however, we need bacteria probably more than they need us. If nothing else, this book vindicates my housekeeping. Anti-bacterial hand soap and use of disinfectants for every flat surface is overkill in many ways and simply not a good idea for long term harmony with bacteria in our world. Personal rant - I really wish a member or two of my family would read this book and take to heart the importance of healthy eating and mental/emotional well-being, but those members of my family don't actually read books or think food (and the bacteria we are harboring) has any impact on health at any level. End personal rant.Recommended reading as an intro to a vital subject for everyone!"

270,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55971-matt-harris,5,"Most important book on health I've read in years. Constantly got me thinking about how we treat our guts pretty poorly, and how linked to happiness and brain activity they are. Amazing (at least to me) facts: IBS is often cured by consciously administered placebo sugar pills. The large intestine only performs a few movements every day.That churning sound when our tummy rumbles? That's just a cleaning system the small intestine has, which ensures the place is swept completely clean.When we are in utero, we start off just as three tubes. One of these ends up becoming the main veins/arteries, another is the gastro-intestinal tract. Inside our small and large intestine there are around 1.3kg of bacteria generally helping our body do various tasks. These can work with or against us! Cats carry a type of bacteria which can affect the amygdala (fear centre in the brain) and the sense of smell, and appears to encourage hosts to perform riskier behaviour!So many mindblowing facts, and this science of the gut is so very new, so it's been great to dive in and start to understand the world within. Here's an interview the author did with Tony Jones and gives you a short idea of how good a communicator she is. http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/conten... "
271,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829466-sara,3,"I enjoyed Gut quite a bit. The book is clearly written for the layperson. It's filled with analogies and personifications. For the most part they help, but occasionally they are a bit clunky or make the explanations a bit confusing (because clarifying information appears to be 'missing' to make the technology simpler). The same can be said about the silly cartoons-- mostly good, sometimes confusing!In general, the book is laden with interesting factoids. There is a one nugget of oft repeated advice 'we don't know so just experiment' that seems to be used a bit too frequently as to feel... Unscientific. At times everything seems just a Bit too simplified- we're popular science readers- not children! But on the plus side: it's a fun, accessible, breezy, silly book with a lot of interesting information. I learned a lot about the digestive system, its connection to the nervous system, and our microbiome. For the most part, the general structure of the book, cartoons, and analogies enhance its readability so most will enjoy!"
272,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281718-brona-s-books,2,"Some interesting facts & I learnt a lot from the bits I did read, but I found it quite tedious and clunky.Maybe it's the translation or maybe it's the time of year (so crazy busy & too tired to concentrate)?For me, Enders didn't get the mix of humour and seriousness quite right.Maybe I'm just getting old, impatient and cranky!"
273,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38412561-alanna,4,"When I was diagnosed with IBS at 18, a friend bought me a course of probiotic tablets. I had no idea what they were, but they had a photograph of a woman's tummy on the packet and I was in so much pain, I just wanted to feel like I was doing something (anything) to control it. They made me feel better and I've been taking them on and off ever since, not really understanding the science behind it.This book explains all about our gut in a pragmatic and humorous way, without being silly or condescending. There are large sections covering intestinal flora and bacteria and it was interesting to read Guila's theories about our digestive health affecting mental wellbeing. I think it helped having a personal interest in the subject matter, but it was really easy to read regardless. I liked the funny doodles and whilst they were in keeping with the tone, I'm not sure they added anything to the book. I'll continue with the probiotics and endeavour to wash my hands more!"
274,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6926551-dana,2,"This book was a meandering mess of facts, bad jokes, and juvenile drawings. I so looked forward to reading this book; I love science nonfiction, especially when it's written by women who are German! I had no doubts that I would love this book. But, my 'Gut' reaction was wrong; there was little to love and a lot that made my eyes glaze over with boredom/confusion/annoyance. Enders had no thesis other than, ""I think the gut is really cool, and you should too!!!!!"" I'm sure the book wasn't helped by what seemed to be a pretty terrible American English edition, too. I almost wish I had struggled through the German version, Darm mit Charme, but I think my poor German skills would have led me to the same conclusion. Ugh.Ich moechte wissen ob jemand hier das Buch in Deutsch und Englisch las. Fanden Sie das Buch im beiden Faelle gut?"
275,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9510731-yvonne,0,"'Gut: The Inside Story of Our Bodies Most Underrated Organ' by Giulia EndersI listened to an Audio version of this book, narrated by Katy Sobey and I basically finished it and restarted it straight away to glean more information. I highly recommend this book, it offers a glimpse into how our innards work, in particular our intestines and how they relate to our digestive system and further, our body as a whole. The book contains practical advice on how to ensure your gut functions at its best and if you are having problems the best means of remedy. There were so many useful nuggets of information without the scientific jargon, the only downside to listening to the audio version is that I missed out on the illustrations to accompany passages. I have already recommended this to friends whom I feel would benefit from a bit more insider information on their innards! "
276,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28532028-kair-k-sper,5,"What I took away from this book:- The only reason we developed a brain is to enable movement which makes it easier for us to get energy. In turn, an astoundingly complex and interdependent digestive and microbiome system has evolved to power the brain and the body.- The microbiome and its importance is a fairly recent discovery. This means gut bacteria is largely unstudied and generally not understood. A good analogy was that the gut is like a forest and we've only taken a closer look at some shrubs out of the whole ecosystem.- The gut-brain connection is real, with major influences in both ways.- Bacteria is #trending as one of the most promising ways to cure and prevent diseases, enhance physical and mental capabilities.- Probiotics and prebiotics are something to take a detailed look into and start experimenting with."
277,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4773204-mahmoud-ashour,4,I really enjoyed the book such an easy and informative read. Guilia Enders discusses two main ideas: The first one is about the digestive system and its connection to the brain. The gut microbiome is well described with all its benefits and described it as much as possible (science has not identified the properties of every single bacteria in our Gut flora yet) apparently the gut flora is responsible for a multitude of psychological and physiological effects on our body (it ranges from suicide to happiness and from growling sounds to death). The other idea is a about the new theory of cleanliness. Real cleanliness does not mean removing all bacteria from our life this results in allergies and autoimmune diseases. Real cleanliness means an abundance of good bacteria with a small amount of bad bacteria. 
278,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78029044-laura-engelhardt,5,"I listened to the Audible audiobook as read by Katy SobeyI adored this book and demolished it in only a few days (a personal best). I have a nursing background in endoscopic research, so while some of this was rehashing things I might have already known, it was neither repetitive, too scientific or condescending, but rather a perfect blend of information, analogy, and anecdotes. I loved the little pun in the title, as the author is German and gut also means good!I loved the reader's voice, although she does read quite quickly which had me double checking my play speed. She had a lovely way of saying 'for example' which very regularly reminded me of Emma Watson in the first Harry Potter movie.I have already been annoying my friends and family with little stories shared here about recent research and about how bodies work and can work better. I highly recommend!"
279,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5104976-tanja,5,"Very informative in a funny illustrative way. You don't have to be a scientist to understand it, although some bits reminded me of biology lectures. The drawings are very cute, too. If you follow the field a little, you might know some bits already, but a lot of people might not be aware of the full picture. For instance, I now realised that I eat too much protein and should increase my fiber intake. A big part of the book focuses on bacteria in your gut and how your personal mixture of bacteria might influence your health, body weight and mental stability. For me those chapters were actually the most interesting ones, even though so little is known yet. Research obviously still has a lot to do in that area. "
280,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1986715-fran,5,"There is so much information in this book; I know I have not absorbed it all and will need to dip back into this now and then. Some of it did go over my head, or maybe my brain was just getting confused, but for the most part this is very accessible. The translation is not brilliant, however; the word choice, or sentence structure, often seemed odd. There were a few times when I either couldn't make sense of a sentence or was puzzled by it. Don't let this put you off though, this is a book very worth reading.Last year I hacked my brain, this year I'm working on hacking my gut. The impetus was, in part, from this book. I am aiming for smart eating, and this has given me some really good tips and ideas."
281,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35495670-allison,3,"First off, I think this is an important subject that everyone should learn about, and I'm glad this book was written and is getting so much attention. That being said, I couldn't rate it super highly (though I wanted to) because the book seemed to lack balance. I don't know if it's because of the translation, the subject matter or simply the author, but at times the book was too simplistic (cute illustrations and all) while at other times it got a little too technical. Either one would have been fine, but the switch between them throughout the novel made it feel a bit disjointed. Lots of interesting information however, and hopefully more books will be written on this topic as research progresses!"
282,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33905091-anastasia-d,4,Easy read on Gut-healthIt was quite an easy read on such difficult medical subject - gut health. I learned a lot and on number of occasions had to stop reading and share it with my significant other.
283,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24781814-paloma,4,"Very entertaining way to learn about the gut. One of the few limitations of the book, however, is that some (small amount of) facts may have been exaggerated or dressed up for literary and entertainment purposes. She keeps putting Spain as an example when she talks about water and food-borne diseases and parasites, and puts it on par with the current sanitary system of India. This might have been true 20-30 years ago but is no longer the case. There are other examples in the book of small comments that are done 'lightly', but if they where looked into one would see they are not scientifically accurate."
284,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29349600-rachel-b,4,"A very interesting read on the gut. Enders spends a lot of time talking about the bacteria in the gut, which I found fascinating. The sections on parts of the body involved in pre-digestion that she covered weren't quite as interesting (mouth, esophagus, etc.).Also, the writing was mildly humorous, but I sometimes felt that the author was trying too hard. No big deal.My biggest beef with this book is that Enders wrote about the evolution theory as if it was fact instead of theory, and yet went out of her way to emphasize that other theories, though likely true, were indeed still theories at this point in time. Why the disparity? I expect scientists to be more consistent in their work."
285,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14130853-lynette,3,"Wow, everything you ever needed to know about your gut, and a lot more you don't need to know. I loved this till about the last third. The microbiology got a little too detailed and theoretical for my liking. If anyone who has struggled with undiagnosed bowel issues is thinking about reading this then I would recommend it, but take some of the theories with a pinch of salt. Many small studies quoted that could be interpreted as being more significant than they have been proven to be. The said, as a practicing GP I found this refreshing revision of a part of the body I am asked about many, many times in a working day."
286,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14766521-peter-dickerson,5,"Gut: the inside story of our body‚Äôs most underrated organ, 2015, Giulia Enders, 259 pgs. This book is very interesting and a really good health resource item. I should have been highlighting while I read it. There is a lot of really key information. The gut effects everything that we do. It is all quite complex and very important for our health. But this book is written in a very friendly and often amusing style and the diagrams are very cool. The section about gut flora is extraordinary. I will keep it and read it again from time to time. ~ ‚ÄòIf we decided to say ‚ÄúHi‚Äù to each of our gut bacteria individually, we might just manage it in about 3 million years.‚Äù !#gut #giuliaenders"
287,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16373035-danny-marcalo,3,"Well, to a large extent this is a book about shit, literally. It's quite amazing how much I do not know about my own body. Although I had some of what Enders writes about in school, none of that sticked. Enders' engaging style, more spoken language than written language, helps interesting me in the rather delicate subject matter. She doesn't manage to all the way, when she speaks about bacteria and such there are not as many funny parallels as when she explains digestion. Still, a worthwhile read and a nice start to further research about your own body. "
288,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5996823-nicola,5,"Wow!I have definately been underrating my gut!! What an eye opening book that leaves you with lots to think about in terms of how you can improve your health by taking care of your diet, stomach & digestive system. This is the type of stuff we should learn as children! Imagine if we were taught this at primary school...how much money could be saved in unnecessary medical care bills.Written in a fun light-hearted way to stave off what some may consider the 'boredom' of science. Funny pictures too!Wonderful job Guilia and Jill."
289,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16425742-blue-phoenix,5,"Currently reading this awesome book. Really informative and useful! It is about our digestive system, how it works, explain all the symptoms of related-diseases and also show us some ways to ""cure"" them. The language is really easy to understand, especially with the illustrates, it doesn't require you to have any medical expertise to comprehend! Learn tons of new things from this book though, no wonder why it was nominated as one of the best science books in 2015 by Goodread!I think everyone should give it a try! PS: the author is also living in my town, Mannheim xD!"
290,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1449145-karen,5,"The connection between brain and gut is very interesting to me, so this book was perfect. It's written in a very engaging style, fun comments, but also lots of good science. It starts with ""How Does Pooping Work"" as an introductory tour of the gut. Then on to some common problems like allergies, reflux, vomiting, constipation, etc. The last section of the book looks at the interaction of gut bacteria with our mind and emotions; are bacteria in the gut good or bad; what about probiotics and prebiotics.This description may sound dull but the book certainly isn't."
291,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/703972-becky,4,"The first half of the book was especially informative and intriguing; the last half seemed more like a textbook. The illustrations were amusing and clever. The information is ""TMI"" in that it was not something I would normally want to know about (gross!), but intriguing nonetheless. Several tips on more efficient ""elimination"" and healthy digestion, including dietary suggestions (yay, olive oil!) A few references to evolution, which is obviously a poor explanation for God's incredible design of the human body."
292,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/886653-deirdre,5,"This was a surprisingly great read that I would highly recommend to anyone! I echo many of the positive reviews already written. What I found particularly important was in an area of often overlooked in most books found in the ""Acknowledgments"" where Enders writes: ""If it weren't for my medical studies I would never have had the knowledge necessary to write this book, so I thank all of my good teachers and professors, as well as the German state, which pays for my university studies."" This is what supporting affordable higher education achieves."
293,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65884828-dung-do,5,"I rate 4 but I think the book deserves a 4.5. It is charming and easy to understand. It not only describes how different parts of the body works but also explains many interesting issues such as why we should eat more veggies in a humorous and logical way. For somebody like me who is not really fond of biology, sometimes it might be hard to follow science terminologies. However I still go to the end :D Someday if u have to deal with problems related to your diet or digestion, I believe that the book will be an useful resource to look for an advice."

Easy and packed with knowledge.Unfortunately, for me it was a bit repetitive after having read the ‚Äò10 % Human‚Äô. Lots of info on bacteria and why it‚Äôs important to eat well all the time: to nurture your microbiota. Which will then in turn help you. I enjoyed the part about the organ itself much more than about the bacteria, because it was something new for me.Will it help me eat better? I hope it will, but I‚Äôm not sure."

But this book is so much more. A study where people affected by toxoplasmosis had higher rates of self-harm? Rats with lower bacteria in their intestines where ‚Äúgiving up‚Äù swimming in a big pool of water before their colleagues that had a more balanced microbiome?Seriously an excellent read."
296,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50926151-robert,4,"This was a great book. Her ability to combine humor and solid explanations on how our alimentary system works reminded me of Mary Roach's Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal.We spend hours throughout our lives eating, digesting and eliminating. Just what is going on during this process? That is what Giulia Enders addresses.I hope she writes more books like this, preferably on medical subjects Roach does not address. It is nice to have two authors who deal with our bodies in a way that is informative and entertaining.4.2 and I hope for more. (less) [edit]"
297,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46902002-reshu-maheshwari,5,This is one of the books totally recommended to everyone. It talks about what we eat and how its worked in our gut . You might feel enlightened to know that your gut health affects you multiple way - mental .. physical & emotional health. There are couple of pages that I have read multiple times . You need not be Science graduate to read and apprehend this book. Its beautifully written for everyone to go through it .. i started this last year and I read it so thoroughly that I was able to finish now.
298,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1324636-kellie,3,"I really enjoyed this as an introduction to how the gut works, the first part is more on mechanics and the second part more microbes and bacteria. There was a lot in the second half that referenced new studies and science - it's like a new field of study so that half wasn't as definitive in information but mostly because the studies are just starting in the effects of bacteria in the gut. The authors style made the topic approachable and entertaining."
299,1771641495,http://goodreads.com/user/show/127942-emily-hindelang,4,"Interesting read about the inner working of our digestive tracts and particularly all of the bacteria that make it up. There is a lot of new interesting research going on linking our gut/bacteria make-up and health to all sorts of diseases like diabetes, obesity, depression, allergies, etc. This book sums up all of the latest research and gives a lot of description to the mechanisms of digestion in a language that is easy to follow and at times with humorous analogies.
