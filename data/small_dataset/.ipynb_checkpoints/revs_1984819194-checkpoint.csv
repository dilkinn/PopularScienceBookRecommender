0,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25493797-khurram,5,"A great book, by a great man. I had heard the name Steven Hawking, but never read any of his theories. Simply for the very reason the something coming from the smartest men of the previous 2 generations would be overly complicated and beyond my understanding. What I discovered in this book is Steven Hawking was just a great man as we was a scientist, but an incredible teacher as well. His method of writing allows people like, who have a passing interest in but only a vacation of his ability in science to understand his work. This skill cannot be understated as if the most knowledgeable person in the world cannot comuninate their knowledge it is list with them. Sort of like sending it into a black hole. The book is easily readable, Hawking' s dry wit and sense of humour makes reading and learning from it a pleasure. The metaphors on this book allowed me to grasp the basics of even the most complicated theories easily. Though I differ from him from a belief perspective, I do respect his ideas and I think like any great teacher Hawking would have welcomed this difference of opinion as a show of curiosity towards finding the truth.I am sure his views, and more in-depth theories will go a long way towards solving many of the great world wide problems highlighted in this book that we face today.I would recommend this book to any. It is a great read, and I don't thing anyone can read this book without learning something from it or seeing something a different way. Also it give a great insight into Steven Hawking as a person for people who know him best or colleagues of his, but from his own writing style. He has a great sense of humour, and amazing determination. This is a great final word and goodbye to a man who's theories will inspire many and live on far into the future. One day some of these theories might even become scientific laws one day."

2,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21575078-florencia,4,"A few years ago, The Times newspaper ran a headline on the front page which said 'Hawking: God Did Not Create Universe'. The article was illustrated. God was shown in a drawing by Michelangelo, looking thunderous. They printed a photo of me, looking smug. They made it look like a duel between us. But I don't have a grudge against God. I do not want to give the impression that my work is about proving or disproving the existence of God. My work is about finding a rational framework to understand the universe around us.Catechist, atheist, agnostic; I've been there. So naturally, my main interest in this book is that haunting question regarding the existence of a god, the creation of things. I had faith, I don't know where it went; perhaps a part of it went with the books I've read that made it impossible for me to absorb some notions without questioning them. I told a priest once and he looked at me as if I were selling drugs and tickets to strip clubs at school, not without expressing how presumptuous human beings are for wanting to know everything. A similar reaction is mentioned in this book.Needless remarks aside, a feeble faith tinged with fear - whereas it represents some obvious disadvantages - keeps the mind open. What do you have? The laws of nature or a self-existent and eternal being that created time and space. The complete absence of destiny or someone to blame for lousy decisions. The serenity of dust or the afterlife - on whichever side you get, because you believe or you don't. There is no wager here. There's a chance that an omniscient designer is going to notice that you're believing ""just in case"". I prefer the afterlife Hawking describes: 
wishful thinking.
 This scientist, key factor in singularities and father of Hawking Radiation, is also the master of analogies. The content of this book is a pedagogic challenge and yet, he makes it approachable. Some ideas and quotes appear more than once throughout the book (those already familiar with Hawking's work may be less enthusiastic about this) but I didn't mind; more resources for me to retain rather complex processes, while there's still light. Some of the Big Questions and one-sentence quotes:Is there a God?If you accept, as I do, that the laws of nature are fixed, then it doesn't take long to ask: what role is there for God?How did it all begin?We are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe.Is there other intelligent life in the universe?I shall take this [intelligent life] to include the human race, even though much of its behaviour throughout history has been pretty stupid and not calculated to aid survival of the species.What is inside a black hole?Black holes are stranger than anything dreamed up by science-fiction writers, but they are firmly matters of science fact.Is time travel possible?
There was a young lady of Wight Who travelled much faster than lightShe departed one day In a relative way And arrived on the previous night.
How do we shape the future?If you know how something works, you can control it.The book includes comments of those who knew Hawking: 
teacher, mentor and friend.

“While there’s life, there is hope.” 

Stephen Hawking was such an inspirational man. When he first received his diagnosis, he was ready to give up on life; he was ready to abandon his studies as his body slowly diminished, but with the help of a few friends and loved ones he managed to carry on and complete his work. And, to his surprise, he carried on living beyond what he thought was capable. So, he made the most of every moment as he pursued his academic goals. 

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

He truly was a great man. And the best thing about this book is its simplicity. Stephen Hawking is not dealing with simple things here; he is dealing with complexities that he has spent his life researching and pondering over. Yet, for all that, he makes it approachable and readable to the everyday reader. He knows his audience, and he writes for them, which is fantastic because with a book like this one could easily have become alienated. He was the leading expert in his field of theoretical physics, but he knew exactly how to communicate his ideas to the public.And that is so important. He considers huge questions in this book. Questions about time travel and alternate universes, but he discusses them in a friendly way. Anybody could read this without getting lost. I really do recommend this one. It’s a book that will make you think, and it’s a book that will make you appreciate one of the greatest scientists of his generation."
4,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,4,"Stephen HawkingStephen Hawking was an English theoretical physicist and cosmologist who's considered one of the most brilliant scientists since Albert Einstein. In addition to making huge contributions to physics, Hawking strove to share his discoveries with the general public, and his book ""A Brief History of Time"" was a best seller. Moreover, Hawking did most of his research while battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which makes his accomplishments even more remarkable. In 'Brief Answers to Big Questions', completed after Hawking's death (from his speeches, interviews, essays, notes and lectures), the gifted scientist responds to a number of queries that are relevant to our time. However it's Hawking's QUESTIONS about relativity and quantum mechanics that will resonate going forward. In the introduction to this book, American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Kip Thorne writes: ""Newton gave us answers, Hawking gave us questions. And Hawking's questions themselves keep on giving, generating breakthroughs decades later. When ultimately we master the quantum gravity laws and comprehend fully the birth of our universe it may largely be by standing on the shoulders of Hawking.""Kip Thorne is an American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate, known for his contributions in gravitational physics and astrophysics. One of Hawking's most important contributions to science was his discovery of 'Hawking Radiation', composed of particles emitted from black holes. It was once thought that NOTHING could escape from a black hole, but this isn't the case. The idea goes as follows: Quantum mechanics implies that space is filled with particles and anti-particles - which are constantly appearing in pairs, separating, them coming together again and annihilating each other. In the presence of a black hole one member of the pair may fall into the black hole, leaving the other member without a partner to engage in mutual annihilation. This particle (or anti-particle) may escape as 'radiation' from the black hole. Sketches depicting Hawking RadiationScientists speculate that, unless a black hole gains mass (by engulfing other objects), it will eventually vanish.*****In this book Hawking answers questions he's been asked over the years. I'll give a brief synopsis of his responses, and leave you to read the book if you want more information.- Is there a God?No. Everything can be explained by the laws of nature. Matter and energy and space were spontaneously created by the Big Bang. - What came before the Big Bang?This is a meaningless question because there was no 'before' the Big Bang. Time (actually spacetime) was created BY the Big Bang. It's like asking 'what is south of the South Pole?'Spacetime (which is warped by the presence of solid matter) was formed by the Big Bang There's no 'south' of the South Pole- Is there other intelligent life in the universe?We don't know (yet) but Hawking likes to think there are other forms of intelligent life out there. They just haven't contacted Earth....perhaps because they're too far away. In any case, meeting an advanced civilization would be unadvisable (for us). Remember European settlers and American Indians? If aliens came here it would be like the film 'Independence Day.' - Can we predict the future?No. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle dictates that we can't know both the position and momentum of a particle at the same instant. Thus we can't predict what will happen to a particle (or things made of particles) at a future time. Hawking observes: “No matter how powerful a computer you have, if you put lousy data in you will get lousy predictions out.” - What is inside a black hole? A black hole - which is single point of infinite density - is a star that's exhausted its nuclear fuel and collapsed.....but no one REALLY knows what's inside.- Is time travel possible?Theoretically yes. If spacetime was warped enough to form a loop, time travel would be possible. However, it time travel WAS possible, someone from the future would probably have come back to visit us already. In 2009, Hawking held a party for time travelers in his college at Cambridge, for a film about time travel. No one came.😊- Will we survive on Earth?Not forever. Nuclear war is a dire threat and there will be a meteorite strike at some point. Moreover, global warming is likely to make Earth uninhabitable, since our climate could become like that of Venus - boiling hot and raining sulfuric acid."" Hawking notes: ""One way or another, I regard it as almost inevitable that either a nuclear confrontation or environmental catastrophe will cripple the Earth at some point in the next 1,000 years which, as geological time goes, is the mere blink of an eye. By then I hope and believe that our ingenious race will have found a way to slip the surly bonds of Earth and will, therefore, survive the disaster. The same of course may not be possible for the millions of other species that inhabit the Earth, and that will be on our conscience as a race.""- Should we colonize space?Yes. In order to survive long term, humans need to colonize other planets. This won't be cheap. Hawking helped initiate a research and engineering project called 'Breakthrough Starshot"", which strives to develop spacecraft capable of reaching the star system Alpha Centauri - which is 4.37 light-years (about 26 trillion miles) away. Hawking believes that in the next hundred years humans will be able to travel to the inner planets of the solar system and in 500 years we will have visited the nearest stars.Breakthrough Starshot- What are the prospects that scientists will unite Einstein's theory of relativity and quantum theory to achieve a complete theory of the laws of the universe?This will happen within the next millennium. - Will human genetic engineering occur?Yes. If scientists learn how to do something, SOMEONE will do it.....even if it's illegal. - Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?Yes. Computers are likely to overtake human intelligence in the next 100 years. Thus we need to ensure that computers have goals in line with ours. Just to be safe, robotic designs should always incorporate a 'kill switch.'- What world changing idea would you like to see implemented by humanity? The development of fusion power to give an unlimited supply of clean energy. It would be an inexhaustible supply of energy without pollution or global warming. *****Despite everything, Hawking was an optimistic soul. He advocates that we should: “Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done."" I found the book interesting and informative and would recommend it to people interested in Hawking's view of the 'big questions.'You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."
5,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,5,"Well, this was certainly a bitter-sweet read, knowing it is the last book of Steven Hawking. I wish I'd borrowed the e-book instead of the print because there are so many things I'd have loved to highlight. In Brief Answers to the Big Questions, Stephen Hawking attempts to answer 10 big questions, such as: •How did the universe begin?•Is there a god?•What is inside a black hole?•Is it possible to time travel?•Will AI outsmart us and if so, should we be worried?These and other questions are answered with brief, simple explanations. Steven Hawking's brilliance shines through on every page. His wittiness is prevalent throughout the book as well (including some wonderful jabs at Donnie-johnnie Trump. Suffice it to say, Mr. Hawking was not a fan!).I absolutely loved this book. I only wish it could have been longer. Steven Hawking was such a gift to humanity, his genius will live on for as long as there is intelligent life to appreciate his many contributions. I am so sad to have finished this book, but so glad to have read it.
""This is not the end of the story, but just the beginning of what I hope will be billions of years of life flourishing in the cosmos.”

6,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25398561-andr-oliveira,5,"In this book Stephen Hawking, possibly the last book written by him, answers some big questions and makes some predictions for the future taking into account the current state of science. How did it all begin? Is there other intelligent life in the universe? Is time travel possible? Obviously, I wasn't expecting solutions for these questions, but Stephen Hawking is able to explain complicated questions in a way that everyone would understand. Also, I love how Stephen Hawking answers those questions without disregarding other's beliefs.

""So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""

7,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28709846-manuel-ant-o,4,"If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.Closed Time-like Curves: “Brief Answers to the Big Questions” by Stephen Hawking“Is there any point in hosting a party for time travelers? Would you hope anyone would turn up?Hawking’s answer: In 2009 I held a party for time travelers in my college, Gonville and Caius in Cambridge, for a film about time travel. To ensure that only genuine time travelers came, I didn’t send out the invitation until after the party. On the day of the party, I sat in college, hoping but no one came. I was disappointed, but not surprised, because I had shown that if general relativity is correct and energy density is positive, time travel is not possible. I would have been delighted if one of my assumptions had turned out to be wrong.”In “Brief Answers to the Big Questions – The Final Book” by Stephen Hawking.I'm not really asking a question - a lot of what Hawking talks about really isn't even theoretically testable. Theoretical physics does tend in that direction - often it talks about ideas that are not testable yet, and may not be for a long time, or which are mathematical speculation as much as observation."
8,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10039791-giorgio,3,"Why 3 stars if the book is well-written?Well, there is NOTHING NEW.He just said again and again what he always said...Maybe it should be sold as ""Hawking in 90 minutes"" or ""Hawking for Dummies""...Yes, his life was really RICH in experiencies, and pain, and fight to overcome an ammount of things that almost nobody could... but...At the end, I did not feel any ""answer"", just plain stabilishment cientific thinking.Not enough for me."
9,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"Part of the legacy of an exceptional genius, a source of inspiration and a science communicator.Please note that I have put the original German text to the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Hawking understood how to use his life in many ways in exemplary fashion, despite his adverse health, and to research with full vigor. He was an inspiration to millions of people despite all the restrictions. And he used the nimbus as a genius, who is caged in his body, to achieve that goal. The press loved Hawking and he played with the media channels like a virtuoso. He was for understandable and entertaining science journalism away from the academic ivory tower. Far away from academics who fail because of their inability to explain their theses understandably and rousingly. And feast themselves on their lonely genius instead. Hawking wanted to make science accessible to the masses of people, fueling joy and enthusiasm, inspiring a new generation of researchers. Like other visionaries like Neil de Grasse Tyson, Carl Sagan and many others. The generation of bloggers known in the new media, Youtubers, etc. is inspired by him too.His unusual life enabled him to gain a reputation he probably would never have attained to that extent. And he was an inspiring model to all procrastinating, passive, blaming, quarreling, ... people in the affluent societies. How ridiculous is it when healthy people wallow in their self-pity or are unable to control their emotions. A quick look at the philanthropy and kindness of an exceptional explorer like Hawking would suffice. To shamefully take consequences and prioritize self-discipline, in order not to stagnate further.Concerning the ideological aspects of Hawking's work, every reader has to find his own approach. Depending on one´s preferred beliefs, agnosticism, atheism, nihilism, pastafarianism, ... his interpretations have a different status. Hawking's metaphysical hypotheses permeate his work and are relevant to readers who are not only interested in pure science. As well as his political analyzes and warnings.In addition to inspirational quotes, Hawking also left warnings of various, future dangers. Both should be used in the sense of a productive use of his legacy. The wisdom of his mantras and the pessimism of his warnings of AI and alien intelligences.The safety of AI depends on two factors: human competence and computer security. That sounds very frightening, but it should work in practice because a lot of infrastructures depends on it. Although similar thoughts revolved around the safety of nuclear weapons: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanisl...But as long as capable programmers implement sufficient security mechanisms to never provide the AI with too much power and access rights, this danger is eliminated. And if these KIs are sufficiently protected against infiltration and sabotage, its fatal manipulation and misappropriation can be prevented. The only problem is that autonomous physical and purely virtual weapons systems need a lot of self-sufficiency and networking to work ""well."" Like all logistical, economic and process engineering applications. This will be a balancing act. Hopefully, nobody will stumble over the Terminator.The extraterrestrial intelligences are a different caliber and no approach is consistent. One can optimistically run to ruin or pessimistically pursue isolationism. Each option has its advantages and disadvantages. In Hawking's opinion, we would do well to behave as inconspicuously as possible and quietly evolve as quickly as possible. And in as little space as possible with fewer signals, emissions and detectable activities on just a few planets. This would entail restrictions on the use of new communications capabilities that are yet to be developed, space colonization, asteroid mining, and so on — all key technologies for the further development of humanity. For economic reasons, one will take all risks and expand as far as technically possible forever until it becomes clear which assumption was correct. There is a contradiction between Hawking's urge for space colonization with self-sufficient settlements with independent populations and his warning to be unobtrusive. Both are not possible at the same time. Humanity will gamble and hopefully win. The dangers of improving humans through genetic engineering and implants are small footnotes in relation to machine apocalypse or alien invasion. China has most likely already begun and everyone else will follow. As always, ""It's the economy, stupid."" Lapidar and soberly said, there were always hierarchies and society pyramids. It would be hypocritical now to pretend that immediate improvement and gene optimization would make a difference and break the taboo. Much ideology plays into it. The poverty that arises from the lack of distributive justice is the problem. And not whether the one human is breathing with gills underwater and lives 1000 years or forever and the other with fewer enhancements can only live 500 years and can afford a little less intelligence increase. There is no difference to today. For Hawking, the easily preventable diseases of civilization are incomprehensible. That so many people fail to get up regularly from sitting, eat less and move their lazy posteriors. Instead of just eating from 7 to 22 and not moving at all. Because it really is not rocket technology to get some ambitions not to die earlier because of stupid and preventable reasons. The criticized hostility to science will become another embarrassing footnote in history. One just has to sit out the time and mindfully avoid dealing with such channels. Prefer to actively participate in the dissemination of knowledge and the passing of the torch to the youth. Because with personified stupidity, ignorance, counseling resistance and lack of learning ability cannot be discussed. Therefore, it would be lost love and waste of time even to seek dialogue with such individuals engaging in those political agendas. Neither of both sides would benefit from it. It´s just a great pity that problems such as declining biodiversity, environmental degradation, global warming,… can only be resolved by a common consensus.Especially now that research is opening up more doors than ever before, a healthy mix of caution and curiosity is required. One never knows what one awakens. Be it in machines, unstoppable processes or in the vastness of space.Ein Teil des Vermächtnisses eines Jahrhundertgenies, einer Inspirationsquelle und Wissenschaftskommunikators.Hawking verstand es, sein Leben trotz widrigen Gesundheitszustandes in vielfacher Weise vorbildhaft zu nutzen und voller Elan zu forschen. Er war trotz aller Einschränkungen eine Inspiration für Millionen Menschen. Und er nutzte den Nimbus als in seinem Körper eingesperrtes Genie geschickt, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen. Die Presse liebte Hawking und er spielte auf ihre wie ein Virtuose.Er war für einen verständlichen und unterhaltsamen Wissenschaftsjournalismus abseits vom akademischen Elfenbeinturm. Weit weg von Akademikern, die an der Unfähigkeit scheitern, ihre Thesen verständlich und mitreißend erklären zu können. Und sich stattdessen an ihrem einsamen Genie ergötzen. Hawking wollte Wissenschaft für die breite Masse der Menschen zugänglich machen, Freude und Begeisterung schüren und damit eine neue Generation von Forschern inspirieren. Wie andere Visionäre wie Neil de GrasseTyson, Carl Sagan und viele andere. Auch die Generation der in den neuen Medien bekannten Blogger, Youtuber, etc. ist von ihm inspiriert. Sein ungewöhnliches Leben ermöglichte es ihm, eine Bekanntheit zu erlangen, die er so wahrscheinlich nie in diesem Ausmaß erlangt hätte. Und er war für alle prokrastinierenden, passiven, anderen die Schuld zuschiebenden, hadernden,…Menschen in den Wohlstandsgesellschaften ein Mahnmal. Denn wie lächerlich ist es, wenn gesunde Menschen sich in ihrem eigenen Selbstmitleid suhlen oder unfähig sind, ihre Emotionen zu kontrollieren. Dabei würde ein kurzer Blick auf die Philantrophie und Güte eines Ausnahmeforschers wie Hawking genügen. Um peinlich berührt Konsequenz und Selbstdisziplin zu forcieren, um nicht weiter zu stagnieren.Hinsichtlich der ideologischen Aspekte in Hawkings Werk muss jeder Leser seine eigene Herangehensweise finden. Je nach präferierten Glauben, Agnostizismus, Atheismus, Nihilismus, Pastafarismus,… haben sie einen anderen Stellenwert. Hawkings metaphysische Hypothesen durchziehen sein Werk und sind für Leser relevant, die nicht nur an der reinen Naturwissenschaft interessiert sind. Gleich wie auch seine politischen Analysen und Warnungen. Neben inspirierenden Zitaten hinterließ Hawking auch Warnungen vor diversen, zukünftigen Gefahren. Im Sinne einer fruchtbaren Nutzung seines Vermächtnisses sollte beides genutzt werden. Die Weisheit seiner Mantras und der Pessimismus seiner Warnungen vor KIs und außerirdischen Intelligenzen.Die Sicherheit von KIs hängt an 2 Faktoren: menschlicher Kompetenz und Computersicherheit. Das klingt sehr erschreckend, dürfte in der Praxis aber funktionieren, weil viel Infrastruktur daran hängt. Obwohl man das bei Kernwaffen auch dachte: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanisl...Aber solange fähige Programmierer ausreichende Sicherheitsmechanismen einbauen, um die KI nie mit zu viel Machtfülle und Zugriffsrechten auszustatten, ist diese Gefahr ausgeräumt. Und wenn diese KIs ausreichend vor Infiltration und Sabotage geschützt sind, lässt sich ihre fatale Manipulation und Zwecksentfremdung verhindern. Das Problem ist nur, dass autonome physische und rein virtuelle Waffensysteme viel Autarkie und Vernetzung benötigen, um ""gut"" funktionieren zu können. Wie auch alle logistischen, wirtschaftlichen und prozesstechnischen Anwendungen. Das wird ein Balanceakt werden, bei dem hoffentlich niemand über den Terminator stolpert. Die außerirdischen Intelligenzen sind ein anderes Kaliber und kein Lösungsansatz ist konsistent. Grundsätzlich kann man optimistisch ins Verderben rennen oder pessimistisch Isolationismus betreiben. Jede Option hat für sich Vorteile und Nachteile. Nach Hawkings Meinung täten wir gut daran, uns möglichst unauffällig zu verhalten und still und heimlich möglichst schnell weiter zu evolvieren. Und das auf so wenig Raum wie möglich mit so wenig Signalen, Emissionen und detektierbaren Aktivitäten wie möglich. Das würde Einschränkungen bei dem Einsatz neuer, noch zu entwickelnder Kommunikationsmöglichkeiten, Weltraumkolonisation, Asteroidenbergbau, usw. mit sich bringen. Alles Schlüsseltechnologien für die weitere Entwicklung der Menschheit. Man wird aus ökonomischen Gründen alle Risiken eingehen und so weit wie technisch möglich expandieren. Bis sich zeigt, welche Annahme richtig war. Es besteht ein Widerspruch zwischen Hawkings drängen auf eine Weltraumkolonisation mit autarken Siedlungen mit ausreichender Population und seiner Warnung. Die Gefahren der Verbesserung des Menschen mittels Gentechnik und Implantaten sind in Relation zu Maschinenapokalypse oder einer Alieninvasion kleine Fußnoten. China hat sehr wahrscheinlich längst damit begonnen und alle anderen werden folgen. Wie immer, ""It´s the economy, stupid."" Lapidar und nüchtern gesagt gab es immer Hierarchien und Gesellschaftspyramiden. Es wäre jetzt scheinheilig, so zu tun als würde unmittelbare Verbesserung und Optimierung einen Unterschied machen und einen ach so großen Tabubruch darstellen. Viel Ideologie spielt da mit hinein. Die Armut, die aus der mangelnden Verteilungsgerechtigkeit erwächst, ist das Problem. Und nicht, ob der eine Mensch mit Kiemen unter Wasser atmen und 1000 Jahre alt werden und der andere ""nur"" halb so alt wird und sich etwas weniger Intelligenzsteigerung leisten kann.Nicht nachvollziehbar sind für Hawking die so leicht zu verhindernden Zivilisationskrankheiten. Dass so viele Menschen es nicht schaffen, regelmäßig vom Sitzen aufzustehen, weniger zu essen und sich zu bewegen. Anstatt nur zu essen und sich gar nicht zu bewegen. Denn es ist wirklich keine Raketentechnik. Die von ihm kritisierte Wissenschaftsfeindlichkeit wird eine weitere peinliche Fußnote in der Geschichte werden. Man muss die Zeit nur aussitzen und achtsam den Umgang mit derartigen Kanälen meiden. Lieber aktiv an der Verbreitung von Wissen und dem Reichen der Fackel an die Jugend partizipieren. Denn mit Dummheit, Ignoranz, Beratungsresistenz und mangelnder Lernfähigkeit lässt sich nicht diskutieren. Deswegen wäre es verlorene Liebemühe und Zeitverschwendung, mit solchen Individuen und politischen Strömungen überhaupt einen Dialog zu suchen. Keine der Parteien hätte davon irgendeinen Nutzen. Blöd nur, dass Probleme wie zurück gehende Biodiversität, Umweltzerstörung und Klimaerwärmung nur auf Basis eines gemeinsamen Konsens gelöst werden können.Gerade jetzt, wo die Forschung so viele Türen aufstößt wie noch nie, ist eine gesunde Mischung aus Vorsicht und Neugierde angesagt. Man weiß nie, was man weckt. Sei es in Maschinen, nicht mehr aufzuhaltenden Prozessen oder in den Weiten des Alls."

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

★ This is the book that I decided to start my year with and I am glad that I did so. I have been meaning to read more non-fiction and more science books and I believe that this was a very good choice! It was my first exposure to Hawking as an author and I certainly want to read his other book (which I already own) later this year.★ As the name implies, the book asks ten grand questions and then try to answer them briefly and simply and if you are curious to what these questions are then here is a small list of them:1. Is there a God?2. How did it all begin?3. Is there other intelligent life in the universe?4. Can we predict the future?5. What is inside a black hole?6. Is time travel possible?7. Will we survive on Earth?8. Should we colonize space?9. Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?10. How do we shape the future?★ I think there are 2 things regarding those questions and answers that I should mention and that you should know if you ever decided that you want to read the book: The first thing is that the author does not hold back and he tries to explain everything and he sometimes opposes the religion so you have to read this with an open-mind. The second thing is that the language was scientific but it was as simple as it could be. I have to be honest and admit that I did not understand 100% of what was written as I am also not a physicists but a physician! I think that it is okay though because it was written by one of the world’s smartest authors (quite literally) and I am not one of the world’s smartest readers!★ I found this book to be real eye-opening and it made me ask questions, it has been 2 weeks since I finished it but I am still thinking about it! The way the questions were tackled was very logical and you could tell Hawking knows how we think! I was amazed by how humble and funny he was as a human being (Even when he addressed his personal life and health issues) and the journey through this book was really inspiring! I may not agree with all his ideas but I sure respect him as a human and as a man of science!

“While there’s life, there is hope.”

★ Summary: If you are looking for a great science non-fiction book then do no more because Stephen Hawking got you covered with his last book! The book answers ten questions although sometimes it spins in circle before doing so. The writing was easier than expected and the book was a pleasant surprise! I have already recommended it to a couple of friends and I know it will be the catalyst to a few heated-debates with said friends! R.I.P. Stephen Hawking!You can get more books from Book Depository"
11,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,5,"This is my first book of 2019. As a thought-provoking book from one of the leading thinkers till recent times, a good way to start the year. I have previously read his “A brief history of time” and “The grand design” both of which I liked for presenting serious science in a very readable form. This book released after Stephen Hawking’s death does not disappoint, and is a great compilation of the most important topics Hawking dealt with in his lifetime – and these topics are also those most of us are extremely curious about. There are a couple of good forewords from Eddie Redmayne who played him in the movie “The theory of everything” and scientist Kip Thorne, who writes of his inspiration from Stephen Hawking’s life on his work on gravitational waves. The afterword by his daughter Lucy is touching including mentioning the impact he had on people as could be seen by the large crowds which quietly lined the street on his passing. The first topic in the is – “Is there a God?”. Hawking’s views on this are already public, and also included in the movie based on his life. The point he makes is that religion describes God as some kind of a superhuman whom we can discuss/debate with and be judged by (some traditions such as Advaita Vedanta do not do that though). He goes on to discuss how time itself started with the big bang and the universe, and well-defined laws of nature mean there is nothing for a God to do. You may agree, partly agree or disagree with his views, but he certainly offers a lot of food for thought. The next topic is on how it all started with the big bang. While all the answers are yet not there, Hawking is confident that physics will crack the puzzle of how the universe sprang from nothing. There is already a lot of progress made such as with M-theory. The section on black holes is probably the most detailed and it is also a bit dense in parts. This is probably the area Stephen Hawking has contributed the most, and I suppose that explains the level of detail. The discussion is fascinating – do black holes retain context and information of what goes in? How do they come about, and how can study them?In the discussions around climate change, and in fleeting references in other sections as well, Hawking stresses that we are being very irresponsible with respect to Planet Earth, and people in power had better pay attention to this. The other sections on space travel, AI make for interesting reading as well.This book is certainly a tribute to Stephen Hawking’s curiosity, passion for science and intellectual genius. A great book to start the year – very intellectually stimulating.My rating: 4.5 / 5."

I have a pile of friends who have grown a hatred for science merely because of the fact that their teachers couldn't simply explain and illuminate the stuff that Hawking has covered in his books. In this book, he answers 10 questions and some of them have been brought up in his other books, yet this book is the extract of his work and could be recommended to anyone who wants to start reading Hawking. I have summarized the first two questions in the following pic, which were the most important ones to me. The rest of the questions somehow depend on humans and their behaviour, which I personally am so pessimist about.I would love to be as hopeful as Hawking, but let's get real, take a look around, no promising sign! Look at the role models of younger generations, look at the number of followers on Kim Kardashian's Instagram page... I mean seriously 150 million people?? man this fucked up world is doomed! Even Hawking's dead :( matching soundtrack:day one/Hans ZimmerP.s: I almost got 10 years older due to reuploading the pic, I can't help it, if you want a high-quality one just let me know"
13,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby,4,"""Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""I loved loved loved this book. I have always been fascinated by science and astronomy and I have never read anything by Stephen Hawking, and this book was absolutely fascinating and thought provoking to me. I loved hearing his theories about our future and I agree with a lot about what he has to say about religion and how human fascination with science and space travel is so important for our future. I really agree with that statement about having all our eggs in one basket and how it's important for us to find a new home.Here is an amazing quote where Stephen Hawking explains better than I could ever attempt to why I'm not a religious person: “Science is increasingly answering questions that used to be the province of religion. Religion was an early attempt to answer the questions we all ask: why are we here, where did we come from? Long ago, the answer was almost always the same: gods made everything. The world was a scary place, so even people as tough as the Vikings believed in supernatural beings to make sense of natural phenomena like lightning, storms or eclipses. Nowadays, science provides better and more consistent answers, but people will always cling to religion, because it gives comfort, and they do not trust or understand science.” I loved this book. I will admit some if it went way over my head with the mathematics and equations and quantum physics but I did my best and I feel like I learned a lot while reading this. RIP Stephen Hawking."

One of the things I most appreciate about him and his books is that he makes often complex and complicated topics accessible to everyday individuals such as myself - those without a background or degree in the sciences, and here he explores some of the biggest and most important unanswered questions (hence the title) in a way that is understandable to all and doesn't require expert or previous knowledge on said topics.I am sad that no more of his fantastic works can now be published, and I have huge respect for him as although he certainly had some challenging obstacles to overcome he has contributed so much to what we now know which is more than most of us will achieve in this life - the word inspirational is what immediately comes to mind. A thoroughly engaging, intriguing and enjoyable romp through Hawking's opinion on age-old, philosophical questions right through to some of those at the forefront of current affairs. Rest in peace, Professor Hawking!"

The Big questions are:Is there a God?How did it all begin?Is time travel possible?What is inside of a black hole?Is there other intelligent life in the universe?Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?How do we shape the future?Should we colonize space?Can we predict the future?Will we survive on earth? I highly recommend this book."

19,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7416346-gerhard,5,"Just as I finished reading Brief Answers to the Big Questions this morning, the power came on again. It had been off since 08:00 to about 12:00, and also from 09:00 to 00:00 last night, in what our South African electricity utility Eskom terms ‘load shedding’ (Stage 2). Due to unplanned breakdowns in its generating capacity, the utility effectively institutes rolling blackouts across the country to reduce peak demand, and to ultimately avoid a total system collapse, following which it will take weeks to restore the national grid.Local municipalities do institute a load-shedding schedule so that we as residents can prepare, but these are invariably outdated or inaccurate. In addition, the electricity supply situation is so volatile it can change faster than you can say ‘lightbulb’ (one night in December we hit a new record of Stage 6 load-shedding, with all the schedules now updated to accommodate up to an ominous-sounding Stage 8.)What does this have to do with Stephen Hawking’s book? In Part 10, ‘How Do We Shape The Future?’, Hawking’s response to what his ‘world-changing idea’ would be is quite simple, and drolly amusing in our own context: “… the development of fusion power to give an unlimited supply of clean energy …”In South Africa, The Powers That Be have deemed that coal-fired power stations are still the way to go, with the State-owned electricity actively legislating against independent power producers and renewable energy due to a perceived threat of competition, and our plentiful supply of cheap coal (a classic monopoly situation, though this is changing as the wheels now start to come off.)What is holding us back in South Africa at this precise point in time? Politics; and self-serving politicians. With the ruling party’s grip on complete power being slowly eroded, and every day bringing more damning news of State capture of the essential organs of government, patronage, and systemic corruption, there is such a bun fight at the moment that everything else that really matters – such as functioning infrastructure and economic growth – go out the window as political fat cats jockey and squabble for their privileged position at the public trough.Ideally, what our electricity utility should do is bring in external experts to conduct a thorough audit of its generating capacity, what the precise technical and coal-supply issues are, and then to devise a proper timetable that can be adhered to, budgeted and costed for, and then also give us a much-needed light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak.But as Hawking himself warns in this brilliant book, there is an alarming revolt against expertise in general and science in particular engulfing the world as nationalism and prejudice increase inexorably: “With Brexit and Trump now exerting new forces in relation to immigration and the development of education, we are witnessing a global revolt against experts, which includes scientists.”Hawking calls for a renewed faith in science, as it were, in order to harness the power of technology to solve our current problems, which are alarming in their severity and potential to become exponentially worse. The main issues here, of course, are climate change, the burgeoning global population, and how to ensure dignity and a reasonable quality of life for all.I loved this incredible book, which I think is such a fitting tribute to the legacy of Stephen Hawking, both as a scientist, a teacher and influencer, a father, and a husband. Perhaps Hawking’s daunting physical struggle against his MLS is what influenced his ferocious tenacity in ferreting out scientific questions and implications that continue to have a profound impact on Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity in the form of M-theory.From the provocative opening chapter entitled ‘Is There a God?’, the book provides a readily understandable (and equation-free) introduction to Hawking’s major scientific contributions. What I enjoyed the most though were the wide-ranging chapters towards the end, such as ‘Will We Survive on Earth?’ to ‘Should We Colonise Space?’ and ‘Will Artificial Intelligence Outsmart Us?’, to the thought-provoking and deeply personal final chapter, ‘How Do We Shape the Future?’In her Afterword, daughter Lucy Hawking reveals that her father knew about, and approved, of this book, which is effectively culled from a lifetime of writing and thinking. Even though it is heavily edited and condensed, the man’s impish humour, compassion, and innate grasp of the essence of any problem, so matter how large or small, is evident on every page.I was also fascinated to learn how Hawking’s legacy is continuing, in the form of the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, and the Future of Life Institute. What delighted me equally is Hawking’s abiding love for science fiction. He comments intelligently and fondly on everything from Star Trek to Back to the Future and Interstellar. This is truly a book to cherish."

Included is a foreword from Oscar-winning actor Eddie Redmayne, who played Hawking in the movie The Theory of Everything; an introduction by Nobel Prize-winning physicist and Hawking's lifelong friend, Kip Thorne; and a touching afterword from Hawking's daughter, Lucy.“So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet.

21,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77744562-brian-bakker,3,"Dare I say this book felt like an unnecessary addition to Hawking's work this soon after his death? I get it, when someone with the stature of Hawking passes away, the demand for a book is there. And since I believe Hawking to be an extraordinary person, what objection could there be for this release? My main gripe is the editing. It's beyond my grasp how such a wide-spread book could be edited so poorly, making it feel rushed and cheap. There are a lot of sentences and entire paragraphs being repeated in different chapters. None of which feel right, they could've easily be skipped over or paraphrased in different ways. Other than that, this book gives people who were already familiar with Hawking's beliefs nothing new. Yet the book is very much about those beliefs. I would've understood the appeal of a more personal memoir as a quick posthumous work, but I'm not quite clear what the target audience is in this case.Despite all that, it's Hawking, it's inspiring, it's at times thought provoking. I think the final chapters concerning A.I., space colonisation and the problems humanity faces in this and coming centuries are where this work shines."

“Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done”

Poignantly bookended by a beautifully written Foreword from Eddie Redmayne and a touching Afterword from his daughter, Lucy Hawking, this book is a collection of essays which attempt to answer some of the biggest questions rooted in science, and to an extent philosophy, posed to humankind. From the existence of God and other intelligent life in the universe, to time and space travel, and whether we will survive on Earth, or will artificial intelligence outsmart humans - Hawking's addressed these issues in his usual authentic, direct and honest manner. While there are some hard science smattered throughout the narrative, especially when the topic centred around cosmology, a substantial chunk of the writing can be easily comprehended without requiring a physics degree. I believe this is a book which should be read by everyone as it tackles some really pressing issues about the future of humanity. 

We spend a great deal of time studying history, which, let's face it, is mostly the history of stupidity. So it's a welcome change that people are studying instead the future of intelligence. We are aware of the potential dangers, but perhaps with the tools of this new technological revolution we will even be able to undo some of the damage done to the natural world by industrialisation.

Reading a tiny piece of his mind is and will always be fascinating! It was such an easy book to read. No need to be a science nerd like in The Big bang Theory to enjoy that book. He is easy to understand and should we talk about his sense of humour? I don't think so but I laughed so much!he was such an inspiration and will keep being an inspirational man...

One may think that this book is indeed what it looks like – a genius addressing big and teeny tiny little bit naïve questions that you and me are longing to ask, such as How Did It All Begin? Is There Other Intelligent Life In The Universe? Can We Predict Future? What Is Inside a Black Hole? Is Time Travel Possible? Will We Survive on Earth? and naturally following Should We Colonise Space? In reality, this book is bigger on the inside. It teaches us (again) to ask bold, big questions – something which seemed perfectly fine for us when we were children and makes us look like dilettantes uttering nonsense now. It kindly reminds us of our endless possibilities no matter how restricted by circumstances we feel. It shows us the infinite beauty of things which are much bigger than our understanding and much older that anything we can possibly imagine for comparison. It tells us stories of stars that died unbelievably long ago and stars that are living so far we most likely will never see them. It proves us why being ”scientifically literate” is important for our future and for the future of our children. And, first and foremost, it tells the story of a boy who passionately, without cease, asked questions and refused to believe in boundaries. Instead, he believed in endless possibilities if not of a single human being, then of the curious, smart and brave generations to come."

I took this one out from a library, but I liked it so much I bought a copy and intend to reread it in the near future. There are passages of beauty and awe throughout his scientific explanations. In addition to explaining the origins of the universe, Hawking described his own origins: ""I wanted to be a great scientist. However, I wasn't a very good student when I was at school, and was rarely more than halfway up my class... but I had good friends at school. And we talked about everything and, specifically, the origin of the universe. this is where my dream began..."" (p. 20).In answering the questions of our origins, Hawking argued:""I have no desire to offend anyone of faith, but I think science has a more compelling explanation than a divine creator.."" (p. 34). Hawking continued to explain his thoughts on the question of a afterlife: ""I think belief in an afterlife is just wishful thinking. There is no reliable evidence for it, and it flies in the face of everything we know in science. I think when we die we return to dust. But there's a sense in which we live on, in our influence, and in our genes that we pass on to our children. We have this one life..."" (p. 38).Hawking warns of the dangers of nuclear weapons and climate change. Although he does not endorse genetic engineering of humans, he does warn that it is inevitable.In relation to our future as a species and the connection to technology Hawking writes: ""I believe the future of communication is brain-computer interfaces."" (p. 194). He expands: ""Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it."" (p. 196).There in his final paragraph, Hawking leaves us this memorable advice: ""So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet."" (p. 211)."

Shape the future.""This is how Stephen Hawking lived his life and this is the message to the world he presents in Brief Answers To The Big Questions.Hawking was a genius. His research and ideas have forever changed how we see and know the universe around us. His theories on Black Holes have changed Cosmology as much, or more, that the ground breaking works by Galileo and Einstein. His ideas and theories will effect his field forever but it is his personality and drive that we should also not forget. Despite being told in his early twenties that he wouldn't live more than another five years, due to Motor Neuron Disease, Hawking set forth and continued towards his educational, career, family and personal goals and lived another fifty years, succeeding even beyond his own wildest dreams.In this book, Hawking gives us his thoughts and ideas on ten ""big questions"" including; god, other intelligent life in the universe, time travel, the need to colonize space, and artificial intelligence. He writes in a manner that presents the science in a way that is both easy to understand and that shares his personal thoughts and feelings.Hawking pointed out that science is currently out of favor with the general public and that this will prove to be a large problem for both individuals and society as a whole. He presents some ideas on how to get people more excited about both science and how it will effect the world. I think reading this book would be a good start."
28,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,2,"This book has been compiled by daughter Lucy Hawking and contains an anthology of the most important popularizing work of her father Stephen. Although it was published after his death, Hawking was involved in the editing process at the end of his life, but he didn't really finish it. Of course I recognized many pieces from ""A Brief History of Time"", the book for which Hawking is best known to the general public and which I read a few weeks ago. In that sense it did not offer me much new, except for the pieces that dealt with climate change and artificial intelligence.What is striking once again is the remarkable social involvement of Hawking (cf. the aforementioned themes), his humour and his openly professed optimism, which was based on a strong belief in science (he uses the word ‘belief’ explicitly). Just like in ""A Brief History"", his ability to clearly explain extremely difficult matters (on black holes for instance) is striking. The only regrettable, but at the same time unavoidable thing is that it is noticeable that this book consists of cutting and pasting from different sources. (2.5 stars)"

30,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5112204-nuruddin-azri,4,"Hawking is one of the most influential scholars on physics and astronomy in 20th century. This book tackles the very fundamental questions of human being and nature although in this last book, he keeps asking the question of the existence of God (and denies it with a critical question on science and the origin of universe which he believes is the result of random collision).As an admirer of Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin (Hawking also mentions Feynman, Heisenberg, Oppenheimer, Laplace, Hubble, Kant, Aristotle, Euclid, Hoyle and Dirac frequently), Hawking develops the theory pertaining black hole, space-time and quantum theory. Hawking saids, Einstein's Theory of Relativity concerns with the big things while the his Theory of Black Hole concerns with the micro things.Basically, there are three major themes when we come with the discourse of universe: matter, energy and space. According to Hawking, matter and energy is the same coin with a different facet. That is why the equation e=mc2 is so important. He also touches on the M-theory, how space and time are warped in the black hole and what is inside the black hole, all in an engaging way when he manages to blend the complex and intricate theory of physics with simple analogies and mentioning popular fictional science movies like Terminator, Star Trek, Jurassic Park and Interstellar.In the last chapter, Hawking answers the question of science and nature. Hawking is really positive with the future of science. He believes from now and in the future, more people need to study and travel to the other space and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can contribute positively to the humankind with a cautious condition and wisdom in dealing with it.Like Einstein, Freud and other world-level scholars, Hawking coined back the importance of human to protect the nature because some of the big crises that make the nature imbalance in the modern world actually can be controlled by ourselves like deforestation, global warming, greenhouse effect, increase in human population, epidemic diseases, degradation of oceans, rapid extinction of other species and the need to develop renewable sources.With a very limited ability to move and write due to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) that he has, he should receive a world honour and praise with his excellent contribution to the understanding of the universe in general."

The thought that there is so much beyond us that we can barely begin to imagine it, makes me immensely fascinated. In addition to that, this school year I had an incredible Physiques teacher who made me completely fall in love with the subject. For those reasons, when I saw Brief Answers to the Big Questions on one of the bookshelves of my go-to bookstore, I couldn't resist buying it. I had tried reading another of Hawking's works, A Brief History of Time, but, unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish it because I found it to be too complex for what I know about Physiques at the moment. However, that didn't deter me from picking up this book which I'm so glad I did.This book is Stephen Hawking's attempt to respond to some of the most common and intriguing questions people ask about space/the future.One of the many amazing aspects of this book is how Hawking takes the time to explain the numerous concepts as simple as possible in order for people who aren't familiarised with them to be able to understand. Unfortunately, there were still a few of them which I couldn't grasp which, despite might being my own fault, deterred me from giving this book 5 stars.Nevertheless, I loved learning about his perspective and opinion on the various matters touched upon this book and I definitely acquired some new knowledge through it.Moreover, the postscript written by his daughter Lucy was probably one of my favourite parts of the entire book. It made me cry and realise how much I looked up to this man as she spoke about him so fondly. He was truly a spectacular person and I'm truly grateful that I was alive at the same time as him, but deeply sorry he couldn't stay with us for longer.To sum up, I would highly recommend Brief Answers to the Big Questions if you're keen on reading about Hawking's views on some very important topics and learn more about the great universe we are a part of."

This man has inspired generations around the world to think about the big questions and to do so in a much more engaged and informed manner, how many can boast that?Following wonderful introductions from actor Eddie Redmayne and physicist Kip Thorne, we hear Hawking's views on everything from god and religion, artificial intelligence, interstellar travel, time travel, and the gravest issues facing humanity today.While you may not agree with some of his positions you will certainly enjoy the depth of thought he brings to every issue. When dealing with such a potent intellect, you of course realize that any work such as this is merely a précis to the voluminous contemplations that underly each of these positions. However, it has always been Hawking's unique skill to make the impenetrably difficult ideas accessible to the imaginations of everyone, he has maintained this ability now through his final work. "

By far one of the most brilliant minds to have graced this world, but also one of the most worthy people to have soared. He is on my list of people I wish I could have met, and I mourn his death. I liked the inclusion of interview clips where you could hear the ""voice"" he came to call his own. I also liked the fact that, even if he was explaining why another perspective didn't hold up, he never belittled--straightforward, respectful, and kind all the way.Some of you might know that, or possibly not, but I specialized in nonfiction for my creative writing degree and delved into science writing (which is widely varied by the way). I wish I had been able to read this book among my classmates because it truly is an interesting little work packed full of interesting and wholesome ideas.

When the title said ""Brief Answers"" I guess I confused that with understandable answers. I don't know if it is just me, but I would go into this book not expecting to understand a large portion of it, and being okay with that. At first I tried to really understand all of the info and I felt a little lost and in over my head a bit but then I found that if I just read over the technical stuff but didn't focus too much on what I couldn't understand, I still came away with the message at the end of each chapter.

Stephen's ""defense"" and rational surely holds up under the highest academic scrutiny.He went a little deep into question 5 about black holes, but I'll certainly allow myself to read this chapter twice. Stephen lies buried between Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin with the Entropy of a Black Hole equation engraved on his tombstone (S=Akc^3 / 4Gh-bar). One would never know that we knew so much about these Black Holes!Stephen has the occasional jabs he is known for, with a few aimed at squarely at Trump. In ""How do we shape the future?"", we read: ""Education and science and technology research are endangered now more than ever before. ... The exchange of people across borders enables skills to transfer more quickly and brings new people with different ideas, derived from their different backgrounds. ...With Brexit and Trump now exerting new forces in relation to immigration and the development of education, we are witnessing a global revolt against experts, which includes scientists.""He gives credit to his teachers: Often that spark comes from a teacher. Allow me to explain. I wasn't the easiest person to teach, I was slow to learn to read and my handwriting was untidy. But when I was fourteen my teacher at my school in St Albans, Dikran Tahta, showed me how to harness my energy and encouraged me to think creatively about mathematics. He opened my eyes to maths ats the blue-print of the universe itself. If you look behind every exceptional person there is an exceptional teacher. When each of us thinks about what we can do in life, chances are we can do it because of a teacher.""Stephen describes the necessity to colonize space. ""We can make interstellar travel a long-term aim - in the next 200 to 500 years."" He describes the current rocket speed limitations of today and how the NEAREST star system (Alpha Centauri) would take 70,000 years of travel at the speed of Voyager. (Alpha Centauri is 4.37 light-years distance) ""If there are beings alive on Alpha Centauri today, they remain blissfully ignorant of the rise of Donald Trump."" Then Stephen describes a plan starting with nano-size spacecraft that could reach speeds of 0.2c and be there in 20 years.Tempered with this optimism, is his realism about the world today: Earth resources draining too quickly. Climate change. Reduction of the polar ice caps. Deforestation. Over-population. Disease. War. Famine. Lack of water. Decimation of animal species. Yet in classic Hawking fashion, finishes this list with: 
""These are all solvable but so far have not been solved.""
Each of the 10 questions in the book gets enough devoted space, and always has a wrap-up summary at the conclusion to come back to the original question.
""It matters that you don't just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.""

4 stars. Such a delightful listen. It's educational and entertaining and full of wit. Hawking was a brilliant man and he had a great sense of humor and it shines here. In between the chapters are little interviews with Hawking and he was so quick witted in his responses and those sections were easily my favorite part of the book. There are a lot of really great quotes in this book. He had a very interesting outlook on life. I loved that this was primarily about Physics but also we get a bit of his personal life thrown in there as well. 
“So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.”
Out of all of the quotes I could post that one is my absolute favorite and really stood out to me the most. Overall, I can't say enough great things about this book and how much I enjoyed. If you are even just a little bit interested in science pick this book up. I highly recommend the audiobook. I look forward to reading and studying more of his work."

We are so easily distracted and stressed by the daily woes of economy, politics, religion, environment, but Hawking reminds us that in a few hundred years, super-humans will be zipping around the cosmos, settling on Mars etc. Life will be unimaginable to ours today!I loved listening to this on audio, each chapter has snippets of Hawking's own speaking, and there's also a lovely afterward by his daughter that is a fitting final tribute to a great man!"

44,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41705015-mounaim-kamel,5,"One of my favorites of all time, this is the last masterpiece authored by Stephen Hawking (2018), in this book he discusses some of the main questions of humanity like: Is there a God?, How did it all begin?, What is inside a Black hole?, Is time travel possible?, Should we Colonize Space?, Will AI outsmart us?...etcThe first two chapters were as if I am reading a cookbook. Hawking was like ..ok guys! today I am gonna show you how to make a universe, and all we need is these ingredients: matter, energy and space, and all these 3 ingredients were invented at the moment of the big bang, From nothing, how? The secret lies in (Physics) something we call “negative energy”“Imagine a man wants to build a hill on a flat piece of land. The hill will represent the universe. To make this hill he digs a hole in the ground and uses that soil to dig his hill. But of course he’s not just making a hill—he’s also making a hole………When the Big Bang produced a massive amount of positive energy, it simultaneously produced the same amount of negative energy. the positive and the negative add up to zero, always………... this negative energy is in space. This may sound odd, but according to the laws of nature concerning gravity and motion, space itself is a vast store of negative energy.”All we need now is something to start this whole process, because everything that exists must have a cause that brought it into existence, right? Right?? Well..Here is where it gets a bit tricky.“in our daily lives .... You can’t just click your fingers and summon up a cup of coffee... But travel down into this coffee cup—through the milk particles, down to …the sub-atomic level, and you enter a world where conjuring something out of nothing is possible…at this scale, particles such as protons behave according to the laws of nature we call quantum mechanics. And they really can appear at random”and since we know the universe itself was once very small according to the big bang theory, this means that the universe itself could simply have popped into existence without violating the known laws of nature. it came into being on a minuscule scale out of nothingness with no “cause” beyond the laws of quantum mechanics, which allow for randomness. And then from that moment on, vast amounts of energy were released as space itself expanded, a place to store all the negative energy needed to make a balance.As you see, one thing that Hawking does well, is writing about science for the general reader, you don’t need to be a genius to understand his books, while he throws some jokes here and there which makes you feel like you are in the middle of a normal conversation with him. the only thing I didn’t like about the book is that it comes to an end."
45,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"​It took a long time for me to get through this book, not because it was difficult (Hawking always makes the most complex processes in the universe relatively simple) and not because it was dry or boring (Hawking is a truly superior writer who manages to relate to his audience and share with them his sense of awe about his personal life and life of the universe that surrounds us. I could not get through this book because I love Stephen Hawking, more than I can say. I was obsessed with his area theorem (which is what initially drew me to his work) and then I loved him all the more each time I read something he wrote. It did not matter that I did not know him personally. His death made me feel as if I had lost a friend and a favorite teacher. I surprised myself by how many times I cried while reading this book. It was just too painful to keep listening to his words, which remained her with us, even though he was gone. It didn't help that Hawking wrote about death quite a bit throughout the book. All of his insights were invaluable, but it was so sad to read his thoughts on death so soon after his actual death. This book, like his others, was a must read if you are a fan of physics. This short, very readable book of essays and answers covers topics including:Should we travel to space and colonize space? Should we develop AI​What are black holes; how do they work; what do we know and not know about them? (This is, without question, my favorite part of the book. No one writes about black holes like Hawking does. What a gifted writer!!!!!)What is escape velocity?How are particles and antiparticles made? (He has explained this many times, but this really did seem like the simplest, most concise explanation i have read from him.)What was his long career like, especially since he had so many challenges?Do we live in a predictable universe? (Exceptionally wonderful history of Laplacian determinism, which was replaced by chaos and quantum physics. Very simple explanation of Max Plank's work on packets of radiation- glorious writing, very simplified for the non-physicist. )What is quantum physics? (Such short answers, and yet, he seems to cover more ground and provide more complete answers than many authors who write much longer books.)Simple but eloquent explanation of the uncertainty principle. (Take home point was how Max Plank and Heisenberg challenged the idea of a deterministic universe).Can we predict everything about our future? (In theory the laws of physics allow us to do so, but the equations are far too complex.)"

But nowadays, if you read one book a day, it would take you many tens of thousands of years to read through the books in a national library. By which time, many more books would have been written. This has meant that no one person can be the master of more than a small corner of human knowledge. People have to specialise, in narrower and narrower fields. This is likely to be a major limitation in the future. We certainly cannot continue, for long, with the exponential rate of growth of knowledge that we have had in the last 300 years. An even greater limitation and danger for future generations is that we still have the instincts, and in particular the aggressive impulses, that we had in caveman days. Aggression, in the form of subjugating or killing other men and taking their women and food, has had definite survival advantage up to the present time. But now it could destroy the entire human race and much of the rest of life on Earth. A nuclear war is still the most immediate danger, but there are others, such as the release of a genetically engineered virus. Or the greenhouse effect becoming unstable.”― Stephen HawkingThis was a difficult book for me to review. How does one assign a rating to a book written by a legend in the scientific community, other to consider the ""readability"" of the material from my perspective? Although I have taken quite a few science classes, my areas of knowledge do not reside in the subjects of Theoretical Physics or Cosmology (meaning I'd be fine with reading something like Quantum Physics for Colossal Dummies). Hawking did a fine job of trying to make the subjects understandable to the lay person but the chapters devoted to black holes and time travel were still too scientifically intellectual for me. Perhaps I am a person who needs graphics and illustrations for certain subjects, as I lack the appropriate imagination.Even though I did not completely understand or enjoy all the subjects presented in the book, I admired Hawking's sense of humor, enthusiasm and optimism. He still managed to get in a few digs about the historical lack of intelligent behavior by the human race, which I couldn't disagree with. "

I stand with Hawking in that it is our responsibility to  all  become scientifically literate. Hawking walks us through how things came to be discovered, how they work, what we should look forward to in the future, and how we should prepare for it. What this book is missing is a ""humanity made stupid choices"" counter (I completely agreed when he made these statements). I hope that this format of answering complicated questions enlightens those who disagree with scientific facts. We need more people in this world believing scientists and supporting them.

What if God is in all the particles of dark matter? What if He’s the fabric of space-time? What if He's inside us? What if He's the most important metaphor ever created by man come to life?

He asks questions in this book that I haven't thought of like what is in a black hole. There is no definitive answer to this question, but I did learn that a black hole is a collasped star that does have gravitational power to suck in a human being. I learned that a black hole does trap in light and emit a lot of heat and radiation. Hawking supported living in space, and he supports his belief by telling readers there are ice caps in the craters on the moon and volcanic activity on the planet Mars. This may be old news to most people, but this is new information for me. It gives hope that people will eventually live in space and build colonies there. I really like the chapter where Hawking questions whether or not God exists. He did not believe in God, but he does asks readers what question they would ask God if they believe in his existence. This is a question that got me thinking about what I would ask. There are written tributes in this book by his daughter Lucy, actor Eddie Redmayne that all show how revered Stephen Hawking is.

I feel I have become physically , intellectually & spiritually smaller after reading this book.An enlightening read on some of the biggest questions faced by the mankind, the book is true to its title and does its job fairly well in answering the complex questions in a simple easy-to-understand language ,for most parts.I must admit though, occasionally there were some theories that just went above my noob head.God- defined as an embodiment of laws of nature and not as a subject to human relationship is an interesting perspective.With nanocraft & superhumans in action,the future seems to be an exciting & scary time/place.Beside the main subject, the impact of the possibility of early death on Stephen Hawking's life is clearly told in the book."

We are talking about his personal opinions, of course, but it's definitely interesting to hear the opinions of one of the greatest minds of the last century.To be honest, on occasion some of the scientific theories presented seemed a little far-fetched to me, even if they were presented as ""this is how things work, that experiment proved it"". But again, exposition of those theories is necessarily oversimplified (maybe even a little bit too much), so that was to be expected.Everybody should spend some time mulling over these questions every now and then.

This is not a very good book, to tell the truth, my truth that is. I certainly learned stuff from it, however, and liked it despite its problems, more or less, I guess that makes it good after all.For problems, I'll focus on two:- For one, the answers are not exactly brief. While this book, as far as I know, is directed to the general public, it does in depth more than needed. So while it is readable to the general public, that would make them less tempted to actually read it. I'd say that this book is directed to people with basic knowledge of physics, which is what allowed me to read it.- For two, the questions and their answers are not that fascinating. If you have knowledge of the ideas discussed, God's existence, Big Ban and time travel, do not expect something more than shedding new light on what you know already. Not that you cannot get more, I was certainly intrigued by the physics behind stuff I know from SciFi, and hearing it from no other than Stephen Hawking is different than Youtube.Speaking of Hawking, there are two main factors that make him who he is, to us readers of course. One is his fight with his condition, and two is his genius contribution to multiple fields, mainly cosmology and physics. He is, by all means, an extraordinary human being. One of the finest our race brought out. This book only vaguely touches those two points, however. This book could have been written by any of a large number of theoretical physicists with the same knowledge, at this level, and some of which would have been able to do it much better, make it shorter and briefer.That is my critique, but what do I know, better read and find out, chances are it won't be a waste of your time.*My interest in physics increases*"

These are just a few of the questions Hawking addresses in this wide-ranging, passionately argued final book from one of the greatest minds in history.Featuring a foreword by Eddie Redmayne, who won an Oscar for playing Stephen Hawking, an introduction by Nobel Laureate Kip Thorne, and an afterword from Hawking’s daughter, Lucy, Brief Answers to the Big Questions is a brilliant last message to the world.Eminently readable, Hawking again delivers a delightful look at how the steady state theory was blasted into space when the expanding universe was proven. Of course, this means that the big crunch is certainly in the future, whether humans are still around then, or not. Refreshing as always, Hawking is a firm fave in our stuga. I cannot envisage a valid reason why you would not pop this book into every young person's Christmas stocking."

69,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2922102-blaine,4,"Brief Answers to the Big Questions was published after Stephen Hawking’s death. It’s an interesting mix of speculation and explanation of the underlying science. The book also does a great job of explaining how Professor Hawking’s study of black holes shed so much light on our understanding of quantum mechanics and science generally. As a collection of various writings, there is some overlap, and it repeats itself a bit. But if you’re looking for me to write a takedown of a legendary scientist who I’ve admired for most of my life, you have come to the wrong place.It’s not  A Brief History of Time, but a good read, and a fine entry point if you’ve never read anything before by Professor Hawking. Recommended.And now, the even Briefer Answers to the Big Questions:1. Is there a God? No, because there was no time before the beginning of the universe in which a creator could have acted.2. How did it all begin? Scientists are still working on it.3. Is there other intelligent life in the universe? Possibly, but unlikely. If so, they are either far away or have overlooked us, because if they had visited, it would likely be like the film Independence Day.4. Can we predict the future? The uncertainty principle and quantum mechanics make it too difficult.5. What is inside a black hole? Still unclear, as theoretical physicists are trying to resolve the information paradox.6. Is time travel possible? Theoretically we could create such wormholes, but if we really could, wouldn’t someone from the future have come back to visit or maybe show us how?7. We will survive on earth? Barring future disaster (asteroid, runaway climate change), yes, but humanity and machines will evolve in unrecognizable ways.8. Should we colonize space? Yes, if only to prevent our extinction, but also to boost interest in science generally.9. Will artificial intelligence outsmart us? Yes, it will be able eventually to design itself, and its evolution is far faster than our biological evolution. So we better make sure its goals align with ours. 10. How do we shape the future? “If you know how something works, you can control it.” Improve education generally and science education specifically."
70,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1778796-merry,5,"Where to begin? Especially when you’re reviewing a book by Stephen Hawking. Amazing, that’s a good start. Written in an incredibly down-to-earth manner (what s surprise considering how brilliant he was!), I have to admit there were moments I was still overwhelmed. It reminded me of some of those shows on tv about the universe where the absolute enormity of what they’re discussing becomes too much to comprehend even though it’s geared for “regular people.” And his delightful sense of humor! Every once in a while it would shine through as in this paragraph:“How do we start this journey? So far, our explorations have been limited to our local cosmic neighbourhood. Forty years on, our most intrepid explorer, Voyager, has just made it to interstellar space. Its speed, eleven miles a second, means it would take about 70,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri. This constellation is 4.37 light years away, twenty-five trillion miles. If there are beings alive on Alpha Centauri today, they remain blissfully ignorant of the rise of Donald Trump.”Additionally he was quite a family man as he relates little snippets throughout the book and as evidenced by the touching words from his daughter at the end. All in all, I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I close with his final thoughts:“So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.”"

I liked how the author views the world and you can plainly see how much he really enjoyed life and everything in it. I want to read more of Hawking's writing now."
72,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2949159-ray-lamanna,5,"This was Stephen Hawking's last book published after his death in March 2018. he was one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century, proven by the fact that his ashes were buried in Westminster Abbey between Charles Darwin and Sir Isaac Newton. Here Hawking summarises his life's work by dealing with 8 Big Questions he contemplated in the past 50 years. His explanations are clear and rather forcefully presented. However, I don't think his reflections on the first 2 questions about the existence of God and how the world began will satisfy many believers. He essentially says that there was no need for God in order for the universe to be created and sustained. He doesn't belittle believers, but says that God is ""beside the point.""But no matter what your belief system is, this is a science book well worth reading-especially in the current American atmosphere where some of our political leaders think that science itself is ""beside the point."""

77,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1660832-kevin,4,"I loved this book, Hawking’s last and most relevant it covers a range of questions about the universe, the earth, man and A.I.From the chapter on the existence of GodYou can’t get to a time before theBig Bang because there was no time before the Big Bang. Wehave finally found something that doesn’t have a cause,because there was no time for a cause to exist in. For me thismeans that there is no possibility of a creator, because there isno time for a creator to have existed in.  From the chapter Will We Survive On Earth At the same time, many of those same politicians are denyingthe reality of man-made climate change, or at least the abilityof man to reverse it, just at the moment that our world isfacing a series of critical environmental crises. The danger isthat global warming may become self-sustaining, if it has notbecome so already.  From the chapter How Do We Shape the Future With Brexit and Trump now exerting new forces in relationto immigration and the development of education, we arewitnessing a global revolt against experts, which includesscientists. So what can we do to secure the future of scienceand technology education?  Also from the chapter How Do We Shape the FutureAnd I believe the future of learning and education is theinternet. People can answer back and interact. In a way, theinternet connects us all together like the neurons in a giantbrain. And with such an IQ, what cannot we be capable of?  From the afterword by Lucy HawkingI thought it was perfectly normal to ask grown-ups lots ofchallenging questions because this is what we did at home. Itwas only when I allegedly reduced a vicar to tears with myclose examination of his proof of the existence of God that itstarted to dawn on me that this was unexpected.  I’d love to read a book from Lucy’s POV and see what growing up with her Dad was like, how it affected her life."
78,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58892455-read-by-coco,4,"I stumbled upon this book in my local bookstore with a friend of mine. She bought it (she doesn't usually read) and said it was interesting, so I picked it up! And she was right! While I feel like I had my own opinions about many of the topics talked about by Hawking in this book, the way he talked about it blew my mind. This book is and isn't opinion based. Hawkings, as you'd expect, has his opinions grounded in science. From reading this book its my personal opinion that he doesn't at all suffer from confirmation-bias. That is, instead of finding facts to back up his opinions, he uses the science he has learned to form his opinions. He also states that one of his great loves in his life is explaining and presenting difficult to understand theories and knowledge in a way that is easy for the average person to interperate, and this book sums up this love perfectly. While this book still is filled with difficult to understand scientific concepts, Hawking uses analogies and simple language to present these concepts in a way I could easily understand. Not only could I understand them, but I could also ponder them and further think on them. Hawking has a really unique and intelligent perspective on some of the big questions. While I wasn't super interested in learning what is inside a black hole, I was blown away by the way he explains and discusses the topics of religion, aliens, time travel, how the universe began, etc. Thesse topics interest me so much. And Im so thankful that Hawking took his time to share his opinions on these topics before his passing. His mind was brilliant, and its truly a gift to get a peek into how he see's the world, and to understand why he sees it that way. I really liked this book, so I'm giving it a solid four star rating.🌟🌟🌟🌟"
79,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Brief Answers to the Big Questions by Stephen Hawking“Brief Answers to the Big Questions” addresses the big questions of the day by scientists, political leaders and the general public. World-famous cosmologist and award-winning author Stephen Hawking takes the readers on his final ride to answering some of the most interesting questions facing humankind. This instructive 227-page book includes the following ten chapters: Chapter 1: Is There a God? Chapter 2: How Did It All Begin? Chapter 3: Is There Other Intelligent Life in the Universe? Chapter 4: Can We Predict the Future? Chapter 5: What Is Inside a Black Hole? Chapter 6: Is Time Travel Possible? Chapter 7: Will We Survive on Earth? Chapter 8: Should We Colonise Space? Chapter 9: Will Artificial Intelligence Outsmart Us? Chapter 10: How Do We Shape the Future?Positives:1.	Professionally written, accessible, brief and well-researched book. 2.	The fascinating topic of the big questions facing humankind from the masterful mind of Stephen Hawking.3.	The book is a compilation of Hawking’s answers to ten big questions. The book follows a clean pattern of asking the big question (one per chapter), discussion and summary. 4.	 Kip Thorne provides a warm introduction that captures the essence of Hawking. “This “Hawking temperature” of a black hole and its “Hawking radiation” (as they came to be called) were truly radical—perhaps the most radical theoretical physics discovery in the second half of the twentieth century. They opened our eyes to profound connections between general relativity (black holes), thermodynamics (the physics of heat) and quantum physics (the creation of particles where before there were none).”5.	There is a sense of awe that drives Hawking’s curiosity. “When we see the Earth from space, we see ourselves as a whole. We see the unity, and not the divisions. It is such a simple image with a compelling message; one planet, one human race.”6.	A look back at his illness, words of wisdom. “After my expectations had been reduced to zero, every new day became a bonus, and I began to appreciate everything I did have. While there’s life, there is hope.”7.	So is there a God? Spoiler alert. “One could define God as the embodiment of the laws of nature. However, this is not what most people would think of as God. They mean a human-like being, with whom one can have a personal relationship. When you look at the vast size of the universe, and how insignificant and accidental human life is in it, that seems most implausible.”8.	Complex topics made accessible. “You can’t get to a time before the Big Bang because there was no time before the Big Bang. We have finally found something that doesn’t have a cause, because there was no time for a cause to exist in. For me this means that there is no possibility of a creator, because there is no time for a creator to have existed in.”9.	Key concepts defined. “Anthropic Principle, the idea that our theories about the universe must be compatible with our own existence.”10.	Provocative observations. “We are used to thinking of intelligent life as an inevitable consequence of evolution, but what if it isn’t? The Anthropic Principle should warn us to be wary of such arguments. It is more likely that evolution is a random process, with intelligence as only one of a large number of possible outcomes.”11.	The difficulty in predicting the future. “In practice, however, our ability to predict the future is severely limited by the complexity of the equations, and the fact that they often have a property called chaos.”12.	A discussion on the black hole. “The black holes are still characterised only by their overall mass, electric charge and spin outside the event horizon but the event horizon itself contains the information needed to tell us about what has fallen into the black hole in a way that goes beyond these three characteristics the black hole has. People are still working on these issues and therefore the information paradox remains unresolved. But I am optimistic that we are moving towards a solution. Watch this space.”13.	The uncertainty principle plays a prominent role in this book. “The reason quantum theory can allow the energy density to be negative is that it is based on the Uncertainty Principle. This says that certain quantities like the position and speed of a particle can’t both have well-defined values.”14.	Is time travel possible? Spoiler alert. “In conclusion, rapid space travel and travel back in time can’t be ruled out according to our present understanding. They would cause great logical problems, so let’s hope there’s a Chronology Protection Law to prevent people going back and killing their parents. But science-fiction fans need not lose heart. There’s hope in M-theory.”15.	Interesting observations on the biggest threats to humanity. “First, the Earth is becoming too small for us. Our physical resources are being drained at an alarming rate. We have presented our planet with the disastrous gift of climate change. Rising temperatures, reduction of the polar ice caps, deforestation, over-population, disease, war, famine, lack of water and decimation of animal species; these are all solvable but so far have not been solved.”16.	The need to colonize space. “I was quoted at the time as saying that I feared the human race is not going to have a future if we don’t go into space. I believed it then, and I believe it still.”17.	A fascinating look at artificial intelligence. “In short, the advent of super-intelligent AI would be either the best or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity. The real risk with AI isn’t malice but competence. A super-intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren’t aligned with ours we’re in trouble.”18.	The future of humanity. “We have two options for the future of humanity as I see it: first, the exploration of space for alternative planets on which to live, and second, the positive use of artificial intelligence to improve our world.”Negatives:1.	No supplementary materials.2.	No links to supporting information.3.	Meant for the masses so lacks depth.4.	Not at the same level as some of his previous books and that’s ok. In summary, this is a fun and instructive book to read. Hawking provides his succinct answers to the big questions facing humankind. The key to this book is that it was written for the masses, Hawking intends to educate and inspire. If you are looking for a book to whet your appetite, this is it. I recommend it.

80,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23360457-mihai-leonte,2,"The author's enthusiasm for knowledge and science is contagious. However I think the book is targeted towards a younger audience which might explain the lack of more thorough insights into the topics he selected. More disappointing for me was the choice of some of these topics - some of them are covered very superficially and sometimes even with a surprising one-sidedness. As I recently finished Factfulness by Hans Rosling - where he explains how the population increase is slowing down and experts having good reason to believe that it will again plateau in the future - I was stunned to hear Hawking exaggerate this danger over and over again. And unfortunately this was not the only topic on which he is not an expert and yet gives his opinion and presents it as fact. He covers religion, AI, social politics with a very broad brush and a very self assured tone: ""Time didn't exist before the Big Bang so there is no time for God to make the universe in."" Hawking's concept of God as being part of creation is different to the definition most people/religions have, so his argument feels incomplete. The editing is poor and makes the book feel rushed - which it might have been the case. Maybe they tried to capitalize on a great man's passing by having a new book quickly available. I'm being cynical, but I can't find a better reason why there are so many paragraphs being repeated in different chapters."

85,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20934206-karthick,5,"Stephen Hawking will always be my greatest mentor after Carl Sagan and Richard Feynman.Thank you sir :)Its a compilation of some big and greatest questions and answers, public need to know. Is there a God?Our ancestors wanted a reason to believe in the creation. Religion, scriptures and stories were the tool for them to believe in and it actually comforted them. Unlike religion or god, Science provide you the understanding of the universe with a rational framework.Law of nature cannot be broken. For creation all you needed was matter, Energy and space. Where they come from? - from Big Bang. You can actually get a whole universe for free, an ultimate free lunch, so a creator was not needed. (Negative energy is an interesting topic to look into, because space itself is a vast store of negative energy and it involves in time travel, wormholes etc.)Nothing caused Big bang. There was no time before big bang, so the creator. Time didn’t exist before the big bang so there is no time for god to make the universe.How did it all begin?Ireland Archbishop Ussher’s claim on beginning of time was on 22 October 4004 BC at 6pm. But now it’s been discovered that the Universe is 13.8 billion years old and earth is 4.5 billion years old, proved by Cosmic microwave background and Rock radiometric dating respectively.Edwin Hubble discovered that universe is expanding by looking at the faint patches of light as they are far away. As galaxies are moving away, the light from them would take billion year to reach us. S, going in reverse of Big bang Theory, the universe must have begun from an extremely dense and high-energy ball (a singularity) which inflated, and galaxies and stars are formed. Hawking claims that in order to understand the origin of the universe, one has to incorporate the uncertainty principle and general theory of relativity which is still a great challenge in theoretical physics.According to Stephen-hawking-Hartle state (No Boundary proposal), what came before Big bang is meaningless, there was no time and there was nothing. And everything became a concept right after the Big bang. During inflation, some regions of the universe had higher density than others which led to the formation of galaxies and stars due to the gravitation attraction and slow expansion. Is there other intelligent life in universe?Our Universe entropy increase with time, means, the disorder increases as universe is still expanding. The same chaos happened in the name of random mutation and it took millions of years (Genes mutation, Brain development etc..) for the evolution of human with intelligence. It evolved from our mammal ancestors who survived the impact of the asteroid which wiped our dinosaur species some 60 million years ago and we are here because they survived. Self-reproducing systems like cells or microorganisms may be alive in any corner of any of the planets. But the possibility of intelligent life is very low as random process is more likely to happen, but evolution of intelligence is a very rare outcome of it.  Can we predict the future?Einstein objected the fundamental nature of quantum mechanics, especially Uncertainty principle which defined you cannot measure both position and speed of a particle simultaneously. Einstein believed in determinism and proposed Hidden Variable theory explains that object is directly influenced by its immediate surroundings. He said, ‘God doesn’t play dice’. But John Bell’s experiment and result were inconsistent with Hidden variable theory and it was disproved.Erwin Schrodinger introduced wave function and it represents both position and speed of a particle. The size of wave function gives the probability of particle will be found at that position. The variation rate of wave function gives the speed of the particle. Wave function is strongly peaked in a small region and both position and speed can be determined by Schrodinger equation. So, it’s still possible to predict. What is inside black hole?Well we don’t know yet. A star weights millions of times of mass of the sun when its gravity wins over nuclear thermal pressure, star compresses having unbelievable density and then it explodes and so the black hole is formed. Black hole is a region of space time which has enormous amount of gravity nothing would escape. Einstein equation cannot be defined at the point of singularity with infinite density.Roger Penrose proposed cosmic censorship conjecture tells that all singularities are hidden from view inside the black hole, we cannot observe from the rest of space time. But Black hole emits particle and radiation. All you can know is black hole’s mass, electric charge and spin. So sorry! we don’t know what is inside the black hole for now.  Is time travel possible?Time travel to the past is not possible. to future? Yes. If you travel at speed of light (299 792 458 m/s). Casimir effect shows that virtual particles pop into existence and energy density is negative. Quantum theory allows the energy density to be negative, providing it is positive in other and field can’t be exactly zero as it violates Uncertainty principle (Position and speed of a particle cannot be measured at the same time). So, combining both theory of relativity (bending of light, curved space time) and Quantum theory & Casimir effect (space time wrap in negative direction), we can travel to past by constructing wormhole.But Stephen Hawking proposed a hypothesis called “Chronology Protection Conjecture” proposes that the law of physics conspire to prevent time travel on a macroscopic scale.But M theory offers the 11 dimensions concept, where 7 dimensions are curled up into a space so small that we can’t even notice them. But M theory is our best hope to tie General Relativity with Quantum theory. In future, it may give rise to many things we don’t know yet and it may open unbelievable possibilities.Will we survive on earth?Definitely NO. Asteroid Collision, Nuclear War, Over Population, Deforestation, Famine, Animal Species Extinction, Climate Change, Artificial Intelligence, Pandemic Disease and list goes on. Sooner or later, Nature will throw a combined of any of above to sweep out the human race, if we don’t alert ourselves to stop doing the unnecessary risks we are into. Stephen hawking is more convinced that “humans need to leave the earth. If we stay, we risk being annihilated”. Should we colonize space?‘Not to leave planet earth would be like castaway on a desert island not trying to escape”.We should Colonize. Base on Moon by 2050, Manned Landing on Mars by 2070 (No worries! We have Elon Musk to take care of it). We are not going to have future, if we don’t go into space.Come on Guys! Moon & Mars are our Jackpot. And in future (say in 300-500 years), we may have interstellar travel (Fuel energy from Nuclear fusion or matter-antimatter annihilation) crossing across different space to find planets with Goldilocks zone (water and supportive atmosphere) and solar system like ours. We will.Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?People asked a computer, ‘Is there a god?’And the computer said, ‘There is now’, and fused the plug.Civilization is the product of human intelligence and so Artificial Intelligence. Even computer has its own set of evolution, but it had set by human brain. Considering the growth of Technology, dismissing or taking AI for granted will be a potential mistake. AI will surpass human and it will not be a surprising news that AI would take off on its own and redesign itself at a rate which couldn’t even compare to human slow biological evolution. British Mathematician Irving Good hypothesis ‘technological singularity’ would come true one day that a powerful super intelligence will surpass human intelligence, results in human extinction, unless we have a Kill Switch.  How do we space the future?Indisputably, Science is the answer for the all queries in the past, the present and the future. It is the part of our daily lives. Future lies in the hand of schools and inspiring teachers giving a better education and providing the scientific temper. We must engage fully with the study of science at an early level so can give our potential. Let’s be scientifically literate and inspire the young generation to create a better world for the whole human race."

If you are going to buy this book, buy the Barnes & Noble Exclusive Edition as it includes the bonus content of five tributes from notable friends of Stephen. In Brief Answers to the Big Questions Stephen answers ten of humankind's most pressing questions succinctly with a combination of incredible scientific insight and humor. His arguments are presented in easy-to-digest twenty-or-so page chapters. Stephen is writing for the layperson so most of this book is accessible to the average science enthusiast, although some of the subjects required more of a deep dive and my head was sent spinning like it did while reading his  A Brief History of Time. Some of my favorite chapters were: Is there a God?, How did it all begin?, Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?, and Will we survive on Earth?. While Stephen isn't an expert in all of the ten subjects he writes about in this book, he has a unique insight and presents interesting rationalizations for each. He also writes about his expertise in What is inside a black hole?, and Is time travel possible? and these chapters will blow your mind.Also great in this book are the Forward written by actor Eddie Redmayne, the Introduction written by theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, and the Afterword written by daughter Lucy Hawking. Redmayne talked about spending months with Hawking prior to portraying him in the most excellent 2014 film The Theory of Everything and how he became a close friend to Stephen and his family. His family asked him to give a reading at Stephen's funeral. His portrayal of Stephen in the movie was incredible and lauded by Stephen, his family, and critics alike. Lucy Hawking's afterword is a poignant and touching tribute to her father and you will pause several times during these six pages as you will not be able to see through the water buildup over your corneas. She gives you an insight in to Stephen the father, his perseverance while battling ALS, and modesty regarding his fame. What a beautifully written chapter this is. Brief Answers to the Big Questions is the last message from one of the greatest minds of our time. It was moving to see his grave in Westminster Abbey between Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin during my trip to London in August. He is missed."
87,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83077485-chelsea,5,"I love this book so so much!?! It made me feel that me (and my problems) are so so miniscule in the grand scale of things. The book covers the following questions in separate chapters: Is there a God? How did it all begin? Is there other intelligent life? Can we predict the future? What is inside a black hole? Is time travel possible? Will we survive on Earth? Should we colonize space? Will AI outsmart us? How do we shape the future? Hawking attempts to break down the ""answers"" into digestible nuggets of information, paired with analogies for the layman reader to swallow, and makes it so easy to read. Even so, I had to do lots of mental gymnastics to faintly grasp the concepts/ theories that he discusses in the first half of the book (more so than I have to do when I read the share sale agreement I'm working on now....), purely because these concepts/ theories are so counterintuitive to conventional ways of thinking (eg. that there are 11 dimensions and we can only experience 4, the concept of time only existed after the big bang). He does an amazing job nonetheless, and kudos to him for making physics palatable to the masses. The last quarter of the book sees him discussing humanity's future, making the case for space travel to salvage humanity, specifically that planets in other star systems may be viable options for human colonization (eg, Proxima b, an exoplanet that is closest to Earth but 4.5 lightyears away). He delves into the ethnical conundrum that we face in developing AI, and calls for regulated and cautious deployment and research into AI technology.My favourite quote from the book: “... we never really know where the next great scientific discovery will come from, nor who will make it. Opening up the thrill and wonder of scientific discovery, creating innovative and accessible ways to reach out to the widest young audience possible, greatly increases the chances of finding and inspiring the new Einstein. Wherever she may be.” *Aw*"
88,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87713068-parag-pawaiya,4,"""People want answers to the big questions, like why we are here. They don’t expect the answers to be easy, so they are prepared to struggle a bit. When people ask me if a God created the universe, I tell them that the question itself makes no sense. Time didn’t exist before the Big Bang so there is no time for God to make the universe in. It’s like asking for directions to the edge of the Earth—the Earth is a sphere that doesn’t have an edge, so looking for it is a futile exercise. Do I have faith? We are each free to believe what we want, and it’s my view that the simplest explanation is that there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realisation: there is probably no heaven and afterlife either. I think belief in an afterlife is just wishful thinking. There is no reliable evidence for it, and it flies in the face of everything we know in science. I think that when we die we return to dust. But there’s a sense in which we live on, in our influence, and in our genes that we pass on to our children. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that I am extremely grateful."""
89,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21528136-fiona,3,"Stephen Hawking started work on this book but couldn’t finish it, so it was finalized after his death with already written texts.The way Hawking describes the universe and his view on life and the big questions is really likeable. He used simple words and daily-life-examples to explain complex processes and topics. That way it was easy to follow his arguments without having deeper knowledge of physics. In this book the tries to answer the big questions from his point of view. Questions regarding the existence of god, time travel, the end of the world etc. And he does a good job, always showing where it is about pure facts and where there is room for interpretations, so the reader can forge an opinion.Even though I was never into physics (mostly because I never understood a word) I will read some more from Hawking, because he explains things in a way even I know what he’s talking about."

The future can be a dangerous place, but it also made me think of how we could help the human species and imagine a possible future for the human kind. Time traveling and other dimensions are topics that make me question the world and our existence and how awesome is it! Some science fiction books I read have a real base on the reality or how it could be. Life and what happens to us when we die is touched briefly in this book and it put my thoughts into place about it. Of course it has a completely scientific view, but it makes sense for me, although nothing is proven yet. Great book! I recommend it to anyone!"

As a non-scientist myself, I did not understand a lot of it, especially when it comes to black holes or time wraps (still not sure what a black hole is), but perhaps it is even for this reason that this book is so vital - if anything, it is a gentle reminder of how tiny we are in comparison to everything else, and how we should restructure our anxieties in that light.

But still, a great book to introduce yourself to Stephen Hawking. Keywords: popular science, astronomy, cosmology, black hole, space travel/ colonization, opinions This is a great popular science book that resumed pretty much Hawking's ideas on many subjects. The majority of the topics dabbed in physics and astronomy, due to Stephen Hawking's specialty in those field. It also contain his ideas and speculation outside astronomy like his thoughts on politic and humankind. It is written in chapters that talk about specific topic, followed by an afterword by Lucy Hawking. Some part of the book feels deeply personal and really moving, especially the encouragement to chase our dreams. Some other parts are a bit too technical because Hawking used scientific words with minimum explanations to those outside the fields. If you're new to astronomy or cosmology and want to try this book, I suggest you also do some other reading because sometimes this book is confusing. It is alright though since the title itself said ""Brief Answers"" instead of ""Long Explanations"". Those thing above doesn't mean I discouraged you to read this. This book offers many insight into astronomy and even more to Stephen Hawking itself. Reading this help us understand his point of view. We can see that he is really passionate on his study and quite optimistic of the future of humankind. He is very inspirative. Overall it's a good book."

Reasons: 1) Answers to the most interesting and open questions, 2) Stephen Hawking's excellent optimism and hope for the humanity and 3) Affecting introductions and epilogue from his friends and daughter.Before this book, I had a small imagination about Hawking's scientific opinions and arguments. From movies, I knew that he was not thriving student, but he was a good family man and a person with a heart. However, with this book I discovered Hawking's wisdom in any questions and for the future prospectives. I only hope that in the future we would finally uncover our full potential.Mostly all the time I agree with the opinions that Hawking discusses. In addition, it is easy to understand and make an independent analysis. I admit that we need to pay more attention to popularize the science in the society, we need to motivate people to understand scientific researches, to be patient and be faniliarized with elementery sciences.It is melanholic to read the last hopeful words of man who died a short after. I felt his full optimism; he says ""we need to"", ""we hope to"", ""we should do"" to give a reason people to do some moves. As a conclusion, I want to express big thanks for his contribution in theoretical physics and even he didn't recieve a Nobel Prize, he changed at least my world."

Does God exist? ​​These are just a few of the questions Hawking addresses in this wide-ranging, passionately argued final book from one of the greatest minds in history. The black holes are still characterised only by their overall mass, electric charge and spin outside the event horizon but the event horizon itself contains the information needed to tell us about what has fallen into the black hole in a way that goes beyond these three characteristics the black hole has. People are still working on these issues and therefore the information paradox remains unresolved. But I am optimistic that we are moving towards a solution. Great work that will be remembered in history"

Is there anyone out there or are we alone in the universe? These are questions for the next generation to work on."" p.203 KindleHe does offer some answers.""I think computer viruses should count as life."" p.66""Somehow, some of these atoms came to be arranged in the form of molecules of DNA."" p.72So what about the idea of God?""It means that if the universe adds up to nothing, then you don’t need a God to create it."" p.33He also says there isn't a God because there is no time for Him to operate in before the Big Bang. In other words, the god Hawking envisions has to be part of creation. p.37Hawking gives two answers for how the human race can continue to exist.""We have two options for the future of humanity as I see it: first, the exploration of space for alternative planets on which to live, and second, the positive use of artificial intelligence to improve our world."" p.204 "

But then, we elect morons with no intellectual curiosity to decide all the big questions and every person of every other career gets to be an expert on everything on social media. This book is a good example of why I approve of scientists speaking up. The mix of brilliance and creativity that made a career for Mr. Hawking shows in this book where he gets speculative on God, time travel, the current lack of scientific literacy of the populace, AI, the future of humanity and many other topics. Hawking was one of those who could explain complex ideas to big dummies like me, and as an unexpected bonus he was pretty funny too. The Common Sense crowd may be offended by parts of this book, but most people will likely enjoy it. And here's a quote to add context to my common sense statement...""When I think about ingenuity, Einstein springs to mind. Where did his ingenious ideas come from? A blend of qualities, perhaps: intuition, originality, brilliance. Einstein had the ability to look beyond the surface to reveal the underlying structure. He was undaunted by common sense, the idea that things must be the way they seemed. He had the courage to pursue ideas that seemed absurd to others. And this set him free to be ingenious, a genius of his time and every other."""

Somehow i was able to earn a Master’s Degree without ever taking a science class after HS freshman biology! Seriously. I agree wholeheartedly with one of the messages in this book that that just can’t happen. We need to familiarize all students with not just the mechanics, but also the history and ethics of and trends and developments in science, throughout their educational careers. I have to admit that even the most accessible science books, which this is intended to be, are not always simple enough for me. I just don’t have the rudimentary tools for discussing or exploring many scientific topics. Especially physics. I keep trying, but i usually fall short of being able to really appreciate a book like this. That’s why i found this to be a little flat and dry. Until the end, when it addressed AI. Then i found it to be a bit more interesting, though somewhat repetitive. I suspect that the average reader will find more to love about this book than i did. The writing style is clear and informative. The author is (was) knowledgeable and passionate about the topic. And the subjects covered have particular relevance to the contemporary reader. There are important messages here, and i hope that it gains a wide audience. "
115,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,4,"Here is a passage that I enjoyed: ""The first discussion of black holes was in 1783, by a Cambridge man, John Michell. His argument ran as follows. If one fires a particle, such as a cannon ball, vertically upwards, it will be slowed down by gravity. Eventually the particle will stop moving upwards, and will fall back. However, if the initial upwards velocity were greater than some critical value, called the escape velocity, gravity would never be strong enough to stop the particle, and it would get away. The escape velocity is just over 11 kilometres per second for the Earth, and about 617 kilometres per second for the Sun. Both of these are much higher than the speed of real cannon balls. But they are low compared to the speed of light, which is 300,000 kilometres per second. Thus light can get away from the Earth or Sun without much difficulty. However, Michell argued that there could be stars that were much more massive than the Sun which had escape velocities greater than the speed of light. We would not be able to see them, because any light they sent out would be dragged back by gravity. Thus they would be what Michell called dark stars, what we now call black holes.""

While some people are worried about gaining power and ruling others, he was thinking of the collective survival of the whole species.This man was certainly smart, but this is not his biggest asset, the world is full of smart people who are lacking the confidence in their own thoughts.

123,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4704819-eric,5,"To start off, not for a moment would I profess to understand the sciences of Stephen Hawking. But I have avidly read many of his books because I am fascinated with the questions and the answers he provides. And he is honest about the questions he is unable to answer. If you don’t want to read this book (or even if you do), the following summaries for each of his big questions are provided:1.	Is there a God? No.2.	How did it all begin? The Big Bang which will ultimately lead to the Big Crunch. But in terms of billions of years, not a worry. While he was an optimist, he realistically looked at humankind with concern: “The human race does not have a very good record in intelligent behavior.” 3.	Is there other intelligent life in the universe? “We need to be wary of answering back [if we are contacted] until we have developed a bit further. Meeting a more advanced civilization, at our present stage might be a bit like the original inhabitants of America meeting Columbus – and I don’t think they thought they were better off for it.""4.	Can we predict the future? The short answer is no, and yes. In principle, the laws allow us to predict the future. But in practice the calculations are often too difficult. Just think about predicting the weather. But as computing power grows (a necessary variable), one needs to recognize that “if you put lousy data in you will get lousy predictions out.”5.	What is inside a black hole? I cannot comprehend this question or the answer. 6.	Is time travel possible? “Rapid space travel and travel back in time can’t be ruled out according to our present understanding. It would cause great logical problems, so let’s hope there’s a Chronology Protection Law to prevent people going back and killing their parents. But science-fiction fans need not lose heart.”7.	Will we survive on earth? One of the most interesting question for me. He writes “I am convinced that humans need to leave earth. If we stay, we risk being annihilated.” “Clearly developing improved humans will create great social and political problems with respect to un-improved humans. I’m not advocating human genetic engineering as a good thing, I’m just saying that it is likely to happen in the next millennium, where we want it or not.”8.	Should we colonize space? Yes. 9.	Will artificial intelligence outsmart us? It is a legitimate worry. If AI would take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate, humans wouldn’t compete and would be superseded. Science fiction – no. “Just imagine if the world militaries are considering starting an arms race in autonomous weapon systems that can choose and eliminate their own targets, what is the likely end point and is that desirable for the human race.” This reminds me of a movie I saw years ago (War Games - 1983 - 7.1 on IMDb) in which a massive computer of that time calculates all of the outcomes from options of thermonuclear war. The conclusion, “The only way to win is not to play.” According to Hawking, “Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it. Let’s make sure that wisdom wins.” 10.	How do we shape the future? Not a coincidence that this is the last big question because it is the most important one. Hawking was a professed optimist but was able to look at the world and humankind and recognize the many threats we face. “A key element for [the brilliance of] Einstein was imagination. We need the spark of enquiry and wonder. But what lies ahead for those who are young now? I can say with confidence that their future will depend more on science and technology that any previous generation’s has done. We have a role to play in making sure this generation of children have not just the opportunity but the wish to engage fully with the study of science at an early level so that they can go on to fulfill their potential and create a better world for the whole human race. Without doubt, our world will change enormously in the next 50 years.“So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.”"
124,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,5,"Oh, man, I need to admit an embarrassing fact. It’s the first book by Stephen Hawking I’ve read so far. No, of course, I am familiar with his awesome achievements in science, but I had simply postponed reading his bestselling offerings for later. It’s just that Hawking’s discoveries and contributions are so frequently narrated in documentaries, films, quoted in other books. So this familiarity gave me a pretext to give my preference to other less known theoretical physicists. Without a doubt, practically all of them referenced Hawking in their works. Well, it happened to me before. I started reading Derek Parfit for the first time right after his passing in 2017. Parfit, in my humble opinion, is one of the greatest philosophers of the past century. His Reasons and Persons and On What Matters should be on your must-read list if you are interested in secular ethics and philosophy in general. Hard to admit, but I am starting to read another bright light in our human tribe only after that light has gone out. And the first book I started with is his posthumously published Brief Answers to the Big Questions. So let me be brief, too. The book starts with a forward by Eddie Redmayne, an actor who played Hawking in The Theory of Everything and is also known for his lead role in Fantastic Beasts. The book ends with a heartfelt afterword by Lucy Hawking (SH’s daughter). She touchingly describes the funeral procession followed by massive crowds in Cambridge: “I have never seen so many people so silent. With banners, flags, cameras and mobile phones held aloft, the huge numbers of people lining the streets stood in quiet respect as the head porter of Gonville and Caius, my father’s Cambridge college, dressed ceremonially in his bowler hat and carrying an ebony cane, walked solemnly along the street to meet the hearse and walk it to the church. My aunt squeezed my hand as we both burst into tears. “He would have loved this,” she whispered to me.”This outpouring of affection for the most recognizable personality in science is encouraging, to say the least. I’ve heard of an idea to put Hawking’s face on a £50 note. I think it’s a great choice. A bit ironic, though, given that Britain is now going through Brexit hell, something Hawking vehemently opposed. Now to the book itself. The questions Hawking addresses are fundamental for sentient beings in our spacetime. The first one is “Is there a God?” If you longed for a definitive answer as to whether Hawking believed in God, now you got it. The answer is no. As simple as that. Yes, he used the word quite a bit, but as he acknowledged in this book, what he meant was in an impersonal sense, like Einstein did, for the laws of nature, so knowing the mind of God is knowing the laws of nature. According to Hawking, we will know “the mind of God” by the end of this century. Now as it comes to religious faith, here’s his answer, “We are each free to believe what we want, and it’s my view that the simplest explanation is that there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realization: there is probably no heaven and afterlife either. I think belief in an afterlife is just wishful thinking. There is no reliable evidence for it, and it flies in the face of everything we know in science. I think that when we die we return to dust. But there’s a sense in which we live on, in our influence, and in our genes that we pass on to our children. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that I am extremely grateful.”Question No 2 is “How did it all begin?” Big Bang is a short preferred answer. It makes little sense to ask what happened before it, given Einstein’s general theory of relativity. According to general relativity, space and time are not absolute, not fixed background to events. Instead, they were dynamical quantities that were shaped by the matter and energy in the universe. They were defined only within the universe, so it made no sense to talk of a time before the universe began. It would be like asking for a point south of the South Pole. It is not defined. However, general relativity breaks down near the Big Bang and it is hard to reconcile with quantum mechanics, which handles electromagnetism and the two nuclear forces. Quantum theory is extremely adept at describing, for instance, what happens when a uranium atom decays, or when individual particles of light hit a solar cell. Quantum mechanics has led many scientists to strange places (and spaces). Like the idea of a quantum multiverse or many-worlds interpretation is an interpretation of quantum mechanics, introduced by Hugh Everett in 1957. It is now practically mainstream to say that our universe is likely to be just one in the infinite number of universes. Quantum one is just one possible multiverse. If you want to learn about other possible contenders, check out Tegmark’s My Mathematical Universe and Brian Greene’s Hidden Reality. Hawking himself seems to believe that a multiverse is possible. Alas, we will never be able to explore other universes. As it comes to the dole of our universe, it will end sooner or later. If the density of the universe is below the critical value, gravity is too weak to stop the galaxies flying apart. All the stars will burn out, and the universe will get emptier and emptier, and colder and colder. Sad, eh? Well, we still have some billions of years to go. Oh, I am speaking of the universe, not our species. Well, our lot is addressed in Chapter “Will we survive on Earth?” The short answer is no. The challenging question to all of us is what we could do about it. Asked “What is the biggest threat to the future of this planet?” Hawking replied:“An asteroid collision would be—a threat against which we have no defense. But the last big such asteroid collision was about sixty-six million years ago and killed the dinosaurs. A more immediate danger is runaway climate change. A rise in ocean temperature would melt the ice caps and cause the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide. Both effects could make our climate like that of Venus with a temperature of 250 degrees centigrade (482 degrees Fahrenheit).” The best chance we have to survive long-term is space exploration. Don’t keep your eggs in one basket. Invest in science. And try not to screw up the only home we have. There are other interesting subjects in the book: time travel, dangers of superintelligent AI, black holes (of course!), predicting the future. Not going to spoil the fun any more. Hawking is a brilliant mind. Will be greatly missed. We badly need science to be part of public conversation. Hawking’s death has left a gaping void. The only way we can survive the next hundred years is if voices of reason are heard. You know one of the solutions to the Fermi paradox (the lack of evidence and high probability estimates for the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations?) Maybe when civilizations reach a certain technological threshold, they accidentally self-destruct. Well, we are at the point when we are technologically capable to do it to ourselves. The question is: are we so dumb to do it? "

I picked this book to understand the view of a genius on the most fundamental question that has been debated over centuries and plagued me personally, ‘Is there a God?’. And it’s suffice to say that he did quench my thirst of curiosity. I am not someone who liked physics and I have always maintained a safe distance form it, part of the reason for that was the way I was taught physics in school but the author makes the most essential and complicated questions of the subject and their answers approachable. Like the author this book pushes its readers to cross the barrier of imagination and go beyond the bounds of common thought. And in the respect it can be both challenging and fun!The book serves as a mind opener to its readers because Hawking not only answers the big questions he also put forwards some key questions for the readers to ponder upon that could change the way one perceives the world.His writing style is not only easy to understand but also inspirational and humorous at times, and that’s what sets him apart from other greats of his field. Some of the analogies will make you wonder at the potential that a human brain holds at comparing and relating things. Though at times there is some repetition, which can be monotonous for a few, but in the end those repetitions help the author’s vision: of making science approachable and understandable to a common person.This book includes comments from those who knew Hawking’s well, his teacher, friend and family, which provides a fascinating insight into Hawking as a person.I would recommend this book to all because I believe this book can teach something to anyone who reads it. It’s a great final word from a man who will taught many the power of imagination and visualisation, whose sheer will continues to inspire others and whose theories will live on far into the future."
126,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007305-joel,5,"[review] What an excellent way to remember such a great mind. This book covers the main questions that readers ask - which usually leads them to “A Brief History of Time” (and consequently limping away confused. I intend to join this horde as ABHoT is on my reading list.) .Admittedly, there were moments where I had to push forward, trusting that the small bits of physics and cosmology that I had managed to comprehend would be enough to make sense of his arguments. That being said I’m also paying the price for not paying close enough attention in high school science classes. . I really enjoyed the way that Hawking would keep a strong flow of humour and popular references through his chapters. His theological views are not surprising, and yet they appear to have developed solely from arguing with fundamentalists - rather than scholars. His dismissal of the divine is based on the matter of “need.” I.E. a god/gods were the ones who made the universe work, and now science has shown that they’ve been made redundant. However this fails to engage with other important questions of ontology and being. (Compare with David Bentley Hart’s “the experience of God.”)That being said he admits that he is more focused on what science can prove, rather than making theological claims. .All in all it was enjoyable, and I’m looking forward to bashing my head against “A Brief History of Time.”"
127,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41269952-blindzider,4,"This book was in the process of being created while Hawking was still alive. It collects various writings from speeches and letters, answering common cosmology questions. He wasn't able to complete it before he died, but his estate did.Two things I garnered from this: 1) an update on some of the big cosmology/astrophysics questions. It's been awhile since I've kept up with the topic, so this was a good refresher. One idea that blew my mind was that time didn't exist before the big bang. Hard to wrap your mind around that but as long as you have a basic understanding of physics, Hawking explains it easily. Because these are ""brief answers"" they are summarized quickly and understandable. That brings me to 2) I'm sincerely going to miss Hawking's writing and his very presence in the science community and even pop culture. An inspiration in more ways than one, you truly get the sense of his optimism and outlook for humanity and science by reading this. His knowledge and ability is without question, and while I freely admit my rating is partially due to sentimentality, his writing style is so accessible and comforting I believe it is easily overlooked.His relentless pursuit of knowledge, desire to educate the public in science and quest for the continuation of humanity despite itself, were a standard we should all strive to reach."
128,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23294527-jas-reads,4," Opening up the thrill and wonder of scientific discovery [...] greatly increases the chances of finding and inspiring the new Einstein. Wherever SHE might be. I teared up at the 'she' a little bit, not gonna lie. As a woman in STEM, hearing someone like Prof. Hawking showing such faith means everything. When it comes to the book, I found it interesting, inspiring and sobering. He has a nice writing style, easy to follow thanks to the analogies he uses to explain complicated physics, and always with an underlying sense of humour. The book is divided in 10 Big Questions, where each is meant to be read individually. Because of this, if you read it all from start to finish, it can get a bit repetitive when he explains concepts again and again in each new section/Big Question, but other than that it's a nice little book. I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for super stimulating non-fiction science, but rather as an overview of where humanity is at currently, in terms of space investigation and the problems concerning us on the planet in the current climate, political, environmental, social, economic and scientific."
129,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36740745-anna-shelby,5,The final bookBrief Answers to the Big Questions unravels mysteries and gives answers to theoretical questions everyone one of us has asked themselves at least once.What’s the future of humanity?When can we finally time travel!Will we colonize space? Shouldwe colonize space?Does God exist and is there intelligent life in the universe?It’s written for everyone – understandable and easy. It’s a nice compilation with a foreword from (and read by) Eddie Redmayne. The afterword is from (and read by) his daughter Lucy.A large part of the book focusses on theoretical physics and black holes. But also talks about the responsibility we have as a species. Be it to our (ONLY) planet or to the quest beyond the borders of our solar system. I read it with mixed feelings – sad because it’s the last book by Stephen Hawking - and excited because I love Stephen Hawking talking about things he’s passionate about. Don’t miss out on this book. It’s a good start if you intend to read his other works!
130,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64939935-signe-cousins,5,"This 5-star rating is deceptive. I would give it 6, or 7, or maybe infinity. I have no idea why I have not read anything by Hawking before. I shall try to remedy this soon. But in a way I believe it is easy to start with his last, posthumously published book, because it covers all the subjects close to his heart, his wisdom and learning and ideas are crystallised, and the language is absolutely lucid, spiced with his lovely, deadpan jokes. A foreword by the actor Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything), an introduction by Professor Kip S. Thorne and an afterword the Lucy Hawking, the daughter, add nice touches and interesting information about the extraordinary life of the genius.""Some think that humanity today is the pinnacle of evolution, and that this is as good as its gets. I disagree. There ought to be something very special about the boundary conditions of our universe, and what can be more special than that there is no boundary. And there should be no boundary to human endeavour."""

And that's ok, because people like Stephen Hawking have been able to explain many things to me in layman's term, whew. This book, like his previous books, delves into subject matter that may feel slightly out of the ordinary person's reach and brings it right into our reach. There are interesting questions posed in this book and even more interesting answers to them. I will admit, some of the things Hawking brought up still went over my head but I blame that on me, the reader, not the author - perhaps this isn't a book for late night reading. Overall, a fascinating book. Stephen Hawking's whit and knowledge will certainly be missed but definitely not forgotten!"
132,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73724149-gustavo-leiva,5,"The book tackles some of the most obscure topics you can think of, with an approach that make it understandable for people that do not belong to these areas of expertise.I don't only appreciate Stephen Hawking's explanations but also his personal opinions on some of the topics which I found very insightful and inspiring.The content related to the existence of God may make you somewhat uncomfortable depending on your beliefs, but it is all addressed from a very respectful standpoint. He's providing his opinion and his answers based on all his knowledge and evidence. He's not trying to mess with religions at all, just answering a question he was asked.Regardless, this is a book that I feel everybody should read. Societies can do much better than today if we were more respectful of the planet and understand what the real priorities are and use our resources towards them.Hope you decide to read it and pass it on to the people you know. The world lost a massive mind with Stephen Hawking departure."

Listened at normal speed and still rewound sometimes. Classic astrophysics. This book made me like Hawking more. I didn’t love A Brief History of Time, mainly because it was over my head, so I’ve mostly turned to other science writers (mostly deGrasse Tyson) to get my fill of incomprehensible space stuffs. However, this book was comprehensible, wildly intelligent, and Hawking even had a dose of humility (at least relative to the average scientist making definitive claims about questions which scientists have repeatedly made incorrect definitive claims to for as long as science has existed). Anywho, this is probably my favorite book I’ve seen thus far in the genre of cosmology/ astrophysics/ “I still don’t get what a black hole is”. Assuming Prometheus is just a myth, and questions of origin, meaning, morality, and destiny can and should be answered by empirical science, Hawking is doing a great job."

A lot of researching gotta be done to understand the content of the book. Thus, I can't say much about the scientific explanations in this book but of course there were some discussion that I think was less realistic and not everyone is afford to accomplish.However, I do think this book is thought provoking. There were some analogies used for readers like me to understand what's being discussed a little bit better. Thank you Pansing for sending this book my way. Brief Answers to the Big Questions is available in all good bookstores and if you're interested in universe, big bang theory, science and a very curious person, you could try this out."
135,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12872086-sheeraz,5,"The title about says it all! This is a book about some of the big questions of our times, like nature and origin of universe, future of humanity, necessity of God's existence and so on. Stephen Hawking does a wonderful job of tackling these with minimal formalism making it palatable for us non-physicists. Some of the ideas are based on his research or at least related to cosmology, whereas some others are just a very smart person's ruminations (like the development and future of AI). Either way, the discussions and arguments are engaging with the central theme of encouraging engagement with science. I was also very touched by the notes from the people who knew him, and still in awe of all that he accomplished despite his constant struggle with his disabilities. The world is a little less awesome in his absence. If you like thinking about challenging problems, you should check this book out. "
136,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"Stephen Hawking's genius reminds us of the likes of Einstein. He believed that unlike what some may think, science can be made accessible for the general reader. According to him, while it is not ideal for everyone to be become a scientist as we need individuals with different skills, people still need to be scientifically literate no matter what profession they follow. In this book, he talks about a range of different topics involving the existence of god, what's inside a black hole, the future of AI, time travel and so forth.Hawking says that science has tried and successfully been able to answer some of the questions that religion has asked since the dawn of civilization. Questions like how did the universe begin? He considers questions like this 'the Big questions'. In the past, the answer to everything was 'God made it'. Nowadays, science provides better and more consistent answers. In about 300 BCE, a philosopher called Aristarchus was fascinated by eclipses, especially eclipses of the Moon. He was brave enough to question whether they really were caused by gods. Aristarchus was a true scientific pioneer. He studied the heavens carefully and reached a bold conclusion: he realised the eclipse was really the shadow of the Earth passing over the Moon, and not a divine event. If you accept that the laws of nature are fixed, then it doesn’t take long to ask: what role is there for God?Unlike what most people think, Hawking didn't believe in a personal God. He uses the word “God” in an impersonal sense, like Einstein did, for the laws of nature, so knowing the mind of God is knowing the laws of nature.He thinks the universe was spontaneously created out of nothing, according to the laws of science. The basic assumption of science is scientific determinism. The laws of science determine the evolution of the universe, given its state at one time.The problem of whether or not the universe had a beginning was a great concern to the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. He felt there were logical contradictions, or antimonies, either way. If the universe had a beginning, why did it wait an infinite time before it began. On the other hand, if the universe had existed for ever, why did it take an infinite time to reach the present stage?it was thought the universe was essentially constant in time. It might have existed for an infinite time, but that seemed to lead to absurd conclusions. If stars had been radiating for an infinite time, they would have heated up the universe until it reached their own temperature. Even at night, the whole sky would be as bright as the Sun, because every line of sight would have ended either on a star or on a cloud of dust that had been heated up until it was as hot as the stars. So the observation that we have all made, that the sky at night is dark, is very important. It implies that the universe cannot have existed for ever, in the state we see today.According to Hawking, There is a theory that says the reason we have not been contacted by extra-terrestrials is that when a civilisation reaches our stage of development it becomes unstable and destroys itself. So is the same doomed fate waiting for us? And finally here's a beautiful and inspiring quote from him:""remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future""."
137,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10091919-ali,4,"An insightful book to read which attempts to answer the most striking questions of today in the simplest manner possible. The book's chapters draws inspiration from half a million or so words stored over the decades in the form of essays, lectures, keynote speeches delivered by Stephen Hawking in form of the last published work. So what of the book itself? It’s divided into 10 chapters, each posing a different question. Three are open-ended: “What is inside a black hole?”, “How did it all begin?” and “How do we shape the future?”. The other seven are all yes/no questions, such as “Is there a God?”, “Is time travel possible?” and “Will we survive on Earth?”, all of which seduce the reader into thinking there will be easy answers. Except, as you might expect, it’s not that straightforward. The work is thought provoking and deserves a read with an open mind with optimism and hope! "

I may not have understood all that he has said in his documentaries or his book, but just the fact that a human being, despite all the odds not being in his favor, has contributed to understanding the universe and is considered Newton and Einstein's peer all done in borrowed time, is a super hero.To quote Obama, Have fun out there among the stars."

But he still manages to capture the reader with his humor, very well understandable and always new metaphors to deeply scientific topics and moving words.Due to relatively short chapters the book is easy to read and quite useful as an encyclopedia for all those overblown discussions we face in our ordinary everyday lifes. Nevertheless, I think there is one chapter everyone should have read – the one called “Will we survive on Earth?” - for the simple reason that it says a truth everyone should have in mind. You know what I mean. "

After that it was a delightful read about how this world should have actually progressed. The book didn't really change my opinion on any of the questions because I arrived at the same conclusions to all of them. I didn't really learn anything new but it was reassuring that some of the smartest people in the world agree with these answers and that there is no debate about it"

Mr.Hawkins is an atheist so he opines that before big bang there was nothing and any question about this can't be raised due to irrelevancy.

163,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7581603-chris,3,"OK..I enjoyed the book. My problems were that every chapter was a ""big question"" that he spent the chapter answering. However...most were not really answered. Hawking just danced around the the topic explaining everything about the topic, but most had no definitive answers. It felt like a lot of back and forth, but not really going anywhere.I understand maybe most didn't have a definitive answer, but he didn't really summarize at the end of each chapter which would have helped.Also...because he calls them ""brief"" answers, don't think that means written for laymen. It's still pretty complex. Luckily, I have just enough science background I was able to follow, but most without a decent science background would probably be lost."

169,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57425007-uma,5,Hawking has amazing insight. His ideas are expressed simply and humorously which makes the book entertaining and accessible to anyone. Hawking makes these abstract and scary questions about the future of humankind seem almost simple or insignificant because his thoughts are so well grounded. I will definitely be reading more of his books.

Answering to really relevant questions of the space and how it will impact our daily lives.Hawking mentioned why it is important to understand space and, funny enough, today SpaceX is launching its mission from USA - another step in space discovery.“When we see the Earth from space, we see ourselves as a whole. We see the unity, and not the divisions. It is such a simple image with a compelling message; one planet, one human race.”"

174,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5641357-richard-bunning,5,"This is a great read, despite some minor repetitions. We have to bear in mind that this is really only a series of essays, some of which cover a little of the same ground. My view is that if Hawking had lived a little longer then this would have been a better compiled set of ‘letters on the big questions’, but that doesn’t much detract from the quality of the work, and certainly not from its messages. These essays run a lot wider than science, into Hawking’s hopes and fears for humankind. Some of the essays run into sensitive issues, which raise a good deal of honest debate. Well, there are just too many of us on our wonderful planet, which we are rapidly destroying, and this alone must justify our questioning of everything, even the very existence of God.There are a few contradictions in the science, which isn’t surprising when writing about an incredibly quickly advancing field of science, cosmology, and especially when the material was compiled from words written over some spread of time. Inevitably the gravitas, the gravity of Hawking’s thoughts are also less than perfectly modulated. I was only too pleased to read every single word despite my minor criticisms.I must add though that for me the finest words in this book were actually penned by his daughter, Lucy, in the Afterword. I quote from the many pearls among them. “I think he would have been very proud of this book.” This collection tells us a little about Hawking as a political animal, being in part autobiographical, and given yet greater insight into the man by the biography content of the other contributors. We have had a ‘Brief History of Time’, which is now augmented by this brief and personal feeling encounter with the brave genius in the electrically powered chair. Alas, the book is all too brief, and doomed now to a steady state of content, unlike our dynamic and cosmically unstable universe."

178,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,2,"Eh. Hawking gives answers to the big questions in this posthumous book and they're mostly what you'd expect. Where does it all come from, black holes and the big bang, does God exist. There's some stuff about Trump and Brexit and AI but nothing very earth-shattering. "
179,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32149770-linda,4,"It was an interesting and enjoyable book, but for a “science noob” like me, a few topics were a bit to hard. "

182,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3578135-mylinh-v,5,"Prof. Hawking is a brilliant and humble thinker, with great humour. The topic discussed in the book is highly complex, and you will need to research a lot to (maybe fully) understand what he mentioned, but he tried to explain the matter with real life examples that make it a bit easier to grasp the concept. It's a book that I deeply enjoy, even though I have to admit I didn't manage to fully fathom the most parts of it."
183,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12594799-subodh,3,"I gave up on 'A Brief History of Time' after the first few pages, feeling all the more ashamed for my failure as I happen to have an M.Sc. in Physics from one of the top institutions in India. This book is far more accessible and the effort of the author (and the editor) to keep the language simple shows. At places it appears as if the author is talking to children.I was disappointed as the book didn't give me a new perspective on anything - cosmology, nature of time, God, AI, future of mankind etc. It mostly covers familiar ground. The press has made much of the assertion 'There is no God'. The logic used by Hawking is simple - a creator, by definition, exists in time before the created object. As the mathematical model of the cosmos shows, however, time didn't exist before the creation of the universe, so there couldn't have been a creator of the universe before it.I would, however, recommend this book to people who are both fascinated and daunted by Hawking's larger than life image. It would be an accessible peep into one of the finest minds of our generation and tell them interesting things about the topics covered in the book, if they haven't already read about them elsewhere."
184,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104765258-david,5,"Stephen gets right to the point. The first question: ""Is there a God?"" Followed by: ""How did it all begin?"" He fully explains how Quantum allows some Positive Energy (=mc^2 aka galaxies and planets) added to some Negative Energy (Space = vacuum energy of expansion) to still add up to zero. Thus the birth of the Universe preserved the conservation of energy.This is serious science here. The title says ""brief"", not ""simple"". It is very beneficial for this to NOT be your first venture into astrophysics. Definitely read Stephen's other book: ""A Brief History of TIme"". And Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" (focus on the astrophysics chapters). And even read something(s) by Michio Kaku, Brian Cox, Lisa Randall, Isaac Asimov, Carl Sagan, John Gribbin, Timothy Ferris, Simon Singh,.Now, you're ready for ""Brief Answers to Big Questions"".DeGrasse-Tyson's ""Astrophysics for People in a Hurry"" is similarly strong like this book. Both of these thin volumes mislead by shortness and no intimidating equations. But you better have your astrophysics hat on tight to read both of these books.He went deep into question 5 about black holes, but I'll certainly allow myself to read this chapter twice. Stephen lies buried between Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin with the Entropy of a Black Hole equation engraved on his tombstone (S=Akc^3 / 4Gh-bar). One would never know that we knew so much about these Black Holes!He gives credit to his teachers:""When each of us thinks about what we can do in life, chances are we can do it because of a teacher.""Stephen describes the necessity to colonize space.""We can make interstellar travel a long-term aim - in the next 200 to 500 years.""With Hawking wit, he describes the current rocket speed limitations of today and how the NEAREST star system (Alpha Centauri) would take 70,000 years of travel at the speed of Voyager. (Alpha Centauri is 4.37 light-years distance)""If there are beings alive on Alpha Centauri today, they remain blissfully ignorant of the rise of Donald Trump.""Then Stephen describes a plan starting with nano-size spacecraft that could reach speeds of 0.2c and be there in 20 years.Tempered with this optimism, is his realism about the world today: Earth resources draining too quickly. Climate change. Reduction of the polar ice caps. Deforestation. Over-population. Disease. War. Famine. Lack of water. Decimation of animal species. Yet in classic Hawking fashion, finishes this list with: ""These are all solvable but so far have not been solved.""Each of the 10 questions in the book gets enough devoted space, and always has a wrap-up summary at the conclusion to come back to the original question.""It matters that you don't just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future."" Thank you Stephen!"
185,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18935227-brenda,5,"I usually don't read nonfiction, but my friend gave me this book. I gave it a go. It is super interesting. It was easy to follow, even if I'm not particularly literate in cosmology and astrophysics. I'm going to summarise here the answers to the big questions, including some direct quotes. Of course, if you want to know Hawking's arguments and reasoning in detail, please read the book.*SPOILERS AHEAD*1. Is there a God?No. ""No one created the universe and no one directs our fate"".2. How did it all begin?""The universe began in a Big Bang, a point where the whole universe and everything in it were scrunched up into a single point of infinite density, a space-time singularity"".3. Is there other intelligent life in the universe?There are at least four possibilities: a) no, there is only life in Earth; b) there is other life in the universe but not intelligent; c) yes, but these intelligent life has destroyed itself; d) ""there are other forms of intelligent life out there, but we have been over-looked"" (Hawking prefers this fourth possibility).4. Can we predict the future?""No, and yes. In principle, the laws [governing the universe] allow us to predict the future. But in practice the calculations are often too difficult"".5. What is inside a black hole?""One can't tell from the outside what is inside a black hole, apart from its mass, electric charge and rotation. This means that a black hole must contain a lot of information that is hidden from the outside world"". But if you are a person falling into one, you will most likely find death.6. Is time travel possible?In 2009, Hawking held a party for time travellers. To ensure that only genuine time travellers came, he sent the invitations after the party. No one came. However, ""rapid space travel and travel back in time can't be ruled out according to our present understanding. They would cause great logical problems"".7. Will we survive on Earth?""The Earth is under threat from so many areas that it is difficult [...] to be positive"".8. Should we colonise space?""We need to explore the solar system to find out where humans could live"".9. Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?""If computers continue to obay Moore's Law, doubling their speed and memory capacity every eighteen months, the result is that computers are likely to overtake humans in intelligence at some point in the next hundred years"". 10. How do we shape the future?Through education and the use of technology. ""The Internet connects us all together like neurons in a giant brain. And with such an IQ, what cannot we be capable of?"""
186,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96058250-ibrahim-ziyad,4,"His last book was an awsome one. Simple, short, and wonderful. Stephen Hawking shares some of the most important questions which are still unaswered. It consists of ten chapters.Each chapter begins with a question, through which he tries to give a reasonable answer with his knowledge and philosophy. You may not agree with all of them, that's OK, so long as there are no definitive answers to them.I think everyone should read this book, if you didn't agree with his answers, at least you would think about an answer."
187,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10486977-themadhatter,4,"This is one of the last published works that Mr Hawking worked on to bring his writings/musings together in one volume. It is a really easy book to read and covers ten ""big"" questions. Some of these questions were really just musings/personal beliefs such as ""Is there a God?"", ""Will we survive on Earth?"", ""Should we colonise space?"", ""Will artificial intelligence outsmart us?"" and ""How do we shape the future"" and while they were interesting to read, they were in essence one person's beliefs and not something I couldn't see myself re-reading. However, the other chapters which had a bit more punch/science behind them such as ""How did it all begin?"", ""Is there other intelligent life in the universe?"", ""Can we predict the future?"", ""What is inside a black hole?"", ""Is time travel possible?"" were ones I thoroughly enjoyed and could see myself reading again and while they are not at all heavy (very pop-science here), there were still a few interesting explanations which I had not thought of before to explain concepts that I want to ponder a bit more and to maybe apply in my own work. Things such as negative energy, why 3D of space (linked to Newton's universal law of gravitation) and a neat explanation on the UV catastrophe. Overall though, the coverage is quite light and people wanting a lot of depth will be left wanting more.The only thing I was disappointed in was that he was still exclusively giving credit for the discovery of DNA to Watson and Crick - with no mention AT ALL of Rosalind Franklin....sigh!At the end of the day, this is the perfect blend of the person and the science and I would definitely recommend to anyone interested in knowing more about either.

188,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,3,"Stephen Hawking's life is an inspiration to the world. His accomplishments and contributions rank him with Einstein, Newton, Darwin, and the rest of history's greatest scientists. His achievements are even more astounding when one considers the degree of physical disability that has afflicted him nearly his entire adult life.This short book is simply his musings on ten big questions facing modern man. Some of his responses went way over my head, making my realize again how relatively intellectually challenged I am. His responses to several other questions were deeply philosophical and thought provoking. He mentions several times that he is an optimist, yet I repeatedly felt overwhelmed by the seriousness of some of the problems and threats that he explains await us and our posterity.This was an enjoyable and short read that most people who have even a mild understanding and interest in science could learn from and appreciate. I particularly enjoyed this passage: 
I have led an extraordinary life on this planet, while at the same time travelling across the universe by using my mind and the laws of physics. I have been to the furthest reaches of our galaxy, travelled into a black hole and gone back to the beginning of time. On Earth, I have experienced highs and lows, turbulence and peace, success and suffering. I have been rich and poor, I have been able-bodied and disabled. I have been praised and criticized, but never ignored. I have been enormously privileged, through my work, in being able to contribute to our understanding of the universe. But it would be an empty universe indeed if it were not for the people I love, and who love me. Without them, the wonder of it all would be lost on me.

Often that spark comes from a teacher.” -p201“If you look behind every exceptional person, there is an exceptional teacher.

I can say with confidence that their future will depend more on science and technology than any previous generation’s has done. They need to know more about science more than any before them because it is part of their daily lives in an unprecedented way.” -p203“...all young people should be familiar with and confident around scientific subjects, whatever they choose to do.

191,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63496776-chris-rousell,2,"Sadly disappointing. Hawking is eminently readable but this work is edited rather poorly. On no less than 5 occasions does Hawking spell out what is meant by the Uncertainty Principle (each time explaining it as if it's the first time he'd ever mentioned it)He twice posits Einstein's 'God does not play dice with the universe'. Some answers to questions aren't really answers at all (e.g. answering whether humanity should colonise space by explaining how nanobots could travel quickly in space)At multiple points answering questions from a previous chapter- in the final chapter Hawking attempts brief explanations as to why we should be concerned about AI and why humanity should colonise space, both questions he gives entire chapters to.Philosophically Hawking is very weak and oftentimes contradictory- stating that scientists cannot believe that scientific laws can be broken but that at certain points in space-time the laws themselves break down. Conveniently for Hawking, it is in reference to God that scientists can't believe in the suspension of scientific law but on the subject of black holes that they should. On the dangers of AI is where Hawking is at his strongest but the rest of the work is sadly lacking in the quality one expects from a mind as gifted as his. "

Most of the stuff you probably know already, if you care about science. I mean, I literally got nothing new out of the book. Also, even on a scientific level, some of the answers are a bit unsatisfactory. Is it a good book? Yeah, it is well written and if you are up for some personal opinions and thoughts, great.

Is there other intelligent life in the universe?3. What is inside a black hole?4. Is time travel possible?5. Will we survive on earth?6. Will Artificial Intelligence Outsmart us?While he acknowledges that not all people should be scientists, Hawking suggests that all young people make an effort to be scientifically literate. Potential catastrophe facing planet earth: Climate change, threat of a nuclear war, over-population, irresponsible development of AI, pollution, decimation of animal species, draining of physical resources etc can be better addressed with a scientifically literate society.

194,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65436618-sophy-h,5,"A really enjoyable and surprisingly accessible read. The final musings of the legendary Stephen Hawking answer the ""big questions"" of life on Earth, life beyond Earth and into the future. Hawking uses language understandable by all. I didn't feel patronised by the use of ""physics speak"" or scientific jargon. Stephen's wit and wry humour come through in the writing, especially when he references Brexit and Trump (he clearly wasn't a fan of either!) Also, the enthusiasm and exuberance he had for adventure and discovery is evident in the writing. Stephen clearly never lost his wonder for the great Universe. A very lovely foreword by Eddie Redmayne and afterword by Hawking's daughter Lucy. Well recommended. "

Portions of the audiobook are Hawking responding to questions in interviews, which makes me want to encourage the listening to rather than reading of this one. I LOVE reading Hawking's writing aimed at the general public. Overall I find it encouraging, exciting, and joyful. This book was the same. It's a very imaginative book but based on hard, factual information, with considerations of liklihoods based in today's political and cultural atmosphere. His thoughts about ""God"" as a series of natural laws was stated beautifully, and his ideas about the challenges and needed focuses for humans today was excellent and gave me ideas on how to alter my current work with the public. I'm definitely going to be coming back to this book for reference material and encouraging people to read it. "

As a New Scientist reader and someone who (just about) scraped a rather average degree in Physics was not a huge about I learnt. But enjoyed every single page. Reminds you (as if it were needed) what a incredible mind the world lost. One of the greatest scientific minds humanity has known, but with the amazing gift of explaining things simply (have never read such a simple description of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle). Wonderful analogies used throughout make this really approachable. And last, but by no means least, interspersed with his wonderful humour. “I don’t believe in the conspiracy theory, I much prefer the cock up theory....”. His ashes now are interred in Westminster Abbey between Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin. What a monument to the wonder of British scientific brilliance. "

It's clear that Hawking was very optimistic about the human race and hopeful that we will rise above our flaws and imperfections. I hope that we will live up to those expectations and shape the future in which many new generations will have a chance to flourish."

It is still something hard for me to stomach, as these whole thing is free lunch. This should be still be a good read for physics lovers and general readers. Recommended! "
205,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56732867-louise,5,"Such an inspirational man. Easy to read and I understood what he was saying despite not being a scientist, I felt it was well written for the layperson. Prophetic in parts too! "
206,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39390256-rebekah-byson,2,"As inspiring as Hawking's personal life was, I found most of the ideas and speculations in this slim book to be on the silly side. I was imagining a serious book on various science topics, but instead the book seemed juvenile and over generalized. Not a science book at all (especially since there is zero sources cited or notes or anything), this book was more a collection of random and repetitive ideas on futuristic sci-fi topics."
207,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61197974-eva-s-ar,4,"4 out of 5 starsStephen Hawking's wit and insight truly shine in this book that provides answers to questions that have surely crossed most people's minds. This is a good place to start if you have an interest in science, and especially cosmology, and would like to know more about the perspective of one of the most recognizable figures in the scientific community.Happy reading!"
208,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2602702-christina-a-reader-of-fictions,3,"Liked this much more than I expected! I'd thought it would be way past my ability to understand but Hawking's style is entertaining, and he's pretty good at explaining complex physics in a way that's actually sense-making. I like to step outside of my usual choices a few times a year, and this was a good choice. Although it does increase anxiety about the state of the world big time."

219,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31854123-kristy-kiefer,4,"What a read!! I really enjoyed this. It was challenging, and witty, and mind-boggling, and overall a really engaging read that gave me so much more of an appreciation for Stephen Hawking's mind. I did have to take notes to keep all the ideas he was bringing up in order, but that was part of the fun of reading it for me. Also, I took notes at the end of each chapter to remember a bit of what I read. Here are those! ------------------------------1 . IS THERE A GOD? Loved it. Took some focus but I could eventually grasp what what he was saying and it was like this super trippy, awesome mindfuck. It seems people (Christians. Evangelicals.) often get up in arms about Hawking, as if he's rude and disrespectful for just stating his own beliefs. I found that entirely not the case. ""Since we know the universe itself was once very small - perhaps smaller than a proton - this means something quite remarkable. It means the universe itself, in all its mind-boggling vastness and complexity, could simply have popped into existence without violating the known laws of nature.""------------------------------2. HOW DID IT ALL BEGIN?I found this chapter more difficult to track along with. It got very science-y (I had to take notes while reading lol). It felt a bit out of my depth. Also like. How do we just DECIDE that imaginary time is legit?? (just googled it. imaginary does not mean fantasy)""Hamlet was quite right. We could be bounded in a nutshell and count ourselves kings of infinite space.""------------------------------3. IS THERE OTHER INTELLIGENT LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE?Easier than chapter 2. Interesting to see Hawking's thoughts about intelligent life's future, and how reading and external data sharing has, in a sense, sped up evolution. ""I would like to speculate a little on the development of life in the universe, and in particular on the development of intelligent life. I shall take this to include the human race, even though much of its behavior throughout history has been pretty stupid and not calculated to aid the survival of the species.""------------------------------4. CAN WE PREDICT THE FUTURE?A shorter chapter that I understood, sort of. It made me look up more videos on quantum mechanics to understand why we can't pinpoint particles in speed / location ( The Uncertainty Principle). It boggled and intrigued me in equal parts! ""In principle the laws [governing the universe] allow us to predict the future. But in practice the calculations are often too difficult.""------------------------------5. WHAT IS INSIDE A BLACK HOLE?Lots and lots! I started to get lost towards the end of this chapter, with all the talk about supertranslations, but to be honest I think that's because the science is so new it's difficult to find ANY simplified explanation out there. Trust me, I tried. I did like the bits with Bekenstein though - I was riveted!! ""If you want to explore the inside of a black hole, make sure you choose a big one.""------------------------------6. IS TIME TRAVEL POSSIBLE?Another DENSE chapter, but intriguing! I like that it's not completely ruled out, but Hawking does a good job of dispelling the ""easy"" ways we might think it could happen, while suggesting a much more complicated - but successful - possibility might exist.""There's hope in M-Theory.""------------------------------7. WILL WE SURVIVE ON EARTH?I really enjoyed this chapter. Less number-y, more contemplating future human life from a sociological? Anthropological viewpoint. The biggest threats to earth are astroids and climate change. Hawking is honest and blunt about what a dangerous place we are in. But I appreciate his tone of optimism, even after laying out all the danger. HIS optimism, specifically, is a motivation and a gift.""We have the technology. We just need the political will."" ------------------------------8. SHOULD WE COLONISE SPACE?I'm just loving these later chapter's that speak more directly to future human life than theoretical physics (not that I didn't find those chapters mind-bogglingly intriguing!) Hawking ignites space curiosity. And optimism. And wonder. Let us boldly go!!! ""So far, so possible.""------------------------------9. WILL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OUTSMART US?Not the most interesting chapter to me. Felt a little repetitive. Still though, curious to think about this future. I'm not so sure humans are noble enough to use AI for good. We'll likely fuck it up, imo. ""In short, the advent of super-intelligent AI would be either the best or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity.""Bonus: ""We spend a great deal of time studying history, which, let's face it, is mostly the history of stupidity.""------------------------------10. HOW DO WE SHAPE THE FUTURE?A summarizing final chapter, advocating for better science education and endless wonder towards our universe. ""So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future."" "
220,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48439302-jingyao-liu,4,"The first half of this book focuses on the basics of astrophysics and relies on recurring physics theories that had lasting impact on scientific debates in the area (e.g. General Relativity, Second law of Thermodynamics, String Theory). The second half focuses on Hawking’s forward-looking predictions and personal beliefs on general scientific matter, like the future of environmental destruction, nuclear weapons, AI and space exploration. Certainly a short read that would spark a non-scientist’s curiosity on science. Some notes on each of the 10 answers:1. IS THERE A GOD? 2. HOW DID IT ALL BEGIN?The creation of the universe required matter, energy and space, and mass is a kind of energy according to E=mc^2. Space and energy were spontaneously created out of nothing, because Big Bang created equal amounts of positive and negative energy (stored in space) that add up to zero.At the scale of protons, particles behave according to quantum mechanics and can appear at random. The universe was once a single infinitesimally small and dense black hole. Being very small, it could behave like protons and pop into existence randomly, and nothing had to cause Big Bang. if the universe adds up to nothing then you don’t need a God to create it. To say the laws are the work of God is more a definition of God than a proof of his existence. These laws may have been decreed by God, but he cannot intervene to break the laws.Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are moving away from each other. Moreover, the further they were from us, the faster they were moving away. In other words, the universe is expanding. We can estimate that they must have been very close together indeed, about 10 to 15 billion years ago. So it looks as though the universe might have started then, with everything being at the same point in space.The concept of time only exists within our universe. Asking what came before the Big Bang is like asking what is south of the South Pole. There can be no cause for the Big Bang and no creator, because there is no time for them to exist in before the Big Bang. 3. IS THERE OTHER INTELLIGENT LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE?On the evolution of our intelligence: At first, evolution proceeded by natural selection, from random mutations. This Darwinian phase lasted about three and a half billion years and produced us, during which the rate of biological evolution in humans is about 1 bit/year a year. In the last 10,000 years or so, since we developed language to exchange information, the external record—in books and other long-lasting forms of storage—has grown enormously, and the rate at which useful information can be added is millions, if not billions, higher than with DNA. We have entered a new phase of evolution. In M-theory, space has ten dimensions, but it is thought that seven of the ten spatial directions are curled up very small, leaving three directions that are large and nearly flat. It is like a drinking straw. The surface of a straw is two-dimensional. However, one direction is curled up into a small circle, so that from a distance the straw looks like a one-dimensional line.Robert Hooke discovered the inverse square law: when the distance between two bodies is multiplied by x, the gravitational attraction between them is divided by x^2. This leads to stable planetary orbits. But in a four-dimensional space, gravitation would obey an inverse cube law, preventing planets from having stable orbits around their suns and electrons from having stable orbits in atoms. Matter as we know it would not exist in such a space and only histories with three flat directions will contain intelligent beings.If other intelligent life exists in the universe, why haven’t they come visit us? (They would make their visits a lot more obvious than vague UFOs, likely with detrimental impacts on earthlings.) According to the Anthropic Principle, it is likely that evolution is a random process, with intelligence as only one of a large number of possible outcomes. Maybe the probability of life spontaneously appearing is so low that Earth is the only planet in the galaxy—or in the observable universe—on which it happened. Or, other planets in the galaxy, on which life has developed, may not have had a long enough collision-free period to evolve intelligent beings. Or perhaps it is inevitable for intelligent beings to lead themselves to destruction past a certain level of intelligence, as us humans could be heading towards.4. CAN WE PREDICT THE FUTURE?(Hawking’s answer takes on a different angle from what non-astrophysicists may expect. This section is on whether we can predict the future position and speed of a particle, knowing its past/current position and speed, or rather, how scientific theories on this matter have evolved.)Laplace’s classical view says that if one knows a particle’s position and speed at one time, the particle’s future motion is completely determined. Then came Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, which shows that one could not know both the position and the speed accurately. However, it was still possible to predict one combination of position and speed, in the form of the wave function. But even this limited predictability might disappear if black holes are taken into account.5 WHAT IS INSIDE A BLACK HOLE?(If you’re used to the Earth and never imagined a scenario where an object being thrown upwards may just escape gravity and not fall back down, the basics of black hole is quite interesting to read about.)If the initial upwards velocity were greater than some critical value, called the escape velocity, gravity would never be strong enough to stop the particle, and it would get away. The escape velocity is just over 11 kilometres per second for the Earth, low compared to the speed of light, which is 300,000 kilometres per second. Michell argued that there could be stars that were much more massive than the Sun which had escape velocities greater than the speed of light. We would not be able to see them, because any light they sent out would be dragged back by gravity. Thus they would be what Michell called dark stars, what we now call black holes.For a sufficiently large star the gravitational attraction between particles can dominate over all other forces and lead to gravitational collapse and creates a so-called black hole. The Einstein equations can’t be defined at a singularity. This means that at this point of infinite density one can’t predict the future. This implies that something strange could happen whenever a star collapsed.A black hole is a region where gravity is so strong that light cannot escape. A black hole has a boundary called the event horizon. It is where gravity is just strong enough to drag light back and prevent it from escaping. The event horizon itself contains the information needed to tell us about what has fallen into the black hole in a way that goes beyond these three characteristics the black hole has.The particles that come out of a black hole seem to be completely random and to bear no relation to what fell in. It appears that the information about what fell in is lost, apart from the total amount of mass and the amount of rotation. As particles escape from a black hole, the hole will lose mass and shrink. This will increase the rate of emission of particles. Eventually, the black hole will lose all its mass and disappear.6 IS TIME TRAVEL POSSIBLE?All the evidence is that the universe started out in the Big Bang without the kind of warping needed to allow travel into the past. Since we can’t change the way the universe began, the question of whether time travel is possible is one of whether we can subsequently make space–time so warped that one can go back to the past.All we need for time travel is a spaceship that will go faster than light. Unfortunately in the same paper Einstein showed that the rocket power needed to accelerate a spaceship got greater and greater the nearer it got to the speed of light. So it would take an infinite amount of power to accelerate past the speed of light.How to get around the kill-thy-grandfather paradox: -The consistent-histories approach: on this view you couldn’t set out on the rocket ship to travel into the past unless you had already come back and failed to blow up the launch pad. It is a consistent picture, but it would imply that we were completely determined: we couldn’t change our minds. So much for free will.-The alternative-histories approach: when the traveller returns from the future he enters another alternative history. The idea is that according to quantum theory the universe doesn’t just have a unique single history. Instead the universe has every single possible history, each with its own probability.In conclusion, rapid space travel and travel back in time can’t be ruled out according to our present understanding. They would cause great logical problems, so let’s hope there’s a Chronology Protection Law to prevent people going back and killing their parents. But science-fiction fans need not lose heart. There’s hope in M-theory.7 WILL WE SURVIVE ON EARTH?Hawking thinks either a nuclear confrontation or environmental catastrophe will cripple the Earth at some point in the next 1,000 years. He expects that within the next hundred years we will be able to travel anywhere in the solar system, except maybe the outer planets. It is up to scientists and innovative commercial entrepreneurs to to promote the excitement and wonder of space travel.8 SHOULD WE COLONIZE SPACE?(The obvious answer is yes, given his thoughts in the previous question: we need to find somewhere else to live before Earth becomes uninhabitable. This section provides a useful summary on different planets’ suitability for living and our current progress and obstacles with space colonization projects.)The Moon and Mars are the most suitable sites for space colonies in the solar system. The Moon could be a base for travel to the rest of the solar system. Mars is the obvious next target. We must be careful not to contaminate Mars with life from Earth nor bring back any Martian life as we have no resistance to it and it might wipe out life on Earth. But what about boldly going beyond the solar system? Our observations indicate that a significant fraction of stars have planets around them. Travelling to these candidate worlds isn’t possible perhaps with today’s technology, but by using our imagination we can make interstellar travel a long-term aim—in the next 200 to 500 years. The speed at which we can send a rocket is governed by two things, the speed of the exhaust and the fraction of its mass that the rocket loses as it accelerates. The exhaust speed of chemical rockets, like the ones we have used so far, is about three kilometres per second. By jettisoning 30 per cent of their mass, they can achieve a speed of about half a kilometre per second and then slow down again. According to NASA, it would take as little as 260 days to reach Mars, give or take ten days, with some NASA scientists predicting as little as 130 days. But it would take three million years to get to the nearest star system. To go faster would require a much higher exhaust speed than chemical rockets can provide, that of light itself. A powerful beam of light from the rear could drive the spaceship forward. Nuclear fusion could provide 1 per cent of the spaceship’s mass energy, which would accelerate it to a tenth of the speed of light. Beyond that, we would need either matter–antimatter annihilation or some completely new form of energy.Hawking co-founded Breakthrough Starshot, a long-term research and development programme aimed at making interstellar travel a reality. The project depends its success on three breakthrough technological concepts: miniaturised spacecraft, light propulsion and phase-locked lasers. The engineering challenges are immense, and this would not be human interstellar travel, even if it could be scaled up to a crewed vessel. But it would be the moment when human culture goes interstellar, when we finally reach out into the galaxy. But if Breakthrough Starshot should send back images of a habitable planet orbiting our closest neighbour, it could be of immense importance to the future of humanity.9 WILL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OUTSMART US?When an artificial intelligence becomes better than humans at AI design, so that it can recursively improve itself without human help, we may face an intelligence explosion that ultimately results in machines whose intelligence exceeds ours by more than ours exceeds that of snails. A super-intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren’t aligned with ours we’re in trouble. You’re probably not an evil ant-hater who steps on ants out of malice, but if you’re in charge of a hydroelectric green-energy project and there’s an anthill in the region to be flooded, too bad for the ants. Let’s not place humanity in the position of those ants.It’s tempting to dismiss the notion of highly intelligent machines as mere science fiction, but this would be a mistake, and potentially our worst mistake ever.Recently, world militaries are considering starting an arms race in autonomous weapon systems that can choose and eliminate their own targets. Given concerns about our ability to maintain long-term control of ever more advanced AI systems, we should not arm them and turn over our defense to them.10 HOW DO WE SHAPE THE FUTURE?I believe the future of communication is brain–computer interfaces. There are two ways: electrodes on the skull and implants. The first is like looking through frosted glass, the second is better but risks infection. If we can connect a human brain to the internet it will have all of Wikipedia as its resource.I am sure that during this century people will discover how to modify both intelligence and instincts like aggression. Laws will probably be passed against genetic engineering with humans. But some people won’t be able to resist the temptation to improve human characteristics, such as size of memory, resistance to disease and length of life. Once such superhumans appear, there are going to be major political problems with the unimproved humans, who won’t be able to compete. Presumably, they will die out, or become unimportant. Instead, there will be a race of self-designing beings, who are improving themselves at an ever-increasing rate.Machines will become be a new form of life, based on mechanical and electronic components rather than macromolecules. They could eventually replace DNA-based life, just as DNA may have replaced an earlier form of life.We have two options for the future of humanity as I see it: the exploration of space for alternative planets on which to live and the positive use of artificial intelligence to improve our world."
221,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,5,"""..trying might turn out to be the most important part of courage.” This was a much easier read compared to other Stephen's books (i.e. universe in a nutshell), maybe because the struggle with those is already behind and some topics are starting to make sense. Most surprising that I was not aware and might just be an impression from this book, but he seemed to concern a lot about BREXIT and Trump and how those move the Doomsday clock closer to midnight. There is strong hope to get to the theory of everything in the next 1000 years, but I do hope that we get to Mars much sooner than in 50 years. Hawking is probably one of the very few people who can kill a question by just saying that it's stupid and I would not mind...“I don’t believe in boundaries, either for what we can do in our personal lives or for what life and intelligence can accomplish in our universe. We stand at a threshold of important discoveries in all areas of science. Without doubt, our world will change enormously in the next fifty years. We will find out what happened at the Big Bang. We will come to understand how life began on Earth. We may even discover whether life exists elsewhere in the universe. While the chances of communicating with an intelligent extra-terrestrial species may be slim, the importance of such a discovery means we must not give up trying. We will continue to explore our cosmic habitat, sending robots and humans into space. We cannot continue to look inwards at ourselves on a small and increasingly polluted and overcrowded planet. Through scientific endeavour and technological innovation, we must look outwards to the wider universe, while also striving to fix the problems on Earth. And I am optimistic that we will ultimately create viable habitats for the human race on other planets. We will transcend the Earth and learn to exist in space.This is not the end of the story, but just the beginning of what I hope will be billions of years of life flourishing in the cosmos.And one final point—we never really know where the next great scientific discovery will come from, nor who will make it. Opening up the thrill and wonder of scientific discovery, creating innovative and accessible ways to reach out to the widest young audience possible, greatly increases the chances of finding and inspiring the new Einstein. Wherever she might be.So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.” “People want answers to the big questions, like why we are here. They don’t expect the answers to be easy, so they are prepared to struggle a bit. When people ask me if a God created the universe, I tell them that the question itself makes no sense. Time didn’t exist before the Big Bang so there is no time for God to make the universe in. It’s like asking for directions to the edge of the Earth—the Earth is a sphere that doesn’t have an edge, so looking for it is a futile exercise.Do I have faith? We are each free to believe what we want, and it’s my view that the simplest explanation is that there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realisation: there is probably no heaven and afterlife either. I think belief in an afterlife is just wishful thinking. There is no reliable evidence for it, and it flies in the face of everything we know in science. I think that when we die we return to dust. But there’s a sense in which we live on, in our influence, and in our genes that we pass on to our children. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that I am extremely grateful.” “I have led an extraordinary life on this planet, while at the same time travelling across the universe by using my mind and the laws of physics. I have been to the furthest reaches of our galaxy, travelled into a black hole and gone back to the beginning of time. On Earth, I have experienced highs and lows, turbulence and peace, success and suffering. I have been rich and poor, I have been able-bodied and disabled. I have been praised and criticised, but never ignored. I have been enormously privileged, through my work, in being able to contribute to our understanding of the universe. But it would be an empty universe indeed if it were not for the people I love, and who love me. Without them, the wonder of it all would be lost on me.” “The problem is, most people believe that real science is too difficult and complicated for them to understand. But I don’t think this is the case. To do research on the fundamental laws that govern the universe would require a commitment of time that most people don’t have; the world would soon grind to a halt if we all tried to do theoretical physics. But most people can understand and appreciate the basic ideas if they are presented in a clear way without equations, which I believe is possible and which is something I have enjoyed trying to do throughout my life.”“In short, the advent of super-intelligent AI would be either the best or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity. The real risk with AI isn’t malice but competence. A super-intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren’t aligned with ours we’re in trouble.” “The human race does not have a very good record of intelligent behaviour.” “While there’s life, there is hope.” “I am very aware of the preciousness of time. Seize the moment. Act now.” "
222,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52996488-andres-sanchez,5,"I read this book directly after finishing ""A brief history of time"". I find the author's story quite impressive, he is a person that faced unbelievable adversity and still pushed his boundaries to achieve great things. It is a really inspiring story.My favorite phrase from the book: “After my expectations had been reduced to zero, every new day became a bonus, and I began to appreciate everything I did have. While there’s life, there is hope”. Every one of us should try to live more like that without the need of something bad happening.I will try to make a brief summary of the big questions addressed in the book with its summarized answer (keep in mind there is a possibility for misinterpretation on my side):1. Is there a god. He compared the concept of God to nature’s laws, and that to know god’s mind is to understand scientific laws. Since these laws are set, the only place left for god is at creation, which we should try to understand. However this task is a work in progress since classical physical theories break down at singularities. He concludes that God cannot exist because before the big bang singularity there was no time, so there was nothing before this.2. How did all begin? The widely accepted theory is the big bang theory, however, the mystery about how the universe materialized out of nothing remains. He discusses several possibilites, such as the universe has no boundaries or M-Theory which allows a very large number of possible histories for the universe.3. Are there other forms of inteligent life?He has a statistical approach to the question, taking into account other planets in other solar systems that might be at a similar distance to a star and the time it took to develop this on earth, he says this is likely. But many things might happen as alternatives like no intelligent life developed, that comets destroyed it, that intelligent life developed but the system became unstable and destroyed itself.4. Can we predict the future? The uncertainty principle in quantim mechanichs makes this extremely difficult. Particles are represented by waves, where their position and speed probability are plotted (one is the amplitude and the other the phase). This is all what we can calculate for a particle, so he concludes that in theory we can predict the future but in practice the equations are too complex to solve.5. Black holesThey are stars so massive that suffer gravitational collapses, where nothing can escape their gravitational pull. 6. Is time travel possible?There are two possibilities for this: to be able to travel faster than light or that there are space-time warpings that act as a tunnel. The former is not possible since nothing can travel faster than light, and the latter is possible with negative energy warping space-time, which might be possible in some universe histories, but this raises a number of highly complex questions.7. Will we survive on earth?He talks about several major threats we are facing at the time:•	The world is socially at its instability peak, social differences are pronounced and people are recurring to populist leaders.•	Nuclear war.•	Climate change has begun and might become self-sustaining.•	An asteroid might bump into earth, which happened 60 million years ago.He estimates earth will die out in around one thousand years, therefore we should explore other planets.8. Should we go to space?Yes, we should look for other places to live for many reasons exposed in the previous chapter. Also he encourages thiss process since it will enable us to learn a lot and develop new knowledge. However he still believes we should fight to recover earth.9. Will AI become smarter than humansHe thinks the workings of a biological brains are very similar to how a computer computes. Therefore, they are able to develop intelligence as we did. It is also a fact that it is possible to create things that out-smart its antecesors.The danger here lies when the AI is able to design itself and improve itself. It will be able to develop a will, which could against human will. So the question is not whether it is happening, the question is whether we will able to control it and design it carefully enough so its goals align with ours. It can either be the best or the worst we do10. How should we shape the future?We should work on understanding science and technology, since they will pervade our life. It woukd be very dangerous for just a small elite to understand latest technology and science, since they would have enormous power the rest.The two most relevant issues to work on: getting to other planets since we are reaching the use limit of earth and learn touse AI for our benefits."

Then lets think of the most couragrous person, and the most loved person and finally the person with the most miserable existence. What if the person fitting the above four is actually a single person. His name is Stephen Hawking. He was by far accepted to be the most brilliant scientist after Eisntein ( though he did not get a Nobel, in hindsight he did not need one after being buried right between Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin ) . He was one of the most universally loved persons if not the most loved. And his was the most miserable physicall existence - stuck on wheel chair , could move nothing except few facial muscles and commmunicating with the world through a machine. Yet in the words of his daughrer lucy “ till the last day possible , he would dress up and go to work”. He was the most couargeous person in a very long time, a courage hitherto unknown. Nothing could stop him- the physical disability , the criticism of creationists or the boundaries of universe. Universe is the subject , he devoted his life too. Cosmology in the popular sense has always been a subject of interest to the soothsayers , fantasy theorists and religions. Scientists mostly confined themselves studying cosmology to the realm of theoretical physics - developing theories and arguing with the likes of themselves. Hawking however changed all that. Not only he pursued his interests within the scientific community , he embarked upon the quest of making these concepts popular and understandable. ‘ A brief history of time’ is now a must feature of each and every book shelf from Australia to Zimbabwe. Now more people know of Bing Bang and Black Holes than the pythogorean theoram or newtonian physics. And more people have ventured to question the myths of creations than the works of all other scientists combined. The questions are essence of Stephen Hawking’s message to understand the universe. The bigger the questions , the better the answers for him. We ,the ill-informed philistines might not be able to know the significance of questions , or the utility of answers but this adventure itself is so fascinating , so liberating and so thrilling that the limits of cosmos fit in the palm of hands with the Hawking’s book. The book is even more important because it is the final book from one of the greatest mind ever lived and in a way is a parting gift for the humanity. The ten big questions are bold , important and unavoidable. The answers as promised from title are brief , but consistent ,comprehensible and never dull. The answers are also not definite and exhaustive but extends the limits of imagination rather than restricting. The recurrent theme is science and cosmology and the text is easy read even if one does not get some of the concepts ( a caution : theory of relativity , uncertainty principle , quantum mechanics and string theory surfaces more than Brexit and Trump , so those BA pass like me have to struggle 😊)The human and humanity however can not shy away from these questions specially the question number 7, will we survive the earth , or the last one , how do we shape the future? The challenges of climate change, a nuclear war and artificial intelligence cannot be avoided any more. In a way, the Harari’s book 21 Lessons for 21st Century complements this book , in which he argues that the twin revolutions of bio-tech and sci-tech will define the fate of individuals and societies in times to come. Hawking delves into evolution and artificial intelligence and predicts the adevnt of one grand theory, an exciting proposition indeed. At the end some nuggets from Hawking ; - For each mind to achieve its full potential , it needs a spark. The spark of enquiry and woder. - If you know how something works , you can control it. - Our future is the race between technology and the wisdom with which we use it - When we invented the fire , we messed up repeatedly , then we invented fire extinguisher. - We spend great deal of time studying history, which, lets face it, is mostly the history of stupidity. - For humans , not to leave planet Earth would be like castaways on a desert island not trying to escape.

224,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36524004-nazrul-buang,5,"It's the last book penned by Stephen Hawking, arguably the most renowned scientists of our time and one of the pioneers of cosmology, before he passed away recently. It only seemed just that I read his final work and come to understand the mind of the man who proposed 'the theory of everything'.'Brief Answers to the Big Questions' is Hawking's attempts at answering the big questions in present life: is there God? Is there intelligent life elsewhere in the universe? What is inside a black hole? Is the future predictable? Not only does he address questions related to physics / astrophysics, he also offers his wisdom in addressing other important relevant questions of our time, such as the dangers of artificial super-intelligence, climate change and space colonization.Hawking is one of the most brilliant minds in this current age, and is one of the most influential figures in the scientific community. When one discusses astrophysics, cosmology, or even just about outer space in general, it's almost impossible to do so picturing Hawking for establishing scientific theories that we adhere to, thus putting himself in the same ranks as past brilliant minds in science such as Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. The world mourned at his departure, and we grieved over how we lost a beautiful soul.'Brief Answers to the Big Questions' is first and foremost a science book, but at the same time it's an autobiography and a personal diary. Hawking details briefly (pun intended) his story as an average boy in London born during World War II, who rose to become an eminent scientist that changed the fundamental understanding of physics as we know it, while being inflicted with a motor neurone disease that rendered him paralyzed but his mind remaining intact. At the same time, he shows his human side in this intimate book, especially the British-style wry humor that peppers his narrative and contagiously positive and sagacious tone that made him a beloved figure to everyone around him.Understandably, there are some parts of the book that are heavy on the scientific theories, as expected from a scientist author. Yet, compared to many other science books I've read before, the theories are simplified so much that the layman reader is able to appreciate. It follows the teaching of another famous scientist Richard Feynman (a scientist Hawking respected, no less): explaining complex theories in simple terms so that even non-scientists can understand. This book embodies Feynman's timeless quote ""nature has a great simplicity and therefore a great beauty"".In a time when people were looking down on earth in search for answers in life, Hawking was one of the few people who looked at the limitless faraway space and wondered if it hold the key to understanding the mechanics of the universe. Throughout his life he sought his key, even if restricted to his wheelchair and speech-generating device, and his endeavors are culminated in his famous book 'A Brief History of Time'. 'Brief Answers to the Big Questions' is a continuation of that book, as well as Hawking's valediction and his parting gift before his death. It summarizes his life's work in simple explanation, and imparts some words of wisdom along with the occasional dose of humor. People would remember him for his grandiose ideas on how the universe works, but they would also not forget his otherwise down-to-earth personality that rendered him undeniably human. Though we grieve for the loss of a brilliant mind, we should also celebrate his incalculable contribution to the scientific community and the betterment of mankind in overall. No words can express how grateful the world is to me, including myself, and I hope, as stated in his dying wishes, that more people would learn to appreciate the fields of sciences out of sheer curiosity and sought answers to questions never thought before, just like Hawking and the pioneers before him did. Thank you and rest in peace, Hawking."
225,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89872089-cb-read,4,"Is there a God? What is inside a black hole? Will artificial intelligence outsmart us? How do we shape the future? These are the most interesting big questions to which Stephen Hawking offers his brief answers, in his last book that is an edited collection of his correspondences, lectures, and notes over the many decades of his life as a scientist. These four chapters contain most of the original content of the book; the other questions can be answered with a, Yes, or No, but here’s why, and are redundant or verbatim of what is written in these main four chapters. But each chapter was insightful to read, so feel free to peruse them at will or in order. Hawking, as we all know, was a scientist—a cosmologist and theoretical physicist of the utmost regard. (He held the same professorship at Cambridge as Isaac Newton.) Much of the public instinctively believes that scientists are atheists or agnostics, or are otherwise anti-religion. Hawking is an optimist who does believe in God, so long as He is defined as the keeper of all rational secrets and laws of the universe that humankind may one day soon discover. The question, Is there a God? Is an ancient one, and religion is a long and closely held human tradition because it gives people faith in the future and hope in humanity. Hawking had faith in the beautiful logic of the universe and hope that naturally and rationally curious humans would never stop solving its puzzling design. If Hawking was religious about anything, it was his devotion to science. He makes a clear case for why science has inspired him to live his life as its devotee and why believing in any other God is foolish. So this big question is best answered by No, but…. Hawking’s career as one of the first modern and serious cosmologists was set into motion by his work on black holes. Retrieving information about a cosmic phenomenon that is almost perfectly inscrutable would merit a severe challenge for anyone. But it was Hawking’s ingenious thinking and creativity that made us believe black holes are almost perfectly inscrutable. Virtual particles, a mathematical entity that exists in the universe without the ability to be physically observed, appear in pairs. They can appear spontaneously and their presence is only known due to their effects on the type of particles that we can detect. So when particles that we are used to fall into a black hole, ordinarily they would never return and will be lost forever. But this is not what Hawking calculated and eventually observed. What he saw was that black holes could emit virtual particles as actual particles, not only proving the fact that something can emerge from the inscrutable abyss, but that something can indeed appear from nothing, or more accurately, mathematical chance. This phenomenon became known as Hawking radiation, and it is best explained in the rest of the chapter. This one alone shows why Hawking was a genius and is absolutely worth reading. The question of artificial intelligence is perhaps the biggest that Hawking addresses. Even as one of the book’s shortest chapters, he illustrates here and elsewhere his worldview for the future of humanity: tame the inevitable creation of superintelligence and use it to help us colonize space while also addressing all of Earth’s ailments. And get it right the first time, because one mistake with AI superintelligence would very likely be our last mistake. The prospect of socially acceptable human enhancement and the emergence of electronic and mechanical lifeforms that are worthy of existence and legal rights is also inevitable, and soon to come within the next 100 years. This is less a prophecy than a consequence of unprecedented investment and societal reliance on science and technology. All of these questions point in the direction of how we, as a science-focused society, can and will shape the future. Hawking’s optimism and scientific pragmatism encourages us to adopt a thorough familiarity with science so we can use it to create the future we want and desperately need.  The final wise words from a curious and brilliant mind that leave us with more questions and hope than ever before. "
226,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108481016-herzl,5,"A bit of a life story of mine is the best way to explain why this book is so important to me.I've been fascinated by the sciences since I was a kid, and I used to love every science and math projects we had to do, no matter how hard they were to complete. I guess my love of science is unrequited LOL.  I was discouraged to pursue science by my teachers and super smart peers because they told me I was not really good at it.  Even our HS principal suggested against my taking a BS degree, so she recommended I take a literature or English course instead since ""that is where I shine."" Long story short, I took a BA in Comm Arts, and it was a course with almost no science subjects.   Needless to say, my enthusiasm was replaced with intimidation.   I avoided science electives like the plague because they would ~*MOST CERTAINLY*~ flunk them and therefore would not be eligible to graduate with honors. Three years after I graduated from college, I watched ""The Big Bang Theory"" for fun. That show means a lot to me, and I still rewatch it (I'm currently on S10 for the fourth time lol) because it has rekindled my love of science. Since then, I started to watch more science vids and reading science books such as this one for pleasure. I still feel stupid and inadequate whenever I stumble upon science concepts with which I am not familiar.  I resigned to my teachers' opinion that I was - and still am - not cut out for STEM, so the least I could do is to read what the experts are discovering, inventing, conceptualizing day by day.  It takes an extremely high IQ and lots of creativity and discipline to be a scientist. I look up to them greatly.  The questions tackled in this book are ones I believe all humans have contemplated on at some point in our lives.  So many answers have popped up from certain beliefs and cultures, and I respect that. I personally incline to scientific determinism, though. I admire how scientists of all branches actually devote their lives to finding the most satisfactory and definite explanations.Being the science dummy that I am, I initially found it hard to digest the scientific concepts and principles introduced in the first few chapters. However, as I read on, I noticed why I was bombarded with them so early on in the book. They were to be mentioned and referred to in the respective chapters. He related certain key points from previous chapters to the latter ones. That organization eased my reading experience after a while. [And of course, Google helped LOL] I was also amused with Hawking's humor and sassiness LOL.  I enjoyed his sly shades against the government and certain political leaders. XD He also incorporated moral and ethical lessons after his explanations, thereby making his advices more compelling. His warnings were backed up by scientific data, so they made me ""alert, but not anxious,"" as Dr. Mike would say.The last few chapters were really inspirational to me. Hawking pointed out that teachers are a big factor in instilling scientific curiosity to the kids. True enough for me. As fun as the projects had been, the discouragement from my teachers had ultimately made me shy away from the sciences. (Prolly for the best lol since I'm doing well outside the scientific community haha)  Still, he stressed the importance of having a lot more kids interested in STEM learning. Now that I'm an adult, it's quite late for me lol, but I can keep learning on my own through one of the things I love the most: reading. Again, it's the least I could do. "

Religion was an early attempt to answer the questions we all ask: why are we here, where did we come from? Long ago, the answer was almost always the same: gods made everything. The world was a scary place, so even people as tough as the Vikings believed in supernatural beings to make sense of natural phenomena like lightning, storms or eclipses. Nowadays, science provides better and more consistent answers, but people will always cling to religion, because it gives comfort, and they do not trust or understand science.""

228,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75854653-hyung-park,5,"Hawking brought me, through his latest and last book, his excitements in cosmology. This book reminded me of that the human mind is an incredible thing! One of the world’s most accomplished scientists, key factor in the theory of the initial state (singularities) of the universe and the expanding universe. No doubt his intuition and imagination was amazing. And also his endeavor to figure out how things work- His explanation on quantum nature was very insightful (despite the difficulty of the subject). The book really made me want to study some quantum physics- so I ordered a book on quantum mechanics (hope I finish that book too). His belief in laws that holds all the time, ultimately links to his answers to the big questions he raised- the existence of god, how it all began, and how do we shape the future. A few things I found very interesting: His description on the universe before the Big Bang, with three dimensions of space and one of “imaginary time”, a concept for describing the state of the universe before the Time begins. He suggested this model of the universe with no boundary condition specified in the imaginary time. No boundary conditions at the beginning- (which implies potentially infinite number of histories of the universe in the imaginary time; each of them determines a history in the real time; and we just happen to be in one of them). If true, the universe is really, really big!Also, his explanation on the relativity- “space and time were no longer absolute, no longer a fixed background to events. Instead, they were dynamical quantities that were shaped by the matter and energy in the universe.” This leads me to think that we, who are matters and energies, can shape the dynamical quantities (the space and time, that is, our history) and can eventually “shape the future”, as we learn how things work. Throughout the book was the voice of a man who broadened the boundaries of thoughts. What was really inspiring was his positivity towards life, well summarized in the last paragraph of the book: “So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.”I too revel in imagining about some day- when we humans colonize the Moon and Mars (as Hawking suggested). In those days, on Mars, we will gaze at the night sky, pointing out at a pale blue planet called Earth, telling our grandkids, that blue dot over there, that’s where we came from :) (But we are going to miss our home planet, Earth!)"

This is Stephen Hawking’s last book and released posthumously. It draws from his personal archive and was completed in collaboration with his friends, family and academic colleagues.You would already know, that I usually lean towards fiction and heavily towards fantasy, feminist and romance genres. But once in every two or three months, I do pick up a non-fiction, based on the description of the book. The author could be anyone, and the content could be anything from a wide variety of subjects. However, what I look for in a non-fiction book when I buy it is – Does the blurb pique my interest? Does it inspire me? Does it talk about some of my own questions and thoughts about life?I haven’t read any other of Stephen Hawking’s books, so I have no point of comparison. But I had chanced upon this book at the airport once and was instantly hooked to the array of questions that he thinks and addresses in the book. Questions like, “Does God exist?” “What about aliens?” “What is the future of human race?”, “What’s inside a Black Hole?”I have to admit that for the controversial questions – like the one about God and afterlife, we don’t exactly get a clear answer, and that’s fine anyway. But we get to understand some of his arguments. However, I really enjoyed reading his answers on some of the other subjects like, time travel, space travel, understanding black holes, the future of human beings the role of AI in our lives and so on.His writing, at least in this book, is crisp and easy to understand. There aren’t a lot of technical and complicated jargons and formulae and I felt that this book is really one for the masses. For people and kids who are just curious about everything and want to know what one of the greatest scientists of our generation has to say about them.I would recommend this book even if you’re not into science or non fiction or Stephen Hawking, just because of the fact that these questions can make for really interesting discussion points Also, is it strange that I just read the book and NASA and Space X announced sending humans to space for the first time since 2011? I for one, am really excited and wishing it to be a successful launch, whenever they do launch! "
230,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63254266-ola-magick,5,"What a great book!!Stephen Hawking was not only able to talk about very complex matters in a very approachable way for the regular person, but he also made everything more ""human"" with his incredible sense of humor, his brilliant way sith methaphores to explain abstact issues that aren't easy to grasp, his respectful and sensible manners towards anyone regardless of their beliefs, his inspirational and empathetic outlook on life and people.I surprisingly knew already lots of the concepts explained coz I've always been in love with parts of physics and anything astronomy related, needless to say that after reading this I feel I have a better grasp on everything I already knew and on top of that I learned a lot of new cool things, Stephen Hawking's life experiences included - which were an absolute plesure to read.I personally found it oddly funny how his highly scientific explaination support perfectly my definitely spiritual and wichy vision of the Universe, (view spoiler)[for example I believe in a god and to me that is the Universe. In the 1st Chapter, Stephen Hawking says: ""I use the word “God” in an impersonal sense, like Einstein did, for the laws of nature, so knowing the mind of God is knowing the laws of nature"" and then later When people ask me if a God created the universe, I tell them that the question itself makes no sense. Time didn’t exist before the Big Bang so there is no time for God to make the universe in. - so basically we agree that the Universe is God LOL (hide spoiler)]Lastly I'd like to mention what a truly inspiration person Mr Hawking reaveals himself to be with his words and the attention he has put into never putting down anyone (when quoting something his son told him once, the kid referred at himseld as ""daft"" and SH felt important to specify that he used that word just coz it was the one used by his son but he disagrees and he taught him that being curious is never silly... I mean WOW.) and always encouraging curiosity, knoweledge and discovery because ""we never really know where the next great scientific discovery will come from, nor who will make it. Opening up the thrill and wonder of scientific discovery, creating innovative and accessible ways to reach out to the widest young audience possible, greatly increases the chances of finding and inspiring the new Einstein.

231,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"In Brief Answers to The Big Questions, Professor Steven Hawking discusses deep, philosophical questions in a manner befitting his position as the former Lucasian Chair of Mathematics in Cambridge. With his condition of ALS or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis being given at an early age, Hawking was in a good position to ruminate on big questions and how they figured into our current understanding of the Cosmos.With ten questions being asked, Hawking wrote relatively short essays on each one. For example, with the question of “Is There a God?” Hawking put down his personal views and the science behind that view. You might say that science should have no say in such a matter, but the idea of science is to further Man’s (and Woman’s) understanding of the laws of nature, and what could be more fundamental than a god that supposedly created everything with his voice in six days? I digress though.Hawking answers these ten questions with his patent wit and scientific flair, writing in a manner that is easy to understand. I hold tight to many of his views so it is easy for me to promote this book as something special. The questions discussed also have a short blurb that gives a terse answer if you don’t feel like reading an entire essay. Of the questions asked, there are some that science has no answer for but Hawking does a valiant job of arguing his case.Some of the humor is slightly lost on me since I don’t have a hand in politics and don’t really know what is happening with the UK. So all the talk about Brexit confused me more than the actual science in the book. I realize that Brexit was about Great Britain exiting the European Union, though I could be quite wrong. I don’t even know if that is still a newsworthy thing. My political views attest that all politicians are crooked and shouldn’t be trusted, but that is merely my opinion. At the same time, I realize that I have to live in a society built by these grossly unqualified individuals.I would recommend this book to anyone with a glancing interest in science. While science hasn’t brought us flying cars or cures for all diseases or the end of poverty and hunger, that is no reason to ignore it altogether and leave it to a small fraction of interested people. While I don’t say that all people should be a scientist, you would do well to at least be scientifically literate, especially in a society that is increasingly connected as ours is."
232,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51605957-frantiska,4,"I bought this book as a Christmas present for my little brother, and it was a joy to watch him read it with such interest and curiosity. It inspired new, in-depth questions for him that i doubt he would consider otherwise. When i ran out of my own books during our roadtrip, i asked to borrow his copy. Though it is written in a simple way, perhaps for a younger audience, it definitely covers lots of interesting topics and gives logical answers to seemingly theoretical questions. It did slightly bother me that Hawking repeatedly explained the same concepts, but i can understand that since the book is a compilation of speeches, interviews and essays. In all honesty, non-fiction is not my favourite genre to read. However i find Stephen Hawking inspiring and am familiar with some of his previous work. The selected ""big questions"" are intriguing and the chapters provide satisfying, informative views. I also very much appreciated the satirical comments on Brexit and Donald Trump. Hawking's writing, wit, intelligence, humour and creativity made this a pleasure to read. The optimistic take was a refreshing change from most books on these topics, and as always Hawking's words inspired me. ""Let us fight for every woman and every man to have the opportunity to live healthy, secure lives, fully of opportunity and love. We are all time travellers, journeying together into the future. But let us work together to make that future a place we want to visit.Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome the odds. It can be done.""The touching afterword, written by Hawking's daughter, reminded me of the day I found out about his passing. As it goes, my affection and respect for him as a scientist and as a person was heightened and as a Gen Z, I turned to Instagram to express this. I wrote these words under Stephen's most recent post: may the most beautiful specks of stardust rest peacefully. not gone, and never forgotten."

The final message is clean and neat through ten questions for our humanities. The first six questions roughly summarize professor's scientific works for his entire life. The last four questions are the responses for human challenges within this and the next decade. I am extremely fortunate that he was my grandmaster since I was eleven. ""The Brief History of Time"" was the first book that I bought all by my own, not textbook from school, not required text, nor my parents' recommendation. It changed my life and opened my brain for a whole new vision. While Hawking will still be shining like a star in the sky for the next one thousand year, the final three paragraphs of this book could be a final poem of his entire life:""This is not the end of the story, but just the beginning of what I hope will be billions of years of life fourishing in the cosmos.And one final point -- we never really know where the next great scientific discovery will come from, nor who will make it.

I loved every bit of this book and got engaged till the last word. In my opinion this book will open new compartments in your brain! One big lesson I learned here is that the universe is governed by natural laws which science is always able to explain. I also learned never to be shy or doubtful to ask the big questions, and always have an opinion on those. For the first time I became convinced that science FACTS can be stranger than FICTION as Hawking explains, and no better example for that than the black hole characteristics. I also got to realize how important it is to follow science fiction threads (reading, movies, etc) as that is most likely the reality of our near future decades away. Fiction is important and it opens new venues in the mind.I also got more familiar with AI and the double-edge nature of it for the best and the worst as far as the humankind is concerned. Will AI ever outsmart the human intelligence?! I think yes...Space is not far from our reach and as Hawking explains, space travel is our last resort to solve the climate change. which is solvable but the political stubbornness will never permit the solution to take place.Regardless of his religious orientation, I thought he did a great job addressing the question ""Did God create the universe?"". He also did a great job simplifying fairly complicated concepts in theoretical physics and cosmology so that questions like what is a black hole was digestible for someone with very basic understanding of physics.All in all, a must read and highly recommended."

I learned new stuff about black holes (or maybe I knew it when I read A Brief History of Time many years ago). His answers to questions about time travel and how the universe began were thought-provoking, and I would love to learn more of the science behind that. I thought it was curious that he started the book with ""Is there a God?"" because it was not one of my favorite chapters. The novel point was that he thinks that the universe does not need a first cause to exist, which he discusses in more depth in the second chapter. The argument is certainly interesting and is in Hawking's scientific wheelhouse, but it is only one small piece of the question posed, and ignores many other arguments for or against the existence of God. He also takes a very big picture view in thinking about the challenges for humanity: namely how to deal with artificial intelligence and goals with respect to space exploration. I thought these were interesting, and they are important long-term policy questions that are not talked about enough. At the same time, I found Hawking's chapters to be a starting point for discussion rather than the final word.Another great thing about this book is the forewords and afterwords written by people who knew Hawking. He was an inspiring person, and that really comes through in these parts of the book. Be sure to read them."
236,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5258058-josh,5,"This was my first foray into the work of Hawking, and boy I wish we had gotten more time with him. True, he wasn't supposed to live nearly as long as he did, but what a genius. What a sense of humor. I was concerned that he wouldn't be able to break down big questions so easily, but he really does. We only get to scratch the surface of what he knew, but even that scratch makes me feel like I understand the world around me better than I did the day before. I never would have guessed how much he thought about UFOs and how unlikely it is that they harbor intelligent life. While Hawking didn't believe in God in a religious way, he did not use science to destroy the faith of others, as I imagine most scientists do. It disappoints me that we have come to the point where science has become political as well. Climate change is the greatest global threat we currently face, but yet many politicians in this country continue to ignore it. This is perhaps the greatest warning that Hawkings gives in the book, that we are not doing nearly enough to stop the disasters that assuredly await us if we don't address the problem. I sincerely hope that the next leader of the country makes this a #1 priority before we seriously have to figure out how humanity moves on to a different planet that may or may not exist. Anyway, despite science being my worst subject in school, I was able to wrap my head around most of the things he talks about in this book. Hawkings was clearly a gifted teacher as well. I'm so glad he will live on through his fantastic writings."

Brief Answers to the Big Questions tackles incredibly complex theories but uses language, context, and examples that make the concepts accessible. These are all questions that Stephen had addressed before in his lifetime, but it was wonderful to hear his most recent perspectives. In his last book, Stephen carefully answers questions such as “Does God exist?” without alienating religious people, keeping science open and approachable to all. My favorite question (and answer) was “Is time travel possible?” (but if you want to know the answer, you’ll have to read the book).It’s also worth mentioning that there was a wonderful forward, introduction, and afterword, in which those who knew Stephen best shared personal insight into his life. It added a nice touch and reminded me that I am way overdue in seeing “The Theory of Everything”.I’d like to end this review on a quote from the book which resonated with me, and I think wonderfully sums up who Stephen Hawking was: “When we see the Earth from space, we see ourselves as a whole. We see the unity, and not the divisions. It is such a simple image with a compelling message; one planet, one human race.” Though the book was published posthumously, I believe it is a book he would be very proud of."

Is there other intelligent life in the universe? Will artificial intelligence outsmart us? How do we shape the future? Will we survive on Earth? Should we colonise space? Is time travel possible? Throughout his extraordinary career, Stephen Hawking expanded our understanding of the universe and unravelled some of its greatest mysteries. But even as his theoretical work on black holes, imaginary time and multiple histories took his mind to the furthest reaches of space, Hawking always believed that science could also be used to fix the problems on our planet. And now, as we face potentially catastrophic changes here on Earth - from climate change to dwindling natural resources to the threat of artificial super-intelligence - Stephen Hawking turns his attention to the most urgent issues for humankind.Wide-ranging, intellectually stimulating, passionately argued, and infused with his characteristic humour, Brief Answers to the Big Questions, the final book from one of the greatest minds in history, is a personal view on the challenges we face as a human race, and where we, as a planet, are heading next. This is one I think everyone should read being that this is the last of Dr Hawking’s published works and it is deserving of everyone’s attention."

But those conversations never end with just doubts in the topic but goes beyond tht. At tht point the teacher takes u to another level of understanding things and puts a spark in ur brain to think more. This book made me feel tht......It felt like Stephen Hawking himself put his lively words in my brain. At times I smiled at his wit and how fun these things were to him. He answered these ten questions independently even though all of them r intertwined. Some things r repeated like Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and Einstein's general theory of relativity. So u can start with any question u want.....Especially loved the parts where he gave simple anologies to explain complicated theories. I really love it when scientists come down to explain people abt hardest topics.He went ahead to mention other scientist's works and their contribution to different parts of the field. He adored Einstein. Here we can see his passion for knowing everyone's view in a given matter......Reading the afterword written by his daughter filled tears in my eyes.....His way of looking at the world is fascinating.

The section on black holes, the area Stephen Hawking has contributed the most, is probably the most detailed .In relation to our future as a species and the connection to technology Hawking writes: ""I believe the future of communication is brain-computer interfaces."". He expands: ""Our future is a race between the growing power of our technology and the wisdom with which we use it."".Each of the 10 questions in the book gets enough devoted space, and always has a wrap-up summary at the conclusion to come back to the original question....Highly recommended ...."

Unless you’d like to refer to the forces that govern our universe as god, but the idea of a divine creator isn’t one Stephen Hawking prescribes to.What about aliens? Possible.Quantum mechanics - I just wish I had the brain waves to get more excited about the movement of particles. But I don’t, this wasn’t my favorite part of the book. Our planet is long overdue for an asteroid collision. Eek. Add that one to your worry pile.Whilst we can’t control interstellar collisions, we can still control human-driven climate change. So get onto that one fast if you’d like Mother Earth to stand a chance. On the point of nuclear energy, be careful with that one, for the possibility of nuclear annihilation comes hand in hand with its development, and if it lands in the wrong hands that will be zero fun and the end of life as we know it.Time to start investing more time and money into colonizing space. Be wary of Artificial Intelligence. At present computers pose no threat. But once they can self-improve and start to replicate the intelligence of a human brain, effort must be made to ensure they serve humans rather than the other way around. Overall, this book was exactly what I was hoping it would be. A wise, informed voice, shepherding my brain through some big questions with interesting insight and easy to absorb facts and yes, opinions. "
242,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29861103-matt-halvorson,4,I watched the movie “The Theory of Everything” which was about Hawking’s life and it made me want to learn a little more about the science behind his theology and beliefs. This book does a good job of that but not great. Some of that was my own lack of knowledge. I stopped reading once to look up something I didn’t have a great understanding of and a couple more times to because the topics really interested me in college and I wanted to dive deeper than he went in the book. Any book that makes you think is a good book. So why did I almost give the book 3 stars? For some reason I felt unsatisfied when I was reading it and even after. In the reading he would mention a theory he believes in and explain how that makes him believe a certain way but later in the book he mentions other theories he believes in and some contradict some of his beliefs. I think this may be why I was left feeling unsatisfied. Most people have contradicting beliefs in their lives and I think I was hold him/the book up to an expectation that was impossible. For this reason I added one more star back to my review to give it 4. It is a good book from one of the great minds of science and also one of the most impressive people this century. Just remember he is still human and you may like the book too. 
243,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100429-p-a-sivachander,5,"Stephan Hawking - A name every science aspiring school kid recited. As a school kid, I also looked at him as an inspiring idol, without actually knowing what he has contributed to the world of science. Fortunately, in spite of my technically boring college, I squeezed some time in 2014 to read ' The Brief History of Time'. I couldn't at that time grasp clearly much of what he intends to convey through the book. I was wondering most of the time as to what role does a black hole have to play in the creation of the universe. Reading 'The Grand Design' gave a much better picture as to where we are in terms of finding the beginning and end to our universe and our life cycle. The movie and his biography gave me a fair idea of the struggles he went through in fighting death and life. This book is a pinnacle of the achievements this man thought he did in more than half a century. The scientific and philosophical approach of the answers to the big questions is interesting and intriguing at the same time. He asks the human beings to act now. be bold - to save the earth for our future generations to survive. H urges us to look beyond earth for future endeavors as he strongly believes that our time on earth is slowly but steeply coming to a halt. Whether you're a fan of Hawking or someone who is completely new to him, you'll enjoy this book equally well."
244,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85788192-nancy,3,"I have an awe and the upmost respect for the brilliant mind of Professor Hawking. But this book could have waited and been sent to a good editor before being published. There were the same paragraphs in different chapters and awkward wording throughout. So what was the hurry? Perhaps, as Hawking points out, the doomsday clock was moved to two minutes before twelve in 2018.For the most part, this was not brief answers to big questions but rather Hawking’s opinions. Some of the big questions cannot be answered yet on a scientific basis. He states that he will have some chance of being “right in the next hundred years, but the rest of the millennium will be wild speculation.” That being said, his opinions come from a deep knowledge base are are certainly thought provoking.Hawking admits to not being very positive about the future, due to, as it would seem, Brexit and Trump. I am more concerned, however, to a potential annihilation of the earth through the creation of a black hole at the LHC at CERN either through an accident or act of terrorism than I am of a asteroid collision. And, certainly the potential discovery of a cold fusion process would answer our energy needs and put an end to deforestation, holes in the ozone and thus eliminate melting polar ice caps and rising sea temperatures.Again, a thought provoking read and really enjoyed the discussion on what’s inside of black holes."

Add to this the emotional dimension due to the fact it is his last (posthumous) book, and you'll get all the reasons to read it, if you're into science or just curious about our current knowledge of the universe.Only negative thing I have to say: you see that some of the reasonings exposed in the book, if they could have been re-read by the author before his death, would have probably been re-written, or given extra, more convincing arguments.For example, if I agree with the author that the more we know about our world, the less we need a God to explain the universe, I find his explanation far from airtight. ""Time started with the bigbang so God couldn't have had the time to create the world before because there was no time before"".While the idea is elegant, it's not sufficient to win the argument against the Simulation Hypothesis: if we live in a simulation, even if (our) time started at the launch of the simulation, the creators of the simulation would have had plenty of (their own) time to create our world before that.Appart such small comments, a great reading."

The amount of respect I have for that man is astronomical (haha, see what I did?). The book was a gift from my little brother to me, with the explanation that I had not learned enough science during my Bachelor studies. Hawking gives his opinion, supported by facts, on some discussion-worthy subjects. There are a lot of facts in this book, enough so that you have to read the sentence once, twice, before kinda getting it. Sometime a specific term is used that you have never heard about before. I strongly suggest having Google nearby. Hawking does use some easy explanation for us mortals, thank goodness. There were two of his opinions I will take with me from the book. One, that Hawking strongly argues that we should explore even more of space, and send out even more people. He explained this with comparing Earth with a deserted island. If we do not explore the water around - space - how will we ever learn what is beyond? Second, that experimenting and creating ""Super Humans"" is dangerous and should not be encouraged at all. I will not dive deeper into the whys and hows - read the book!"

It reads well and the scientific principles are nicely simplified for the layperson. He also acknowledges other scientists throughout the book and how they helped his own scientific work. My favorite aspect about this book is Hawking's call to arms to save the human race and the planet using science and space exploration. He also encourages everyone to have an open mind and take an interest in science, even if it is not one's career path. He points out that at the stage of evolution we have reached, science is key to almost anything we try to achieve.Never one to shy away from controversy, Hawking also takes shots at how humanity has behaved throughout history and how it keeps on repeating it's self-destructive nature. Specific shots are aimed at Donald Trump and Britain for it's Brexit debacle. And as expected, he takes a final parting shot at the issue of existence of God. I feel like in this book, he is more aggressive about this topic than in his previous works. I kind of feel he knew this would be his last opportunity to address the issue one more time.All-round a good read and I breezed through it pretty quickly. I definitely recommend it. "

The book discussed issues such as life outside of our planet, exploring our solar system, the existence of God, climate change etc.. All which are thought provoking and written scientifically but with a dash of wit and humour that made this book rather unputdownable.

Although it is difficult to understand quantum physics, Hawking tried to explain the big questions so that a layman can understand it. The most interesting questions for me were - Is there a God? What is inside a black hole? Will we survive on Earth?His take on AI is brilliant and balanced. The best example he gave was of the invention of fire and eventually fire extinguisher.

It had nothing to do with me getting scared easily (because that’s not the case at all), but more with the way Stephen Hawking talked through all the mysteries of this planet and the insignificance of our existence in comparison to the universe; which, in fact, isn’t really new news to anyone, I suppose, but reading it bluntly like that, makes it the scariest thriller of all times.One of my favorite topics of this book was black holes. The findings that he laid out were very interesting and very frightening at the same time. They go beyond my imagination, so fascinating!

I think Stephen Hawking is amazing and is 5 stars all the way. But his views on cosmology and black holes and the origins of the universe were more than my brain could handle at 8am (on my way to work). But I finished it nevertheless and like to think that I learned a few things during the rare moment I was absorbing what he was saying instead of having it completely go over my head. He was writing this book when he died. His family saw to it that it was finished and his daughter wrote a touching and insightful afterward. If you do read this book, I recommend the audio version. After each chapter, he is asked a question and Stephen Hawking himself answers the question using a computerized machine controlled by facial twitches and muscles that formed words (which he used once his ALS advanced to the stage where his vocal chords and muscles no longer worked)."

Even though I'm seriously interested in science of all kinds, it has never occurred to me to read one of Hawking's books. The reason I got interested in this one is because a friend of mine was struggling with his faith and picked up this book to see if he could get a few answers... and in the process of reading, it cemented him in his relationship with God. So I wanted to see what touched my friend in such a way. And it was, I think, the mental gymnastics that Hawking went through to keep Jehovah out of the creation picture. My entire life I've watched science answer one question while raising a dozen new ones, and sometimes you have to just turn yourself over to faith. So that's my theory of everything - or at least what happened to my friend. An interesting book, BTW, and my eyes only glazed over once during the proceedings. Recommended, if you're so inclined."

Dr. Hawking's ability to write straight forward prose about the meaning and significance of scientific theory requiring walls of math equations humbles and amazes me.When he says there is no God, or that science no longer needs explanations of the universe based on a God, he is communicating the same reality that I discuss in Unified Field Theology when I say that God -- the omnipresent source and sustainer of life which allowed the Big Bang and would continue to exist even if the current physical world ended -- has now been found inside the laws of physics and evidence observable in the physical universe.I believe the job of religion in the twenty-first century will be to help people find their place and meaning and decide how to live in the world the science behind this book has now revealed to us."

As he also says, Einstein's ingenuity was sparked not by his capability with math, but because of his imagination as a 16 years old, imagining travelling sitting on a light beam.I have found this increasingly true (for including subjects like history, where a narrative/story works much better than rote). The statement summarizes the crux of why the book was written. In this brilliant book, Hawking is able to explain some very complex ideas using very graphical imagery and simple language. His ability to explain more in less and simple is outstanding. It's ideal reading to spark an individual's interest in wanting to learn more about some of these fundamental concepts. "
264,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125245-wes-metz,5,"Stephen Hawking indisputably had one of the great minds of the human race. Fortunately for those of us who will never entirely understand relativity, cosmology, quantum mechanics, or the physics of black holes (because we don't have the math), Hawking was able to convey to the lay reader difficult concepts in clear language (with no equations!). In this book he asks and answers ten questions that deal with some of the great mysteries of human life. Where did we (and everything else) come from? Are we alone in the Universe? Could we travel in time? What about black holes, space colonies, artificial intelligence? What about God? Hawking was a modest man. He would be the first to admit that the answers to these questions and others are his opinions, but they are grounded insofar as possible in solid science. If you are interested in what a genius has to say about the universe and our place in it, read this book. "

I have to say, this book actually now feels very close to me, somehow. The book explained some very difficult notions of cosmology and other fields of science through a very easy but professional narration. I actually am now very familiar with the concepts explained in the book and it has piqued my curiosity. I also loved the comments made before and after the explanations themselves, by Eddie Redmayne, actor who impersonates Hawking in the movie “The Theory of Everything”, which I really enjoyed and enlarged my knowledge about Hawking‘s personal life and experiences, and the daughter, Lucy, who talks about the funeral in Cambridge and her personal thoughts. This book really expanded the limits of my understanding, and I’m really happy and proud I read it."

“To my colleagues, I’m just another physicist, but to the wider public I became possibly the best-known scientist in the world. This is partly because scientists, apart from Einstein, are not widely known rock stars, and partly because I fit the stereotype of a disabled genius.”
This was such an interesting read. I especially enjoyed reading some facts about Hawking’s life growing up and the hurdles he overcame - he even survived an earthquake!? Diagnosed with ALS at a young age, Hawking was given a poor prognosis and expected to live no longer than his early twenty’s, but with the support from those close to him, he proved doctors wrong and lived to be 76. Even though this book delves into Hawking’s scientific research and theories, his simplistic writing makes it an easy and absorbing read.  ”So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up. Unleash your imagination. Shape the future.”"

It can be done” I did not want to write a review on this book at first, for several reasons but the main one being the fact it is a book published after his death, and based on his opinions with science behind it.I was always very curious, and I can say I still am, once I saw this book I knew I had to have it and read it right away, mostly because I saw it had at least two subjects I actually cared about and always wondered. 1) How did it all start? and 2) Is time travelling possible. Those two subjects made me want to read the book and then I found out it had so many more that I cared about like Black Holes, Artificial Intelligence, and even global warming (although in a smaller scale).Stephen Hawking was a great man, and a great scientist, that I admired for the longest time. I always tried to follow his theories even though I know nothing of physics, however share na interest in that field. This book confirmed to me that he was a great teacher, capable of telling his audience his message in a simple way, and understandable. I can say I’m sad that I’ll never get to meet him, but happy that he contributed so much to his field, because his work will live on.I don’t think I’ve ever annotated and highlighted a book as much as I did on this one. This is a book I highly recommend it made it to my favorites list, and will most definetly be on my favorites of the year. “I think that when we die we return to dust. But there’s a sense in which we live on, in our influence, and in our genes that we pass on to our children. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that I am extremely grateful.” "
268,1984819194,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71649361-philippe-gamito,3,"Stephen Hawking was probably one of the greatest minds of our time. In this book, his contemporary writings are brought into one volume. Ten questions are asked and he humbly tries to address those in the most accessible way, although some parts are not easy to follow (namely: what is inside a black hole or time travel). Personally, I found the question about the origin of the universe very interesting and namely the proposition that the universe had a beginning as well as the possibility for the Big Bang to have occurred from ""nothing"" without God necessarily provoking it. Equally surprising is his deep enchantement for humans to explore space and planets with the view to settling in there in the future."

As Stephen Hawking had always been a role model for me both as a scientist and as a personality, I enjoyed viewing the world through his eyes, learning more about the wonders of the universe! Following his passing, I was saddened by the fact that he definitely had more to give to the world of science, even though he outlived his prognosis by half a century. Brief Answers to the Big Questions is Stephen's final gift to the word, a masterpiece of science, personal experiences, memories and aspirations, dreams and impressive personal strength! Making science as accessible as ever through his words, Stephen supports that science should indeed be shared with the world and that each and everyone of us is capable of achieving great things given the spark of enquiry and wonder! Brief Answers to the Big Questions is a huge source of inspiration and motivation, it will trigger your thoughts, make you laugh, believe, appreciate, aspire and dream! If you haven't read it yet, the time has come!Closing up with a personal favourite quote from book: ""Opening up the thrill and wonder of scientific discovery, creating innovative and accessible ways to reach out to the widest young audience possible, greatly increases the chances of finding and inspiring the new Einstein. Wherever she might be."""

I love asking big questions and stretching my mind to imagine the possible answers. I imagine infinity as everything everywhere all at once stretching behind my eyes as a blanket of deep purple. Some people find me weird and don't get it. ""It is impossible to imagine,"" they say. No it's not. You just have to look with better eyes. Stephen Hawking had those eyes and this book sums everything up. The only issue I had with the book was it was a little repetitive and weaved politics into it. Although I suppose it is hard to talk about the future of humanity without some mention of politics, especially these days. Read this if you have a curious mind."

One of the greatest scientists, Stephen Hawkings, in the book, has put his revolting yet crystal clear thoughts about the universe, it's beginning, it's present, our present and most importantly, the Future. It is a very good book for anyone who is curious about existence, nature and working of the universe, and if you find it stunning how huge ,a whole world, our Imagination is. I really wonder how beautiful it is to know that it's not the Gods that govern the universe, but Physics (no offence to the 'devotees' of almighty, there might be one..,who knows what it turns out to be).

I was wrong, at least partially. There are so many wonderful concepts in this book. Many might be familiar at first glance, but the ways Hawking approaches them to reach a conclusion are not. Considering the topics, Hawking’s conciseness and the ability to pack it all into 200 easily digestible pages, topping it off with humor(!), is nothing less than incredible.I can’t remember another book that would have made me feel like I was 12 again, not just reading and thinking, but actually feeling the awe and amazement triggered by the unfamiliar.What a great book, what a great man."

I will tell you that his ability to explain advanced topics is unparalleled. Many books like this read like data dumps. Lots of information given to you straight. When Stephen Hawking explains something.. there's a connection. You're not just learning about something from one of the greatest minds that ever lived.. you're getting to know a little bit of Stephen Hawking. He makes difficult topics personable which really helps me retain and at least begin to understand what it is he's speaking and writing about. As some of his last published words.. you should definitely give him this a read. He voice will surely be missed.

What a marvelous book!My first read of his book was A Brief History of Time and i instantly fell in love with his writing. He easily explained to non-academia person about cosmology and the universe, which something can be regarded as heavy topics.In this book, once again he successfully explained the big question in our life (related with the universe). I am absolutely amazed with this book. The questions about the existence of God, blackhole, time travel, AI and more!I love the simplicity of his explanation even though there certain explanation that requires you to read it again and again, but still that's because of our lack of fundamental in the topics. But i would say Stephen Hawking really did his best to simplify the explanations.Anyway, it's a sad thing that he didnt get Nobel before he died. His lost was a big loss to us. His contributions to cosmology will always be remembered.Rest In Peace among the stars, Stephen.P/s Eddie Redmayne's foreword in this book is too cute for me."

Hawking's Brief Answers to the Big Questions is a one last letter-It hurts to say- to the world, and science world. In this collection of his writings, he briefly sums up his work, his thoughts on universe, god, time and AI. He is so many things- in Brief Answers to the Big Questions he proofs he could even be a novelist! Knowing that this book published after his death, ironically, it felt like he was sending his message throughout time- just like the movie party he organized for real time travelers. His unique humor and wisdom will put a smile on your face, and maybe some tears after Lucy Hawking's last words. He left a huge scientific heritage behind and he also left a story of strength, hope and determination for all of us. His latest - most important - message in this book to world is to understand the science and keep working for a better world. And Stephen, I don't know if you're seeing this but I will keep following your ""Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet"" advice for the rest of my life. Thank you for this book, thank you for Brief History of Time, thank you for the children's book series that made me love science when I was young and thank you for all great achievements you made."

If he wasn't a blatant human you would think he was an alien taking the mick out of us unintelligent humans.

Hawking’s passion for the world around us was (and is) infectious. What a great book and a wonderful selection of questions, my favourite being ‘Will AI outsmart us?’ This boom is accessible, eloquently written and as simple as a book on such matter could be. Eddie Redmayne’s foreword and Lucy Hawking’s afterword are emotional reads and depict true admiration for Stephen’s work and his contribution to society.

The book is filled with optimism, but strong caution about the impact humans are having on our planet's environment, the role artificial intelligence can play in our future, genetic editing, and the need for humans to spread beyond Earth.I think this is the first cosmology/astrophysics-related book I've read since finishing 'The Three-Body Problem' and it's sequels, and this really made me appreciate how good those books were. I'm no physicist, but much of the extremes of science that were discussed in this book were also in Three-Body.I'd read this again."

Offering a dire warning about the treats of climate change, nuclear war, and AI. Another astrophysicist that mentions these three things. Hopefully we listen.Funny line: ‘intelligence may not be necessary for survival. In fact it may get in the way.’Hawking is says he is an optimist but he sure thinks that humans have fucked the climate and that the only way to survive the next 1000 years is to get off this planet. He does not go into the details about how exactly we will survive off this planet but believes it’s possible and that we must. "

Mostly this was as informative as it was enjoyable but he had a few tactless comments. Like when he talks about colonising space and likens our current situation to that of 1492 before the Old World ""discovered"" the ""New."" Without that, we wouldn't have Big Macs and KFC he says, totally reducing massive changes, genocide, disease, slavery and environmental devastation to the level of fast food progress."

It's only a small book of 200-300 pages, which already indicates a lack of depth into answering the questions. Most of the questions stated are even unanswerable for us today, because of our lack of knowledge. The lack of depth aside, Stephen Hawking's work on black holes is really extravagant and has had a big impact on science and on the way we see the universe. He also uses the book to encourage people to get into science and try to be a positive influence to humankind and to take on the fight with some of the biggest problems humanity has ever encountered, which is really nice."

I went into this book not having really contemplated in great detail about the origins of the universe except enough to determine that most traditional creation stories don’t really satisfy me as plausible.

It's also personal for me, since I did ask myself there must be something before it all when I was young, since I do think everything human does is natural, even if they destroy this Earth.

Although I adore science, I never thought of reading a (serious, adult-level) book about it, mostly because I was sure that the level was way too high for me. Now however, after knowing a lot more about physics, chemistry, and biology, I felt I was educated enough to read this book (and many others). When I first saw this book, I wasn’t too sure if I would like it. The first question, “Is there a God?”, was not a question I was interested in; knowing that Stephen Hawking was an atheist, I didn’t want to read about someone trying to convince me that God does not exist. I gave the book a try anyways, and I’m glad I did. I’ve always respected Stephen Hawking and many other scientists, but after reading ‘Brief Answers to the Big Questions’, my respect grew even more. I appreciate his thoughtful writing and how he tried to stay respectful towards religious people. I truly appreciate that.The ending almost made me tear up — and this is said by someone who never gets emotional through films and/or books.

I also liked the bit where he through deep shade on Laplace. Mostly all and all he's a very personable nerd who has a deep reservoir of knowledge for astrophysics but it's very approachable. The part where he dives into talking about AI comes off as nonsense and he sounds like he's completely out of his element in that regard. I knocked a star off for that."

His positive attitude about the future of humanity, his humor, his modesty and his ability to easily explain immensely complex subjects makes you want to just grab a beer with this ingenious down to earth guy. The only issue I have with his writing is that he tends to re-explain a lot of stuff, sometimes it's adequate and sometimes is just unnecessary."
