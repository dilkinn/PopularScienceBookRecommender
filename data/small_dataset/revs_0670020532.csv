0,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178470-claudette,5,"As I read this book, I wondered: why am I only learning about evolution in depth NOW...and through my own desire to learn? How did I get through school--including a Bachelor's Degree--without really understanding the nitty gritty of evolution? I think much of the problem is that so many discoveries were so recent, but actually there is no excuse. I THInK I paid attention in school. But if I remember learning about Geometry, and, in fact, had at least one high school class CALLED Geometry, shouldn't I have also had a class called Evolution? If there was such a class offered in my enormous suburban public high school, how did I get out of it? This is crucial stuff. Read it. This needs to be ingrained knowledge from like first grade on up."
1,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/970677-ravic,5,"Shocking and sadHere in Europe we tend to forget that the USA are not exclusively a country of reason and progress. Books like this remind us that there is also religious fundamentalism and that uneducated people who believe that the world is 6000 years old and favour „intelligent design“ can rise to the highest political offices. The shocking thing is what this book reveals about the condition of our society. What kind of society is it where brillant scientists feel compelled to waste valuable time writing serious books to refute harebrained nonsense like a flat earth, geocentrism or creationism / intelligent design? In Europe creationism is usually perceived as a minor problem, at least one not affecting the educational system. In America it seems that creationists are able to gain influence in schools, so much so that in some cases they have to be subdued in court. The introduction to this book detailing a recent court case is enough to make your skin crawl. How far have we actually come since the times of the Scopes trial? If the „Untergang des Abendlandes“ should come it will begin like this. With the rise of religious fundamentalism and the abolishment of reason in education. The saddest aspect of this book is the realization that those who are really in need of learning the facts will not read it. People already interested in life, in biology or in evolution will read ist. People who want to know, people who wish to learn, people who have an open mind will read this book. Religious fundamentalists are not interested in facts. They cannot be convinced by facts because they have an entirely different outlook on life. They cannot be reached by the truth because they have chosen to ignore it, fabricating their own twisted and bigoted versions of truth. So, sadly, this excellent treatise on evolution, lucid and compelling, will benefit only those who are already open-minded and critical. It makes for a great introduction to the subject for younger readers or for people with little previous knowledge in biology. It may be less suitable for Europeans as the frequent references to creationism would probably be considered distracting and unnecessary by most readers. But take out these parts and you have a wonderful introduction to evolution ready for translation into French or German, Italian or Greek, Polish or Swedish. Weathermen say that with the prevailing currents it usually takes three weeks for heavy weather from North America to reach Europe. Creationism is decidedly slower and it has not yet gained a strong foothold in most European countries. Let us hope that it does not act like the weather and that it can be vanquished before it spreads and pollutes the world. If anything it will be books like this which may help to teach and enlighten at least those who are willing to learn. "
2,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,5,"I'll come right to the point: Jerry Coyne's ""Why Evolution Is True"" is arguably the best general-interest reference book on the scientific evidence for evolution currently in print. It really is.Many of the items that Coyne marshals will be familiar to those who are well-versed in this topic. But I found several items that I had never before seen. One example is the recent discovery that diurnal and annual patterns in the growth of Devonian corals could be used to date these corals, since the length of years (396 days) evident in these records matches the age (approximately 380 million years old) coincides with radiometric ages.One of the myths about evolution that Coyne explodes is the claim that there are lots of ""missing links"" in the fossil record. To the contrary, in the past decade or two numerous transitional fossils have been found, in many cases bridging gaps (such as the fish-terapod link) that creationist critics of evolution have asserted could never be bridged. Coyne addresses human evolution in particular, and shows how the fossilized bones of hominin ancestors fit perfectly into the predicted intermediate forms.Coyne's analysis of how evolution coincides with the geographical history of the earth (meaning the history of how continents have shifted) is particularly good. Other notable parts include the evolution of vision, sexual selection selection and evolution, and observations of evolution acting on bacterial species (such as Hall's experiments). Coyne's chapter on vestigal organs and instances of ""bad design"" (such as the loss of Vitamin C machinery in primates) is alone worth the purchase price.It will be quite a while before someone tops Coyne's book. Enjoy it while it lasts."
3,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/755462-nathan,3,"I picked this book after reading Dawkins' Greatest Show on Earth. After a series of conversations I had with some young-earth creationists, and in light of what is occurring in the battle for science curriculum here in Texas, I wanted to find a book that I could recommend to creationists, since most creationists have absolutely no clue about the actual science. Dawkins' book is not that book because he is unable to keep his contempt for young-earth creationists out of the conversation. I think the book would only insult those people who I wish would open up their worldviews a bit. To that end, Dawkins defeats his own purpose for writing the book in the way he delivers the material. This book has a far more neutral tone, and is a a nice succinct look at the science of evolution. He chases less rabbits than Dawkins also, and he presents the evidence with a less impassioned tone than Dawkins, which I think is real plus if you're actually hoping to get those who disagree with you to listen to what you're saying. You can see the differences in these two books just by looking at the titles. Dawkins' Greatest Show on Earth is an impassioned case for evolution. It's practically a love letter to the natural world. Why Evolution is True is a far drier presentation of much of the same evidence. I personally enjoy Dawkins clever writing and all his rabbit chasing, and the passion for the subject that he can not hide, so personally I didn't enjoy this book as much as The Greatest Show on Earth. But it's a very good general-interest overview of the science of evolution. Reading these two books together, I realize how much my education as a child failed me, largely because my science teachers were clearly afraid of wrath of the religious influences in our community if they really taught the facts of evolution. To me that this is still going on is a travesty. Since I started the quest for a book that I could share with young-earth creationists, I've realized the search is a futile one. Once you realize where creationists begin their argument, you realize there's no point in trying to have a reasoned conversation with them. They start by stating their hypothesis is fact, and indeed is revealed through God's own words. Then they work in reverse. Anything that doesn't support this conclusion is suspect, and is thrown out, or otherwise ignored. They aren't looking at the evidence to see where it leads, they are looking at the evidence to figure out how to discredit it, or how they can possibly warp it into a way in which it might lend some kind of credibility to what they already believe. Their minds are already made up. They have no respect for the scientific process, and consider the academic process of peer reviewed publication--probably one of the greatest things to happen to the process of learning--to be a conspiracy. I don't know how I forgot this, but i'm grateful for the reminder. Far greater minds than me have been unable to get these people to see how flawed this worldview is. It's certainly not something I'm going to cure. So I think this book concludes my quest. I don't think it will sway many minds that are already made up, But if you're someone out there just looking for a great overview so you can learn more about about the massive evidence used to understand the process that got us here, or if you genuinely don't know what to believe, because science education in this country has failed you miserably, this is a great place to start. One more thought. I think he should have left the final chapter out. I understand why he feels like he needs to assuage fears that if society in general accepts evolution is true, we'll quickly de-evolve into a pack rabid dogs, but i don't think the argument is something that can be tacked on to this conversation and dealt with fairly in a few pages, and I don't think it has any place in a book about the science itself. It's the job of science to excavate the truth about how the world around us works. It's up to philosophers and religious leaders and the like to figure out what to do with that information. I think the fear of evolution destroying religious world views is about as rational as the fear that the entire universe doesn't revolve around the earth will end the Christian world view. When religion and science spar, historically, religion always loses, and it always finds a way to bounce back. I think the best way to forward for science is to continue to present the evidence and let the religious leaders work out how they're going to work it into their wordview, though I see why Coyne and Dawkins and others feel that to this point, that approach hasn't worked out so well. Still I think the important point that should be hammered relentlessly is that science makes no commentary on faith. Evolution makes no true commentary on God. It isn't even a theory on origins, merely a theory on how life adapted over time. Faith deals with the super-natural. Science stops at the natural world. I think the scientific world would make better progress if they continue to make this point with the religious communities. "
4,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67532575-kevin-shepherd,5,"Coyne is direct and no-nonsense. He doesn't get bogged down in the pointless debate of trying to disprove a negative, he simply states what IS and what IS NOT. Evolution is not a belief, it's a science. It's a science supported by 150 years of research and (literally) mountains of evidence. And, like any true science, the timelines and conclusions have been tweaked and recalculated with the introduction of new data. In the end, everyone will draw their own conclusions. Either the theological narrative of the origin of life is not entirely accurate or the sciences of paleontology, anthropology, astrophysics, genetics and evolutionary biology are bogus and irrelevant."
5,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1258773-douglas-wilson,2,Coyne admittedly had the uphill struggle of trying to prove something that is not true.
6,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2619231-richard,2,"I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could. Seeing how I think he's wrong, though, I'll downgrade rather than upgrade.I probably agree with 70% of what's in the book, which may be surprising, me being a creationist. I'm not going to try to untangle all the mixtures of agreement and disagreement.. but its interesting that I definitely am fully onboard with over half of the book, but still disagree with the major premise; that evolution is true.Coyne succeeds in presenting a case for neo-darwinian evolution. By which I mean, he successfully explains observations in light a modern evolutionary theory. He paints a fairly complete systematic understanding of the history of life. I recommend the book to everyone for this reason. E.O. Wilson is correct when he writes in the blurb on the back that this is a ""clear, well-written explanation of evolution.""Unfortunately, he doesn't begin to explain the serious difficulties of darwinism (he outright denies the existence of such problems!). That's a major drawback of the book... it presents it more as a defensive boast rather than a scientific and critical examination of evidence.A further detriment is the apparently intentional strawman portrayal of creationists. There is an endnote on page 33 that explains the creationist position as allowing for microevolutionary change within biblical 'kinds'. But this is the only place in the book creationists are treated this honestly. Everywhere else 'special creation' is caricatured as a special creation event for each and every species of organism. It is dishonest and, once again, takes away from the argument of the book.The final failure of the book I will mention is the last chapter, where Coyne attempts to deal with philosophical and metaphysical implications of evolution. It is a sad attempt... while he should be praised for recognizing the need to deal with these issues, he should have stopped when he honestly stated the case: ""How can you derive meaning, purpose, or ethics from evolution? You can't."" (p225)"
7,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3046014-jesse,2,"This one is like the Beak of the Finch: it shows impressive work on Natural Selection, but it doesn't prove that the little changes must lead to the huge changes between people and animals. This book also illustrates how scientists are trying to be historians--a kind of integrating of subjects--and they are failing miserably. If any historian tried to pass of these kinds of arguments as history they wouldn't survive the laughter. Evolutionists reason like this: if these two bone structures look alike they must be related; therefore one must have come from the other. That's like an historian saying Alexander the Great and Charlemagne were both kings; therefore one must have come from the other. Evolutionists assume a system and then fit everything into it, but they seem to think that they are not making assumptions. Some how they are assumption free. Really?"
8,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/502680-david,3,"First of all, this is a very well-written book that powerfully makes the case for Darwinian evolution. The author is well-versed in the subject. I would recommend this book to anyone who, like me, has little knowledge of the actual science of evolution but wants to learn. That said, I am not really bothered by evolution (and I am an evangelical Christian, though not a creationist). Yes there are theological challenges that the science of evolution brings to scripture. I don't think these challenges are as much in Genesis 1. Genesis 1 comes across poetically and I highly doubt whomever wrote it was intending to write modern science. The bigger challenge comes in Genesis 2 and 3 which presents Adam and Eve as the first humans and of course, Paul speaks of Adam as the first human in parallel to Christ as the new human. But even there, many Christians have found a way to reconcile evolution and faith.The rest of this is not so much a review of the book as my thoughts on the real questions at the heart of the debate (which are philosophical, not scientific, questions)I think part of the problem in the whole debate is the rhetoric both sides use. Throughout the book Coyne attacks creationists. To some degree this is necessary as creationists are the ones most opposed to evolution. But such rhetoric tends to put people on the defensive. I mean, I think everyone has been in an argument where they knew they were wrong but kept arguing anyway to save face. The fact is that whether evolution is true or not is irrelevant to the question of whether God exists.A parallel to other sciences may help make my point. The Bible talks often about God sending rain and sunshine. Yet when meteorology explains how weather patterns occur naturally, no one blinked an eye. People of faith continued to see that behind those natural processes, God is still involved in the weather. There is no battle to get a creationist view of meteorology taught in schools. But I imagine when you read a meteorology textbook there are no slams on God, there is no argument that because we know how weather arises naturally we know God has nothing to do with it.When we get to evolution, the dialogue changes. Again, this is not a knock on Coyne for he is specifically defending evolution against creationists, so of course he will attack them. I just wonder how the debate would change if both sides admitted that the science of evolution does not prove God does not exist. Maybe I am idealistic, but if we heard more people in the middle (believers who accept evolution, nonbelievers who accept evolution but admit it does not rule out God) and less extremes (both Richard Dawkins and Ken Hamm see evolution as ruling out God) perhaps the debate would change.Coyne manages to mostly avoid the problem of moving from science into philosophy. In the last chapter he writes: ""How can you derive meaning, purpose, or ethics from evolution? You can't. Evolution is simply a theory about the process and patterns of life's diversification, not a grand philosophical scheme about the meaning of life"" (225). Nice. In the next paragraph he notes that finding meaning, purpose and moral guidance are outside the domain of science. But by the end of the chapter Coyne is talking about ""deriving your spirituality from science"" (232). That seems muddled. Right before this, he writes: ""The world still teems with selfishness, immorality, and injustice. But look elsewhere and you'll find innumerable acts of kindness and altruism. There may be elements of both behaviors that come from our evolutionary heritage, but these acts are largely a matter of choice, not of genes. Giving to charity, volunteering to eradicate disease in poor countries, fighting fires at immense personal risk - none of these acts could have been instilled in us directly by evolution"" (230-231). Then where did they come from? Not science.He goes on to say evolution acts in a ""purposeless, materialistic way"" (231). This is okay, because people find meaning in all kinds of places, including religion (231). Then he gets to spirituality from science, ending up with a quote from an author lamenting the failure of science to replace conventional religion (232). He ends by assuring us that accepting evolution will not cause us to behave like beasts because, well, look how much great art and literature humans have made.I do wonder though, earlier he talks about infanticide among lions (122). If humans are just a part of nature, then why is infanticide wrong for us? Likewise, he seems to lament humans introducing foreign species into habitats that then kill native animals off (110). But if humans are part of nature, are we not just playing a role in natural evolution where some animals survive and others do not?It appears like on one hand he is saying the science of evolution says nothing about religion for science only talks about how. On the other hand, if only we could get rid of religion and just have science. But back to the first hand, science alone gives us no meaning and purpose. Thus, we have some vague ""spirituality from science"", whatever that is. To me, it seems muddled. Overall, this is a good book to learn about the science of evolution. But whether this science is true or not (and Coyne makes a strong case that it is) reveals little to nothing about the questions of meaning, purpose and God's existence."
9,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264605-elaine,5,"This was such an awesome book. I have read a lot of books on evolution, but this is the first that actually made me interested in fossils. Very, very cool. Of course it wouldn't convince a dummy that evolution is true because you actually have to have some reading comprehension and be able to understand what you read, but for anyone with a brain that doesn't believe in evolution (I still can't undertand how there are people out there that fit that bill, but I digress), this book will remove all doubt and if it doesn't, you aren't understanding it. "
10,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"This book avoids bickering over details and goes right for the throat; exposing Creationism and Intelligent Design for the unworkable, unscientific ploys that they are. It does so without being too aggressive, a la Dawkins, because such heavy hitting really isn't necessary, when there's so much evidence to be presented. Instead, the chapters cover fossils and a little bit of genetics. The reader is walked through the process of how we came to know what we know. It's not a challenging book, nor a long one, but it does suffice to show Why Evolution Is True."
11,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6199925-david,1,"I have recently been interested in the topic of evolution. I am a Bible believing creationist and I have heard of many questions that seem to really challenge the theory of evolution. For me when considering an argument I try to consider both sides of the argument with an open mind. So I picked up this book with the intention to have an open mind and hear the ""other side of the story"".Unfortunately I was very disappointed. Based on the title of this book ""Why Evolution is True"" I was expecting to hear the author speak to some of the serious challenges to evolution. However, this was not the case. In my opinion Coyne seems to setup so-called ""straw men"" and then attack those with an air of pompous superiority that made me want to throw the book in the garbage. Coyne did not deal with any of the serious questions that I had and seemed content to pick and choose whatever parts of ID, creationism, or literal 6-day creationism that seemed easy for him to pick off.""Why ... do we need a book that gives the evidence for a theory that long ago became part of mainstream science? After all, nobody writes books explaining the evidence for atoms, or for the germ theory of disease."" - pg. xvii. This comment in the introduction sets the tone for the rest of the book. The attitude conveyed is one of ""I can't believe I have to write a book like this"". Thanks a lot bud.These are the major topics that Coyne covers along with my thoughts:1. History in rocks. No mention of the objections to radiometric dating. Radiometric dating makes some serious assumptions about presence of certain isotopes. Not to mention that the various types of dating (uranium-lead, carbon-14, etc) can very often disagree. Rock recently formed from a volcanic eruption known to have happened 200 years ago using radiometric dating could conclude it happened 100-600 million years ago (article). Also, there are some serious questions to the geological column. One example is trees that sit upright in the column and ""straddle"" multiple layers of rock that supposedly represent thousands of years (article). Also, how do we see ""flat gaps"" between rock layers that supposedly represent millions of years of sedimentation and then erosion? (article). In my opinion, the geological column and radiometric dating are where evolution is the most open to doubt. And if this is the case then this is Coyne's largest omission. 2. Vestiges, Embryos, Bad Design. I found Coyne's argument for vestigial traits to be guilty of circular reasoning. Example. ""Our bodies team with remnants of primate ancestry. We have a vestigial tail: the coccyx, or the triangular end of our spine that's made of several fuzed vertebrae hanging below our pelvis. It's what remains of the long, useful tail of our ancestors. It still has a function, but remember that it's vestigiality is diagnosed not by its usefulness but because it no longer has the function for which it evolved."" - pg. 62Question: How do we know that we evolved from other species? Evolution: Because we see vestigial traits.Question: How do we know that what you consider to be vestigial is in fact vestigial? Evolution: Because we know we evolved from other species.The same type of reasoning is used for embryology and so called ""bad design"". Not to mention the fact that in order to truly be able to classify something as a vestige or bad design you must 100% understand the entire function of the organism. Which science cannot say in the case of the majority of organisms on this planet. Right?BTW there are huge objections to embryology. So much so that it is not taken seriously anymore (aritcle).I could go on and on of these topics but I will stop there.3. Bio-geography. Nothing I read here seemed un-explainable with the Flood model. As per Coyne himself plants/animals have been documented to cover huge distances of water and land and to colonize an area in a relatively short period of time.4. Genetics. This is something that I admittedly need to study in more depth. However, my conclusions in this area did not seem to be seriously challenged by this chapter. Namely that each species has a certain amount of genetic ""material"" that allows for adaptation to it's environment. Some organisms have a huge range of potential adaptational ability and others do not. For example look at the dog. Man has used breeding so that now we have dogs that range from the Saint Bernard to the Chihuahua. The dog seemingly has a huge adaptational ability. However, would anyone think that breeders could somehow breed a dog into a fish? Or maybe even just an additional leg? No, no I don't think anyone would think this is possible no matter how long a breeder had to do this. But for some reason if you add millions of years into the mix anything is possible. Speaking of dogs I thought this was an interesting comment from Coyne about dogs - ""If somehow the recognized breeds existed only as fossils, palaeontologists would consider them not one species but many - certainly more than the 36 species of wild dogs that live in nature today"". Yes and not only that but palaeontologists would construct an evolutionary tree around them and call this ""proof"" of evolution. Then biologists would use this as ""proof"" for vestigial traits and embryology. A seemingly tidy arrangement. :)5. Origin of Species. Depends on genetics. Coyne makes an interesting point that macro-evolution, because of the long periods of time necessary, will NEVER be seen in a human lifetime as is not provable in history because we only started serious scientific documentation in the last few hundred years. Guess we will just have to wait for 100,000 years to see if this theory is true. :) Perhaps if radiometric dating and the theory of the geological columns was absolutely rock solid with no assumptions we might be justified in making some some conclusions here. However, this does not seem to be the case. An assumption based on another assumption does not equal to ""fact"". 6. Human evolution. Does not deal with the huge objections to the fossil evidence for human evolution. Find just a summary here (article). By Coyne's own admission ""...our early human ancestors were large, relatively few in number compared to grazers like antelopes, and inhabited a small part of Africa under dry conditions not conductive to fossilization. Their fossils, like those of all apes and monkeys, are scarce."" - pg. 195 However he goes on to speak of the human fossil record as if it is indisputable. ""These mysteries about how we evolved should not distract us from the indisputable fact that we did evolve. Even without fossils, we have evidence of human evolution from comparative anatomy, embryology, our vestigial traits, and even biogeography. ...The fossil record is really the icing on the cake."" - pg. 209-210. Perhaps Coyne does not remember that in the chapters dealing with embryology and vestigial traits he uses the fossil record as the proof. Circular reasoning yet again.7. Evolution redux. Probably the most disappointing chapter of them all. Coyne dips into philosophy and tries to make some profound statements without any logical backup or reasoning. Ex: ""Although evolution operates in a purposeless, materialistic way, that doesn't mean that our lives have no purpose."" - pg. 231. But then Coyne does not attempt to give a fundamental reason for purpose. I realize that he did not intend for this book to be philosophical in nature. But if you are not going to do it justice then please don't even go there. :)To summarize my thoughts on this book:1. Many assumptions and circular reasoning.2. Extremely tough on creationists lack of evidence but then seemingly forgiving for any lack of evidence on the evolutionary side.3. Does NOT deal with the serious objections to evolution. 4. This is NOT a book that seriously considers evidence on both sides and tries to make an objective conclusion. It is only a book to RE-ENFORCE evolutionary BELIEF in evolution as a ""fact"".I sincerely hope that this book does not accurately represent evolutionary science.SIDE NOTE: ""There, on the very land that symbolizes evolution, the iconic islands that inspired Darwin, a Seventh-day Adventist school dispenses undiluted creationist biology to children of all faiths."" - pg. xix. I had to smile at this comment as I am a Seventh-day Adventist myself. Way to go Adventists!!"
12,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14475342-abubakar-mehdi,5,"This is an eloquent, detailed and fascinating study of Evolution. An idea as controversial, and one with such profound socio-political repercussion, deserves to be treated the way Coyne has dealt it. He presents arguments systematically and he is not too keen on bashing creationists. He keeps his nose out of futile arguments and focuses primarily on the scientific aspect of evolution and not the psychological or philosophical elements that often become a part of such a discussion. This makes the book an excellent and in-depth introduction to Evolutionary Biology, its historical significance and the tremendous amount of scientific research that has been undertaken over the years by scientists. 	Coyne at length describes fossil evidence, vestigial organs, genetics and other subjects that are involved in every sophisticated study of Evolution. Recent studies have been mixed with previous predictions and some beautiful diagrams illustrate them for convenience.  This is a brilliant book and I can’t recommend it enough."
13,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Why Evolution Is True by Jerry A. CoyneWhy Evolution Is True is my favorite book on evolution. It starts of course with the prodigious knowledge of Mr. Coyne but it’s his ability to explain such complex topics with ease that sets this book apart from the rest. It’s profound without being unintelligible. It’s always the first book I recommend when I want to convince someone that the theory of evolution is true and supported by converging mountains of evidence. The book is composed of the following nine chapters: What is Evolution, Written in the Rocks, Remnants: Vestiges, Embryos, and Bad Design, The Geography of Life, The Engine of Evolution, How Sex Drives Evolution, The Origin of Species, What About Us?, and Evolution Redux.Positives: 1.	I absolutely love Mr. Coyne’s assured, confident approach backed by lucid scientific evidence. He masters his topic and he conveys it with expertise. This is how all scientific books should be written, make your point and provide cogent arguments to defend it, bravo!2.	Great scientific quotes abound. Reference material.3.	The best explanation for the theory of natural selection with a luxury of details.4.	Mr. Coyne tells it as he sees it without being disrespectful. He establishes clearly where the resistance for evolution comes from and puts it in its proper place.5.	Great use of figures that help illustrate evolution.6.	I absolutely love how Mr. Coyne weaves several disciplines of science to make his points as clear as possible.7.	In making the case perfectly clear for evolution, he in fact destroys any notion of an “Intelligent Design”.8.	An outstanding explanation for evolutionary predictions.9.	Radiometric dating and how we are able to have confidence in its accuracy.10.	Everything you wanted to know about fossil records and transitional forms. Including two of the best examples: Tiktaalik and Archaeopteryx. 11.	One of my favorite sections…vestigial traits. A lot of aha moments here.12.	Great examples of bad “design”.13.	Convergent evolution explained.14.	Genetics made easy to understand.15.	The best explanation on how our eyes evolved. 16.	Sexual evolution…I finally get it.17.	I enjoy the admiration that evolutionary biologists have for the icons of their industry: Darwin goes without saying but there is great admiration for Ernst Mayr and Richard Dawkins.18.	Absolutely loved the chapter about human evolution.19.	This book explains the most important concepts of evolution like no other. Brilliant!20.	All the links, notes, glossary does this superb book justice.Negatives:1.	Having to wait for Mr. Coyne’s next book. In summary, this is in my humble opinion the best book about evolution for the masses. No book explains the theory of evolution any better than this one. It’s thorough, well written, and makes you proud to love science. I can’t recommend this book enough. A well deserved 5-star book. You don’t have to believe in evolution but once you read this book it will leave you no choice but to accept it.Recommendations: “Your Inner Fish…” by Neil Shubin, “The Making of the Fittest” by Sean B. Carroll, “What Evolution Is” by Ernst Mayr, “Life Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution” by Nick Lane and “The Greatest Show on Earth” by the great Richard Dawkins. "
14,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"For those looking for evidence supporting evolution, either because they themselves doubt it or want more evidences to argue for it, these two books can do the job extremely well.I bet the vast majority if not all of those who read ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" & ""Why Evolution is True"" with an open mind and understand them, will regard evolution as true and be able to argue in its favor strongly.Both authors maintain that evolution is compatible with #religion although they do not elaborate on that. In fact, Dawkins -who is notorious for his criticism of religion- goes on and lists a number of British #bishops and public figures who call for teaching of evolution in publicly-funded schools.I recommend reading Dawkins book first since he explains what is evolution and natural selection in detail before moving to the evidence while Coyne presents a lot of evidences and details.For books that try to reconcile between religion and evolution, I hear that ""Finding Darwin's God"" & ""The Language of God"" are good, although I haven't read them yet."
15,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution"". That classic quote from the great Russian-American evolutionary geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky is replete with far more truth now than when he uttered it in 1973. Thousands of scientists around the globe are using the principles of evolution towards understanding phenomena as simple as bacterial population growth to those as complex as the origin and spread of such virulent diseases as malaria and HIV/AIDS, and the conservation of many endangered plant and animal species. There is no other scientific theory I know of that has withstood such rigorous, and repeated, testing as the modern synthetic theory of evolution. The overwhelming proof of biological evolution is so robust, that entire books have been written describing pertinent evidence from sciences that, at first glance, seem as dissimilar from each other as paleobiology, molecular biology and ecology. But alas this hasn't convinced many in the court of public opinion, especially here, in the United States, who remain skeptical of evolution as both a scientific fact and a scientific theory, and who are too often persuaded by those who insist that there are such compelling ""weaknesses"" in evolution, that instead of it, better, still ""scientific"", alternatives exist, most notably, Intelligent Design creationism. Distinguished evolutionary geneticist Jerry Coyne's ""Why Evolution Is True"" is not just a timely book, but it is quite simply, the best, most succinct, summation I can think of on behalf of evolution's scientific validity. No other modern evolutionary biologist has attempted to convey, with such excitement, and enthusiasm, a comprehensive, quite compelling, proof of biological evolution, unless you consider the notable literary careers of Coyne's graduate school mentors; Ernst Mayr and Stephen Jay Gould. Coyne's achievement is especially noteworthy for covering virtually every major evolutionary aspect of biology in a treatment that barely exceeds two hundred and thirty pages. In essence, ""Why Evolution is True"" can be viewed as an updated, modern rendition of Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"", but encompassing those biological sciences, such as population genetics, molecular systematics, evolutionary developmental biology - better known as ""evo - devo"" - and, indeed, even paleobiology, which were unknown to Darwin; to put it bluntly, this is ""one long argument"" on behalf of evolutionary biology, told via Coyne's respectable, occasionally lyrical, prose and compelling logic. Coyne asserts that there are six principles of evolution in the book's first chapter (having been preceded by two brief prefaces devoted to the nature of science and the ongoing intellectual threat posed by Intelligent Design creationism); evolution - which he defines as a species undergoing genetic change through time - gradualism, speciation, common ancestry, natural selection, and nonselective mechanisms of evolutionary change. These are indeed the very principles recognizable to anyone who has taken an undergraduate course in evolution, the key features of the Modern Synthesis Theory of Evolution; in other words, modern evolutionary theory. And they are principles recognizable to those evolutionary biologists who concur with Gould's observation that current evolutionary theory is incomplete in explaining the origin, composition and history of our planet's biodiversity; scientifically testable principles unlike those alleged to exist for Intelligent Design and other flavors of ""scientific"" creationism. In the book's remaining nine chapters, Coyne offers persuasive evidence on behalf of these principles from the fossil record, from the biogeography of plants and animals, from molecular genomic data, and other aspects of biology, discusses the importance of sex in driving evolutionary change, and the process of speciation itself. There is much worthy of praise in Coyne's elegantly terse tome in defense of biological evolution. His fossil record chapter (Chapter Two) compellingly recounts the evolution of primitive tetrapods from bony fishes in the late Devonian, the mid Mesozoic evolution and early radiation of birds from their feathered theropod dinosaur ancestors, and the early Cenozoic evolution of whales from primitive ungulates distantly related to rhinos and tapirs. He demonstrates persuasively (Chapter Three) how humans and other animals are so poorly ""designed"", that their ""designs"" bear ample witness against the existence of an Intelligent Designer. His superb treatment of biogeography (Chapter Four) echoes the literary elegance of Darwin's prose, and reminds us of the stark differences between so-called Intelligent Design ""theory"" and evolution in making testable, verifiable, predictions regarding both present-day and fossil distributions of plants and animals. In the book's finest chapter (Chapter Seven), devoted to speciation, Coyne - who is among our foremost authorities on speciation - offers a surprisingly comprehensive account that discusses not only the mechanisms of speciation, but also, of equal importance to biologists, how species are recognized and defined as distinct populations separated from others in space and time. But readers may find most moving, his poignant treatment of humanity as a biological species (Chapter Eight), and how evolution may still be driving the course of human evolution. There is so much worthy of praise in Coyne's book, that it seems almost an afterthought to mention errors, omissions, and potential disagreements. The most glaring of these may be his insistence of gradualism as an important principle of evolution, since others, like his Stony Brook University colleague Douglas Futuyma, have recognized the importance of morphological stasis (Though he might contend vigorously and persuasively that to do so would be to recast the argument as one of evolutionary tempo, instead of mode.). But I am especially surprised by his omission of the significant role of mass extinctions in reshaping the composition and complexity of Earth's biosphere, not just once, but approximately seven times in the last five hundred-odd million years, which has garnered ample attention from past and current University of Chicago colleagues; paleobiologists David Raup, J. John Sepkoski, and David Jablonski, among others. By themselves, mass extinctions are the key episodes in the history of life on Earth still ignored by leading Intelligent Design creationists such as mathematician and philosopher William Dembski and biochemist Michael Behe; their very existence strongly refutes the inane assertion that life has been ""intelligently designed"". ""Why Evolution is True"" belongs on the bookshelves of anyone interested in science. However, those who are skeptical of evolution's scientific validity, remain its intended audience. Any of them possessing an objective, open mind, should be persuaded by Coyne's terse prose and compelling logic. The evidence for biological evolution is quite overwhelmingly true; Coyne's slender book is a magnificent presentation of this proof. "
16,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1282558-rebecca,5,"I really enjoyed this book. Basically, it's a several-hundred page review of the major arguments for not only why scientists accept the theory biological evolution, but why it is so well accepted that it is stated to be 'true'. Each chapter breaks down a part of the evidence -- fossils, embryology, genetic evidence, observations of natural selection, the role of sex in evolution, speciation, and so on. Usually the general case is talked about, with examples about specific evidence, though the author notes that he can't give every case of, say, discovery of transitional fossils where and when transitional fossils should exist, as each topic he discussed was something that books could be written on by their lonesome. I knew a lot of the examples -- Tiktaalik, the fish-with-legs; the signs of human evolution of lactose tolerance but only in populations that herded; the strange geometry of arteries and nerves in the human head and neck that came from gill arches in the embryo very similar to the ones fishes have; etc. -- but I still would often find a specific case that I had never heard of. Even things that would be useful on Ask an Astronomer -- like that corals show that the Earth was spinning faster in the Paleozoic, and this amount matched up with both models of the Moon despinning the Earth and radiometric dating. The last two chapters were especially interesting. The author singles out humans for a full chapter on their evolution, noting that acceptance of evolution always seems to boil down to whether people are comfortable with the idea that we share an ancestor with chimpanzees (and... well, everything else). The last chapter spoke about the moral implications of evolution -- both that just because something is true does not impose any stance on right versus wrong -- and takes a brief dip into the field of evolutionary psychology. If you are already convinced by the evidence, you might get a bit weary about the author's insistence on noting that creationism/ID does not have any explanation about why such is so. I mean, for me, he's lecturing to the teaching assistants. But it is the elephant in the room, I suppose -- the idea that ID offers an actual scientific alternative, rather than being a disguised religious belief. (Completely unrelated, but I find it amusing that the person who recommended this book to me noted that Richard Dawkins was a good biology writer, but the fact he was known for writing on atheism as well as biology meant that the recommender felt like any wavering theist would reject his biology books out of hand, while would take something like this as a way of seeing the evidence. Yet, this book has a blurb from Dawkins, which notes him as the author of The God Delusion, rather than, say, The Selfish Gene. Way to go, marketing department. *eyeroll*) "
17,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1334545-david-s-t,5,"This book is fascinating and well written. I think the highest complement I could give it is, had I read it 10 years ago when I was in college, I'd likely be in the field of biology instead of computer science. This book starts off with a basic overview of evolution before heading into the bulk of the evidence. The first section of evidence is based off of fossils, I didn't realize just how many transitional fossils exist for certain species such as the whale (there a pretty good number of fossils showing the progression from a land mammal to a sea one. Something else I found interesting is that in the human embryo, grow lanugo full body hair before losing it all (a remnant of their evolution heritage). Of course I haven't even scratched the surface of everything this book contains. One thing I do wish he expounded on more is DNA, during one discussions on speciation he addresses how once the chromosomes are different enough they can no longer produce an offspring, but this left me confused because how did we get from the 24 ape Chromosomes to the 23 in humans, sadly for a book so full of information this much have been beyond the scope of it, I'll soon read Relics of Eden which appears to discuss the fusion of two chromosomes from the ape into one for man. This is also the one area where Dawkins' The Great Show on Earth does better (DNA evidence) I'm still pretty new on learning about evolution so this book might be too basic for some, but so far its the best of the 4 books that I've read or am reading on the subject. It seems that this book is often compared to Dawkins The Greatest Show on Earth since they were written about the same time, in my opinion for a first book on evolution this one is better, its more concise but there's much more evidence presented in this 250ish page book than I've gotten out of the 350 pages I've read so far of Dawkins book (which is a great read also, but pretty unfocused, full of great information but not much evidence). As for the other two books I've read, ff you're a creationist or follow intelligent design, Finding Darwin's God is a great read. I'm also reading Darwin's On the Origin of The Species and I think anyone wanting to learn more about evolution should start elsewhere and only read that for historical/important work purposes. Growing up in the bible belt, I've heard discussions on the validity of evolution, but without really knowing much about it, I never actually formed an opinion one way or the other. Its hard to have an opinion on hearsay, but after reading this and Finding Darwin's God, I think the evidence is pretty apparent. I wonder how many anti-evolutionists actually read up on the subject and not just follow what they've been taught. I'm finding evolution highly interesting, I wish more would read up on it before dismissing it and this book is a great place to start. "
18,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,5,"Oh, I am such a cheater this month! I totally started this book a couple of days ago but, in my defense, I finished it up this morning....I just couldn't help myself.Evolution. Very few words in science can raise the religious hackles and get the debate juices flowing like this one. Even numerous court trials have become involved to help decide if evolution is science fact or fiction and whether the opposing viewpoint - creationism - deserves to be taught and considered on the same academic level.Granted, I went into this book a full-fledged supporter of evolution but I was still struck (again) by the beauty and elegance of this biological process that was thought of hundreds of years ago. Coyne logically and concisely went through the evidence for evolution - tracing his way through the fossil record to show dinosaurs evolving into birds, fish invading the land as terrestrial tetrapods, and terrestrial mammals going migrating back into the oceans. He not only shows fossil evidence and supports it with rigorous hypothesis testing (the hallmark of robust science) and examples from nature, but also brilliantly illustrates evolution rapidly occurring during a human lifetime. The vast majority of the book focuses on evolution in general - single-celled organisms up through mammals - but the final chapter focuses on humans evolution from primates and, what I feel is, irrefutable evidence that this process is the best explanation we have for how Homo sapiens came to be.Sometimes science books can be a little tedious (shock, I know) but Coyne's writing style had me anxiously awaiting to pick the book back up! His words were illustrated by lovely drawings that I prefer so much more to pictures because it brings uniformity to book. And, possibly my favorite part, is that Coyne didn't attack any other belief system - he occasionally brought up the creationist argument against a specific evolution viewpoint but I didn't feel like he was hostile in any way, he simply laid out the facts and let them speak for themselves.If you are a supporter of evolution but want to learn more, are unsure on the issue but would like more facts, or are even staunchly against evolution but think it's important to know the opposition, then I would highly recommend this book."
19,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,5,"This is a remarkable book. It is written by someone who is really interested in educating people and not just laying out facts. I loved the tone of the author and am now following his blog Why Evolution is True which is really interesting and amusing (this guy really loves cats!). He almost daily posts lots of interesting facts about evolution.There's a good YT video about this book that people may be interested in seeing before reading the book http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1m4mA...Before buying this book, I read some bad reviews about it from people who said that the tone of the author was aggressive and he was really obnoxious. This is certainly not the case. After hearing what some say about Dawkins (whom I personally calm and convincing) being aggressive and obnoxious and about Coyne, I came to the sad conclusion that some will really get offended no matter how you write about evolution. It could be that people like Hitch may sometimes be offensive, but Dawkins or this guy Coyne, they are serious people interested in education other than paying lip service. Anyway, the author shows how natural selection operates and drives life by demonstrating some of the most interesting stuff about evolution of different species. There is a chapter about embryos and especially how the human evolution can be traced by the different stages that our embryo undergoes which made me shudder. People who are very familiar with evolution may find some of ideas in this book repetitive, but there is certainly some new stuff here. I read both The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watchmaker and was still amazed by many interesting facts, so I recommend it, especially to those who want an easy and brief introduction to evolution. "
20,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41987697-mohamed-elsherif,5,"It only took me 3 years to finish this book, but I'm glad I did, very good book that is mainly written for people who are not bilogists yet curious to know about the scientific literature in the subject, it answers most of the questions people have about evolution in a very logical way and lays down the evidence clear early enough in the book and I appreciated that it left the human evolution subject towards the end of the book after it established a lot of terminology with the reader so it doesn't come as a surprise after all.Very important read and highly recommended for those curious to actually know the scientific subject."
21,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1392101-scarlett-sims,2,"I chose to read this book to learn more about the science behind evolution, at least partially so I could defend or explain it to people. However, Coyne's writing style left much to be desired.At the parts where he did actually discuss evidence for evolution (which he often mislabeled as ""proof""), I enjoyed learning about it. However, he repeatedly attempted to use this information to discredit creationism, his main argument being ""See.... why would a creator do this?"" which is obviously neither science nor logical. It also bothered me that his working definition of creationism was sufficiently narrow as to be easily refuted. He also made statements like ""all creationist believe x"" or ""no creationist believes x"" which is sloppy and in some if not all cases just plain wrong.In his section of further reading, he makes a point of not including any books by proponents of creationism. This is his prerogative, but it makes me wonder if he has read any of them because of the many errors he attributes to the creationist perspective.Coyne claims that he wants to educate the public about evolution, but the tone of the book is so insular and, ultimately, many of the reasons people have for denying evolution aren't going to go away just because they read a book discussing scientific evidence contrary to their viewpoint."
22,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20015365-may,5,"A great book to end the year with. ""But there is something even more wondrous. We are the one creature to whom natural selection has bequeathed a brain complex enough to comprehend the laws that govern the universe. And we should be proud that we are the only species that has figured out how we came to be."""
23,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4771466-john-martindale,3,"Well, I now have a new understanding why evolutionist feel so strongly and are so insistent that evolution is true. The evidence in this book is truly staggering, much of which I had never heard before. The book is well written and he seemed like a pretty reasonable guy, quick to mention when something is speculation and when something (according to the scientific community) is established fact. He bent over backwards to show that evolution is science in the fullest sense of the word and is scientific fact like the law of gravity. But yeah, one thing that bothered me is how much he fears and derides creationist, as if, if we let them have even a slight foot in the door, then its not just the end of science, but the end of the world. I think this is an over reaction. He also, refuses to acknowledge that modern science has its foundation on the Christian assumption that the universe is reasonable and discoverable. Secondly, for decades those making the biggest science advances (Like Isaac Newton) were creationist, their believe in God fueled their curiosity to learn about His universe and they believe by showing how it worked, they were bringing glory to God. I don't think the ""eeeeeevil"" creationist are as dangerous as he thinks. Though what he shared is extremely convincing, I am sure there are some devils in the details; details that the science community does well to hide or refuses to acknowledge in the first place. Evolution is to most now as it was to Darwin, their beloved child whom no one can question or insult or challenge. Unlike most evolutionist I don't deride those who have a different perspectives and see the evidence in a different light. I think one can learn from Jerry A Coyne and equally from Stephen Meyer. It is obvious that though there may be many interpretations of the data, only one is allowed. I also know the power of perspective and how when we go out to prove something, we can find a lot that fits and what does not, we can force until it does fit. So much of the evidence for evolution is in the fossil record, its like we have a bunch of puzzle pieces and they have in their mind a picture of how they're to all go together, so how can they help but arrange the pieces to please the eyes, just like the evil creationist also arrange the pieces to please their eyes. The presuppositions causes them to think the other side absurd. But yeah, evolutionist believe most species are extinct, but are not even open to the possibility that a fossil is from an extinct creature that we knew not of, but rather automatically assumes it is transitional fossil. But yeah, i am sure I am sounding like an idiot. So I'll shut up about this. The part concerning the genes was the most convincing, especially concerning the pseudo-genes in dolphins. But now i've found a book called ""The myth of junk DNA"", so I know there is different interpretation of the data. So I look forward to reading this book. The section about the evolution of creatures on remote islands is hard to propose a reasonable creationist alternative to, yet it has been done, unlike the author said.  He mentions if evolution was just random chance and accidence, then there would be no life, but he says its not just randomness, but we have lawful natural selection that solves everything. But it still is hard for me to follow the logic on how this fixes the problem. I mean he mentions that mutations are rare and beneficial mutations are extremely rare, so even though national selection grabs every positive mutation and carries it on, it still seems like the chances are absurdly low. Imagine a monkey typing on a keyboard (representing the random mutations) and then a man (who acts the part of natural selection) who jots down every intelligible word and throws out every nonsensical letter. This would not resulted in the writings of Shakespeare or even a intelligible sentence. In the DNA its like we have a word over a billion letters long, I just can't be convinced that randomness can produced more orderly information in the cell then information in the Encyclopedia Britannica. So yeah, I still am far from unconvinced of how the extremely rare unguided, random mutations can bring this about, even with the added element of natural selection. He also does not touch on origins, so yeah how did the molecule evolve the ability to evolve? they think the universe created them, who then created their creator?  There author seems to think the fact of evolution demands a naturalistic/darwinistic explanation, but I disagree and I think Alvin Plantinga's evolutionary argument against philosophical naturalism is pretty good. Plantinga shows if one embraces naturalism, then evolution turns into a defeater to naturalism. As John Lennox put it concerning how naturalism undermines science; ""Faith lies at the heart of science, that the universe is accessible to the human mind. What justifies this faith? Why should we believe that the universe is rational?... The materialist says; my mind is my brain, whats my brain? Its the end product of a mindless, unguided processes... Ohh... So why on earth should I believe anything it tells me? Including that it is the end product of a mindless unguided process!""  Finally, I could not disagree with him more, as he is trying to lay people's worries aside that if their kids are taught they are animals, that they'll start acting like ones. He thinks there is absolutely no bad consequence to believing one is just a bunch of molecules with no concrete value, no absolute morality and no ultimate meaning. But a lot of atheist are running on the fums of Christian ethics, but should we not fear that it might dry up? In the 1900s we saw Darwinism taken to its logical conclusions several times throughout Russia, Germany, China and we even saw eugenics happened in the united states. Atheist regimes had part in the murder of 100 million of their OWN people, they evidently did not believe in the value of the individual and they're political drive was in perfect harmony with their godless belief in the origin of the universe."
24,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2765549-jonathan,3,"I was homeschooled as a child, and my parents believed strongly that creation was a fundamental tenant of Christianity. My science education included quite a lot of books by Creationist authors like Duane Gish, who views evolution as a laughable, largely unsupported ""theory"" invented to dispose of the inconvenient need for a Creator. So, for me, reading this book was a little like looking at a photographic negative: the same tone, similar content, but with all the characters flipped. Just like the zealous Creationists who wrote the textbooks I read as a child, this one is written by a zealous Evolutionist who, in his eagerness to demonstrate the superiority of his theory, strays beyond the boundaries of fair debate.For example, he is very fond of pointing out bits of nature that weren't designed as he would have designed them, and coming to the unfounded conclusion that they weren't designed at all. For example, as evidence of evolution, he points out that the plants that live in the deserts near California are different species than those that live in the deserts of the Sahara. Wouldn't a designer, he argues, have simply used the same kinds of plants in both places, since they have similar climates? Since the plants are different, we can conclude that they were not created. QED. Lest you think that I'm exaggerating, here's the actual quote from the book:Why would a creator put plants that are fundamentally different, but look so similar, in diverse areas of the world that seem ecologically identical? Wouldn’t it make more sense to put the same species of plants in areas with the same type of soil and climate?To which I say: well goodness, Jerry, do you buy the precisely same decorations for your living room as you do for your dining room? If not, your interior design can hardly be intelligent. Surely you can grant that a Creator might have enjoyed filling each corner of the Earth with different kinds of plants and animals!With so much good evidence for evolution (and this book lays out plenty of it), there's hardly a need to stray into this line of argument. Yet the author does so, repeatedly, and betrays more than a little condescenion towards those poor, foolish Creationists. However grating the occasional overreaches and smugness are, however, they aren't a major feature of the book and in truth this is a very well-organized, well-written, and thorough defense of evolution. There are even moments of humility, in which the author admits that science doesn't, and maybe never will, know how certain implausible bridges were crossed. Finally, there's a bit at the end that addresses the elephant in the room, without flinching: if we're nothing more than an accidental result of blind, purposeless forces, what's the point of ... well, anything really? While more a question for philosophers than biologists, he addresses it admirably. Perhaps the biggest challenge to the adoption of evolution as fact is not its lack of scientific evidence but its lack of a compelling, purposeful story."
25,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"This is a suggested book related to one of my current classes on Coursera, so I decided to pick it up. I already believe in evolution, so I can't judge on whether it's convincing -- I already know that evolution by natural selection is mathematically inevitable, and I know of a lot of the supporting evidence. Still, this is the kind of book that produces all sorts of titbits that you didn't know before, and which lays things out so clearly it helps you understand how to explain it to other people (which, to my mind, means a deeper understanding of the theory -- if you can explain it, there are fewer grey areas).Overall, it's clearly written, with lots of supporting diagrams and so on where it's useful, and a good set of footnotes and suggestions for further reading. I found it interesting, too; perhaps not for a person with a science background to begin with, but for me (humanities background, science interest) it was easy but not boringly so.Interestingly, he also touches a little on why people find it hard to accept evolution, and answers some of those objections, too -- for example, why our behaviour isn't fully dictated by our genes, why morality and ethics aren't dismantled in any way by evolution."
26,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3411374-mattmiller,3,"As a firm believer in the God of the Bible and his work in the creation of all things I picked up this book to try to become better educated on the subject of evolution. Coyne's writing is clear and concise. He is a good communicator and uses plenty of sources and examples for which I was grateful.Rather than completely contradicting my theistic view, many (yet not all) of his points broadened my appreciation of the immensity and beauty of God's creation. Although his end-of-book thoughts on evolution and the meaning of life were a bit lame, he's after all a scientist not a philosopher and so I guess you have to keep that in mind.While I understand his consistent interaction with Creationism and ID thought, I thought his jabs were unnecessary and his tone condescending at times. But I expected worse.Anyway, I feel like I have been inadequately educated on this branch of science and this book helped me. There are still many questions I have and points to ponder, as I believe in the inerrant nature of the biblical text. But I feel much better equipped to ponder after reading this book."

However there are yet lots of questions that are unsolved and probably needs decades of research until humans come to a better understanding of how we “biologically” came to existence. The author was more respectful to deniers of evolution that Dawkins is. He was also more straight forward. The big drawback though, is that when comparing the ideas of “creationists” as the author likes to call them, he mainly focused on Christianity teachings who anyways believe that life of humans does not exceed 10 thousand years. The author did not touch on the logic of Islamic teachings (where some scholars do not deny evolution) which talk of creation as the work of Allah; ""It is] the work of Allah who perfected all things Indeed He is Acquainted with that which you do""The balance we see on earth, the beauty of all what is on earth (as opposed to the emptiness in the universe) are all but obvious evidence that what has become did not come by luck. Natural selection might be good a theory explaining the biological evolution of the species, but not enough to explain the first creation (which the author purposefully and openly did not include in his book).I enjoyed the book and now have questions of my own; such as how to understand the story of Adam and Eve in light of evolution? Is it possible they ascended to the heavens and back to earth? I am sure one day it will be clear and obvious, and the evidence of creation by Allah will be too strong to deny. "

Jerry A. Coyne's argumentation shapes evolution as a FACT. However, there are yet lots of questions that are unsolved and probably needs decades of research until humans come to a better understanding of how we “biologically” came to existence. And also as Thomas Nagel puts forward in his ""Mind and Cosmos"" book : If materialism cannot accommodate ""consciousness"" and other mind-related aspects of reality, then we must abandon a purely materialist understanding of nature in general, extending to biology, evolutionary theory, and cosmology. Since minds are features of biological systems that have developed through evolution, the standard materialist version of evolutionary biology is fundamentally incomplete. Intelligent Design(ID) & DNA is a hot issue in evolutionary science yet to be clarified by philosophers or so.کتاب های انتقادی داروینیسمBooks against Darwinism: https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/4..."

It's short but packed with evidence from embryology, biogeography, vestigial structures and the fossil record and explains, with plenty of examples, the process of natural selection, genetic drift, speciation, sexual selection and human evolution.One of the examples that most appealed to me because it is so wholesome was John Wells' study of coral fossils which the isotope dating places in the Devonian period (380 million years ago). The theory of the geophysicists that the friction produced by the ocean tides gradually slows Earth's rotation down by 2 seconds every 100,000 years was neatly confirmed by the corals Wells studied, in that the corals had about 400 daily growth rings inside an annual ring - in accordance with the calculation that 380 million years ago a day lasted about 22h, or that there were about 396 days in a year, while the modern corals show about 365 rings. It's such a well-rounded, brilliant yet accessible example of interdisciplinary science at work.This was primarily intended to reason with the creationists in USA, of which there's no lack of. I can't help but wonder if he managed to ""turn"" a single fundamentalist, but at least the general public - myself included - got a very readable and well articulated overview of evolution."
30,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10329028-gary,4,"I hesitated before buying this book because I was a little put off by the title. I already assumed evolution was ""true"" (as much as any scientific knowledge can be considered ""the truth""), and I was more interested in knowing how it works, and the history of it all, from the first micro-organisms to now. The ""how"" part is covered pretty well, and by covering the ""how"" the author addresses creationist or ""intelligent design"" arguments and provides a clear, rational, and most importantly scientific answer. To be fair, the idea of natural selection and evolution seems simple enough, but how it leads to complex devices like an eyeball seems inexplicable... until it is explained. The creationist arguments are all fair, in the sense that they are perfectly valid questions to ask- until they are answered. But a perfectly valid question isn't the same as a valid objection. The book does a very good job at answering questions and debunking creationist objections in the process of explaining how evolution works, although this isn't the main focus of the book. At points along the way the author pauses to address a creationist objection- debunks it- and moves right along. And its done with such convincing ease that by the end the question is not ""How could evolution be true?"" but ""How could it be otherwise?""I don't think this book will change a creationist's mind, because if mere logical, rational, scientific explanations were all it took, creationism (an appeal to the supernatural rather than the natural) wouldn't exist in the first place. But I don't think that was the intent with this book. The book's title isn't ""Why creationism is wrong."" There is no point in arguing with a creationist whose faith feels threatened by science. If somebody isn't threatened by science then ""more science"" isn't going to change anything. But for the rest of us, laypeople who occasionally hear a creationist argument and think ""Oh, well that seems like a good point, I wonder how Darwanism answers that?"" the answers are here. And eventually, by the end of the book, with a good understanding of how darwanism works, any creationist question no longer seems like a good question- but more of an admission of ""I don't understand how this works.""There is nothing wrong with the statement ""I don't understand how this works"" as long as it is not followed with ""Therefore it can not be true."" Is it any better than saying ""I don't understand how this works, but I'll assume it's true""? No- unless that statement is followed by ""Because I understand the method by which this conclusion was reached."" If you understand the scientific method and think that observation, hypothesis, prediction, experimentation, and comparison are really good ways to arrive at a conclusion about something then you will readily accept conclusions reached by those methods without knowing the details. So by understanding and accepting this method as a valid way to understand the world, it is perfectly reasonable to accept knowledge as being ""true"" that was achieved using these methods.You can't, however, argue one way or the other for something without knowing anything about it. I believed evolution to be true because I trusted the method by which the theory was developed, but I wanted to be able to understand the theory itself, and this book did a great job of it.One final note. The author did a great job at addressing the ""Just a theory"" argument. It isn't ""just a theory"", but a ""scientific theory"" which is completely different than ""a random guess with no way of testing it"". There is no point arguing it in a book review. Suffice to say the book spells it out and does a great job. Enough so that I underlined the entire thing.If you want to understand Darwinism, don't be put off by the title. By the end of the book you will understand how it works. The books isn't a defense of the theory but an explanation that is so thorough that it defends itself.I subtracted one star because I wish there was a little more about the timeline of evolution and the different eras of the earth's history. Another chapter would have been nice. "

I was expecting evolution/creationist argument in the preface, maybe even in the first chapter. Unfortunately, It's littered throughout the book. I understand that some readers actually enjoy this mindless drubbing, if so, this book is for you. What I was hoping for was a deeper biological understanding of speciation and specialization, and to Coyne's credit there are anecdotes littered throughout. Sadly, Those anecdotes are merely a way for Coyne to stick out his tongue and say ""I told you so, dummy"", they offer little new insights to those with a baseline understanding of biology. If you like Dawkins,you'll like Coyne, and If you like both I offer some simple advice. Grow up, and read a book with some scientific teeth. I recommend Stephen Jay Gould. If you are like me and are interested in speciation and specialization, I recommend skipping this book, and watching Coyne's lecture.

I can't imagine how hard it is to summarize a topic as voluminous as evolution into 230 pages.Without a doubt, evolution is complicated. It is one of the most misunderstood facts, and definitely the most viciously attacked. Jerry Coyne does a phenomenal job of explaining some of the basic tenets of evolution to the reader in a very succinct way. It is a breath taking read; this book needs to be read more than once. If only those who are so adamant about ID would crack open this book! Evolution is a beautiful mess. But, the fact that of all the species and of all mutations over billions of years, we are the only ones who have been awarded reason and a complex brain- that, to me, is far more meaningful and beautiful than to think someone created us and ""blessed us"" with it. We managed to become who we are, through billions of years of genetic fight. We are special, and we are here. Wow.

The author has a remarkably humble tone as he describes both the assertive truth of evolution as well as the ongoing process of unfinished learning of science (e.g., the study of biogenesis, the beginning of the universe, evolutionary psychology, evolution's inability to stand alone as an ethical/moral system, etc.). I believe that this book was well worth the time to read.Evolution can by no means explain everything about the world around us, but contrary to the opinions of many creationists/ID advocates, it does not presume to. This is the essence of science: the search for knowledge rather than the presumption of it.Why Evolution is True is an excellent popular treatise of evolution because it makes clear these points, and is honest about the shortcomings (both real and imagined) of modern evolutionary theory.

39,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48009491-brianna-silva,4,"Let me tell you a little story.In high school, I was taught science from a ""Creationist"" perspective. I did who-knows-how-many research projects and papers on ""Creation versus Evolution"". I became pretty knowledgeable about the subject (or so I thought). I owned a tome titled ""Science vs Evolution"", a graduation present from my biology teacher, and could give all the talking points on why Darwinism was false.Fast forward a number of years. I can't pinpoint the moment when my perspective changed. I think it started with a nagging suspicion that, despite all the Creationist videos I had watched and the articles I had read, I had never truly, actually heard the argument for evolution from evolutionary scientists themselves, and only knew the distorted interpretations of their arguments from their ""critics"".I changed my mind, ultimately, not because of a wealth of scientific rebuttals to combat every objection of Intelligent Design advocates. It came down to a simple matter of logic.That logic is this: The theory of evolution came about from the scientific process. Predictions are made, evidence is gathered, and conclusions are drawn. At every turn, for more than a century, the assumptions about evolution have been rigorously questioned, challenged, and tested under scientific scrutiny.And throughout this process, the theory of evolution has not only survived, but become stronger and more deeply understood. And it is overwhelmingly accepted by scientists.Contrast this with the idea of Intelligent Design, or Creationism. This concept does not start with predictions that can be completely questioned or re-thought at any moment; it cannot flexibly follow the evidence, wherever it leads.Creationism begins with a conclusion, and seeks evidence to support that conclusion.In other words, the theory of evolution is scientific. Creationism is not.I had become convinced of evolution from a logical perspective, but I still did not understand it. I did not have the high school education most people get on the subject. I still had all those talking points from Answers in Genesis that I knew were false, but didn't have responses for.This book, Why Evolution is True, became the perfect answer to my needs. Coyne lays out the mechanisms of and evidence for evolution in very easy-to-understand, eye-opening terms that the average, non-scientific reader can absorb and enjoy.It's also relatively short (not a difficult read), while still astonishingly robust in the power of its evidence and strength of its arguments.I came to this book already convinced of evolution; I came way fully understanding it (for the first time), and EXCITED about its awesomeness. Seriously, evolution is... REALLY COOL???I'm greatly appreciative of the author for writing this, and helping me to fill a gap in my knowledge... while also helping me discovery the pure joy and wonder that comes with knowing our origins.Buuuuuuut... he does get one tiny star bumped off, and this is for purely opinionated reasons, but in his discussions of gender he sometimes lapsed into what I can only call ""male arrogance"". The way he talked about men and women just grated on my nerves. Not what he said was untrue or anything, just written in an annoying way that felt way too comfortable with male superiority. My objection is completely non-intellectual and subjective, but hey! This is my review! I can give whatever stars I wanted!In all seriousness, this book is amazing. It will doubtlessly be my default recommendation for fence-sitters, skeptics, and other people who lacked an honest education in the fact of evolution like I did."
40,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81496242-sakshi-sinha,5,"This book is a compelling read. Learning about evolution, the process and time that goes into this makes you just respect and admire our environment and animals even more. -Firstly, Coyne discusses about creationism and evolution. He often includes antidotes throughout the book. Its so unbelievable that there are people out there who don’t believe in evolution!!There are references from Darwin’s book “The Origin”, other authors and scientists who have worked in this field. Introducing different viewpoints to us. -Then it continues with Coyne explaining different theories and concepts of evolution. This isn’t much of a rocket science. It just requires basic comprehension of species and biology and I think it’s pretty easy to grip on. -Along with facts and views, Coyne mentions alot of studies conducted on fossils and how they helped in grouping and combining the story of evolution. It’s really an engaging study and this has actually amplified my interest in fossils.-In addition to this the author addresses evolution in different aspects of wildlife such as in aquatic animals, birds, mammals etc. Coyne also describes at length natural selection , vestigial organs, genetics etc.-Altogether the book is filled with engrossing examples and it’s so amusing. There are images for references which make it easier to interpret description the author provides. -lastly, I do have a suggestion, Coyne mentions various kinds of animals, insects, birds, and not all of them have a visual representation in the book. I suggest you use google to understand their anatomy and explore various journals or articles. It might take extra time but I think this just adds another layer of knowledge to the read. This book really is an eye opener. Overall brilliant book! I would recommend it:) "
41,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25797445-eugene,5,"Why Evolution is True is a very interesting and thought provoking read. Detailed yet written for the lay person, Jerry Coyne does a phenomenal job of clearly laying out the evidence for Darwinian evolution from a common ancestor and why it is unanimously accepted by all scientists not already predisposed to creationism. From the fossil record and DNA sequencing to continental drift and speciation, he not only lays out the multiple lines of evidence but also shows the countless predictions that have been made using the evolutionary model, and counters each example by explaining how creationism fails these predictions and doesn't yield what we would expect to find were it the case. I have a very limited scientific background, but had no trouble understanding most of the book. On top of arguing the scientific evidence, he also does well at addressing common social and moral objections to evolution. The last chapter describes how contrary to popular (usually creationist) belief, evolution properly understood does not lend itself to racism. Races evolved to adapt better to various environments as branches spreading out on the evolutionary tree, and there is nothing to suggest any sort of racial superiority. Likewise Coyne debunks the popular but misguided argument that believing evolution will make people lose all sense of morality. Quite contrary, the more we learn about how our social behaviours evolved and how our brains developed to comprehend all these questions, the more we can appreciate the value of our lives. My only contention is how he subtly seems to slip in his anti-theist presupposition toward the end by saying appeal to the supernatural is not necessary when discussing origins. It may not be necessary, but it would be more accurate to say science and the God debate fall under seperate, non overlapping categories as one deals purely in falsifiable claims while the other does not. That being said, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is curious to learn more about evolution and its implications written in a very matter of fact, unbiased way."

So why, when evolution is being reconfirmed every day, and forms the backbone of modern biology, do we need a book entitled Why Evolution Is True?""It's just as the description above has said, the evidence that supporting Evolution is enormous, starting from the first life on Earth until the evolution of Homo-sapiens. Every single life is just as Darwin had predicted, you won't find a fossil that exists in the Cambrian Age in the Precambrian Age and vice versa. In fact Evolution declared a bet as the evolutionist Richard Dawkins said: ""To those who has doubts about Evolution to scratch hardly in the Rocks to find an unsuitable fossil, we challenge them to that, will they accept the bet?"" In ""Why Evolution Is True"", Jerry A Coyne takes us to a journey in the Wonders of Natural Selection. He started with what a scientific theory means and then he goes on to explain the endless evidence of evolution and connecting it with everything around us, ""Some claim that evolution is just a theory, as if it were merely an opinion. But evolution, like the theory of gravity, is a scientific fact. Evolution really happened. Accepting our kinship with all life on Earth is not only solid science ... in my view it's also a soaring spiritual experience."" –Neil deGrasse TysonYour body is a proof of multiple enhancing processes that have been done over millions of years starting from your individual cells to genes to last nerve in your Brain, for example the way human born is one of the best examples that we are descending from birds, by time the human evolved the way of giving birth doesn't change, the body of the baby turned upside down and the head of the baby (which becomes significantly bigger than that of our ancestors) faced the entrance of the womb, here we have to say isn't it ridiculous for God to do something like that, I mean why would He even blueprint-ed (or design) us with something very painful and can threatened the life of the mother just to prove something nothing than His sadistic nature of enjoying the screams of the mothers. Then he talked about Mutation and how it was at first the stick that Creationists wave on the face of Evolutionists every time they started a debate, he also mentioned and shed some lights on Linski's magnificent experiment on E-coli Bacteria which took 20 years and opened the gate in front of us to witness that ""Natural Selection + Mutations + Time = Darwin was Right""After that he talked about neuroscience and that evolution also has the ability to describe Morals and that Morals are not something comes up with Religion, it's something far more than that, it's something we might inherited it but mostly we gain it by practicing (eg: The Chimpanzees experiment). Jerry also explained that evolution doesn't necessarily mean to evolve into something more sophisticated, there's also a ""Redox Evolution"" which for example the evolution of Whales from Reptiles. I know I haven't wrote much and I won't, coz if you want to know something you have to dig for it, but what I'm totally convinced about is that the evidence evolution provides are stronger, reliable and more scientific than the Ideal Design provides, and that the idea of us coming from Adam and Eve is nothing but a Myth. It's not my words it's what science told us with EVIDENCE. It's as Carl Sagan said: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” – Cosmos."

But I can at least try to dispel the misconceptions that frighten people away from evolution and from the amazing derivation of life’s staggering diversity from a single naked replicating molecule.""Such is the writing style of Jerry Coyne, an accessible and well-versed author and research professor of evolutionary biology. This landmark work should have staying power in the annals of popular science, though it is lacking in philosophical nuance and subtlety. It is not intended to be a textbook for academics but rather a treatise to persuade anyone without a background in the subject. He is strong in his convictions and forceful in his rhetoric; a blog of the same name may be consulted for further reading and development of his thinking in this area.Why Evolution Is True is a serious page-turner. Coyne has a gift for conveying complex ideas and anyone of high-school education should not have trouble following his arguments.Far easier to understand than other overviews like Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, the primary focus is the direct evidence and ever-mounting proof which we have amassed since Darwin's formulation of the theory nearly two centuries ago. If one went into this topic without any knowledge the book would serve as a comprehensive introduction to the topic and its fundamental concepts, though they will miss out on discussion of related issues, e.g. memes and extended phenotype.Coyne makes the commendable decision to anticipate objections to each of his chapters, much like Darwin did in later editions of On the Origin of Species; he knows that evolution is a contested and widely-misunderstood field and that minds tend to be closed to its authenticity. There are some questions that are oft-raised without sufficient answer in the public square: how did the eye form if not by a miracle? Of what use is half a wing to an evolving bird, and how could that possibly be selected for? He tackles these deftly and head-on, giving answers and insight that reflect his depth of knowledge.Near the end of chapter 9 we are given this summary:""Evolution is simply a theory about the process and patterns of life’s diversification, not a grand philosophical scheme about the meaning of life... Most of us do need meaning, purpose, and moral guidance in our lives. How do we find them if we accept that evolution is the real story of our origin? That question is outside the domain of science.""He then proceeds to dismiss all answers outside of naturalism and materialism outright, which shows the limitations of his view in dialogue with contrasting opinions. Coyne does not attempt to appear as an unbiased explicator of evolutionary theory. This is a minor problem in the scope of the work, and perhaps a deserved one; he could hardly be more vindicated due to the sheer force of evidence for macroevolution. It makes me wonder if a more dispassionate approach could have been helpful. There are, despite his bewilderment, religious people who believe in evolution.He leaves us with a pithy and hopeful quote:""Evolution tells us where we came from, not where we can go.""I would definitely recommend this work to anyone who is curious about the developments in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural and sexual selection. As long as they are open to the evidence and don't mind the occasional sneer from the author, by the end there should be little doubt that evolution is, in fact, true."
44,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6350127-seawood,5,"Read for Coursera ""Writing in the Sciences"" and ""Genetics & Evolution"" courses.Why Evolution Is True is a love-letter to Charles Darwin; an accessible and detailed overview of the current state of evolution research. Each strand of knowledge which contributes to our understanding is laid out clearly, starting in many cases with what Darwin knew or intuited when writing On The Origin Of Species. Coyne deftly takes us through the developments in areas such as the fossil record, embryology, vestigial organs, biogeography and genetics; showing how predictions can be made and how discoveries since Darwin's time have confirmed the process of evolution over and over again. Many eye-catching examples are used to demonstrate where we can expect to find fossils in geological layers; how the bodily organisation of modern creatures follows patterns laid down in ancestral forms; and how environmental pressures lead to adaptation. The example of the modern mammalian laryngeal nerve as poor design derived from ancient forms is particularly striking. The nerve is involved in speech and swallowing and connects the brain to the larynx. It wraps around the aorta (a large vessel in the heart) rather than taking a direct route. This is not an issue for an ancient fishlike creature – but in a human the nerve has to be about a foot in length to follow the same route. In a giraffe, which has the same basic body plan, the nerve is three feet long! This is obviously inefficient and may even be more prone to injury, but clearly shows the laryngeal nerve adapting to follow the evolutionary changes in the body pattern.Coyne also shows how these additions to our knowledge efficiently take down the creationist or “intelligent design” arguments. Whilst he concedes that those arguing from faith will probably not change their minds, the book is very much aimed at people who are uncertain about the science. For European readers, this frequent referencing of creationism is a little grating since it is not such a large issue in this part of the world, but it is understandable when the American audience has a much greater background of “disbelief” in evolution [1].The final chapters are devoted to recent human evolution (from the period following divergence from chimps) and an overview of some of the difficulties people have with the possible implications of evolution for human behaviour. Overall, this is an excellent text for anyone who would like to understand the principles of evolution or update their knowledge, written in an entertaining and engaging style.[1] http://www.sciencemag.org/content/313... – unfortunately this, the original article in Science, is paywalled, but you can see a mirror at http://old.richarddawkins.net/article..., including the table comparing “belief” vs “disbelief” in evolution from 34 countries in 2005.

If you are an evolutionist, you'll probably be quite pleased with the book. And there's pity. For many, the book won't be read on its merits but for whether it supports or challenges one's views on the issue of Darwinian evolutionary theory.In terms of the book itself. . . . The purpose is specified by Jerry Coyne, the author, on page xiv: ""This book lays out the main lines of evidence for evolution. For those who oppose Darwinism purely as a matter of faith, no amount of evidence will do--theirs is a belief not based on reason. But for the many who find themselves uncertain, or who accept evolution but are not sure how to argue the case, this volume gives a succinct summary of why modern science recognizes evolution as true.""The book unfolds in a straightforward fashion. Chapter 1 summarizes the nature of evolution. He discusses the essence of the concept of evolution--""a species undergoing genetic change over time"" (page 3). Also discussed is ""natural selection,"" the process by which the more ""fit"" individuals tend to be more successful in reproductive terms That is, they leave more offspring than their less fit peers).Subsequent chapters outline the evidence for evolution, including often jury-rigged adaptations (evolution makes do with the organism/species as it exists and often leaves organisms that are poorly designed--but still capable of successful reproduction: think the lower back of humans!), the fossil record, a more detailed discussion of the process of natural selection, the relationship between sex and evolution, how species arise and develop, and--always an issue that excites passion--the relevance of evolution for humankind.The book itself does well what it sets out to do. There are things that bother me. As with many, the author claims that evolution is a ""fact."" I have never understood this allegation. Neo-Darwinian theory is a THEORY--not a fact. Lots of facts support the theory. By itself, though, it is NOT a fact. I think advocates of evolution shoot themselves in the foot with such an argument. Many, of course, would rejoin, ""It's ONLY a theory."" Such folks also don't know what they're talking about. A good theory is a great thing! Not ""just."" Quantum theory is terrific; Einstein's relativity is a fine theory. And so on.All in all, if the reader wants an accessible advocacy of evolutionary theory, this book does the job nicely. If the reader does not accept it, the book, of course, will not be very compelling."
46,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36384001-yousuf,2,"Good Overview, But Contains Straw MenThis is a good summary for the pro-Evolution side if anyone is researching the evolution-creation controversy. It goes through the fossil evidence, genetic evidence, geological evidence, and more for Evolution via natural selection (and other naturalistic processes). The author writes in a clear and logical manner, and generally avoids the confrontational polemics that other writers such as Richard Dawkins are prone to.My main objection is that Coyne uses misrepresentations to attack Intelligent Design (ID). He tries to associate ID with Young Earth Creationism many times, arguing that the two are similar or have similar methods. Nothing could be further from the truth. Pro-ID people are NOT making a deduction from religious scriptures; rather they are analyzing the structure of the cell (such as the information encoded in DNA) and making inferences based on that. You might not agree with their conclusions, but you should not try to smear them in a dishonest way.Another issue that I had was that most of Coyne's objections to ID are ""theological"" in nature. What I mean is that he points to ""flaws"" in organisms and basically states: ""An intelligent designer would have done a better job of this.""But these are theological, not scientific, objections; and they have theological, not scientific, answers. Probably because the Designer made the designs bad on purpose - I dunno, perhaps this world wasn't supposed to be perfect in the first place?He admits that materialist scientists do not have an explanation for the origin of life (OOL) as well as the Cambrian Explosion. But then he brings out the stereotypical ""God-of-the-gaps! God-of-the-gaps!"" argument to rebut ID here... I was literally shaking my head out of disappointment (though I wasn't at all surprised). Also, the response to integrated complexity was vague and didn't make much sense to me.I'm currently reading Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design, which is a pro-ID account of OOL. And I can tell you, it is anything but God-of-the-gaps. The entire argument is based on what we do know in biology, not a gap of any kind.I know the above review sounds harsh, but I actually enjoyed reading this book and I do recommend it to anyone who's interested in evolution or the evolution-creation controversy."

However, if you are undecided and truly interested in learning about the wealth of evidence that supports evolution as, indeed, the way (along with sea cucumbers, lichen, platypuses and blue whales) came to be, this is a wonderful book. Even if you already have a fair working knowledge of the theory (and that's theory in the scientific sense, not in the casual ""it's only a theory"" sense), you'll likely find a lot of new and fascinating details herein.All the classic evidence that you learned in school (if you're my age) is here, along with scads of new evidence in fields like microbiology, geology, paleobotany, and many others. The book avoids jargon except when it's needed in order to be specific, defines unfamiliar terms as it goes, explains how the facts in highly diverse areas support one another, points out the numerous areas where evolution would predict X and in fact science finds X, and generally lays out its case in a comprehensive and coherent manner. Happily, it also does so without either proselytizing or haranguing, leaving the reader to make his or her own decision in evaluating the range of interlocking facts presented. The last chapter discusses why certain religious sects have such difficulty accepting evolution, which was also enlightening and interesting.Highly recommended for the lay reader interested in acquiring a solid overview of the scientific evidence for evolution."

Coyne's Why Evolution Is True is a fine place to start. As his unsubtle title suggests, Coyne's purpose is to banish the arguments of creationists and their intelligent design fellow travelers. Much as Darwin did, he draws upon geology and the fossil record; biogeography, or the distribution of plants and animals; and the similarities and differences among living species. But gaps that once frustrated Darwin, such as so-called ""missing links"" in the fossil record, can now be filled. ... ... he builds a strong case for the fact of evolution, and for Darwin's theory of how it works. (That species change over time isn't theoretical; how and why the changes occur is the subject of ""evolutionary theory."") Coyne addresses many of the common creationist arguments head-on, outlining how complex systems such as eyes and biochemical pathways can evolve by natural selection. To his credit, however, the author acknowledges his strategy's fatal flaw: The refusal to accept evolution has precious little to do with reason, logic or evidence. Like the introductory college courses it too-closely resembles, Why Evolution Is True is packed with facts and clear explanations but is unlikely to change many minds."""

It's sad to think that even on this modern day, we still need books to show what is just actually is. It's always my dream to become an evolutionary anthropologist and by reading this book only ignites that passion more! This is a great book on evolution though some might find it to be dry. But the author has thoroughly described how evolution works and presented - as is the case in scientific literatures - a lot of convincing and irrefutable evidence. One thing I liked is the organization of the chapters where Coyne subtly explained the concepts and applied them first on evolution of ""lesser"" organisms, then on to human evolution. For readers who are honest-seekers, do not discount evolution until you have read this book. And for those who are already convinced, this could be a good weapon against Creationists (Intelligent Design proponents)."

The Blind Watchmaker and The Ancestor's Tale are the best books of this genre I have ever read. He is a bit more detailed than Coyne, a bit more lucid, and if I may say so, a bit more exciting, even a bit more poetic.Nevertheless, at under 300 pages, Why Evolution Is True is the best short book I've ever read on the subject. The last chapter, about the implications (and lack of implications) of the theory of evolution for our own species, is very good. And Dawkins himself gives the book high praise.Well worth reading."

Within decades we must close our eyes again. Isn’t it a noble, an enlighten way of spending our brief time in the sun, to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it? This is how I answer when I’m asked - as I am surprisingly often - why I bother to get up in the mornings.” This book helps in its short and concise manner lay the argument for evolution, helping us understand our place in the intricacies of this marvellous world."

56,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42147710-michael-shore,5,Coyne nailed it. A fantastic summary of the basic concepts and evidence for evolution.
57,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"To be more precise and clear, the title of the book should be ""why the modern theory of evolution is true."" Changing the title doesn't make a difference to us the believers of the theory (I'll call the theory Darwinism for short), because we usually accept it as a bundle package. But after reading the book, I realize the theory makes multi-level propositions. ""Evolution happened"" is only one of them. Coyne mentions this structure of Darwinism repeatedly, but I think he could make the book stronger by laying it out at the very beginning. In my own words, the theory of evolution proposes the following hierarchy of propositions:1. Evolutionary change (change in inheritable traits of a population through generations) happened. Not only on the micro level (change of traits within a species) but also the macro level (the transformation of one species into another)2. Natural selection explains most of the microevolutionary change, e.g., the change in beak size of birds.3. Natural selection explains most of the macroevolutionary change, e.g., the origin of birds.4. Natural selection builds complex features in nonhuman species, such as the eyes and the brain.5. Natural selection builds complex features of humans, such as language and consciousness.  Some creationists refuse all propositions above. Some admit (1) but refuse to explain it by natural selection. Others accept natural selection only to a certain level. All of them share one common belief: natural selection cannot make us human to be what we are. As a response, Coyne provides ample evidence to support Darwinism. The evidence includes the following: • Species can be classified and grouped in a tree-like way• Discovery of transitional fossils at predicted locations with the expected age.• Features that only make sense by natural selection: vestiges / atavism / dead DNA / Embryo palimpsest / bad design• Distributions of species across the globe, such as how different species fill similar roles in different areas, how certain species lack on volcanic islands but not on continental islands, and the radiations of endemic species on volcanic islands.• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by artificial selection• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by natural selection in labs and fields• Math simulations that exhibit evolutionary paths to complex features under natural selection. An important lesson I learned from Coyne's enumeration of the evidence above, is to treat the following two things differently: 1) the general evolutionary theory, and 2) individual evolutionary explanations of traits and behaviors. Darwin provides us a beautiful theory. It is so simple, yet so powerful. But beauty does not equal truth. Darwinism is generally correct because scientists have accumulated a huge amount of supporting evidence. An individual evolutionary explanation, however, must bear its own burden of proof. We should not blindly believe in a single evolutionary explanation because there are often multiple competing evolutionary explanations of a trait or behavior. Many of them are inevitable ""just-so stories."" Moreover, natural selection is not the only chisel used by nature the sculptor. Features can be generated by other mechanisms, such as genetic drift and sexual selection. I found the hypothesis explaining the existence of human appendix especially interesting: it is possible that natural selection simply can't shrink the appendix anymore, because before it disappears from shrinking, a smaller appendix gives rise to a higher risk of being blocked.  This lesson also applies to economics, another discipline that is guided by a core theory — the rational choice theory. Again, the core theory might be generally correct, but this does not mean it is correct in every context, far from it.  Coyne also reminds me that most evolutionary explanations of complex human features, no matter how elaborate, are untested and probably untestable. This is unfortunate, because the evolution of such features, especially the evolution of consciousness, seems to be the most intriguing question of all. But to quote Darwin, we should not ""positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science."" Instead, we should keep searching for testable theories in the future.  Stray observation:- The book solved a big puzzle I had in high school biology class: why human embryos look so weird and go through phases of development that make no sense.- Darwin did not explain the origin of species in his same-titled book (he would explain it in later books and papers). A better title for The Origin of Species, would have been The Origin of Adaptations."
58,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23258105-dileep-n,5,"tl;dr Evolution is true. The big picture is indisputably clear. What remains is to probe the finer details of the mechanics and processes underlying it. If Coyne's primary goal in writing this book was to convince Creationists that evolution is true, it remains unfulfilled. The people he's trying to convince are precisely the kind whom no amount of evidence supporting evolution can convince. This book lacks the only thing that can convince Creationists and proponents of Intelligent Design - passages from their holy book of choice, or even better, a direct quote from their god of choice, stating evolution is true. Kidding aside, the sad truth is that it is nigh impossible to fight dogma and deeply entrenched beliefs with logic and evidence. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try. This book is the result of one such attempt and it is a brilliant one at that. Kudos to Coyne for fighting the good fight. Unless you're the kind of person who relies exclusively on made-up stories from stale, antiquated texts for moral guidance and laws of the natural world, you probably already know evolution is true, or rather, that it is the best explanation we have so far for the origin of life on this planet; and I'm fairly sure you will find this book insightful and enjoyable. The book is full of interesting facts and observations that unequivocally prove that evolution is a scientific fact. Topics that are covered include discovery of fossils, particularly of intermediates; speciation and biogeography; vestigial traits and organs that along with emryology provide a window into the past; genetic drift as an alternative (although minor) engine of evolution besides Darwinian natural selection; the powers of sexual selection; and lastly, the origin of of our own species along with a brief but useful discussion on the dicey issue of race. Along with a historical overview, Coyne also details recent evidence (last three decades) supporting evolution and advances made in paleontology, molecular and evolutionary biology, and a few other fields, which I found very helpful. At one time or another, I'm sure most of us have wondered, ""Now that the pressures of natural selection are largely absent in most human societies, are we still evolving? If so, in what ways?"" I found the beginnings of an answer to this in the penultimate chapter.The crisp, clear, and no-nonsense writing style makes digesting this information-rich book painless. Coyne has also provided handy notes clarifying certain ideas, pointing out opposing viewpoints, and lisiting resources for those interested in exploring a topic further. Several of the books he has mentioned have found their way into my to to-read list.This is a cogent synthesis of facts about evolution and of coherent arguments in its favor. Not only does it satiate your curiosity and expand your mind but it also arms you with knowledge for those uncomfortable engagements with staunch Creationsists. Highly recommended!"
59,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"The title of this book bluntly states its purpose, which is to refute, head on, the claims advanced by creationists and supporters of intelligent design that evolution by natural selection cannot possibly explain how life takes the many forms that it does. Biologist Jerry Coyne convincingly addresses every conceivable argument that could be made against evolution, using numerous examples to explain how life as it exists today must have arisen through evolution. To this end, he covers evidence from:- Fossils and biogeography.- Vestigial organs (eg, our appendix). - Vestigial genes. We have around 2,000 that no longer work because evolution rendered them unnecessary. An example is our gene for the final step in the biosynthesis of vitamin C which became non-functional after we started to consume this essential substance in our diet.- Atavisms (eg, our coccyx). - Embryonic development, where the early embryos of most vertebrates bear a striking resemblance to one another. The human embryo, for example, starts looking like that of a jawless fish, before becoming reptilian, and then mammalian. - Bad design, such as the asymmetric structure of flat, side-swimming fish, such as Dover sole, or the convoluted route taken in mammals by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (which covers about 15 feet in the giraffe, to join two points just one foot apart).As Coyne points out, no supreme being would have created these oddities and imperfections unless it was that being’s intention to deceive us into believing they were the outcome of evolution, which seems extremely implausible. This is not a textbook on evolution, so its purpose is not to teach the underlying principles. The reader needs to look elsewhere for detailed explanations of genetics, genomes, DNA, inheritance, population growth, genetic drift, etc, but this is the ideal book for anyone who is open-mindedly sitting on the fence, unsure as to whether or not life arose through evolution, creation or intelligent design. Coyne’s arguments are very compelling although, as he admits, “evolution raises such profound questions of purpose, morality, and meaning that [some people] just can’t accept it no matter how much evidence they see”. He illustrates this point by referring to a talk on evolution he gave in Chicago to a group of businessmen. Afterwards, he was approached by one of the delegates who said, “I found your evidence for evolution very convincing—but I still don’t believe it”."
60,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52557863-grrlscientist,5,"Considering the plethora of books about evolution out there, is it really necessary to publish yet another one? What can another book about evolution have to offer that previous books have not provided? This new book not only presents the latest information about evolution to come to light, but it also responds to the most recent attacks made upon this field of scientific knowledge. The book, 
Why Evolution is True
 (NYC: Viking; 2009) by Jerry Coyne, is the most up-to-date and one of the most clearly written books about evolution that is currently available — and that’s saying a lot since most books about evolution are excellent.This beautifully written and fascinating book delves into the answers to several questions; How has (and is) evolution tested scientifically? What predictions do scientists make based on the Theory of Evolution? Have these predictions been supported by the experimental evidence? This book is Coyne’s detailed presentation of the most impressive and modern discoveries of fossil, animal and plant data that have been published in a variety of scientific fields that impinge upon and contribute to The Theory of Evolution.Take the field of biogeography, for example. Biogeographers have long known that there are two types of islands: oceanic islands, which arose from the seafloor and have never been connected to a large land mass and continental islands, which have become isolated from a large land mass sometime during their history due to rising sea levels or fracturing continental plates. Biogeographers have documented time and again that these two island types can be easily distinguished because all oceanic islands lack native mammals, amphibians and freshwater fish — animals that are present on continental islands. This is not due to any defects associated with continental life since humans have introduced continental species such as rats, goats, pigs and other domestic animals onto oceanic islands throughout history, demonstrating that continental species are quite adept at island life. Additionally, species found on oceanic islands are often very similar to each other — radiations from a few ancestral species — while those on continental islands are not.“Why would a creator happen to leave amphibians, mammals, fish, and reptiles off oceanic islands, but not continental ones?” wonders Coyne. “Why did a creator produce radiations of similar species on oceanic islands, but not continental ones? And why were the species on oceanic islands created to resemble those from the nearest mainland?”The fossil record is consistent with evolutionary biology, too. When paleontologists look for particular transitional forms, they are found in the fossil record precisely where they should occur if evolution occurred. For example, the earliest birds appear after dinosaurs but before modern birds, as we see illustrated on the front dust jacket cover of the book.Primate fossils follow this same pattern. Coyne discusses a series of fossils that are intermediate between chimp and humans, where the older fossils are more ape-like while progressively younger fossils are those that possess more characters associated with humans. Creationists react to this by claiming that all of the great ape fossils are either humans or apes with no discernible intermediates, and that they are separated by “a large and unbridgeable gap.” But interestingly, when tested, creationists can’t agree among themselves as to exactly which fossils are “human” and which are “ape”. “Nothing shows the intermediacy of these fossils better than the inability of creationists to classify them consistently,” concludes Coyne.Developmental biologists have identified atavisms that betray close evolutionary relationships, too. Atavisms are dormant ancestral features that are sporadically expressed during embryonic development and sometimes after birth, too. This is likely due to the activation of genes from an organism’s evolutionary ancestors that remain normally unexpressed. For example, humans possess the genes for making tails, but these genes are usually deactivated. But not always: page 63 has a photograph of a human infant with a 3–4 inch atavistic tail!Speaking of genes, geneticists have also made some interesting discoveries, such as dead genes. Dead genes are those genes whose inactive sequences are found in the chromosomes of particular groups of organisms. “Virtually all species harbor dead genes,” Coyne notes, “many of them still active in its relatives.”Dead genes are even found in the human genome. One example is the human inability to manufacture our own vitamin C — despite the fact that the necessary genes exist in our genome. A close look at the sequences reveals that just one gene has a mutation in it, and this is exactly the same mutation shared between all other primates, while guinea pigs, which also cannot make vitamin C, have a completely different mutation.“Why would a creator put a pathway for making vitamin C in all these species, and then inactivate it?” Coyne asks. “Why would the same inactivating mutation be present in all primates, and a different one in guinea pigs?”Even though Coyne’s initial motivation to write this book stemmed from his annoyance with those who claim that intelligent design is science, he doesn’t attack religion. Instead, as demonstrated in some of the passages I’ve quoted here, he does what scientists do best: he makes predictions. In this case, he makes predictions that naturally arise from evolutionary theory as well as from creationism and “intelligent design” and details how actual scientific data conflict with religious beliefs.Coyne also includes an interesting section in the last chapter of the book where he explores the fear that evolution inspires in many religious people. He points out that religious opposition to evolution is not due to a lack of scientific evidence, for there is plenty of that, but it stems mainly from fears that the moral fabric of society will fall apart if people accept the fact that humans descended from ape-like ancestors. But that said, Coyne goes on to recognize that ethics are not the result of religious belief at all. Further, he is not deterred from using scientific findings to examine humans in the light of our evolutionary ancestry and postulating that this realization could mean a great deal for our future evolution.Most of us do need meaning, purpose, and moral guidance in our lives. How do we find them if we accept that evolution is the real story of our origin? That question is outside of the domain of science. But evolution can sill shed some light on whether our morality is constrained by our genetics. If our bodies are the product of evolution, what about our behavior? Do we carry the psychological baggage of our millions of years on the African savanna? If so, how far can we overcome it? [p. 225]I highly recommend this book to everyone who is seeking a clearly written and level-headed review of the most recent and relevant scientific findings and for how they support modern evolutionary theory.NOTE: Originally published at scienceblogs.com on 21 May 2009."
61,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13269556-brian-powell,5,"Jerry Coyne is perhaps best known as a bit of a firebrand, publicly antireligious and antagonistic to creation mythologies. (I once attended a lecture of his where he suggested that the world would be a better place if there was zero religion in it). He is also a successful biologist, and it is easy to conflate these two passions, allowing the atheistic rhetoric to muddy the scientific message. In ""Why Evolution is True"", both passions are alive but thankfully the jabs against creationism are few and incidental -- this is a book about science. It's not that the jabs aren't warranted (they are), they just seem so conspicuously out of place in what is otherwise a clear and concerted presentation of the facts of evolution. Lucid illustrations of Darwinian evolution are interrupted to point out that creationism or intelligent design simply cannot explain this or that fact or phenomenon. It's like going from 6th gear down to 1st, and the presentation stands strongly on its own merits without giving airtime to these scientifically unfounded speculations. The book would be better without them. That said, Coyne's work fills an important niche in the galaxy of pop-sci evolution books; while many focus on how evolution works and marvel in the amazing natural variety so obtained, ""Why Evolution is True"" is a book about the evidence for evolution -- the critical observations and facts that support the theory of evolution through natural selection. Coyne presents four pillars of evidence: the fossil record, embryology and vestiges, biogeography, and speciation. Each adds a different piece to the puzzle, and some are mutually supportive. For example, we learn that fossilization is a rare, essentially contingent event that preserves only a vanishingly small subset of all species ever to have existed. Despite this most imperfect collection of snapshots, biologists have had remarkable success tracing near complete lines of evolution of certain species. Take the whale: beginning with a raccoon-sized, land-dwelling mammal called the indohus, scientists have pieced together a striking chronological and structural succession of fossilized species connecting this early progenitor with the modern whale, meandering through a parade of odd-looking, freakish transitional forms. The fossils record a discrete representation of a more or less continuous process, as the pelvis of the indohus slowly shrinks as the hind legs disappear, though not completely: the pelvis, though diminished to barely a nub, remains in the modern-day whale as a useless leftover from its days as a land-dwelling animal. Monstrously telling, one in five hundred whales is born with a rear leg attached to this pelvis: a true atavism that gives scientists a chance to peer behind the curtain.Vestigial pelvises and other outmoded remnants pepper many other species -- understanding their relevance in the context of the progenitor species provides an additional powerful source of evidence for evolution. Defunct wings on ostriches, though since commandeered for the relatively modern need of balance and steering, are another good example. Moles and other subterranean animals living in darkness apparently have no eyes, at least until you push back the fur in a certain place on their heads: hidden beneath this covering, one discovers sightless eyes that are stowaways from an earlier time when the mole's ancestors took in the sun as surface dwellers. Not all vestiges are permanent: as embryos develop, they exhibit a succession of ephemeral vestiges, a nod to their hidden ancestry. The study of embryology is rich in evolutionary gems, and Coyne reveals a truly marvelous fact -- that embryos develop through several stages in which they express different characteristics of their progenitor species, a sequence of developmental stages equivalent to the sequence of speciation shaped by evolution! ""A lizard begins development resembling an embryonic fish, then somewhat later an embryonic amphibian, and finally an embryonic reptile. Mammals go through the same sequence, but add on the final stage of an embryonic mammal."" (p. 77) But not all of these features are truly ephemeral: the left recurrent laryngeal nerve in humans is two feet longer than it needs to be, taking a circuitous lap from the neck down around the aorta before attaching back up at the larynx. The reason? The human larynx forms essentially from what later becomes a gill in fish. The gill runs more or less parallel to its nerve and blood supply, but as it begins to form the larynx in humans, the blood and nerve supplies get tangled and the nerve must stretch to reach the larynx.Biogeography -- the geographic distribution of species -- is given its own chapter and contributes a few remarkably decisive pieces of evidence to Coyne's cache. In particular, the conspicuous difference in flora and fauna between two types of islands: oceanic, those that are born from undersea volcanoes, and continental, those that separated from larger land masses. Oceanic islands lack amphibians and fresh-water fish. They have a paucity of mammals and large trees. These islands that arise in the middle of the ocean are remote and isolated from only the most tenacious and prolific forms of life: insects that hitch rides on migratory birds, or plant seeds buoyant and robust enough to survive a trans-oceanic voyage. The lack of trees, whose seeds are too heavy to complete this journey, leave for small plants to establish their hegemony: absent competition for resources and sunlight, sunflowers grow into towering behemoths not seen elsewhere on the globe. Meanwhile, continental islands boast unique species, but ones imminently traceable to forebears on the mother continent. Sexual selection is given good amount of air time, but I'll spare you the details here (that are easily as provocative and decisive as the others). Coyne finishes with an overview of speciation, and importantly, with our tale -- the story of the descent of man. This narrative is broken in many places, there are gaps and mysteries, false starts and lineages that meander into nothingness. But within this incomplete constellation of fossil, genetic, and geographic evidence, a path emerges, admittedly approximate, but glorious nonetheless. A certain ancestor named Australopithecus afarensis begins to walk 4 million years ago. We know this partly from fossil evidence: the hips and femurs are structured to support upright mobility; but we also know this because of two sets of footprints preserved in the ash of a volcanic eruption. One set of prints larger -- the male, one smaller -- the female. The right foot of the female leaves a deeper depression than the left -- perhaps she is holding something -- maybe a child? This image of a primeval hominid family, still wild and without language, abstract intelligence, or culture, is nonetheless deeply human. It provides such great perspective on where we came from and how we got here. This is why we study evolution."
62,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,3,"This book should be retitled ""Why Natural Selection is True"". Coyne gives compelling and fascinating proofs for why and how various types of selection work on species to produce new expressed traits. I almost didn't make it to the interesting stuff though, because the first few chapters basically bashed the reader into submission to authority - ""everyone who's anything believes in evolution; it's a fact!"" Once I got past that, he actually talked about science and how selection works. But no one's really claiming that NS doesn't happen. He does little to show how the unexpressed traits arise in DNA in the first place. There's a little bit about mutation and genetic drift, but he hardly explains how mutation can produce complex DNA without destroying it first. And for someone who debates creationists, he certainly doesn't understand their arguments - many of his arguments against special creation claim that the patterns of variety on different types of islands proves that nature, and not supernature, put those species there. But creationists don't claim that God populated the whole earth with animals all at one time! (garden of Eden, Noah's Flood.) His conclusions about islands, i.e., that 10s or 100s of species/varieties came from one original species in the past which migrated to that island, also supports the creationist model.His section on evolutionary psychology is honest and helpful, and I wish more people would read that before presenting wild speculations about how human behaviour must have evolved. Most explanations are little more than 'fitting' a hypothesis to the facts.His final word about ethics is pretty lame TBH. It's little more than a statement that evolutionary biology shouldn't necessarily make us bad. Perhaps he felt compelled to throw that in there, but it's incomplete, and I'd be embarrassed to leave myself so open to criticism."
63,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56722053-bander,4,"The scientific fact “Evolution” wasn’t a subject to be studied when I was in school. It wasn’t in the curricula, as this topic was always disregarded. You could say it was forbidden to be taught in our schools. For this reason, I searched and found this highly rated book suitable to be a start. I wasn’t disappointed.It seems to me that Evolution isn’t just a theory. It’s really a scientific fact derived from physical evidence, among many other ways. I’m not going to argue its authenticity because that’s for you to do. But I’m here to give my personal thoughts about the book itself, as every review should. Coyne’s account on this subject was not technical or excessive in terms that aren’t defined. It’s easy written and with the examples Coyne mentioned, you could grasp the ideas behind every concept. This makes it a good start to anyone interested in Evolution. He stated his arguments against the so called creationists in a manner that’s compelling and convincing. It’s too early to judge since this is my first book on Evolution, but if I were to teach Evolution to younger generations, I’d recommend this book."
64,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50200963-ian,5,"I found this book very informative and well-written. To be honest, I was wary of reading this particular book on evolution given Coyne’s other overtly anti-religion titles. Yet, I actually found his addressing specific questions that “Young Earth Creationists” ask or alternative answers that YECs give very helpful and his tone was not antagonistic (as one find’s in Dawkins et al.). So, despite my initial reluctance, I would now whole-heartedly recommend this book to Christians who are honestly seeking to understand the overwhelming evidence for evolutionary theory. This would be a good read alongside Ernst Mayr’s What Evolution Is.From the biblical studies side of the questions that readers of Genesis raise, I highly recommend John Walton’s Lost World of Genesis One and the other title s in his lost World Series."

Now, it's pretty damn obvious that their explanations on the origin of life are not based on science, but they often attack the so called ""holes"" in the theory of evolution in a (moderately) compelling fashion. I feel like I have a much better grasp of the whole picture of evolution that was forgotten from middle school. The book was also very well written. I actually picked it up because Coyne was featured on a Sam Harris podcast, one which I also recommend.It is amazing how right Darwin turned out to be."

And anyone who's on the fence and needs a friendly nudge in the direction of science over fantasy need not be afraid of accepting evolution as truth.

I learned more about the view (which I do not hold), which will allow me to correct some of the misconceptions I've had about it.As a criticism of creationism, it's absolutely wretched. Almost every ""critique"" is attacking an imaginary preconception about the way that creation would work that Christians do not hold. In some cases, the author says that creationists have not addressed an argument when that is patently false. And he basically ignores old-earth creationism as a field at all, when it is in fact the majority view of most public-facing Christian apologists (most of the big names you have heard of, save for Ken Ham, are probably old-earth creationists. I found this aspect particularly problematic). "
77,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3532236-charlie,5,"Jerry Coyne wrote a book with a straightforward title, but that doesn't mean his task was simple. Evolution is not a single science, but rather a theory that involves many sciences. Thus, to make a well-rounded, accessible, current case for evolution, Coyne had to assemble, synthesize, and distill a massive amount of data spanning many scientific domains. On the whole, he was quite successful. Three features of this book stand out as particularly praiseworthy. First is the sheer number and recent date of examples. Much of the debate over evolution on both sides can get detached from continuing scientific progress, stuck at some point in the past. However, the 1990s and the 21st century have already been rich with advances, including perhaps the most compelling evidence for evolution. I think that Coyne could have been even better here by reducing references to Darwin. It is remarkable the extant to which he envisioned the development of evolutionary theory and it is natural to pay respects, but constantly invoking him can obscure where science currently stands. The second is Coyne's focus on evolution's success in prediction. For decades scientists have been assuming that the broad outlines of evolutionary theory are true and predicting future discoveries based on gaps. A striking case is the find of Tiktaalik roseae. University of Chicago researcher Neil Shubin wanted to find a species that would clearly mark the transition from fish to vertebrate. Such a species should occupy a location in the strata dated at 360 to 390 million years. Based on the overall picture of evolutionary descent, it would also occur in freshwater. Shubin selected the most likely spot and after five years of careful excavation, found the remarkable Tiktaalik roseae. It is not only the find itself, but also the way in which the find was discovered that lends confirmation to evolutionary theory as a whole. Biogeography, the study of the locations of animals, is a field constantly experiencing predictive success. When predictions drawn from data in several fields are commonly and precisely confirmed, that's scientific proof. The third is Coyne's handling of creationism. In general, he doesn't. There are a few snarky comments, of which I disapprove, but he is definitely more restrained than most of the voices on either side of the debate. He addresses specific creationist concerns only when they arise naturally in the course of explanation, usually when elements of evolutionary theory itself have been routinely misunderstood. I think refusing to go in for a point-by-point refutation of creationism is a wise choice. Simply providing the positive outlines of evolutionary theory is enough to give readers some perspective when engaging in more detail later. Doing more would have ruined the plan of his book. I was also generally pleased with the last chapter of the book, ""Evolution Redux."" I would not say it was philosophically sophisticated, but Coyne refused to promote evolution to a philosophy or ultimate theory. He clearly acknowledged that there are limits to science. This distinguishes Coyne from the brash and often embarrassing voices of popular evolutionary writing.The book also contains a glossary and an annotated list of suggestions for further reading. I highly recommend this book. It got off to a bit of a slow start, but gradually improved until it was quite impressive. I have read better books on individual topics, but none that tie so many fields together like this one. "
78,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/612579-ellis,5,"Before reading:I'm really looking forward to this book. When I got it I just figured that I'd read it because it was readily available and because it is by duty as a scientist to read this kind of stuff. However, I've been teaching a lot of evolution lately and I just can't help but be stimulated by such an outstandingly well-supported scientific theory (I say theory here only as a scientist would mean theory - with great weight). So much of the physical life on Earth makes sense only in the context of evolution. Besides, I picked up, at the same time, some book called The Darwin Myth, and while I plan to read that one as well, I just couldn't stomach dragging myself through it first. After I've pleased my imagination (hopefully) and filled myself with gratitude with this book then I'll move on to the nether-readings.After reading:Fantastic book. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that the author framed some of his arguments against creation of universe/earth/life by God. This fault is misguided and unfortunate. The reason the author did this is that this book (as the title of the book suggests) responds to and debunks some of the silliness of creationism/intelligent design. Since creationism/intelligent design are not scientific theories but are fear-induced religiously-based reactions to evolution, the arguments in this book were sometimes pitted against creation by God. It's unfortunate that this was the case since science tells us nothing about God's role in life or even the existence of God. Science is simply a method to learn about the world around us. Science offers us many tools we can use to learn, but science can't help us when the tools aren't capable of measuring the subject. Science never tries to learn about God. This is not because no scientists care about God (many scientists are devout believers), but it is because there have never been any testable hypotheses that the scientific method could be applied to in order to support any claim to the existence or the absence of a God. Since science isn't capable of answering questions about deity, it's pointless, imprudent, and misguided to say that any scientific theory suggests that God does or doesn't exist. Could creation of life on earth happen by speciation and by the evolution of species? Absolutely. Could God have created earth (and the universe) through a singularity knowing that earth would result and that this earth would have the necessary components to allow for life to develop, even in his image? Absolutely. Is this A LOT to get your head around? Absolutely. It is worth your time to get your head around it though. Remember that ignorance breeds fear, and fear (Yes, summon Yoda now, I have) leads to ridiculous apologetics like creationism and intelligent design. Never allow a lack of knowledge to direct your thoughts, especially when a lack of knowledge is so easily cured. "
79,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,4,"Somewhat contrary to my expectations, WEIT turned out to be considerably better than Dawkins' The Greatest Show on Earth. It still has some very real problems, though, starting with his sloppy use of words (particularly evident early on), which will allow a determined skeptic to take legitimate issue with the book.Fortunately, it picks up when it moves away from the squishy introductory bits into real data, and the rest of the book is pretty solid.He glosses over real (and very interesting) controversies regarding origin and continued popularity of sexual reproduction, though that's somewhat understandable, as a real discussion of the issue would fill (and indeed has filled) several books of its own (my favorite being Matt Ridley's The Red Queen). His discussion of human origins disappointingly doesn't mention neoteny once, but does touch on the aquatic ape crap; and also overstates differences between humans and other apes, for no legitimate reason that I can see.There's also a subchapter on human race, for which braced myself. Fortunately, Coyne doesn't seem to buy into the Gouldian bullshit that race is entirely a social construct of negligible genetic significance that is so popular among American academics (though he does inexplicably refer to The Mismeasure of Man as ""superb"", which is a stretch even if you agree with Gould; and Coyne is clearly a disciple of Gould's in some other respects, as is clear from his attitude towards sociobiology in the last chapter), but he does tip-toe around some obvious conclusions.He mentions that the notion of races (slash subspecies slash ecotypes) among non-human animals is uncontroversial, but then goes out of his way to stress that races in humans aren't unambiguously demarcated, as if that's ever different in other animals. He spends some time discussing very real genetic differences between human races (sickle-cell anemia, Tay-Sachs disease, lactose intolerance, apart from the obvious), and the incredible speed at which sexual selection in particular can work, but then strangely concludes (based on ""informed speculation"") that the human races are probably too young for there to be significant differences between them.I don't know if this is genuine confusion of the mind on his part or intellectual hypocrisy brought on by an editor, but I wish American (mainly) authors would stop fucking doing it.Anyway, apart from that, it's a good book, and one which (unlike Dawkins', really) clearly and systematically lays out a lot of the evidence for evolution; or at least such evidence as is easily accessible to a lay audience. Sometimes he's a bit too careful, sometimes he's a bit too vague and technically inaccurate, but on the whole, it's definitely worth reading."
80,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5814532-jim,5,"""…understanding evolution should surely deepen and enrich our appreciation of the living world and our place in it.""  I really, really like that. This is a fantastic primer on evolution for someone like me that was never really taught it in school. It really makes me reflect on the idea of a literal reading of Genesis. {Is natural selection so hard to swallow when you believe that differences in people have been made in just the few thousand years since Noah?}And is the piecing together of the fossil record any more problematic than the piecing together of the canon we call the Bible? One of the things that strikes me so strongly is the evidence against reading Genesis 1 as literal. To me none of this argues against a Creator, (though I see how some might argue that it makes a creator unnecessary), but as I look around me, Thomas Payne's argument still holds - that God is evident in creation. This goes back to the quote I use at the beginning of this review. But when you look at the facts and the evidence, the idea that God created everything less than 10,000 years ago, there's no way the earth could exist in this current state. Unless, of course, you suggest that God has intervened continuously in the makeup of the natural world, without proof or evidence to back it up. Without even having anything in the inspired scriptures to concur with your claims. The fossil record, vestiges, poor design, biogeography, the variety of species. Why do people ignore the evidence - even the evidence of the scriptures themselves and of church history - to try and ""prove"" that Genesis 1 is literal. I didn't intend to make this review an argument against fundamentalism, but really, that's what this book is about. The reason behind why evolution makes sense versus a literal young earth creation story. The reason why Kyle Butt and his ilk are so successful at debates is because of their use of snark, sarcasm, and poor logic - which just shows they are better entertainers and know how to play to an audience. Kind of like Rush Limbaugh. They're so good at it, that the people whose prejudice they are reinforcing don't realize - or don't care - how unintelligent they really are, or how the come across as utter assholes. And natural selection - when understood - is extremely fascinating. It's difficult to wrap your mind around sometimes. But it is an amazing idea. Overall, this is an excellent and interesting text - especially if your knowledge of evolution is limited. "
81,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"Belief comes first and then rationalization of those beliefs, according to Michael Shermer. Maybe that is why 72% of Americans believe in angels, 60% in the devil and only 45% in Darwin's theory of evolution. That there is abundant evidence for the latter makes no difference at all to what people believe and this is the main reason I gave this rather dull book four stars: it is important. It does state many truths on where this world's creatures, including us, came from - and why. This book could as well have been called ""Why ID is wrong"". The arguments against creationism are strewed all through the book and since I don't need to be convinced, it is sometimes irritating. I have learned a lot more about the mindset for creationism than I have learned new things about evolution. I spent 2/3 of the book wondering why creationists dispute evolution so vehemently. It never struck me, ever, while growing up, that Darwin would be any threat to God. That evolution offers another explanation for ""creation"", so what. It does not make life or nature any less miraculous nor did I see how it would diminish God in any way. Until I got to the bit about humans - then it dawned on me. OH. Human beings are not the pinnacle of creation. Ooops. I can see how that would irk a lot of people. Evolution is a scientific theory, which means it has been tested over and over again and there is no evidence to disprove it. It is not a religion. To say you believe in evolution is like believing in gravity: it makes no sense as the evidence is all around us. People believe in atoms, electrons, black holes and billions of galaxies - not to speak of all the things people believe in for which there is not a scrap of evidence - it shouldn't be such a stretch to believe that over eons, life evolves. However, as it seems to be that for many, Jerry Coyne has written ""why evolution is true"". Not that I actually believe he could convince anyone, as evidence is not an issue. There is plenty of evidence in the book, but if you prefer to believe in something else, of course you will continue to do so regardless. The people who sit down and make hard decisions based on evidence are few and far between. I tip my hat to Mr. Coyne for trying and for writing such a clear and lucid book."
82,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1597507-david,3,"The title of this book could just as easily have been -- ""Why Intelligent Design is False"". I do appreciate the author's patience with all those who are still questioning some of the basic assumptions of Darwinianism, but for once it would be refreshing to see a biologist actually acknowledge some of their own assumptions. Certainly I ""believe"" (his word) that much in this field of study is ""true"", but at the same time I am quite aware of the underlying biases in any human pursuit of knowledge and understanding. I just wish that scientists were as forthcoming as I in admitting to them.This writer goes to some lengths to show that evolution has lead to many dead ends and imperfect adaptations, thus ""proving"" there is no ""divine creator"", whom he (the author) presumes would have only created ""whole, perfect beings"". Here is where he displays his ignorance of the tenets of monotheism, at least. I am not here advocating for the biblical point of view -- only stating that this author displays a common ignorance endemic in the scientific community concerning what is actually written in the Bible, as well as what it is that many people of faith actually ""believe"". One question never answered by Darwinists is the issue of where modern birds came from, since they (evolutionists) insist they are descended from dinosaurs, and the dinos all went extinct 65 million years ago. The basic thesis of this book is that all life on earth has evolved from one organism over the past 3.5 billion years, so the assumption, I suppose, is that the ""dino-bird"" somehow escaped to live and evolve another day.I began my study of these two worldviews (evolution vs. creationism) in 1968. I have ended up some 40 years later as an empirical metaphysicist -- or, if you prefer -- a metaphysical empiricist. That is, I greatly value the merits of a scientific worldview while simultaneously maintaining the ability to accept less sense-based explanations for certain phenomena -- all without much cognitive dissonance, I might add. I regret that during my lifetime there have developed these two schisms, apparently unwilling or unable to speak coherently to one another."
83,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22088425-aaron,5,"If you are a rational person who does not believe 99% of scientists are engaged in a big shadowy atheist conspiracy, you probably accept evolution as a scientific fact. Because of the overwhelming consensus in the scientific community, it is perfectly reasonable to hold this belief without having a deep understanding of the supporting evidence. Nobody has time to become well-versed in everything, and so we frequently defer to expert opinions on all manner of subjects. But if you do want to have a solid understanding of the evidence for evolution and common descent, and understand why creationist arguments are a bunch of bullshit, read this book. You don't need a scientific background. If you finish this book and still have doubts about evolution, you are delusional.Coyne, who is an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago, clearly lays out the multiple lines of evidence for evolution from various scientific fields, including paleontology, comparative anatomy, genetics, embryology/developmental biology, and biogeography. He also gives lucid explanations of the various mechanisms of evolution: natural selection, sexual selection, genetic drift. And there is a great chapter on speciation (the formation of new and distinct species). Along the way, he debunks common creationist objections to evolution.In no other aspect of life do people require nearly as much evidence as there is for evolution to accept something as factual. That is because many people do not like the implications of being closely related to chimpanzees and ultimately related even to dung beetles and E. coli. That's right, you have a distant cousin that habitually rolls balls of shit uphill, and another one that literally eats shit and periodically fucks up lettuce supplies for a living. Talk about the black sheep of the family! People instead want to believe that they are special little creations objectively on a higher plane of existence than all other living creatures. Sorry bud, you're just a talking ape! If you were born a few million years ago you'd be fit for a zoo exhibit."
84,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89508462-melissa-kidd,5,"I have to start by saying that when I bought this book at my university bookstore for my Human Evolution and Paleoanthropolgy class, the clerk who checked me out mentioned how he hoped I proved the book wrong. I find this incredibly ironic because of what this book is all about. Coyne does not set out to prove creationism wrong, but to prove that evolution is true. And in my opinion, he does very well. When I first started this book I thought Coyne came off a little too aggressively. But by the end of chapter one I was feeling fine again. Maybe his intro was meant to weed out those who would only be angered by the rest of his book; I’m not entirely sure. But the book was very factual and scientific. There was no attacks against creationism, just data that pointed out the flaws in the argument. This is fairly basic information, so I definitely recommend it to anyone who is curious about the debate between evolution and creationism and doesn’t have a huge base of evolutionary knowledge already. For me, it was all mostly a review from past classes and books, but the information was organized in a easy to follow way. And while I had heard all of these concepts before, there were some that I now have a better understanding of. And there were a lot of little factoids about this and that species that I’ve never heard of. I had a lot of fun reading this book. The writing is straightforward and clear. There are perhaps other books out there that are more factual and less pervasive, but I went into this reading with the understanding that this book is more about the debates surrounding the validity of evolution than specifically evolution. I think for readers without a clear understanding of evolution, the book does a great job at informing readers about the topic. I do recommend it."
85,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1975296-evanston-public-library,0,"Like most high school students in the early ‘80s, I was taught the theory of evolution and natural selection in the classroom. But up until recently, I still found it difficult to comprehend how the sophisticated human could have evolved from ancestral monkeys. Mr. Coyne’s Why Evolution is True not only explains evolution from a 21st-century perspective that far surpasses my high school textbooks, he answered many questions about the evolutionary process that—until I read Coyne’s book—had left me wondering. One example: Why do fish, dolphin, and dog embryos look similar to the human embryo? Because, according to Coyne, we’re looking at it backwards: the dog, dolphin, and human embryo look like the embryonic fish—not the other way around. Coyne explains that the developing fetus for each species begins with its original ancestral structure and proceeds through its own evolutionary process. The developing human embryo, for example, develops a yolk, which is later shed; it grow a tail, which is later absorbed; it grows a coat of hair, which is later shed. In other words, evolution is an imperfect, jerryrigged process: in order to get to its current form, it first has to build from its previous ancestral forms. Coyne also explains how evolution produces such drastic changes across species; artificial evolution (such as dog breeding); the seemingly counter-evolutionary mating behaviors of male and female animals; and the genetic heritage of humans and apes based on recent DNA sequencing. Largely written in response to recent controversies over teaching Intelligent Design in the classroom, Coyne’s Why Evolution is True does not disappoint. –Russ (Reference) "
86,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5192954-benjamin,5,"A good overview of the evidence for evolution. It's well written and logically set out--though this is what you should expect from a science book. There were good answers given to questions I hadn't even thought about. For example, the fact that the human transitional fossils may represent branches in the Tree and not necessarily specimens of the direct line for homosapiens. I'm always wanting more detail when questions pertaining to genetics comes up, but the lack of depth is understandable given the complexity of the topic. I appreciated the bit on speciation--an important aspect of evolutionary theory that I'd previously under-emphasized. Coyne more or less sticks to science and avoids venturing off into philosophical or religious tangents. The last chapter dealt more with the sociological and psychological implications of evolution and shied away from tackling heavy religious questions. Though I think Coyne's (most probably atheistic) beliefs about religions and God shines through here and there throughout. I feel like Coyne avoids the difficult questions, related to human consciousness for eg., raised in support of the idea that humans are unique among the animal kingdom. This may be so because there's limited space in a small book. I don't know how much I trust Coyne's assessment of ID and creationism. His comments regarding creationists views seem shallow and lacking of substance. Overall a very good book covering the evidence from all the various fields of science for evolution."
87,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1360762-darcy,5,"This book is amazing. (Or the general 'mind-blown' state I have experienced reading it has been amazing). I cannot believe that I am just beginning to study this topic in depth. I thought a general understanding of natural selection was sufficient, but I have been missing out! I am blown away by what I did not know about evolution and the truly amazing, indisputable evidence of the history of our world and evolution of our bodies. I have been misled by the use of the term THEORY of Evolution, not understanding that the word THEORY has a very different meaning within the world of research than is typically assigned to it in a general vocabulary. The discoveries being made in the field of evolutionary science are awe-inspiring and not at all some 'best guess given limited knowledge'. If you too have been allowed to believe that, please read this book and be amazed. I have a doctorate degree as a health professional, and yet evolution has never been mentioned at any point in my education, let alone a detailed study of the research supporting it - why?! Why is the study of evolution not a required high school and/or college course considered as important as anatomy, physiology and biology? This stuff is an essential precursor and/or companion to the study of anatomy, physiology and biology! This is need-to-know stuff for anyone, not just those who take particular interest in science. "

He goes into some detail, but not enough to bog you down - like Dawkins can tend towards. He resolved a lot of questions I had, and left me feeling quite deceived or misled at least by the opposition. Some of that might have been intentional, but I think most of it was from a basic misunderstanding of the facts. Things I learned:There are missing link fossils. Fossils are always found in the correct strata for the time period. Creationists could debunk the whole ""Theory"" by finding one out of place, which they have yet to do. We have seen evolution/natural selection in the lab and in nature. ""God's amazing design"" isn't so amazing if you start to look at the details and vestigial traits. DNA has allowed us to trace geneological trees and progression of evolution. We are 98.5% similar to chimps. There is no evidence the Biblical Flood ever happened, and plenty that it couldn't have. Distribution of species is one drop in the bucket. Nature is even more incredible than I thought, and now I'm asking more questions and appreciating things in a new way. There is a lot more of course, that's just a few off the top of my head. The scientific evidence is overwhelming, really. Really good read, I look forward to learning more. "

I'll try to lay what I learned from this book in the form of points. Jerry Coyne is an accomplished evolutionist. - If you think Darwin was intelligent, he was probably more intelligent than you think he was. - Evolutionary theory doesn't say that species MUST evolve; it's conditioned. It doesn't state that ""all"" species must evolve. It doesn't predict the speed of the process, either. - Intelligent Design promoters have to explain extinction, and the emergence of new species that resemble (to some extent) the extinct ones. - Most fossils we have of marine organisms because the process of fossilization requires a watery environment. - Fun fact: the length of a day increases by about two seconds every 100,000 years. - We can detect evolution, but sometimes it's hard to uncover what caused it. - J. B. S. Haldane was asked, ""What observation could disprove evolution?"" He replied, ""Fossil rabbits in the Precambrian!"" (Which is a powerful funny statement given that rabbits as mammals hadn't showed up yet at that time as predicted by the theory of evolution. - Our control and manipulation of nature, also advances in medicine, have slowed down our biological evolution. They have replaced nature in determining survival of the fittest. "
90,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/705887-broodingferret,3,"While this books does make a fairly concise case for evolution, and also contains quite a few interesting factoids, I've read better introductory texts on the subject. Not having the book on hand, I can't pinpoint specific passages, but there were a few points while I was reading this book that I found myself thinking ""Yes, that's true, but this statement could be misconstrued or misinterpreted. I'm aware of the counter arguments and why they're wrong, but only because I already have a working knowledge of evolutionary theory; someone not as experienced might not understand what has just been said."" Coyne makes good points, all of which are accurate, but he fails to either anticipate and deal with counter arguments or, at times, to clarify ambiguous or potentially confusing points. As such, this isn't the best book if you're looking for an introduction to the topic; for that I would highly recommend The Greatest Show on Earth by Richard Dawkins, which is well-written, comprehensive and (unlike many of Dawkin's other works) geared specifically for the lay public. If, however, you already have a good grasp of evolutionary theory, Why Evolution is True does a good job of fleshing out several details, making it a good supplementary read."

Note that I didn't say, ""Believing in evolution,"" as if it were another doctrine or tenet of a faith. Rather, I needed hard proof that it happened and is still happening.This book helped immensely. When you read it, you see how much information that ""intelligent design"" proponents have to hide in order for their belief to continue to appear plausible. You also see how beautiful and how simple the process of evolution really is. We truly are all connected on this planet: A giant web of animals, bacterium, insects, plants and other secrets that we don't know yet.We are indeed very lucky that we understand our place in this hierarchy, but that shouldn't confer upon us any special feeling of privilege. Rather, it means that because we understand how life works, and how it grows and changes over time, it's our responsibility to be a responsible member of the family here on Earth. We're here for such a short time, and each of us can either do the greatest good or the greatest harm. The choice is up to us individually."

Some of my favorite tidbits: 1 in 500 whales are born with back legs, the platypus has no stomach, human embryos develop three kidneys (the first two resembling fish and reptile kidneys are discarded during the first months of development), and bananas are sterile hybrids.During the reading of this, I kept getting deja vu, but I was certain I hadn't read it before. The answer to this riddle came when I looked over the references and suggested reading. Turns out I've read many of the sources Mr. Coyne is pulling from.The information in this book is fairly basic and logically presented."
93,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1191018-dale,5,"Coyne gives a brief introduction to the modern understanding of evolution, followed by separate chapters outlining the various kinds of evidence for evolution, including the evidence of transitional forms, evolution in action in bacteria and in isolated species, etc. He also takes pains to point out the various ways in which evolution is a testable scientific theory, by listing a number of the predictions made by evolutionary theory, any one of which, if falsified, would force modifications to the general theory.Along the way he casually demolishes the various 'gap' claims made by creationists. Sadly, no such demolition is ever likely to have even the slightest effect on creationists, stuck as they are with their religious/mythological understanding of the world.Nonetheless, this is the best book I've read on evolution. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a deeper and better understanding of the theoretical structure of evolutionary theory and its evidence."
94,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/658925-khadijah,4,"We got this book when both my mom and I signed up for a Cousera course on evolution. I didn't manage to finish the course, but I'm glad we got this book.I didn't study evolution in school because it was taught in the 2nd year of high school biology, which I didn't take because I chose humanities division. I remember my friends talking about having to study evolution only to have it refuted a chapter or two later.The book gives a lot of examples of evolution, often with pictures or graphs, and is very convincing. It leaves no doubt that evolution is true, obviously given the book's title.I don't think there's any contradiction between evolution and religion. Evolution to me doesn't mean we weren't created. But I guess the problem for some people with accepting it goes back to how they interpret religious texts. Is everything to be taken literally or not? That's probably always going to be debatable."
95,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4331887-steve,5,"A good introduction to the subject, and probably more accessible to the layperson that some of Dawkins' titles. One of this book's strengths is that Coyne has clearly made the effort to engage with and understand the objections levelled at Darwinism by its creationist/ID opponents. If you're a religious believer who is yet to be convinced, don't be put off by the somewhat dogmatic sounding title - the most important word in it is the very first one: WHY. This is an excellent book of argument and evidence rather than dogma. If you're already on board with the 'theory' but feel like you could do with brushing up on the subject, you should get a lot out of it too. With only one book to his name, Coyne has proven himself to be among the very best science communicators, and I hope he will continue to write more."

If you are not familiar with the theory of evolution then you will not be swamped in a flood of jargon when you read this book; but if you are not a newcomer to the theory, then equally this book should not bore you.I think that the theory of evolution is amazing in its simplicity and is really an example of beauty that is so obviously apparent in the world around us.This is not a book to read instead of Darwin’s “On the Origin of Species” but makes a superb compliment to it.

At this point, I kind of feel like there has been enough evidence that proves evolution that it is impossible to argue against it. Coyne does a good job of aggregating a lot of this evidence in a concise way. I kept wondering who the audience for this book is supposed to be. Any hardcore creationist will dismiss the book outright, without ever picking it up. And there are times where Coyne seems to be yelling at anyone who doesn't agree with him (he uses a lot of exclamation points). I'm not sure that's how you win over doubters, if that's his goal. I think, more than anything, the book is good at showing a lot of good examples, explaining them in layman's terms, and ""arms"" the reader with good talking points for future discussions about evolution."

Teenagers just looking to get an intro to evolution because your teacher didn't teach you dick -- pick this up, quite useful place to start. But if you're looking for something a bit more involved, you may as well just start with On the origin of Species, then check out The Selfish Gene.Also, Dawkins is just more entertaining -- so get to The Selfish Gene as well.But that said -- don't treat this as a war with religion.

But what he does extraordinarily well is turn the tables and ask creationists to make sesnse of the existing data without resorting to reasoning like, ""the Creator is kinda funny that way. He just does wacky crazy unpredictable stuff that somehow perfectly fits a model of evolution. But it ain't evolution.""

134,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52228684-salman-israr,5,"Remarkable. Simplistic. Enlightening And extremely convincing.Being a scientist myself I already agreed with theory of evolution by natural selection and was convinced about it being a scientific fact. Although I didn't agree with Intellgient Design arguments (zero empirical evidence for it) I still had reservations about development of complexity by just mutations and natural selection acting on them.I searched for papers calculating the probability of all this complexity arriving just because of natural selection though I was convinced by them but still was little doubtful about the probability - maybe our brains didn't evolve to comprehend the probability due to our cognitive biases.What this book does is explain evolution of life by natural selection extremely well and dispel any criticism with solid evidence that might arouse usually from religious circle.For example,the most ""blown away"" moment was me reading about evolution of mammalian eye,a very complex and intricate biological object,I'll quote from the book: ""Dan-Eric Nilsson and Susanne Pelger of Lund University in Sweden made such a mathematical model, starting with a patch of light-sensitive cells backed by a pigment layer (a retina). They then allowed the tissues around this structure to deform themselves randomly, limiting the amount of change to only 1 percent of size or thickness at each step. To mimic natural selection, the model accepted only “mutations” that improved the visual acuity, and rejected those that degraded it.Within an amazingly short time, the model yielded a complex eye, going through stages similar to the real-animal series described above. The eye folded inward to form a cup, the cup became capped with a transparent surface, and the interior of the cup gelled to form not only a lens, but a lens with dimensions that produced the best possible image.Beginning with a flatwormlike eyespot, then, the model produced something like the complex eye of vertebrates, all through a series of tiny adaptive steps—1,829 of them, to be exact. But Nilsson and Pelger also calculated how long this process would take. To do this, they made some assumptions about how much genetic variation for eye shape existed in the population that began experiencing selection, and about how strongly selection would favor each useful step in eye size. These assumptions were deliberately conservative, assuming that there were reasonable but not large amounts of genetic variation and that natural selection was very weak. Nevertheless, the eye evolved very quickly: the entire process from rudimentary light-patch to camera eye took fewer than 400,000 years. Since the earliest animals with eyes date back 550 million years ago, there was, according to this model, enough time for complex eyes to have evolved more than fifteen hundred times over. In reality, eyes have evolved independently in at least forty groups of animals. As Nilsson and Pelger noted dryly in their paper, “It is obvious that the eye was never a real threat to Darwin’s theory of evolution.”So mathematically it would require ~400,000 years for evolution of complex but it happened in 5500,00000 years (a lot of the mutations would have been harmful or neutral) in Nature with only mutations and natural selection acting on them without any supernatural intervention or Intellgient Designer.This just blows me mind and leaves my jaw dropped. I feel super blessed and super grateful to be even existing in Cosmos and experiencing the life and growth and experiencing art,literature,science,connection,love,empathy and compassion.It's remarkable to know that we all connected and are children of Earth. I'm totally convinced about complexity arising from natural selection though we still don't have conclusive evidence how life exactly started - how self replicating molecules arrived. It makes sense to extrapolate evolution to assert that it was abiogenesis but we should let evidence speak for itself.I'll leave with just following passage from the book:""And although evolution operates in a purposeless, materialistic way, that doesn’t mean that our lives have no purpose. Whether through religious or secular thought, we make our own purposes, meaning, and morality. Many of us find meaning in our work, our families, and our avocations. There is solace, and food for the brain, in music, art, literature, and philosophy...The biggest of these misconceptions is that accepting evolution will somehow sunder our society, wreck our morality, impel us to behave like beasts, and spawn a new generation of Hitlers and Stalins.That just won’t happen, as we know from the many European countries whose residents wholly embrace evolution yet manage to remain civilized. Evolution is neither moral nor immoral. It just is, and we make of it what we will.""To add: there is inherent purpose too to life of a Homo sapien in my opinion and that is: evolution of Self (as layed out in Robert Kegan's The Evolving Self)."
135,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53026475-maurice-williams,2,"I found this book very interesting. I haven’t heard all the arguments in favor of evolution, so I was curious what this man had to say. Dr. Coyne is a famous biology professor at the University of Chicago well known for his criticism of intelligent design. When he was asked in a recent interview about the credibility of creationism, Coyne said he didn't think creationism has any credibility: “It's not that we have two theories here: . . . one of them has explained the data, and the other was ruled out a hundred years ago.” When asked, what would you say to a creationist who read the book and remained unconvinced? Coyne said if the reader was unconvinced because Coyne’s book contravenes the Bible, then Coyne would tell him: “I’m sorry. I can't talk to you anymore. You can't be convinced by reason and evidence.”In his book, Coyne writes about the Asian Giant Hornet, “The world’s largest hornet, it has a two-inch body, fearsome jaws and a quarter-inch stinger that is lethal even to humans. This hornet is marvelously adapted to kill—it looks as though it were designed for mass slaughter.” Coyne’s use of the word designed caught my attention. I’m confused about this word when the theory holds there is no intelligence capable of designing anything. It seems like there is some residual perception, even with evolutionists, that there is some kind of intelligent design somewhere in the universe. I see this often in television documentaries on nature. They invariably attribute evolutionary change to some recognition of how it will benefit survival, which is an appeal to my intelligence that can recognize the value of the change, but there is no intelligence proposed by the theory that can recognize anything before the evolutionary change is made. I think even an evolutionist has trouble envisioning the world evolving devoid of intelligence.Coyne discusses how sex drives evolution, he writes: “Creationists could never explain why a super designer should produce gaudy feathers and heavy antlers in one sex and not in the other. Coyne mentions that Darwin had postulated sexual selection as a selection that increases a male’s chance of mating. Coyne writes: This is done in two ways. One way is to provide a means to fight off rivals; the other is a means to make a male more attractive. Coyne also discusses sexual selection in humans. An empress in Asia, for example, might have a penchant for men with straight black hair and almond shaped eyes. By creating a fashion, her preference spreads culturally to all her female subjects. Coyne continues that this ‘good-genes model’ remains the favorite explanation of sexual selection. These models assume that the evolution of sexual dimorphisms is driven simply by pre-existing biases in a female’s nervous system.”I think this ‘good genes model’ requires the intelligent choice of the female human, whom we all know is intelligent, but positing the same intelligence for animals is far fetched. I think an all-knowing creator guiding animals through instinct is a much better explanation. To me, Coyne’s argument presupposes that there is indeed a design that helps the organism in its survival. Animals recognize it and humans can certainly recognize it. That’s Coyne’s point, but where was the intelligence that recognized it beforehand? It is much more sensible for me to presume that God designed things this way.Even considering salmon that live their adult lives in the open ocean, then, after several years, as they approach the end of their lives, swim hundreds of miles across the open ocean to the river they were born in, and hundreds of miles up the river to spawn their eggs and sperm in the location where they first saw life. I can’t imagine a biological mechanism based on chemistry, hereditary traits, magnetism, or smell that can sufficiently explain this. Here again, it is much more sensible for me to presume that God designed things this way.Coyne writes that civilization began about 4000 BC. He goes on to say that “250 generations of civilized society lie atop 300,000 years during which we may have been hunters-gatherers living in small social groups.” Figuring 24 years per generation, would give 12,500 generations of hunter gatherers. Doesn’t anyone speculate on the extraordinary difference in capability between humans and pre-humans? Coyne writes: “We are the one creature to whom natural selection has bequeathed a brain complex enough to comprehend the laws of the universe. And we should be proud that that we are the only species that has figured out how we came to be.” I think it’s much more than a physical brain that explains the ability of humans to comprehend the laws of the universe. I stumble again on Coyne’s claim that “natural selection bequeathed humans a brain complex enough to comprehend the laws of nature.” Who is there to bequeath anything? The Theory of Evolution posits no intelligence at all in natural selection. Even Coyne’s use of the word laws jumps out at me. Attributing laws to random chance events is confusing. A law implies an intelligent lawgiver governing those chance events. If there is no intelligent lawgiver, why talk about laws? Sometimes those who argue against intelligence governing the universe use words that do not precisely get across their arguments.I think the spectacular rate of technological advance in human civilization during 250 generations compared to 12,500 generations of virtually no technological advance argues that there is a significant change in human nature compared to pre-humans. In my lifetime, I have seen technological advances I never would have believed possible. If one were to plot human technological advances against time starting at the beginning of civilization, with time being the vertical axis, the curve would start off horizontal and rapidly, exponentially, curve toward a vertical position. No animal displays that magnitude of advance in technology. Animals that have been on this earth far longer than humans show no advance at all. I think there is something different with humans. I think humans have a spiritual side to their nature as well as a physical side. I think humans are free persons given the ability to improve the conditions of their lives.I spite of my criticism of this book, I like to point out that I think the Theory of Evolution presents a believable scientific explanation of how the different species appeared in the world, and it could fit very well as a human understanding of how God did it, but to suppose that this theory proves that God did not create man is farfetched. Dr. Coyne was not present when man first came into existence? How would he know? All he has to go on are a few hundred bones of extinct hominoids and the testimony of Darwin. Darwin also was not present when man first came into existence, and Darwin had fewer fossil bones at his disposal than Coyne has. How does either one of them know how and why man first appeared? They are offering me their opinion that they want me to accept on faith in the accuracy of their word. I can’t verify their word. I wasn’t there myself, and I don’t have the resources or education to experiment on my own to verify what they say. The best I can do is to accept what they say on faith, accepting it on the credibility of their witness, but that’s not enough for me.The Biblical passage that evolutionists object to: that God made man from the clay of the Earth, isn’t clay composed of the same 98 elements that everything else in the universe is composed of? What is incorrect in saying God made man out of clay, or even if the wording were ‘out of the elements,’ or even ‘out of some pre-existing organism that had it’s origin from clay?’ All those statements claim substantially the same origin for the body of the first man.As far as credibility goes, the Biblical account of the origin of man comes from Moses. Moses was inspired by God to bring the Israelites out of slavery and to compose The Torah, the book containing the laws God wanted the Israelites to abide by. God also had Moses write the history of the Exodus and to compile the ancient traditions and history of the Israelites selecting, under God’s inspiration, which traditions Moses should preserve and which ones to reject. That makes God the authority behind what Moses included into the book. The Torah including Genesis has been accepted as the revealed word of God for some 3300 years. I prefer to place my faith in this witness by someone who was a prophet selected by God rather place my faith in what Darwin proposed 100 years ago.I have no problem accepting that the procedures God used appear to by very much like the Theory of Evolution describes. It’s Coyne’s insistence that this theory proves that God does not exist that I cannot accept. I don’t think that a scientific theory that is based on observation and experiment can prove that a spiritual being does not exist? A spiritual being cannot be observed and examined. I think the nature of God, even his existence, is beyond observation and experimentation to science. Nobody can observe God or perform scientific tests to verify his existence. The only avenue any of us have to approach God is to believe the revelation he has made.I am unconvinced by Dr. Coyne’s arguments. I think a better explanation of the complexities of the world and the marvelous abilities of humans and animals is that God created the world and everything in the world, and guides animals through instinct that displays God’s intelligence, and God gifted humans with free will and a spiritual soul, which explains why humans are so much more advanced than animals."
136,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37175639-danny,3,"This book is both helpful and frustrating.The scientific evidence is presented well. The chapters are well organized, the prose lucid, and the arguments are largely compelling. Coyne draws out his conclusions with interesting examples, and covers the most important issues relating to evolutionary science. I don't have much aversion to what IS in the book, from a scientific perspective. However, the two gripes I have with the book are significant. One deals with what what Coyne leaves OUT of the book and the other deals with what the book entails outside of the scientific realm. First, Coyne deals only with what he affirms, and ignores the views of other legitimate evolutionary scientists who see the science differently than he does. I understand that the book is a popular level treatment, and therefore is not going to feature a proper academic ""lit review,"" but there is a bit more variation within the scientific community on some of these issues than Coyne lets on. This makes portions of the book misleading. Second, and this is my most significant problem with the book, I believe it was a mistake to make this book an apologetic for evolution. Coyne states that his purpose was two-fold; to elucidate the science at a popular level, which he largely succeeds at doing, and to offer ""ammunition"" against creationism. This apologetic approach was in some ways helpful, but in other ways severely flawed.The problems with Coyne's apologetics, in brief; First, he conflates belief/faith in a deity with creationism, and counters them as though they were the same thing (which they are not), without much thought to the differences between them, and with zero sophistication as to the varied beliefs of people of faith. Second, he makes use of the fallacious viewpoint that faith and reason (and religion and science) are incompatible; a fallacy that has been handily dealt with in a number of places. For example, there are major top 20 global universities that now offer post-grad degrees in ""science and religion,"" that recognize the compatibility of the two, when both are viewed rightly. Coyne would have to convince entire academic institutions that their brilliant scholars are all off base, and he'd have to do so with deeply unsophisticated arguments attacking certain groups, like creationists, rather than attending to the real issues between faith and science. Third, his arguments regarding creationism, insofar as he conflates that with religion/faith, are highly caricatured and inaccurate. His rhetoric will convince no thinking person of faith, because he simply doesn't represent them fairly. Fourth, Coyne often pretends to think for a deity in the book, in unsophisticated ways. He often explains the science, quite well, and then concludes paragraphs by suggesting, ""An intelligent creator would have no reason to do such a thing."" Really? Where is your evidence for such a claim? He never offers any. Fifth, Coyne assumes the fairness, accuracy, and superiority of scientific findings, which is also fallacious, as reason based arguments for the limits of science stretch back as far as John Locke. Too often, Coyne blurs his lines by stretching beyond ""Where the evidence likely takes us"" into supposed sure-fire arguments regarding things not covered by the scientific method (historical and philosophical in nature).There is an irony in Coyne's approach that leads him into intellectual hypocrisy. He writes this book in part to counter the arguments of creationists that misunderstand evolution. But, while he succeeds in explaining the science very well, he conflates faith/religious categories that should not be conflated, showing that he misunderstands faith just as deeply as creationists misunderstand evolution (and then Coyne compounds this even more in his next book). My criticisms are lengthy, but let me be clear; I believe that the science in this book, which takes up 90% of the content, is instructive, helpful, and well argued. Had this simply been a popular level book explaining evolution, it would have been very good. But the 10% that makes up the paraenesis is so deeply flawed that it casts a shadow over the entire book. This makes it essentially unhelpful despite its positives."
137,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65039932-danilo,5,"Life is beautiful, amazing, and endlessly interesting.As a beneficent side-effect, Jerry Coyne - apart from wonderfully providing ample evidence for evolution, produces this feeling of interconnectedness between all living things. The Juan Fernandez firecrown, the beluga whale, the roundworm parasite, and homo sapiens, all share in this incredible and unlikely experience we call life.Why is this book important? Since the dawn of time, philosophers and worldly sages have sought to answer life’s most fundamental questions. Where do we come from? What is the meaning of life? Where are we headed? With asking these questions came great anxiety - after all, it was their quest for certainty, for knowledge, for things above and beyond the normal limits of human comprehension. In one way or another, consciously or subconsciously, every individual asks themselves this set of questions. Because of their universality, we could say they are the deepest questions of mankind. Wouldn’t it be great to have an answer to at least one of these? Well, evolutionary theory gives us one.Scientific theories and scientific research have two goals. Either discover new facts about the world, or test the hypothesis of previous theories, try and falsify them, and make them better and more robust if any holes in the theory are found. The least valuable goal of any scientific project is - scientific description. The most valuable - scientific prediction. And evolutionary theory is ripe with them. Predicting where and in which layer of rock fossils will be found. Predicting where and how old the fossils of transitional species will be. Correctly tracing down the phylogenetic tree to find common ancestry, and hundreds of predictions more - all serving as concrete evidence for evolution.Evolution is not just a theory. It is a theory of the same order as Newton’s theory of gravity, or the theory of Copernican heliocentrism. These theories are practically manifested in our everyday lives. You can’t say that Copernican heliocentrism is just a theory and then use a GPS to get somewhere. You can’t say that the theory of gravity is just a theory and live in a building. It is very easy to mistake the word theory in its everyday usage with its scientific usage. A theory in science is like a general in the army. It is of the highest order.It was very interesting telling other people about the evidence for evolution. Try it, it ends up being a conversation in which, in my experience, 90% of the time people are shocked in disbelief. Some babies are born with small tails? What!? The stages of embryonic development in humans resemble the development of embryos of other vertebrates, in the same order we evolved from them? Impossible! Whatever questions you might have had about evolution and the mechanism that drives it - natural selection - will be answered in this book. It is my experience that people fall back on superstition, in situations where they simply don’t know enough of the facts to make their case.There is another, deeper reason, why people choose to firmly hold on to a 200-year old worldview. It is because the validity of the theory of evolution has very personal consequences for individuals. Believing in it, is terrifying. Instead of a creator that has a plan for each and every part of our lives, and the universe as a whole, we are left with a random, material, mechanistic process that doesn’t give a shit about whether we are happy, hell, it doesn’t even care if we stay alive - after we have done our reproductional duties.On the other side of the coin, evolution tells another, beautiful story. It is a story of prolonged darkness (4.6 billion years - to be exact), and a very brief moment of light. I am speaking, of course, about the light that consciousness brings to human existence. An analogy from this book tells us that, if we are to put the entire history of the Earth in one year, the first life form would appear by the end of March, and human beings would appear on the 31st of December, at 6:oo PM. This is the part we get to participate in. The contingency, the randomness, the luck we had to have to be here - is incredible. We don’t get to choose, we get to do whatever we can to enjoy the light. C'est la vie, my friends!"
138,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37160485-alex-athanassakos,5,"This is one the best books on evolution that I read and it certainly clarified a number of issues for me. Coyne writes well and provides full explanations in easy to understand language. He has an uncanny ability to anticipate questions: many a times I found myself reading a paragraph and forming questions like ""...but what about...?"" only to find this same question with its answer a few paragraphs below - sometimes it was unnerving!Coyne is also an unbiased writer as he will tell you whether or not the evidence exist even for the things that he has developed a preference. For example, although he seems to favour the ""good gene"" model as an explanation of sexual selection (i.e., females select males who have, in their estimation, good genes) he also says that there are only two studies that support this theory, while many other studies do not.The book covers the gamut of the evidence in support of evolution: genetic, laboratory studies, the fossil record, vestigial organs, embryology, mathematical models, accurate predictions of the theory, geographic distribution of species, replication of evolutionary outcomes by mixing species that were suspected to form the parents of the new species and finally bad design (i.e., evolutionary left-overs the are not optimal biologically and would not have been there if someone had created that species from scratch, e.g., the descenting human testicle). The evidence is not only overwhelming, but robust. Which raises the question ""how could any sane person not accept the theory""? Or ""how could there still be controversy as to whether or not it is true?""...more on this momentarily.The only negative thing I have to say about this book is a statement that Coyne makes twice (probably an oversight). He says that ""the theory of evolution"" is a fact. But it is not ""the theory"" that is a fact but rather ""evolution"". The theory contains more than just facts that prove evolution . It contains explanations about how and why evolution happens and as he says there is still controversy about the relative importance of the mechanisms that bring about evolution.I would also like to make a semantic point about the discussion on randomness versus non-randomness in evolution by selection. Coyne says that the genetic mutations (both incorrect copies of genes and gene drift) that are necessary to create a genetically variant population and hence enable evolution are random, but natural selection is not. Well, if a population is genetically variant and a random natural phenomenon happens (the example that Coyne provides is rise of the land bridge between north and south America), then which mutations are stuck on which side of the Panama canal is also random and hence their evolution happens because of two random events: a) the geological event and b) the location at which the species with the particular mutations found itself stuck by chance. So it is not clear to me what we mean here by ""natural selection"" being none-random. Yes, given a distribution of genetic variants and an environment, then natural selection will select the fitter genes. But both the location of the ""fitter"" genes (being on the east or the west side of the Panama canal) and the geological event are random events - natural selection has to work with what it has it cannot make up things! Furthermore, ""fitter"" is a relative concept, not an absolute concept. A gene is fitter given what else is in that environment. But what other species got isolated on the west side of Panama canal was also a random event and natural selection may have made a different selection if some of those species did not happen to get isolated by chance. In any case this is not an important issue.I now come to the issue of Intelligent Design and the resistance to the evolutionary evidence by those who believe in ID. I would classify the ID supporters into two groups: the first group consists of snake-oil salesmen. They sell ID not because they believe in it, but because they profit from doing so. Although these guys are morally despicable and annoying, they are not the real problem since if the activity becomes unprofitable they will simply abandon it and move on to the next con-job. Then we have the second group who really believes in ID. Michael McGuire in his book Believing: The Neuroscience of Fantasies, Fears, and Convictions mentions the case of a woman patient of his who, although rational in other issues, believed that her parents were not her real parents. And she believed this despite of all the evidence provided to her by her parents, grandparents, the hospital and other friends and relatives who were around when she was born! According to McGuire, we form beliefs all the time about everything and the job of our brain is to reduce the distance between evidence and the belief. And if the evidence do not exist, our brain will make it up. But why should our brains make up evidence in support of ID? I would argue that this is so because of the costs and benefits involved. Some people's belief in God is tightly connected to their need to believe in afterlife. And this issue is much more important to them than the belief in evidence-based explanations of the origin of species. As such, these folks' brains will make up whatever they need to maintain their belief in God and hence afterlife.So, are these folks a lost cause then, similar in nature to people who suffer from schizophrenia? I think so.Is there a point in trying to argue with them rationally? Trying to convince them that, say, morality is not going to suffer if we believe in evolution and that people who believed in ID from 4,000 BC to about 1945 were severely more morally depraved and brutal to each other then today's atheists or liberal-minded people? I don't think so. It is just a waist of time and energy.So is there anything we could do? Yes, I think the solution is not to try to convince them of their erroneous beliefs by rational arguments and evidence, but rather to give them a way out so they can believe in ID and evolution at the same time! How is this possible? Well, evolution says nothing about the rise of the first cell organism. Where and How did it come about? So we could point them to a theory that says that God knew exactly what he was doing when he created the conditions that gave rise to the first single-cell organism. This was the ""divine spark"" that was needed to start evolution! And this is what the Bible means when it talks allegorically about Adam and Eve. The rest took care of itself and God did not really have to be involved in the minutia of evolution since he knew the outcome anyway (let's not forget that he omniscient). This way there is no contradiction between the theory of evolution and God's books, since evolution does not try to explain that part. But, one could argue, this will only push the inevitable conflict into some distant point in the future. It does not solve anything. True, but in the meantime we can go on teaching evolution at schools and not teaching ID...and who knows what will happen after several generations have been brought up in this model.Finally, evolutionary biologists need to get a bit more critical of evolutionary psychologists who are spoiling the field for them. Coyne talks about them and their ""Just so"" stories, but we need more of that. These guys should not even be considered as scientists. And perhaps the language needs to improve a bit. Although Coyne explains the randomness and purposelessness of evolution, other than genetic propagation, sometimes he even sounds like natural selection or species adaptations have some kind of intentionality. Even the words ""natural selection"" imply that ""nature"" has some kind of purpose or intention. Maybe it is time to leave Darwin's words behind?"
139,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31496815-abdul-sattar-ashour,5,"Prof. Jerry Coyne is a professor in Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago. Coyne is a distinguished biologist of Speciation fame and a well-known figure in the intelligent design vs. evolution debate.""Why Evolution Is True"" is one of the greatest books that I've read on evolution.Simply, it's like a science book to who doesn't love science or can't fully understand science.A readable, clearly well-written and organized book supported with useful diagrams and charts ""Great use of figures that help illustrate evolution"" , provides an easy to understand summary on evolution theory, a good book for beginners even if you're a creationist or don't have any academic scientific background about the principles of evolution, you will understand the book because of its simplicity in language and explanation. It starts of course with the prodigious knowledge of Mr. Coyne but it’s his ability to explain such complex topics with ease that sets this book apart from the rest. It’s profound without being unintelligible. It’s always the first book I recommend when I want to convince someone that the theory of evolution is true and supported by converging mountains of evidence. The book is composed of the following nine chapters: What is Evolution, Written in the Rocks, Remnants: Vestiges, Embryos, and Bad Design, The Geography of Life, The Engine of Evolution, How Sex Drives Evolution, The Origin of Species, What About Us?, and Evolution Redux.I enjoy the admiration that evolutionary biologists have for the icons of their industry: Darwin goes without saying but there is great admiration for Ernst Mayr and Richard Dawkins.The book was great in explaining the radiometric dating and how we are able to have confidence in its accuracy and everything you wanted to know about fossil records and transitional forms. Including two of the best examples: Tiktaalik and Archaeopteryx.I absolutely like the chapter of the human evolution especially the part of how our eyes evolve.Finally, No book explains the theory of evolution any better than this one. It's the best explanation for the theory of natural selection with a luxury of details. After reading, you can consider it as the best book about evolution for the masses.You don’t have to believe in evolution but once you read this book it will leave you no choice but to accept it.*الترجمة العربية يعيبها ضعف التدقيق.5/5.– Recommendations based on my previous readings:- “Your Inner Fish” by Neil Shubin- “The Making of the Fittest” by Sean B. Carroll- “What Evolution Is” by Ernst Mayr- “Life Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution” by Nick Lane - “The blind watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution reveals a Universe Without Design” by Richard Dawkins.- And of course “The Greatest Show on Earth” by the great Richard Dawkins."
140,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54858719-suzanne-dia,5,"So basically, in 2005 the school board of a high school in Pennsylvania passed a resolution requiring biology teachers to basically tell their ninth graders that “evolution is JUST a theory with zero evidence, and there’s this thing called intelligent design, check it out”, the biology teachers refused to read this to their classes, and some parents were angry enough that they took this case to court. This case made Jerry A. Coyne anxious that religious fanatics may go as far as censoring science, specifically evolution, in public schools, therefore a fight in defense of evolution was needed.This is a brilliant, comprehensive, detailed but not too detailed introduction to evolution, I love it.What made me especially like this book is that fact that it discusses all aspects of evolution, and not just fossils. For example, it showcases the evidence of evolution found by tracing the geographical history of Earth.What you’ll find in this book:Chapter one: what evolution is and the six principles of evolutionChapter two: evidence from the fossil record and some “missing links”Chapter three: vestigial traits, dead genes and examples of bad designs that can only be explained in light of evolutionChapter four: Biogeography and how the theory of evolution can predict the distribution of animals and plants as well as their fossils.Chapter five: how natural selection drives evolutionChapter six: how sexual selection drives evolutionChapter seven : Speciation and the mechanism by which it occurs.Chapter Eight: the evolution of humansChapter nine: effect of evolution on humans nowThis is how I expect a scientific book to be written, compelling, straight to the point, detailed enough that you understand what you need to, but not so detailed that the author keeps going on and on about a minor detail. Reading about all the evidence in favor of evolution makes one wonder “how could someone deny this, yet have absolutely no trouble accepting other scientific theories that are less understood”.It’s not a dense or a heavy book, but it’s a science book nonetheless, so it’s not going to be as fluffy as your average romance novel, but it does a wonderful job at presenting all the evidence out there for Why Evolution Is True I highly recommend it to anyone who -like me- finds the subject of evolution very interesting, it’s also suitable for people with little to no knowledge about this subject. I read three books about evolution so far, and this one here is unquestionably my favorite, if you’re going to read only one book about evolution in your whole life, make it this one."
141,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"For some reason, Evolution is a touchy subject. You find people sometimes that doubt its authenticity, decrying it as ‘only a theory.’ Usually, these people don’t know what a theory is when it applies to science. I can say this because Gravity is also a theory, and I don’t see people nonchalantly floating off into space. There isn’t an alternative to the theory of Gravity unless you are really into Aristotle and never heard of Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein. Relativity is a theory as well and we use that all the time for GPS and Satellites and things.However, Why Evolution Is True points out some interesting things about human nature that I did not consider before. Apparently, the idea of natural selection and anything that doesn’t involve a creator god challenges the identity of a person who believes in a creator god. Why Evolution is True is a book that I really enjoyed a great deal. It provides evidence for all of its statements. This is something that I find preferable to throwing up your hands and making up a magic sky man.Let’s go back a bit though. This book provides tons of evidence for all of the statements it makes. It discusses the history of Evolution and how it was thought to be a thing but they couldn’t provide a mechanism by which it occurred until Charles Darwin came along. Once science had the mechanism of natural selection it really took off. Everywhere you look you can find evidence that it is the truth.The author Jerry A Coyne carefully assembles his arguments against every parry that a creationist could invent. Take the idea of certain bacteria having a little molecular motor, or the old favorite of the complexity of the eye. Coyne argues that for each event it isn’t necessary to produce an eye from nothing, just that you have to have something functional that doesn’t hinder the organism. We learn about sexual selection and tons of other things along the way. Coyne even discusses the idea of molecular biology and how it is helped along by our more advanced science.If you are a staunch creationist you probably won’t change your mind at this book, but I thought it was very compelling. Then again, I don’t know why you would want to read this book as a staunch creationist unless you were looking to argue. I could be wrong though."

In these days of climate change and, it seems, all things science denial it's important for believers to be grounded in the facts. One picky point about Dr. Coyne is his belief that scientists should not leave the lab to participate in protests against fear-mongers and alternate fact spewers. America is trending in the opposite direction from most of the rest of the industrialized world.Notes: 1 Evolution matters because it is personal.1 Resistance stems largely from religion.5 Evolution is genetic change over time.4 Gradualism says major changes take thousands or millions of years.5 Splitting or speciation.7 99% of species go extinct leaving no descendants.15 A theory must be testable and make verifiable predictions.35 Only need transitional fossil species not distinct missing link.60 Creationists don't like vestiges because it shows animals evolved.68 Dead genes for smell in dolphins refutes creationism.76 Embryonic development and ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.88 Biogeographic evidence so powerful that creationists don't contest it.81 Robin Williams observation about bad design and waste treatment plant next to recreation area.90 Convergent evolution is the same adaptation in different anmimals- for example gliding on the flying squirrel and the sugar glider.108 Creationists hate the logioc of island biogeography.123 Genetic drift is another type of evolution but random.123 Genetic drift is the opposite of natural selection.148 Sexual dimorphism is differences between sexes of same species.160 Extreme sexual dimorphism correlates to greater competition for mates.169 Darwin actually doesn't address speciation.176 Genes don't arise to fill a niche.188 Polyploid speciation.215 Cultural change can produce genetic change.219 Due to cultural change we are going downhill genetically.225 Evolution doesn't give us a reason for existence and that bothers people."
143,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12534065-maria,4,"I was raised in a fundamentalist home who believed evolution was wholly untrue. I vividly remember questioning my teachers in middle and high school about different conflicting or unproven aspects of creationism. Eventually I decided that if I were the only Christian on earth to believe that evolution was true, I was okay with that. After all, isn't it more amazing to imagine a God capable of creating a world of natural resources, physics, chemistry, math, and pure chance that culminates into the earth we know today than a God who simply placed all that exists on earth 6,000 years ago and was done? Fortunately, as a now Catholic, my religion does not condemn evolution (although it does still condemn other widely held beliefs). But why am I talking about my personal religion, rather than this book? Because that is what the belief in evolution actually comes down to- one's self. If you are interested in evolution, because it might be true or because you want a better understanding in order to show its fallacies, I highly suggest you begin here with Coyne.This book lays out clearly and logically every(?) facet necessary to understanding evolutionary theory. I do have a background in science (B.S. in Biology), but I think anyone of high school level knowledge can understand this book. This book is valuable because it is a current and simple description of evolution and natural selection- everything that one *should* learn in school in one, illustrated book. This book is also *actually* interesting as is demonstrated by it being one of the only nonfiction books that I have completed.P.S. Even if evolution is false- God created us all 6,000 years ago- isn't evolution still an extremely helpful tool that we can use to better understand God's world? P.P.S. It is okay to doubt. The disciple Thomas doubted and Jesus still loved him."
144,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94060158-j-gibson,4,"This book is enjoyable and well-written, and contains a lot of useful information about evolution. It covers almost every argument in favor of evolution that one could imagine. My only critique of the book is that Coyne uses the ""bad design"" argument early on, and I object modestly to this point, as someone who believes in evolution. While I don't think the ""design"" of the body is proof of intelligent design or favors creationism, I don't think ""bad design"" necessarily works against it, either.The human body may be a lot like coding. Sometimes, things just work and we leave it alone. Sometimes, removing or changing one line or instance can have unforeseen consequences on the rest of the code. Coyne uses the example of the circuitous path of the laryngeal nerve, which is commonly pointed to, as an example of bad design. Yet, we know that this nerve innervates other parts of the anatomy on its path, and that innervation itself is complicated and still not wholly understood by neuronatomists. He argues that the long path of the laryngeal nerve makes it more susceptible to damage, and yet if it connected directly to the brain from the larynx, whatever it would have innervated along its former path would still require innervation. Therefore, it would seem to me that there would just be something else there potentially susceptible to similar damage.I think the case for evolution is powerful enough that speculative and subjective ideas about ""bad design,"" when there is still so much we don't know, even about the brain, are unnecessary. I favor abandoning the argument and sticking to the other substantial proofs of evolution. Biogeography alone makes a better case than most metaphysical or any ""bad design"" arguments.I would rate this book a 4.5/5 if I could. Great work."
145,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76453165-katlyn-sons,1,"Truthfully I didn't read all of this book. It was for a class and we only read certain chapters, but I read enough to know I hated it. It was pretty basic and told in a boring way so I wasn't learning anything new, nor was I entertained. But maybe this book isn't for me? After all I am in my second year in college as a Biology major. Logically I already know a lot about evolution (So why did my professor force us to read this book then? I wish I knew) However, the people who might not know this information and find in themselves the desire to hear the basics of the arguments for evolution told simply will be turned off by this book. Coyne is very condescending in his writing about anyone who has even the slightest doubt in evolution or belief in a higher power (even if they still believe in evolution, which many people do). I'm firmly agnostic (raised Lutheran) and I was still kind of offended by how rude he seemed about spirituality. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is interested in evolution. Either you already know all the information and it'll just be boring and slightly aggravating to read. Or you will likely be offended and turned off from considering any of the arguments in favor of evolution."
146,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2981046-nate-walker,3,"Lots of interesting info in here about a whole host of creatures. And a number of compelling arguments that suggest at least some aspects of evolution are true. Creationists should not be dismissive of the science behind evolution. I appreciated him best when he focused on biology and paleontology and stayed away from topics like God and ethics—clearly not his area of expertise. But the polemical tone was heavy-handed, and he seemed to think that he proved more than he really had. As an open-minded Christian coming to this book I would think I am his primary audience. But my biggest question about evolution is this: is it possible, or probable, that mindless forces could by accident produce the countless mutations necessary to have the abundance of species in our planet? Amazingly he did not answer this question. I think the reason was because his main premise that natural selection is the engine of evolution is faulty. Natural selection is the steering wheel of evolution, but natural selection is not the engine. The car doesn't move without the mutations. The question ""Where did the mutations come from?"" is the heart of the matter, and he didn't address it for me."
147,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58328722-samantha-brooks,4,"Being a Catholic, at first, I had a hard time reading this book, mostly due to Coyne's very blunt words. However, i quickly became fascinated by the extensive research and accurate science he provided upon a wide range of subtopics to the theory of evolution. I read this book alongside Shubin's ""Your Inner Fish"" and they are great companions as Coyne makes reference on a few occasions to Shubin's discovery of Tiktaalik. Overall, this book has opened my eyes to the science of how all beings were created. In the end, Coyne has insightful and spiritual words towards how evolution does not guide our future, but merely explains the past. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in knowing a little more about the theory of evolution. It has been a great read for me and has opened me up intellectually. If you are a catholic and are worried about how this book could impact your faith, I encourage you to read the Encyclical Humani Generis of the Holy Father Pius XII (you can google it to find the document), in which the Holy Father speaks on behalf of the church in relation to evolution. "
148,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80531988-jon-henrich,4,"This book definitely helped my spotted knowledge of the fact of Evolution. It supports the many points that atheists and philosophers have made as to why Creationism and ""Intelligent Design"" just doesn't make any sense at all when the Earth and its past and present inhabitants are genuinely acknowledged and studied.""Intelligent Design"" is especially nonsensical. It is an easy excuse for any person to accept the excellent arguments presented for Evolution (and why the theory has been verified) yet still refuse to let go of an imaginary, simultaneously all-knowing and idiotic creator. If a god truly did create the Earth and man, he's an idiot.Because of all the detail involved in this book (so many references to thousands/millions/billions of years ago), I wish it would have contained more charts, graphs, images, etc. It's not an easy task to think in seemingly negative terms of X many years ago. It's like making references to BCE (Before Common Era, or BC) by taking the difference in relation to now. If it had those charts, this book would get five stars. (I should look for that book...)"
149,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54481000-fahim-khan,4,"This is one of the best book to understand and know clearly about complex evolution of animals in our planet. The language is very strong and easy to understand. Anyone regardless of his education background can pick this book and can enjoy a journey through the world of fossil and evolution.The magnum opus book about evolution is surely Charles Darwin's The origin of Species. But the book was written even before the discovery of basic genetics. So many theories proposed by Mr. Darwin can seem pretty hard and preposterous to get from that book. But this one is basically a rewritten version of the origin along with modern science and genetical data proving the validity of the theories. It also goes further by proposing modern theories regarding evolution and what might we find out in future. The writer did a great job including easy pictures and maps instead of hard mathematical data which might confuse the young learners.I would say, if you are really interested about evolution and what actually triggered the long lasting debate about our origin, you need to read this book thoroughly."
150,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541654-jared,4,"In  Why Evolution is True,  Jerry A. Coyne lays out evidence for evolution, and does a fine job of it. He addresses common objections to evolution and explains where they fall down. He acknowledges the limitations regarding what the fossil record can provide, and explains why that's not a problem. In the last chapter of the book, he addresses the common fear that belief in evolution will result in a less moral society.Overall, the book is well written. The author makes his case. If I have one complaint about the book, it's that he's a little defensive about it. He complains that no other science has to defend its assertions like evolution. This is not true. In my physics and engineering classes in high school and college we replicated experiments demonstrating the accuracy of the laws of electromagnetics. But nobody fears that the laws of electromagnetics will result in a less moral society."
151,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61564803-edgar-antioquia,5,"An enlightening book. It teaches us the basic ideas of evolution, backed up by evidence. This book teaches us that evolution is not something to be afraid of, for it might cause as to act like beasts, (because we evolved from them) but it shows us that we are indeed evolved -- better. It merely shows us where we come from, and the wondrous laws of nature that acted upon species in order to form a biological complex specimen such as humans. I also like the fact that the author is not afraid to say that science doesn't have all the answers, for now. Science, like species, are contiually evolving. Just because we don't know something right now, that we have to use the ""God of the Gaps"" argument. It just means that we have to strive to learn better about our world and how it works; including evolution. We are lucky that natural selection evolved us brains that can actually comprehend its role in our evolution, and I hope that with the same brain, all people will realize that evolution is not ""just a theory"", but is a scientific fact."
152,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2806990-shahina,5,"You may not remember every bit of evidence presented in this lucid and vivid narrative but the wonder will surely remain. Somewhere in the book he mentions how man evolved to make sense of just about thirty years and goes on to take us slowly but surely, through evidence after evidence, all the way back to the Cambrian fossils to a more recent 7 million years ago - when early man emerged, branching out from apes, and the other wondrous evolution stories in between - from fish to reptiles to birds to mammals. All held together with that most remarkable intellectual breakthrough, Darwin's natural selection. Even if all this common knowledge or the gist of it is, this book is so much more than just an essential and relevant argument for a world where a significant population is still unconvinced. It is a celebration of the journey made so far, of how we came to be. Dotted with anecdotes and quotes, strewn with facts and overwhelming evidence, and replete with wonder - altogether a very engrossing saga. Loved it! "
153,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72817347-gracie,5,"This is an excellent overview of the multitude of evidence in support of the theory of evolution. Coyne's writing is easily accessible, interesting, and to the point. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a refresher on evolution, or who has not been exposed to evolutionary theory since high school (or who never even were exposed in high school...). I will say that Coyne is very heavy-handed in his rebukes against creationists/intelligent design-ers - since I was primarily reading this book to better understand evolutionary research, rather than combatting creationists, I found those parts a bit tiresome. However, they are easily glossed over if you are more interested in the research itself. I really did like how Coyne frames so much of the book by making a prediction based on evolutionary theory and then listing the evidence that supports the prediction. It clearly shows the robustness of Darwin's proposition and how, over time, it has been supported and supported to the point that evolution is no longer ""just"" a theory, but scientific fact. "
154,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1783298-paul,5,"Ahh... the subject of evolution, or to some people ""How we are/are not descended from primates because that would alter our worldview of ourselves and how important we think we are in this world."" I gave this book five stars simply because of the fact that it meets the following criteria: 1.) The writing is amazingly good when it comes to taking something complex and intricately detailed and being able to bring it down to a level that the average everyday person can read, digest, and understand. 2.) A wealth of supporting facts and evidence is given in support of the main ideas that run through this book. 3.) Opposite and contravening opinions are addressed, logically and in a methodical and systematic manner. The book does not so much decry as debunk by showing how certain ideas/concepts/issues that are used by people who don't like this idea (mainly creationists and the like) simply do not hold water when placed under scientific review and, more interestingly, common sense and logical deduction. 4.) Painstaking effort is taken to illustrate and delineate the most critical and important links between theories, ideas, evidence, process, and eventual product of evolution. The author goes to great pains and lengths to ""connect the dots"" as it were when showing why the theory of evolution is more than just a theory. He even addresses the controversy surrounding the usage of the word theory, by placing it in its proper context as it is used in the scientific community.5.) This book does not talk down. Instead, it takes competing ideas, assumes their posits are true, and then proceeds to show the gaps/deficiencies in the logic/process/evidence/etc., widely documented, and explain how such gaps/deficiencies either disprove the competing idea, or make it less tenable and usable than the one that is accepted by the scientific community. 6.) While the topic of creationism is addressed, by name, at numerous points in the book, it never once felt when I was reading it as if it was an ""anti-creationism"" work. Instead it felt like the author was trying to be as objective as possible and give the idea as much benefit of the doubt as well, only to then proceed and expose the flaws to the point espoused by creationism. In other words, instead of seeming like it was screaming ""pro-evolution"" at the top of its lungs, the book seemed instead like a patient, logical, rational teacher that was taking two screaming kids and correcting their understanding of the topic being fought over in a calm, sensible, and educated manner. Some people, regardless of whatever they are shown/told or otherwise, are always going to believe that humankind was the way we are since day one, and that the earth is thousands of years old and not the billions that the fossil and geological record say we are. This book is not for them. This book is for people who want to understand the idea more, the controversy surrounding the idea, or seek illumination regarding this topic in order to be able to more intelligently discuss the topic (or be able to understand why it is such a critical issue in today's educational curriculum). With such issues today as gene treatment therapies based on race emerging as hot button issues (and that one in particular because it can smack of racism when it is actually using scientific data to pinpoint and illuminate issues that seem to be endemic to a particular ethnicity, issues that have developed over time due to geographical isolation and the changes in their evolution that developed as a result of said isolation), it is more important than ever for people to know and understand this issue today, clearly and sharply. All teachers who teach evolution should also read this book, simply because it might give them additional advice and/or info in the event that they are ever challenged in their teaching of evolution by parents or anyone else who doesn't buy into it. Finally, to anyone on the fence regarding this issue - this book will hopefully help you understand the issue better, and place it into a better perspective of understanding. Moreover, it will hopefully get you off the fence and into the camp of at least seeing why this issue is so critical to understand and why it is so important to not bend to the pressure of people who want the issue removed from school curriculums. Now, for my own personal note: this book has a quote on the dustcover by Richard Dawkins that, while sounding a bit harsh, is one that I can readily agree with as it regards this book. As I said at the beginning of this review, the reason why a lot of people have issues with this topic is because it challenges their notion of being ""special"" in this world, of being nothing more than the product of random chance and luck. The simple fact that we have, as a race, managed to come this far while everything has been so dependent on luck and chance is nothing short of amazing - think of it as winning at the blackjack table in Vegas each and every time you bet a lot of money, even if now and then you miss a small hand. This book openly admits that the evidence used in it is not complete. It also goes on to state that even though that is the case, if the model holds true, then future predictions can and should work - and then it goes on to show specific examples of just that. It admits the limits of its own knowledge and works the best it can with what it has to show, the whole while addressing the gaps and saying how new evidence may one day overturn the model and necessitate reworking it into something new. Most amazingly, it has no problem with this at all. Such honesty about who we are and how we got here is not only rare but, more importantly, should be valued. Overall, a book that should be read by anyone who wants to understand the idea more, the controversy surrounding it, or looking for clarification and illumination on the subject. "
155,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17203160-kaushik-bekal,4,"Evolution is one of the most novel ideas that sprung from simple yet astute observations by Darwin. A century and a half after his bold assertions, evolution continues to pass the high bar set by the scientific method. Coyne's book sheds copious light on evidence for evolution from various scientific fields like paleontology, biogeography, anatomy and genetics.While there is some sparring with unproven creationist ideas, readers should not be concerned about this being an exercise in mudslinging. The primary focus of the book is on explaining various forms of data gathered over decades and how they mesh together to provide undeniable proof. Certainly a nice short read not only for the armchair biologist, but also for those looking to get their feet wet at the shores of the vast ocean that is the theory of evolution."
156,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28415586-jeff-powers,3,"A fantastic overview of the exhaustive list of evidence that leads to evolution being the driving force of the natural world. Coyne directly disputes the arguments of ID and creationism as they are often presented as an alternative to the scientific perspective. But their arguments not only don't hold water, but there is countless reasons as to why evolution is the only logical and reasonable method by which we got to the current diversity of life that we see on earth. This is a great pop science read even if you only have a passing interest in evolutionary biology. Possibly one of the best on the subject. An absolute recommend to anyone who might at all be interested. Proponents of ID might feel personally attacked but let's be honest, they don't leave much room for alternatives to their worldview and this or any book isn't going to change their mind."

This books gives you exactly that. Coyne does a fantastic job at laying down the evidence and he does it in a very entertaining and rigorous way. It turns out evidence for evolution comes from many different sources and methods that complement each other, analysis of fossils being probably the most fascinating one. One thing I really liked is the description of how evolutionary theory predicts facts that have been confirmed by further research. I also really enjoyed the last chapter on what the theory of evolution means for humans and their morality. Great book: it gave me exactly the knowledge I needed."

The reason: because there are still large numbers of people in our society who are skeptical about evolution. As Coyne explains, evolution is as solidly established as any scientific fact and is not ""just a theory"" as some non-scientists would like to believe. Coyne also shows the beauty and wonder that understanding evolution brings to our view of ourselves and the world. Understanding the universe and our, may I say miraculous role in it, is indeed awe inspiring and humbling. I'm really glad I got this book and greatly enjoyed reading it."

Evolution was a foreign subject to me, and I’d always assumed that scientists were frauds, reaching for answers, missing the boat. Coyne does a great job simplifying the subject for a beginner to the subject of evolution. I was especially pleased to see a pragmatic statement that belief in evolution doesn’t necessarily eliminate belief in a creator. Having finished this book with a comprehensive understanding of evolution, and a firm foundation upon which to now grow as I read on, I can only give it five stars for taking my old cult-mentality on at full force...and winning.

It presents evidence from many areas (fossil record, embryology, biogeography, genetics, biochemistry, anthropology, etc.) to show that evolution is not only a scientific theory, but also a scientific fact. Everybody will benefit from reading it. If you already believe evolution is true, it will provide you with more background information to understand and defend it. If you have your doubts, it will help you see how and why it is the only possibility. And if you are a radical creationist whose mind won't be changed no matter what, it will show you your own stupidity. Darwin would be proud."

It's somewhat geared toward creationists and people who believe in intelligent design, which I think is really important, but anyone can read it--including people who need no convincing about evolution--without feeling like they're not the audience if they just want to learn more about the subject. And re: the running theme of countering intelligent design with empirical evidence, the author approaches this in a way that is not totally dismissive of people's religious or other views that could lead them to believe in it, which I found to be quite diplomatic. The book is dense with fascinating information and surprisingly interesting and entertaining to read."
162,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87165204-david-solis,5,"What an incredible read. Jerry Coyne does an elaborate and concise job on explaining why evolution as a 'theory' is no theory but in fact a law and scientific knowledge. Taking its readers through the history of earth and the origins of evolution as a studied concept, Coyne makes it impossible to deny the process of evolution. Every chapter was full of facts that I otherwise never have come across in documentaries or books, so it was great to have a book dedicated to showing evolution in several species and understanding the chronology of it all, as well as the reasoning, the mutations, the 'mistakes' and even the role that evolution has in modern day culture and biography! Definitely a must read for the avid fan of science!"
163,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4647385-endre,5,"Jerry A. Coyne from the University of Chicago is a distinguished biologist of Speciation fame and a well-known figure in the intelligent design vs. evolution debate. He for some reason felt obliged to lay out the evidence for evolution, but unlike the one mentioned above, which is a highly technical textbook (co-authored with H. Allen Orr) and an embarrassingly difficult read even for professionals, Why Evolution Is True is a delightful book designed for the average reader.Isn't this so-called ID-evolution debate already settled? Apparently not. Not in America, at any rate. While it's not really an issue in Europe, a great number of people in the United States flatly reject evolution and literally interpret the Bible as the ultimate truth.But here's the thing: the evidence for evolution is overwhelming. It's there for all to see. Paleontology, geology, plate tectonics, biogeography, comparative anatomy, genetics, molecular biology - all these disciplines have their share to add to the ever-growing pile of evidence. You have to be blind or just plain stupid to deny it.At any rate, Dr. Coyne makes his attempt to impart this intelligence to the lay people. After explaining in the first chapter what evolution is, in the following chapters he makes his case clearly with numerous examples from the above disciplines. Chapter 2 deals with fossils, how paleontologists work, radioactive dating methods, prominent transitional fossils like Tiktaalik (fish to amphibian), Archaeopteryx (reptile to bird), Indohyus (an artiodactyl ancestor of whales). This is really just an excerpt. There are a lot more.Chapter 3 happens to contain my favourite example, one from ontogenesis. Not the easiest to understand, but I hadn't known about it before. I recommend medical students pop this to their anatomy teacher: why the heck our left recurrent pharyngeal nerve goes all the way down to the heart and comes back only to innervate the larynx?The answer lies in ontogenesis and common ancestry:""One of nature's worst designs is shown by the recurrent laryngeal nerve of mammals. Running from the brain to the larynx, this nerve helps us speak and swallow. The curious thing is that it is much longer than it needs to be. Rather than taking a direct route from the brain to the larynx, a distance of about a foot in humans, the nerve runs down into our chest, loops around the aorta and a ligament derived from an artery, and then travels back up to connect to the larynx. It winds up being three feet long. In giraffes the nerve takes a similar path, but one that runs all the way down that long neck and back up again: a distance fifteen feet longer than the direct route! When I first heard about this strange nerve, I had trouble believing it. Wanting to see for myself, I mustered up my courage to make a trip to the human anatomy lab and inspect my first corpse. An obliging professor showed me the nerve, tracing its course with a pencil down the torso and back up to the throat. This circuitous path of the recurrent laryngeal nerve is not only poor design, but might even be maladaptive. That extra length makes it more prone to injury. It can, for example, be damaged by a blow to the chest, making it hard to talk or swallow. But the pathway makes sense when we understand how the recurrent laryngeal nerve evolved. Like the mammalian aorta itself, it descends from those branchial arches of our fishlike ancestors. In the early fishlike embryos of all vertebrates, the nerve runs from top to bottom alongside the blood vessel of the sixth branchial arch; it is a branch of the larger vagus nerve that travels along the back from the brain. And in adult fish, the nerve remains in that position, connecting the brain to the gills and helping them pump water. During our evolution, the blood vessel from the fifth arch disappeared, and the vessels from the fourth and sixth arches moved downward into the future torso so that they could become the aorta and a ligament connecting the aorta to the pulmonary artery. But the laryngeal nerve, still behind the sixth arch, had to remain connected to the embryonic structures that become the larynx, structures that remained near the brain. As the future aorta evolved backward toward the heart, the laryngeal nerve was forced to evolve backward along with it. It would have been more efficient for the nerve to detour around the aorta, breaking and then re-forming itself on a more direct course, but natural selection couldn't manage that, for severing and rejoining a nerve is a step that reduces fitness. To keep up with the backward evolution of the aorta, the laryngeal nerve had to become long and recurrent. And that evolutionary path is recapitulated during development, since as embryos we begin with the ancestral fishlike pattern of nerves and blood vessels. In the end, we're left with bad design.""The following chapters deal with the geography of life, how animals came to live in the separate continents, island biogeography, bees killing giant hornets by heating them up to 80 degrees centigrade, evolution in the test tube, drug resistance, a whole chapter on sexual selection, speciation (the process of distinct species formation), population genetics, human evolution (including Homo floresiensis, the hobbit), etc.All in all, a profoundly satisfying read, a rare gem in the market of popular science books. Last words:""We are the one creature to whom natural selection has bequeathed a brain complex enough to comprehend the laws that govern the universe. And we should be proud that we are the only species that has figured out how we came to be."""
164,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64645866-jo,4,"I still have a hard time comprehending how some people still deny evolutionary evidence. When I set out to read this book, I'd just come off reading the Jurassic Park books and was interested in comparing the novels' ""science"" to that of our own. This book carefully maps out an argument for evolution, one which is completely convincing and brought me back to an anthropology class back in uni. I still can't believe people argue against evolution, especially in our day, but Coyne argues against creationist views and backs up his arguments with research and facts instead of using sarcastic wordplay. "
165,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55909565-ks,5,"Considering that Jerry Coyne intended this book to be accessible to the general public, I found it a greatly written book, as Jerry Coyne easily weaves in the difficult concepts without throwing in too many technical terminologies. This book does not attempt to disprove God, but lambasts the notion put forth by creationists (and Intelligent Designers) that evolution is false in its entirety.The chapters on speciation were a great read, as certain forms of speciation that are less known (such as hybridization) are easily tackled and brought forth with clarity.Great read and an educational book!"

I think genetics do explain and support evolution enough, yet it remains a challenging task to convince people about evolution since they want something tangible, not just a comparison between sequences of genes.I read this as an effort to present evolution in a classroom to other students (I am a student myself, studying CS, nothing related to biology really) since they were all curious about it and, unfortunately, very misinformed. I think the book served my purpose well, and of course, I got to learn a lot for myself, too and I'm ever more interested in the topic."
167,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12769262-henrique,4,"This book was a surprising read. Jerry Coyne makes an exceptional job at describing the several lines of evidence that support evolution. He has a talent for making it simples yet thorough. Its also entertaining at the same time.Like its said in the preface ""this book lays out the main lines of evidence for Evolution. For those Who oppose darwinism as a matter of faith, no amount of evidence Will do - for those Who find themselves uncertain this volume gives a succint sumnary""I also agree with Coyne in the end that accepting Evolution does not cripple our morals or Will lead us to disaster. Rather, it enhances our lives by telling us where we came from and how much life has achieved. "

Taken together it really is overwhelming evidence that inevitably points to the same conclusion in every area of science. In the natural world truth often is stranger than fiction and the portraits of the natural world in this book were captivating. A deeper understanding of evolution through natural selection paints a more complex and beautiful picture of nature and our place in it than any creation story could."

On the other hand, his treatment of the subjects is generally balanced and without polemics.

Mr. Coyne gently introduces and explores some of the science of and behind evolution, and creates an eminently understandable narrative."

For someone like this previous version of me, Coyne's book really gives you all the evidence you need to convince you of the truth. For those who aren't willing to give up their beliefs in religion and its accompanying false ideas, this book sadly will not help (as we can see from many of the reviews for the book itself). "

His in-depth explanations on topics that might be unfamiliar to some people are easily understood. Check the extensive bibliography if you need more information about any particular topic.This is not an easy book to read as a reader without some understanding of biology past the high school level may need to review terminology. Don’t let that scare you away from this most excellent treatment of evolution especially if you were ever steered away from the topic in your childhood.
172,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7838733-sanjay-patel,3,"Pros and ConsPros1. Coyne gives one of the simplest explanations of evolutionary theory you can find. The basic explanation is about ""natural selection."" The concept is quite simple. Evolution usually progresses in minor steps. These are usually caused by mutations in the organism's genes. That's why we find different types of features amongst human beings and other animals. For instance, some people are hairier than others. Some elephants are hairier than others. No big deal. But suppose an Ice Age comes up. The elephants that are hairier will tend to remain warm and survive and populate. Elephants with less hair would freeze and die. Similarly, across thousands and millions of years, due to chance mutations, and good and bad fortune, `fitter' organisms tend to survive whilst others die. Makes sense.2. Coyne argues that the proof of evolution ironically lies in the imperfection of all life forms. The imperfections were the reason they died. The reason for the imperfections is because they were not designed. The helpful characteristics in various life forms are just fortunate characteristics that enable them to survive. Because those characteristics appeared at the right time in the right place they give the illusion of having been intelligently designed for a purpose. Makes sense.3. Coyne admits that ""science cannot completely exclude the possibility of supernatural explanation."" Makes sense.4. He honestly admits ""Evolution raises profound questions of purpose, morality and meaning..."" (pg 224) ""How can you derive meaning, purpose, or ethics from evolution? You can't. That question is outside the domain of science."" (pg 225) Makes sense. Coyne is one of the few evolutionists to admit good behavior cannot derive from evolutionary theory. ""What can keep us moral if we are nothing more than monkeys with big brains?"" He says.Cons1. Coyne suggests that since creatures have been dying off for billions of years, that is proof that they are imperfect and cannot be the work of a perfect creator. He suggests that evolution proves there is no creator because a creator would create perfect organisms that would live forever under any circumstance. This is a huge assumption. How can Coyne know the mind of God?2. He sarcastically compares the belief in a transcendental, omnipotent, omniscient, ineffable God to the belief in elves. (pg 225) This is an unfair and unrealistic comparison. Elves are an easy strawman to demolish in place of a transcendental God. This rude and insidious tactic is used by many evolutionists.3. He says ""Supernatural explanations always mean the end of inquiry."" (Pg 225) This is untrue. Newton believed in God and he was perhaps one of the most inquisitive and brilliant scientists of all time. His belief in God actually provided the momentum for his inquiry into the universe. Understanding creation was a way of getting a glimpse into the mind of God.Also, in the amazing texts of ancient yoga - which Coyne conveniently avoids - ancient yogis actually encouraged their students to investigate the universe through ""intelligent examination, scripture, inference, direct perception, and demonstrable arguments. The eye [observation], scripture, water [water clock], drawing [diagrams], and counting [mathematics],o best knowers of intelligence - these five are the means of investigating the host of stars, o priests.""Coyne and others repeatedly attempt to destroy the belief in God and spirituality by ignoring the ocean of wisdom and science in Eastern faiths. This is not to say that such wisdom cannot be found in the West. It can. But dogma from a powerful Church has suppressed the mysticism of the Abrahamic faiths that were once connected to Eastern faiths in ancient times.Here's why evolutionary theory (not atheism) MIGHT be true but appears SO false:All knowledge - spiritual or scientific - begins from trust in the messenger. Sarcasm [lumping God together with elves, Santa Claus and Easter bunnies] against the deepest values and morals of the people breeds mistrust and suspicion of the messenger and his or her intentions.If atheism and evolution are truly good for the world, why don't militant atheists appear to be nice people? Atheist authors and others need to become their message. They need to behave good for people to accept their theories as good. One word of arrogance, sarcasm, or disrespect in a volume of 1 million words can easily discredit that entire volume. It will be relegated to the rubbish heap. That one word becomes the drop of poison that renders undrinkable the whole pot of water.Militant atheists often hurl sarcasm and condescending, myopically narrow arguments again spirituality. They are sometimes war mongers as much as the fundamentalists. This is in stark contrast to the intellectually honest atheist or skeptic. Some of my friends are from these groups and they are very kind people who respect the beliefs of others. As in religion, the fundamentalists spoil it for the majority, similarly it is the militants in atheism who spoil it for the rest.I doubt whether militant atheism is good for our world. Coyne himself admits that evolutionary theory cannot provide a basis for ethics.Full disclosure: I'm a peer-reviewed researcher on connections between ancient yoga and modern science as well as between ancient yoga and the Bible. ~ Sanjay C Patel, SanjayCPatel.com"

A little too much of trying to convince the skeptics rather than teaching those of us that already believe, but I did learn a lot of good stuff. Fun to read about whale evolution, as well as get an update on hominid evolution. Some of the arguments against the deniers are interesting. He often ends with the comment that if this was all done by divine intervention the creator surely went out of his/her way to make it look like everything evolved. "
174,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31565730-dalton,5,Here is a science book for people who don't like science or don't fully understand science. This compelling and engaging read is easy to digest yet is packed with information and Coyne manages to create a compelling and nearly air tight argument in favor of Darwinism as scientific fact and expels the notions surrounding the intellectually deficient creationism. Coyne's book is a master stroke that should be read by all for a better understand of ourselves and of all organisms. 
175,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15220227-vaishakh-ravi,5,"At a time when what's true is often conflated with what's repeated, many of us, surrounded by propaganda, primarily of a religious sort, remain unaware of how airtight the case for evolution is. Towards this, Jerry Coyne simply lays out the facts. Facts, that speak loudly on the ludicrousness of creationist ideas, even more so than the vitriolic commentary of the likes of Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens or Sam Harris. By doing so, this books earns a special place. Highly recommended."
176,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7961188-estela,4,"This book was not exactly what I thought it would be, but I’m glad that I read it. We all need a good brushing up on evolution and Darwin. This book does go beyond just stating facts. Coyne is more so having an intellectual conversation with readers, while pointing out what the critics say. He doesn’t try to refute every point he brings up and does go into depth with what creationists argue and how that isn’t completely wrong. Overall, definitely a well written book and overall great read."
177,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58914154-salah-eddine-bo,5,"One of the best books about evolution. I think the author made an amazing work by explaining the theory by using a simple language, the book is filled with clear illustrations and powerful examples that show why evolution is the best scientific theory we have so far to explain our origins. I highly recommend this book for anyone seeking to have a good understanding about the origin of our species. "

"
180,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2356657-jonathan,3,"I haven’t read too many books on evolution. Heck, I haven’t read many books the last four years, which is a significant regret for me, if understandable...So for me, this is a good overview on evolution.My main critique is his tone can be abrasive in places. I’m a Christian, I’m not a materialist, so I’m going to disagree with him there (Christianity doesn’t preclude the theory of evolution, materialism does preclude Christianity). Otherwise, it’s a decent book."
181,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16151791-nitin,5,"Excellent read for those who have read about evolution only in high school.One thing I would have liked better was if the author did not constantly try to convince creationists that evolution is true. Addressing them in first few pages is acceptable, but addressing them after every few pages is a bit redundant. Readers who read the book to the end are the ones inclined to know more about evolution, and not the ones who need convincing that it exists."
182,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15862910-steve-granger,5,"Possibly one of the most accessible and articulate books I've read on evolution by natural and sexual selection. A silver lining to this particular theory getting so much religious backlash is that we get books like this. While incredibly talented scientists have had to spend less time advancing their field of expertise, at least they can help bring the general population up to speed on what we know about life and its origins."
183,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35655787-ahmad,5,"Shocking, challenging to presupposition most people of blind faith have and brims with incontrovertible and insurmountable evidence.

184,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72620823-izzat-sabbah,5,"It's a superb book. It's a great starting book for anyone who doesn't have great knowledge on Evolution. Coyne really gives good and easy information with good examples on how the theory works by using scientific method practices done by paleontologists and biologists. He uses specific examples on how fossils, genes and geography led to the amount of biodiversity that we see today. "
185,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18378220-qiang-zhang,4,"Loved the way Coyne approached this topic: through a mix of curious facts and necessary speculations. Gave evolution a new perspective outside of reading mundane textbooks. The last chapter left room for speculation on currently unanswered questions in evolution, and I loved the way he addressed the moral, philosophical implications of this topic. "
186,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2674221-ken,4,"If you needed a scientist to connect the evolutionary dots for you, Coyne has done that well in this book. He clears up several common misconceptions regarding what evolution is and what it isn't. His writing style is easy and enjoyable to read, not at all like a scientific journal article. Recommended to those interested in the subject."

I've been reading this off and on for the past 6+ years and finally forced myself to finish it. I do not doubt the science and theories of evolution, but the writing style seemed to be more of here's why evolution works and ID does not. Not sure what I was looking for, but this wasn't it. I bought this based on a Coursera genetics class from Duke."

Fully certain I am going to read this again and again. Spiritual read."
190,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26702705-s-an-brazier,5,"One of the best non fiction books I've ever read. Full of things that made me stop and tell people, I was so amazed. The whole premise is that it's a rebuttal of creationism so I knew what I was getting into, but I already don't believe in that, so could have done without those bits. Really well written."
191,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107075814-honeybee26,3,"Was a decent read. I feel you definitely need to have some background knowledge on geology, paleontology or natural science.

192,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15198059-jennifer,4,"Very thorough. Lost one star due to the fact that much of the book seems to be focused on putting down and/or convincing Creationists. I 100% believe in evolution, and I believe in God. Somewhere in the middle it felt like I, as a religious believer, was being attacked. Still a wonderful and comprehensive explanation of evolution."
193,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87437106-majd-alkatreeb,5,"A very interesting and informative book providing many examples of evolution in plants, animals and humans in a simple language. Some explanations are accompanied by illustrations functioning as an extra aid for comprehending the facts stated.The book utilizes criticism on creationism, which is mainly based on religious beliefs, as a starting point for its evidence-based argumentation."
194,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1382242-valerie,4,"Mutations are changes in traits that already exists: they almost never create brand new features.This means evolution must build a new species starting with the design of its ancestors.Records in rocks confirm several predictions of evolutionary theory: gradual change within lineage, splitting of lineage, and the existence of transitional forms between very different types of organisms. These traditional forms occur in the fossil record precisely where they should. If evolution was not true, fossils would not occur in an order that makes evolutionary sense. Even a major sort of evolutionary change nearly always involves remodeling the old into the new. Natural selection can act only by changing what already exists.Different odors contain different combination of molecules , and each combination stimulates a different group of cells.All vertebrates begin developing in the same way, looking rather like an embryonic fish. The curious thing is that as our development proceeds, the change resembles an evolutionary sequence.During development the human embryo actually forms 3 kinds of kidneys, one after the other, with the first 2 discarded before our final kidney appears.Those transitory kidneys are similar to those we find in species that evolved before us.Around 6 months after conception, we becomes completely covered with fine, downy coat of hair called lanugo. It can be explained only as a remnant our primate ancestry: fetal monkeys also develop a coat of hair at about the same stage of development. Their hair, however, doesnt fall out, but hangs on to become that adult coat. And, like humans, fetal whales also have lanugo, a remnant of when their ancestors lived on land.As we evolved a big brain, the infants head became very large relative to the opening of the pelvis, which had to remain narrow to allow efficient bipedal walking.This compromise leads to the difficulties and enormous pain of human birth.'Species that live in similar habitats will experience similar selection pressures from their environment, so they may evolve similiar adaptations or converge, coming to look and behave very much alike even though they are unrelated.Mutation- accidental changes in the sequence of DNA that usually occurs as errors when the molecule is copied during cell division. Genetic variation generated by mutation is widespread: mutant forms of genes, for example, explain variation in human eye color, blood type, and much of our- and other species-variation in height, weight, biochemistry, and innumerable other traits.Mutations(errors in DNA replication) occur randomly-regardless of weather they would be useful to the individual. The useful ones are the raw material for evolution.Filtering of that variation by natural selection that produces adaptation. The unique combination of mutation and selection that tells us how organisms became adopted. Adaptations always increase the fitness of the individual, but not necessarily group or species.Reproduction, not survival determines which gene make it to the next generation and cause evolution.Genetic drift gets rid of harmful alleles and raises the frequency of beneficial ones.Animal species often have different mating displays or pheromones, and dont find one another sexually attractive.Species can be isolated by preferring a different habitat, so they simply don't encounter one another.Members of all species generally look and behave pretty much alike: because they all share genes, they respond in the same way to evolutionary forces.Different mutation affection male behaviors or traits could appear in different places.Sexual selection might then drive the population in different directions.Their mating preferences would prevent them from mixing genes, and they would be considered different species.Accidental by-products of genetic divergence, by natural selection or genetic drift. Their genomes become so different that, when they're put together in a hybrid, they just dont work well together.Species are evolutionary accidents.They are simply the inevitable result of generic barriers that arise when spatially isolated populations evolve in different directions.Fossils start off ape like but become more and more human like as time passes.In Roman times, some of the most sophisticated that ever existed found it an excellent afternoon's entertainment to sit and watch humans literally fight for their lives against each other, or against wild animals. There is now no culture on the planet that would not this this barbaric. Similarly, human sacrifice was once an important part of many societies. That too has thankfully disappeared.In many countries, the equality of men and women is now taken for granted. Richer nations are becoming more aware of their obligation to help, rather than exploit,poorer ones. We worry more about how we treat animals. None of this has anything to do with evolution, for the change is happening far too fast to be caused by our genes. It is clear,then, that whatever genetic heritage we have, it is not a straitjacket that traps us forever in the ""beastly"" ways of our forebears. Evolution tells us where we came from, not where we can go."

285,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5500087-shaun,5,"  With the amount of resistance that a solid and provable scientific theory gets in this country, one would think that we are still living in the religiously dogmatic medieval ages. This is partly why evolutionary Biologist, Dr. James Coyne set out to write this book. One of the main premises of Coynes work is to clear up any confusion that persists in the public eye concerning the natural evolution of species through the catalysts of natural selection and speciation.  With an accessible style, Coyne presents an overwhelming case for Evolution as being a demonstratable fact. Besides the amount of information that Coyne sets down before the reader, his ability to explain such complex topics with ease sets this book apart from the rest. It is delightful how Coyne can narrate all of the information without being unintelligibly abstract to the layman.   Throughout this work, Coyne demonstrates that evolutionary theory makes predictions that are consistently borne out by the data—basic requirements for a scientific theory to be valid. Although being respectful of those who promote intelligent design and creationism (i.e claims that each species, especially humans - are the product of a separate creative act by an intelligent designer ), Coyne uses the extensive scientific data at his disposal to demolish any thought that creationism is supported by any physical evidence, while also explaining why those ideas fall outside the bounds of science. Dr. Coyne does not hesitate from periodically pointing-out where it is most relevant that creationism simply offers no scientific explanation in attempting to refute Evolution, while dodging other ramifications .It is sometimes even humorous while reading Coyne presenting many examples of physical proofs that are employed to clarify a concept - to suddenly find it pitted against creationism and how it tries to argue with the presented information. It is refreshing to see Coyne demonstrating the flaws in these creationist viewpoints or objections not with rhetoric, but with well chosen evidence. . .For example - One of the myths about evolution that Coyne dispells is the claim that there are lots of ""gaps"" in the fossil record to explain how complex organs such as the eye or wings of a bird can evolve by natural selection, or that there are irreducible gaps between species of animals that are supposed to have evolved from the other. Coyne finds no problem in citing the numerous cases of transitional fossils that have been found (such as the fish-terapod link), which do bridge the irreducible gaps that the creationist critics of evolution have asserted could never be bridged. Coyne does this repeatedly when addresses human evolution in particular, and shows how the fossilized bones of hominin ancestors fit perfectly into the predicted intermediate forms. features accessible chapters on: - What evolution is, and is not (specific defining features, testability, etc.) - The fossil record (including specific examples and discussion of transitional forms and lineages (dinosaur feathers, whales, etc).- Specific predictions of Evolution and their fulfillment's - Vestigial and atavistic features (e.g. human tails and appendices, and whale pelvises and dolphin legs) - Examples of ""Bad design"" which renders the concept of an ""intelligent designer"" absurd (e.g. flat fish skulls and eyes, and the route of the vagus nerve in humans, as well as problems with both genders' reproductive systems) - Developmental oddities (e.g. dolphin embryos beginning growth of hind legs that are later changed, human embryonic growth and subsequent absorption of tails, as well as the growth and loss of a full coat of hair).- Pseudogenes - Biogeography- Specific examples of evolution in action, both in nature and in the lab (via natural selection)- Genetic drift - Artificial selection (e.g. domestic dogs, agriculture, etc).- Speciation  Coyne is also clear (in his final chapter; Evolution redux) of the limits to evolutionary thinking. . .This is where Coyne directly addresses the concept often advanced by religious fundamentalists that an acceptance of evolution must lead to immorality, concluding that evolution tells us where we came from, not where we can go. By the end of the book the basic areas of evolutionary investigation clearly demonstrate that the material evidence confirms evolution, not creationism/ID. Readers looking to understand the case for evolution and searching for an truthful response to many of the most common creationist claims should find everything they need in this book, which is clearer and more comprehensive than the many others on the subject that I had read in the past. With Coynes consistently using elegant simplicity and beauty of Evolution to speak for itself, ""Why Evolution is True"" is arguably the best general-interest reference book on the scientific evidence for evolution currently in print. "
286,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7320790-rob-bottass,5,"Coyne lays out the extensive evidence for evolution while noting not all questions have been answered. In fact, science is founded on the need to question, a process that will never end until human beings are extinct. Meanwhile, questions about morality, purpose and ethics are left in the cold; they lie outside the domain of science. Plan to reread this a few more times to let it all sink in."
287,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56665597-shilpa-nagarajan,4,Great book to capture all aspects of evolution into digestible chapters. Initially read this the summer after high school but recently re-read it with my husband (who is not a biologist) to ease him into understanding my world (biology).

288,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7470861-ali,5,"A book for anyone who believe in evolution, but simply wants to have a good complete picture of the various evidence that make it as close as it can be to a Scientific fact, than a theory (as the author spends a good bit of the first chapter explaining).I can't recall ever doubting evolution myself; however, I always wondered what I will have to say if an instance ever comes where I need to highlight or describe why evolution is true.. well luckily I found this book and it is a fantastic source on this topic, explaining in detail the many aspects that prove evolution. These range from vestigial biological features (why is there evidence of leg bones in whales?), the genetic code record (how many proteins in different species can still be traced to common ancestral ones), and of course most convincingly: the fossil record! Highly recommended"
289,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978482-nour-elhofy,5,This is my second book in evolution theory 
290,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1584391-john,4,"Coyne writes from both a scientific and an historical reference frame believing as he does that evolution is not just a theory but has been amply proven as a fact. In this he has shown his passion for evolution as an explanation for the origin of life. So, although he assures us that science is self-correcting, I am left with an impression that: If we swim out far enough, there is no way to swim back. We invest too much time and effort into a theory, too much reasoning that we cannot find the emotional and intellectual resources to change. The study of creationism vs. evolution represent to me a labyrinth where taking the wrong path might lead to becoming lost forever in the maze of a logic that directs us even deeper into it.I say all this as a word of advice to all readers. Be prepared to think—and to think for yourself! Among the many threads of thought within the book, follow the feathers:what feathers evolved from is even more mysterious . The best guess is that they derive from the same cells that give rise to reptilian scales, but not everyone agrees. Despite the unknowns, we can make some guesses about how natural selection fashioned modern birds. (p. 46).While we may speculate about the details, the existence of transitional fossils— and the evolution of birds from reptiles —is fact. (p. 47). So why did some species lose their ability to fly? We’re not absolutely sure (p. 58). Coyne admits that his evidence is built on an arrangement of fossils which he maintains also lines up with radiometric dating which leaves him comfortable with still a growing list of questions as to how this all fits together.not every feature of an ancestor’s embryo appears in its descendants, nor do all stages of development unfold in a strict evolutionary order.... Now, we’re not absolutely sure why some species retain much of their evolutionary history during development. (p. 78). But the facts ... remain, and make sense only in light of evolution. (p. 79). [not creationism also?] He argues that evolution which is in some aspects random has the right to make a' bad' design but argues that creationism wouldn't because its designer is thought to be—well—intelligent. (ID) Of all his examples, the one alone that gave me pause (as a creationist) was ... demonstrating evolution. We have three muscles under our scalp that attach to our ears. In most individuals they’re useless, but some people can use them to wiggle their ears.... in humans the muscles are good only for entertainment. (p. 62). Coyne proceeds to explain the evolutionary process on Oceanic Islands arguing for the absence of trees. But he adds without explanation:(The coconut palm, with its large, buoyant seeds, is a notable exception, occurring on almost all Pacific and Indian Ocean islands.) (p. 105)These are examples of—and I give Coyne credit for his honest reporting here—remaining mystery gaps in the evolutionary process. Why did whales return to the water? Good question for the evolutionist? Coyne raises it without answer. A few chapters deal with microevolution which creationists will attest to. These are easy and enjoyable reading.And most interestingly, Coyne devotes an entire chapter to sex. It is worth a reflective moment:Why hasn’t the cost of sex led to its replacement by parthenogenesis? Clearly, sex must have some huge evolutionary advantage that outweighs its cost. Although we haven’t yet figured out exactly what that advantage is, there’s no shortage of theories. (p. 155).All I can say is: Thank God!!!Well, parts of his work necessarily get technical. Keep WIKI and Google handy. This is a review and not the place for any more of my rebuttal. Coyne talks about BSC as the main model for evolutionary theory which is based on reproduction and reproductive barriers as a by-product of that process.Much he does not say about dating rocks or strata even given the fossils we do have, why, for example, we have found no human coprolite as yet.Evolutionary biology is teeming with questions and controversies. (p. 223). All in all it was a good read but excuse me if I now decide to read someone who sees the same facts as concluding creationism."

It wasn't horrible, and I loved that it acted as my textbook and costed $20 and not $200, but it's not the type of book that I enjoy reading. I'm just not super into non-fiction.

292,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58098904-emi,4,Great book that nicely compiles all of the evidence present for evolution. Made me laugh more than I thought it would. Highly recommend to anyone wishing to increase their understanding of evolution.
293,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4626387-linda,5,"I don't have any trouble believing in evolution - not even human evolution. I'm not sure why; maybe my world view is tolerant and reasonable; maybe I ""evolved"" (!) that way. But I have a very hard time with people who are totally assured that it is wrong and couldn't have happened.So there was actually no reason for me to read this book. It was mentioned as a major ""read"" for a genetics class I'm about to take on Coursera so I picked it up and became fascinated.Coyne isn't interested in emotion or in demonizing creationists. He has a hard time understanding them as well but understands that, to them, human evolution appears to take the ""specialness"" out of humans. To him and to me, having evolved to the point that we have literature, art, music, foreign languages, high life expectancy, the ability to perform science and understand much of our world makes us MUCH more special than having been created as the pinnacle of God's creation. Look what came out of the breaking off of species of the apes!!!!!!Of course there is always the argument that believing in human evolution means that, automatically, we are given free rein to have no morals, no compassion, to be animalistic in our behavior (anyone for saying that women have a system in their bodies to make sure they don't get pregnant from rape - thereby assuming it's all right to rape them?), etc. etc. But since human evolution is true, and nothing of the sort has happened, then why should it suddenly happen now, rather than 100, 1,000, or 10,000 years ago?Anyhow. Coyne's book is fantastically written in ""human"" rather than ""scientist"" fashion and introduces some items I hadn't known before. I'm well acquainted with the fact that human embryos go through stages where they very much resemble a fish, a reptile, other mammals, etc. But I was NOT familiar with the fact that humans also go through a state of ""lanugo"" - a fine, hairy coat of fur. It occurs in the human fetus at about 6 months after conception, exactly the point of development that it occurs in primates. However, ours disappears and theirs stays.Also, if we were created in God's image, he must not have been as omnipotent as we think he is. Otherwise, we would not have our twisty larynx nerve. It descends from the brain, parallel to the vagus nerve, then cuts over and goes UNDER the aorta and then back up to the larynx. Pretty stupid design I'd say. He also would have an appendix which appears to have no function, so why should he give it to us? And, as a male, his testes would have originated in his abdomen but then moved down through the inguinal canals to the scrotum, leaving weak spots in the body wall that are particularly susceptible to hernias that can obstruct the intestine and sometimes cause death.And what designer (other than a man) would have designed a child's head almost too big to emerge from the birth canal, offering so much pain (and sometimes damage and death) to the mother giving birth? (Remember how large the percentage of mortality from childbirth was as recently as 100 years ago.) Why not create this nice little area in the abdomen where you could just unlock a little door and the baby would pop out, pain free?Not all of Coyne's book is devoted to humans and the parts on evolution in general are just as fascinating. Evolution can only go forward, so only features that existed in the ancestor can be modified. No new structure can be tacked on. Eyes must develop from former types of light detecting organs; lungs must develop from some sort of gill or lung-like structure that converted oxygen to something its possessor could use for existence. I knew that but had never articulated it and looked it straight in the face.If you're interested at all in the science of evolution, rather than just the debate between evolutionists and creationist, read this. You'll come away with a much better understanding, and appreciation, of evolution."
294,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11462400-chris-jaffe,4,"The title gives this one away. He notes that yes, it’s a theory – but that doesn’t mean it’s simply some idea someone thought up. Instead, it’s some idea that someone thought up and has been confirmed by tons of evidence over the years. Heck, when Darwin came up with his theory, we had a very spotty fossil record (at best) – including pretty much none on humans. But since then we’ve found fossils, and they almost always seem to bare out what’s expected. For instance, scientists had an idea of a fish that looked like was pre-amphibian from 370 million years ago, and fossils of amphibians from 350 million years ago – so they looked in rocks from 360 million years ago and found a fish with a neck and fins that were nearly proto-limbs (and could breath some air) that was descended from the 370 million years ago fish. We have DNA evidence – and that backs it up. We have an idea of how evolution works: it’s when two strands of the same species get separated. For instance: Panama was created 3 million years ago, and on each side of it are 7 types of shrimp – 14 species in all – but their most similar species is the one ACROSS the isthmus. What’s more, on islands a little separated, you find species that are a little apart. The longer an island has been separated, the more distinct and different evolution is upon it. Creationsists just ignore this evidence. So you get marsupulas dominate in Australia, which has been on its own for a while. (Actually, it’s even stranger than that – the first fossils are in South America, but they crossed over during the supercontinent era – but the fossils show damn definite difference over time). Evolution is a theory – in the same way that gravity and relativity are theories (or atomic theory). He even notes that many creationists will accept microevolution, as we have clear evidence of that (most notably in animals we breed, like horses and dogs). He even notes how the eye evolved step-by-step. Scientists reckon it took 400,000 years. He’ll also go after some creationist claims. One popular creationist speaker mocks how the whale is related to the cow. Well guess what? Go step by step and it is. Some animals revert back to the water – and the hippo is a possible in-between stage. He also attacks intelligent design by noting how often its unintelligent. Turtles who bury their eggs sure would be better off with fins that could bury a lot better (especially since their exposed when burying eggs). A lot of our DNA is junk DNA that serves us no purpose anymore. The appendix – how is that intelligent for us? Lots of people died from that before modern medicine. For that matter, if is intelligent design – why have most species died out? How is that intelligent? Why do some cave fish still have eyeballs? Why do whales still have some bones that would’ve been hip-bones in their land days (and why do some still get an occasional limb coming out? – It’s dead DNA). Coyne notes that the fetus stage is full of evidence of evolution, including one spot where the fetus gets hairy. (Pediotrians know this, but they typically don’t realize the evolution connection). Creationists argue that if we can’t see a new species evolve over its lifetime, then evolution isn’t real. But this is fatuous – it’s like saying because we haven’t seen a star go through its lifecycle, then stars don’t evolve. Or that languages don’t evolve because we haven’t seen a new one emerge from scratch. We have evidence of evolution in humans. Lucy is ape from the neck-up, in the middle she’s a mixture, and from the waist down – almost a modern human. (This shows biped came before brain). "
295,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/344179-brendan,4,"I follow the evolution / ID culture war pretty closely, but it occurred to me a while back that I had very little actual understanding of the science behind evolution. After reading Coyne’s book, I realize that I had more than I knew I did, but that I was missing a lot. Why Evolution is True demonstrates with strong clarity why evolution has proven itself to scientists as broadly and throughly as gravity. Unlike Miller’s Only a Theory, which focuses specifically on creationist arguments and why they’re bogus, Coyne explores evolution from the perspective of “how has this convinced us,” and he does so thoroughly. A few fun facts and good quotes: * Evolution depends on six concepts: “evolution, gradualism, speciation, common ancestry, natural selection, and nonselective mechanisms of evolutionary change.” Coyne explains each. * Whales descended from land animals. Their closest living relative is the hippo. They have hip and leg bones and occasionally one will be born with a leg. * The number of spots on the male peacock helps determine how sexy he is to the female peacock. One theory about this is that evolution to appreciate a certain color for unrelated reasons leads to sexual selection. Coyne writes “Suppose, for example, that members of a species had evolved a visual preference for red color because that preference helped them locate ripe fruits and berries. If a mutant male appeared with a patch of red on his breast, he might be preferred by females simply because of this preexisting preference.” (167) In other words, the females would select males because they look tasty. * The lineage of ape to human evolution is astonishingly well defined. The “hobbit” species, Homo floresiensis, an offshoot protected from worldwide species evolution by geographic barriers, lived as recently as 18,000 years ago. * The best argument against intelligent design is the bad design we find throughout complex life forms. By contrast, if we follow clues to explain development of one trait through adaptation from another, most of these bad designs make sense.One extended quote I really like. [Creationists argue:] that all the perceived evils of evolution come from two worldviews that are part of science: naturalism and materialism. Naturalism is the view that the only way to understand our universe is through the scientific method. Materialism is the idea that the only reality is the physical matter of the universe, and that everything else, including thoughts, will, and emotions, comes from physical laws acting on matter. The message of evolution, and all of science, is one of naturalistic materialism. Darwinism tells us that, like all species, human beings arose from the working of blind, purposeless forces over eons of time. As far as we can determine, the same forces that gave rise to ferns, mushrooms, lizards, and squirrels also produced us. Now, science cannot completely exclude the possibility of supernatural explanation. It is possible– though very unlikely—that our whole world is controlled by elves. But supernatural explanations like these are never needed: we manage to understand the natural world just fine using reason and materialism. Furthermore, supernatural explanations always mean the end of inquiry: that’s the way God wants it, end of story. Science, on the other hand, is never satisfied: our studies of the universe will continue until humans go extinct."
296,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5275479-elise,4,"This is a neat little package of the most fundamental ideas within evolutionary theory. It might make you a little bit teary because it's so beautiful, but that might have been just me! It is accessible (to those who want to learn about it) and covers a lot of ground. I'm a layperson. I appreciate books like this and The Selfish Gene (which was the most straightforward explanation for me) for all their simplicity, even though those more well-versed in the field can pick out where they go astray. I couldn't shake that uncomfortable feeling, however, whenever the beauty of what was being described to me was constantly set alongside creationist arguments. I kept thinking, I'm already onboard! You don't need to proselytize me. It's cool! This book is trying to make a social statement, not just invite people to consider evolutionary theory on its own. I understand that in this way it is reactionary, cautioning against the ignorance of favouring ""creationist"" arguments in spite of the evidence. To be sure, it's pretty messed up that a textbook like On Pandas and People can disguise itself as a scientific resource while harbouring decidedly non-scientific ideas, be they true or false. As far as I can reason, religion and science are two separate domains.I guess what I mean to say is that if I could have written this book, as angry as I would be about religious politics and all the crap that blurs peoples' vision of the evidence, I wouldn't want to isolate such people as an audience. For all the talk in the final chapters about common human traits and our use of symbolic language, our love of the arts, etc, is it so degrading that some of us search for meaning in the supernatural? Why do science and religion have to construct a war against one another, as if they couldn't be two different and equally valid realms of human experience and activity? I would have liked the tone to be more sympathetic and straight-foward, instead of isolating all creationists. We are intelligent creatures; there must be many believers who are looking to reconcile their religion with what they see to be a compelling truth. It's not cool to be all like ""This is the way forward! All you fools are living in a delusion!""That being said, I still can't figure out if my criticism is valid or not. Coyne does, after all, take the position that science and religion should be separate. What he really questions is the way in which religious politics are encroaching on science, and how it may be holding us back from teaching amazing things to children. Evolution is enlightening. I think it can teach us to be kind to one another. It humbles us to smithereens. It grounds us right in this impossible moment, alive and heart beating. It lets us know that it's okay to feel whatever we feel - nothing is personal anymore! For me, reading books like this is a religious experience. I think there is more going on in religion that mere superstition and staunchness. And I am totally off track. Sorry about that.Also, I think it was cool that Coyne recognises his book is not going to change anything the way he wants it to. It's not a lack of evidence that prevents people from accepting evolutionary theory or at least considering it. He addresses this in the last chapter, and it's rather good."

As I said with Dawkins’ The Greatest Show On Earth, I don’t see how anyone could walk away from this book NOT believing in evolution, unless they’re incredibly biased or simply don’t understand the information being provided. Coyne really covers all of his bases with this book, it’s brilliant.The most damning (and interesting) evidence in this book that was new to me was the chapter on embryology. I have three children, I’ve had ultrasounds with all of them in the early stages, I’d heard and seen things like the yolk sac, but never even thought about what that meant. These are things that are around us every day and yet we don’t see them! Coyne did a wonderful job explaining the things we’re not seeing, and doing so in a way that almost anyone could understand.Another chapter I found incredibly interesting was the chapter on biogeography. Again, the distribution of animals is something we see around us every day, but probably don’t think much about. Coyne explains how animals are distributed in a way that only makes sense with evolution, and as with embryology, in a way that almost anyone could understand. A great quote from this chapter, ""The biogeographic evidence for evolution is now so powerful that I have never seen a creationist book, article, or lecture that has tried to refute it. Creationists simply pretend that the evidence doesn't exist.""I really recommend this book to everyone. Creationists, so maybe they can see what they’ve been missing (or because I believe if you’re going to say you don’t believe in something, you should at least understand it well enough to say WHY you don’t believe it) and evolutionists, just to add to their understanding.Something to note, I see a lot of reviewers complaining that he's ""bickering"" with the creationist view. My Genetics and Evolution class had an interview with Jerry Coyne and he stated the reason he wrote this book was because text books no longer talk about WHY evolution is true, they simply assume you already know it. He always has to start the first few lectures of his classes convincing students that there is, in fact, ample evidence for evolution. He wrote this book because there are too many people out there that don't believe in evolution (as of 2012, approx 46% of the US population believed God created humans in their present form) and he assumed this was because of ignorance. With that being said, it makes complete sense as to why he would be comparing his evolutionary facts to the lies creationists try to spread. This book is made to convince people of evolution, not for people who already know evolution is a fact. Creationists are the people he is trying to convince! Part of convincing is comparison and showing why the other side is wrong as well as providing evidence as to why your side is right. How can you convince them if you don't show them the lies and propaganda they've been spoon fed their entire lives are not true? Personally I find his creationist statements to be just that, statements. He's neither aggressive nor rude, it's definitely not attacking... Maybe creationists are just offended because it's not what they want to hear or believe?"
298,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83858566-devon-deraad,5,Great read. Covers clearly but carefully everything you need to know about evolution to have an informed opinion. Even ends with a bit of optimism.
299,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875081-arvind-balasundaram,5,"In this deeply passionate account of evolution, scientist Jerry Coyne provides a wonderful and lucid argument for why a spate of mounting evidence, both confirmatory and predictive, lay claims for major tenets of evolution to be no longer tossed around as a ""theory"" but to be considered as ""fact"". Coyne begins with outlining the six fundamental tenets of evolutionary theory:(1) the idea of evolution - a species undergoes genetic change over time(2)gradualism - substantial evolutionary change takes many generations to produce(3) speciation - splitting occurs in evolving chains that creates multiple species(4) common ancestry - we can always look back in time and find descendants joining at their ancestors(5) the idea of natural selection - the nonrandom, differential reproduction of alleles (particular forms of mutated genes) from one generation to the next, and (6) processes other than natural selection that can cause evolutionary change, like genetic drift in populationsHe then provides evidence from multiple domains - the fossil record, biogeography, embryology, vestigial structures (a feature of a species that was an adaptation in its ancestors, but has lost its usefulness now or been co-opted for some unrelated use, like ostrich wings), atavisms (anomalies that look like the appearance of an ancestral trait, like some babies born with a tail), dead genes (the GLO pseudogene for Vitamin C production completely inactive in the human genome)and poor design (the recurrent laryngeal nerve, for example). All this evidence, argues Coyne, shows conclusively that organisms have evolved. Throughout this book, the author provides examples of predictions that scientists made about the likely course evolution would take, only to have evidence uncovered many years later that proved them right - notable examples include the discovery of the early land fish Tiktaalik and the discovery of marsupials in Antartica.The main takeaway here is that the main tenets of Darwinism are continuously being verified with scientific advances in related fields like genetics, molecular embryology, etc. Why then, Coyne asks, is there continued ambiguity about these tenets, though the very same folks accept the existence of electrons and black holes, although these notions are also removed from everyday experience? He makes the argument, rather convincingly, that this is because the ""naturalism"" of evolution gets erroneously extended to the domain of ethics and morality...that somehow the ""selfishness"" of Dawkins' The Selfish Gene provided a legitimacy to all selfish behaviors, which is misplaced. In the last chapter, Coyne makes his case of why it is important to separate the purposeless, materialistic way in which evolution operates from the notion that our lives have no purpose. Religious or secular thought, he argues, can assist in framing our purposes, meaning and morality.This book is a must-read. Most importantly, it reinvigorates in the reader the wonder of the universe and its myriad processes, and provides a brilliant and systematic account of how the scientific endeavor has helped us make empirical sense of it.."
