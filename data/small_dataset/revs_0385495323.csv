In fact, it goes one step further than present day, and gives us a look at what the future may hold in this field. The author writes about what could have been quite a dry subject with such enthusiasm and in such an engaging way that one can’t help but be drawn in. Before reading this book, I only had a very rudimentary knowledge of cryptography and am very much the layman. Singh explains things so well that you don’t need any prior knowledge of the subject to tackle this book; if I can understand it, anybody can! I’ll definitely be reading more of his work in the future. Some of the topics covered here aren’t technically concerned with codes and codebreaking, but deal with the translation of ancient texts such as hieroglyphics. Ancient dead languages aren’t codes, as such, because they weren’t created with the intention of concealing the contents; quite the opposite, in fact; but they are relevant in that some of the techniques are shared with codebreaking. These chapters actually make for really interesting reading, so it’s a welcome diversion and one that Singh weaves into the rest of the book seamlessly. Be warned, though; reading this book will make you want to delve deeper into the subject matter. Fortunately, the author provides a further reading list at the end of the book, so there are plenty of future delights in store! P.S. If you actually went to the effort of decoding this review, you get a gold star. An imaginary gold star, but still… (hide spoiler)]"
1,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1219700-jim,5,"The Code Book is like geek porn. Explanations of the theories behind cryptography are woven together with anecdotes of times when code-making or code-breaking was integral to historical events. Singh strikes an excellent balance with this book. The clarity of his writing makes the explanations of the mathematics of cryptography very straightforward without dumbing them down, and the historical connections are always fascinating.Personally, my favorite part was the section devoted to the role cryptography played in World War II. The cracking of the Enigma at Bletchley Park was probably one of the greatest moments in nerd history.If you're fascinated by puzzles, curious about history, or you want to know what privacy really means in the 21st century, pick up this book. You'll have a hard time putting it down."
2,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"Coming on 20 years after the book was written, it’s still quite awesome despite all our subsequent advances in cryptography.Or rather, I should say, we’re still living in the same world already transformed by pretty good encryption. The methods for breaking the security still falls in the same category as usual: interception. Of course, the means of interception has gotten amazingly good and creative as hell, but that isn’t the primary scope of this book. Rather, it’s about an awesome crash course in the history of encryption from the Middle Ages or earlier, say Roman or Greek, all the way forward to mechanical solutions a-la Babbage and right into the thrilling good stuff of WW2, including Turing and the awesome Code Talkers. The advances since then are almost stunningly fascinating, however, and aside from Zimmerman’s courageous advent of PGP, the REST of the story may well be trapped under National Security blankets still. Alas. What I wouldn’t give to get a backstage pass to those goings-on. :)Well written, accessible, and rather thorough, this book remains one of the best books on encryption for laypersons. Highly recommended."
3,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus,2,"PEARL RULED (p79)The development of the telegraph, which had driven a commercial interest in cryptography, was also responsible for generating public interest in cryptography. The public became aware of the need to protect personal messages of a highly sensitive nature, and if necessary they would use encryption, even though this took more time to send, thus adding to the cost of the telegram.When I awoke from my coma, I realized: 1) sesquipedalian verbiage needs must be read while fresh and hale, 2) I don't care as much as I thought I would, 3) hot Spring afternoon sunshine feels good.Also, I might not be as smart as I thought I was. The graphs and tables preceding this page caused me to whimper and curl into a fetal ball. Ahead (I peeked) were *entire*pages* of comma-separated numbers. That is unconscionable. It is a replay of Tau Zero, the SF novel with equations in it, that I could not even bring myself to hurl at a wall I was so paralyzed by outraged betrayal at picking up a novel to discover 

EQUATIONS

 in it.Keep your filthy math out of my fiction!Anyway, this book. It's non-fiction so there's no reason to be sniffy about numbers and junk, right? Sorta right. I need something to give me the will to drag myself over the glass shards atop the bed of coals and in this read there wasn't anything at stake from moment to moment. Overall, yes; secrecy/privacy is a major part of the online world both in its presence and absence. But in this book the stakes are abstract and waaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy above my li'l punkin haid.I'll keep it in case it calls to me this winter. Now, no."
4,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22189980-belhor,5,By far the best and the most interesting book on the subject. recommended to anyone interested in Cryptography and its history. I read it in three days mainly because I couldn't put it down. 
5,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1969876-stefan-kanev,5,"I recently watched The Imitation Game, which left such a bad taste in my mouth, that I wanted to clean it up with something in a similar subject. Having read two of Sighn's other books, I picked this one.I had high expectations and it met them nicely. The book tells the story of ciphers and encryption through history – from what the Greek and the Romans did, through the Enigma, and finally to RSA. The style is very easy and pleasant to read, everything is pretty understandable even if you don't have a math background (sometimes to the point of being slightly inaccurate) and there are a lot of interesting stories inbetween.This book has a single downside – it's so pleasant and easy to read, that you'll be done with it in no time. Highly recommended."
6,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,5,"I haven’t had this much gleeful delight in a book in a long time. This book is pure fun. It’s not fast reading necessarily, and requires some active engagement to keep up, but man, it is a blast. If you read a lot of spy books as a child, or if you’re secretly jealous when there’s a cipher to be solved in a TV or movie plot and a character says,“Yeah, I can totally crack this if I have a few hours, let me get to work,” you’re going to love this. Singh introduces us to famous historical ciphers and codes, as well as the basic principles underlying code making and code breaking- you actually get a fairly solid foundation on understanding how to build and crack most classic ciphers. --------------CODES AND CIPHERS--------------Some examples of interesting codes this book unpacks and deconstructs with you: -Transposition. Substitution. Superencipherment.-Caesar shift ciphers. -The Vigenere square cipher. -The Great Cipher of Louis XIV. -The as-yet-unsolved Beale cypher. -The ADFGVX cipher. -The Zimmerman telegraph cipher. -The one-time pad cipher (aka a Vigenere cipher where the keyword is a random string of letters, at least as many as are in the text to be enciphered- which is inherently un-decipherable by cryptanalysis. But which of course requires both the message writer and receiver to have a copy of the random key, which makes it vulnerable to discovery. Plus it’s expensive to constantly create brand-new random keys for hundreds of messages a day). -Navajo code-talking. -All the way on up to quantum cryptography, which in theory at least is an uncrackable cipher. ---------------CRYPTANALYSIS---------------For me, the real genius comes into play here, in cryptanalysis- the deciphering of all those nasty little devils. Some memorable moments in cryptanalysis history:-Al-Kindi’s method of deciphering by analyzing the message in terms of letter frequency, or looking for unusual letter pairings (in English, Q is basically always followed by U so if you find a particular letter that is never followed by anything but another particular letter, that’s probably Q and U). -Bazeries’ method of deciphering the Great Cipher of Louis XIV by analyzing by syllable frequency rather than letter.-Charles Babbage (who, incidentally, invented the prototype of a computer way back in the 1700s) invented a method of deciphering the Vigenere cipher. First, you look for repeated sequences of letters- words that are repeated, and which happened to have gotten encrypted the same way because they land on a multiple of the number of letters the key has. You count the spaces in between those words, and draw up a chart with all the different repeated word sequences and the factors that go into those spaces (e.g. factors of 20 would include 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20- but you wouldn’t use just 1 letter for a keyword, so it can’t be that). Find the number that's a factor common to ALL of the repeated letter sequences, and you know the number of letters in the key word. Then you look at the letters the first letter of the keyword would be used to encrypt and use frequency analysis on *that*. [I’m not explaining this well, but Singh does, and it’s so brilliant it makes your ears wiggle.] -The deciphering of the ancient script known as Linear B by Alice Kober and Michael Ventris. -------------MODERN CRYPTOGRAPHY-------------Cryptography can basically be credited with the invention of computers. Furthermore, cryptographers are the reason you can send encrypted messages that nobody but the receiver can access, and the reason you can buy things over the Internet without people taking you credit card information. I have a BlackBerry, so I feel like I’m supposed to be a slick techie who knows what encryption is, but I’ve never heard it explained as straightforwardly as this book:Alice wants to send Bob a letter and she doesn’t want the postal service workers to be able to read it. Obviously, she can’t just send it in a padlocked iron lock-box, because she has no way of securely giving Bob a key. So what can she do? She puts the letter in the iron box, padlocks it, mails it to him. He puts his own padlock on it- the box now has two padlocks- and sends it back to her. Now Alice removes her own padlock and sends the box, locked with Bob’s own padlock, back to him. He removes his padlock and reads the letter. That way, the box is never unlocked, but Alice and Bob don’t have to find a way to exchange keys. (This would be especially problematic if the key has to be different for every message or device, the way it is in technology). Then there's the asymmetrical public key encryption system designed by Diffie, where Alice has a “public key” that allows anyone to encrypt a message to her, but cannot be decrypted by the same key- it can only be decrypted by another key, the private key to which only Alice has access. So Bob could “look up” Alice’s public key, which is known to everyone, encrypt his message to her, and she can decrypt it. In the padlock scenario, this would mean Bob would go to the post office, take an “Alice padlock,” of which there are many copies, lock the box with his message inside, and mail it to her. Only Alice holds the key that can unlock this, so the system is secure. ---------------CONCLUSIONS---------------This is just such a cool book, an absolute ride. I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't have at least a little fun with it. It's accessible, it's interesting, it's challenging, and it's an unusual read. Not a bad thing to say about this one."
7,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6015709-pallavi-gambhire,5,"I never thought I'd love a book about mathematics, or ever see the beauty of mathematics. My mother was definitely right when she kept pestering me to work harder on my math and argued that it was EVERYWHERE! (I had argued back saying I would be fine as long as I could perform the basic calculations!)Maybe this is what growing up is about!That being said, this is a very informative book about the past, present and future of cryptography. Singh takes us on a journey from ancient times where simple communications and hence simple codes sufficed, through a series of unfortunate events that resulted in the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,to a time in the future when quantum cryptography might prevail. My favorite part is when he talks about the decipherment of Linear B (which led me to another amazing book of the same name), an ancient language discovered in the remains of a palace in Crete. Oh, and he also makes the Second World War seem interesting in an entirely differently way. Singh has a knack for explaining ideas and theories, which might seem mundane if explained by someone else, in a very interesting manner. His use of characters called Alice,Bob and Eve to explain the codes, made it easy for a layperson like me to understand the theory behind them.He even adds a few ciphers for us to decipher at the end. I must admit I skipped over those pages, but might return to them at some point in the future.I recommend this book to anyone who is fascinated by ancient history, linguistics, cryptography, quantum physics, OR MATHEMATICS!"
8,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31537194-john-meo,5,"This is a fascinating introduction to the world of cryptography. It has opened my eyes to a whole new subject that interests me, and now I have spent many hours attempting to create a machine that can decrypt hidden messages. It is a wonderful and gripping tale of the history of cryptography, and presents the entire plot as a battle between the code makers and the code breakers. I was never left a little bored at parts as I occasionally am during non-fiction books because it is a continuous story that flows throughout the pages. It keeps you in suspense over the fate of the queen of Scotland, the behind-the-scenes intelligence conflict in the midst of World War II, and the secret of the Beale treasure. For anyone interested in the matter, it is a must read, and for anyone who think they might enjoy the subject, I highly suggest it.The history contained in this near-novel doesn't merely end a long time ago, but extends up to the very present, and discusses the exciting possibilities of cryptography in the future. Quantum computers and qubits enter the scene, hopefully presenting the holy grail of code-making, letting the code makers win the struggle forever. Our modern lives lay on the foundation of the public and private key system, including everything from the internet to checks. The only reason you are capable having your own private account in security is that complex math is occurring behind the scenes, multiplying two prime numbers hundreds of digits long so that any computer would take the lifetime of the universe to decode the messages you send. If you want to understand our modern age, you should definitely read this book."
9,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493714-cindy,5,"This is a *must* read before reading Cryptonomicon. Or maybe after, like I did. If you at all feel uncomfortable in your knowledge of one time pad cyphers, public/private keys, or the importance of really good cryptography for average folks, please read this book! It's sadly a bit out of date, but Singh does such a brilliant job of methodically building up the complexity in cyphers though history, that you will inevitably learn a ton."
10,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17945431-hristina,4,"Read for the Reading Without Walls challenge, for 'a topic you don't know much about'. And even though I didn't finish it in a week, CHALLENGE COMPLETE.I really enjoyed The Code Book. The explanations were well-done, and the history lessons amazed me, which is odd because I'm not a history fan. I learned a lot about codes and ciphers and how they work, and that was the best part of it all. I liked the writing, so I think I might pick up another Simon Singh book in the future."

Standardization of encryption - today's popular encryption mechanisms - DES and RSA 5. Future with quantum computing - explanation is crystal clear to help someone who is new to quantum mechanics.6. Most interesting part - knowing and understanding all the great persons involved in making and breaking the code.7. Details on the never ending race between non-breakable code and mechanism to defy all encryption. 8. Interesting background stories - Mary Queen of Scots, Man in the Iron Mask, Arab's frequency analysis, Creation (and breaking) of German Enigma, Bletchley Park, Navajo code, Rosetta stone, Zimmermann's PrettyGoodPrivacy, formation of laws ""against"" strong encryption.8. A whole load of many more interesting conceptsIf not for world war and the quest to decode the enemies thoughts, we wouldn't have the luxury of computers way ahead of its time.Whether the same will be true for Quantum computers? I think so…Interesting quotes:""Cryptography used to be an obscure science, of little relevance to everyday life. Historically, it always had a special role in military and diplomatic communications. But in the Information Age, cryptography is about political power, and in particular, about the power relationship between a government and its people. It is about the right to privacy, freedom of speech, freedom of political association, freedom of the press, freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, freedom to be left alone.""""The fundamental question is whether or not governments should legislate against cryptography. Cryptographic freedom would allow everyone, including criminals, to be confident that their e-mails are secure. On the other hand, restricting the use of cryptography would allow the police to spy on criminals, but it would also allow the police and everybody else to spy on the average citizen.""""The deciding factor will be whom the public fears the most - criminals or the government""As Neil Bohr said - ""Anyone who can contemplate quantum mechanics without getting dizzy hasn’t understood it.""""The urge to discover secrets is deeply ingrained in human nature; even the least curious mind is roused by the promise of sharing knowledge withheld from others. Some are fortunate enough to find a job which consists in the solution of mysteries, but most of us are driven to sublimate this urge by the solving of artificial puzzles devised for our entertainment. Detective stories or crossword puzzles cater for the majority; the solution of secret codes may be the pursuit of a few."" - John ChadwickHighly recommended stuff!Recommended for: If you love treasure hunt, logical deductions, puzzles, anything related to digital privacy sounds fascinating to you, then this is the book for you.Not recommended: If you totally abhor simple mathematics, data interpretation, tables and charts."
13,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,5,"Singh, author of Fermat's Enigma, has even included a code to practice one's deciphering skills on. The successful cryptanalyst will win $15,000. In the appendix, he discusses other famous attempts at breaking codes, including the recent book, The Bible Code, by Michael Drosnin. This work caused quite a stir a couple of years ago when Drosnin, building really on the work of several Hebrew scholars, claimed to have discovered several prophecies hidden in the text of the Bible, a forecast of the assassination of the Kennedys and of Anwar Sadat. The Biblical code was an EDLS (equidistant letter sequence) code, where you take any text, pick a particular starting letter and jump ahead a given number of letters to spell out a sentence. As critics have pointed out, any large text will produce all sorts of things. Brendan McKay at the Australian National University used Drosnin's technique to search Moby Dick and discovered similar predictions of assassinations that have occurred. Hebrew texts, Singh notes, are particularly rich in EDLSs because Hebrew has no vowels, which means interpreters can insert vowels as they see fit. Codes are constantly evolving; as code breakers break them, new ones must be developed. The supposed one-time pads, as in the Cryptonomicon, even had weaknesses — for example, if used more than once or from patterns inadvertently created by typists, patterns being the entry into most ciphers. Cryptanalysis, or the process of code breaking, was really invented by Islamic scholars in the 19th century. Substitution ciphers, where another alphabet is substituted for the original, were believed to be unbreakable; there were so many possible combinations of 26 letters that it would take billions of years to test all of them. The Islamic scholars, while analyzing the Koran, discovered that the frequency of letters was not the same. In English, for example, the letter 'e' appears much more frequently than 'z' By analysis of letter frequency and knowing the language of the cipher, deciphering became quite simple. Blaise de Vigeniere solved this weakness by inventing the Vigeniere square, which provided multiple cipher alphabets using keywords to link letters with particular alphabets, a polyalphabetic cipher. The beauty of his scheme was that the letter “e” might be represented by several other letters, so frequency became irrelevant C or so everyone thought. To decipher the code, all one needed was the keyword, easy to remember, and not necessary to write down anywhere. Deciphering was a tedious process, however, and his impregnable ciphering system was not widely used. The Great Cipher was created by a father and son team working for Louis XIV. Their system was to use a combination of various types of ciphers. Unfortunately, they died without recording how their cipher worked, and many documents in French archives remained completely unreadable until the late 19th century when a French cryptanalyst spent several years painstakingly applying his knowledge of ciphers to the problem. Several of the documents thus finally deciphered revealed the identity of the Man in the Iron Mask. Charles Babbage, inventor of the modern calculator and computer, was the one who broke Vigeniere's polyalphabetic system, by using statistics to create an algorithm that helped reveal the keyword. The problem in the twentieth century has not been the development of undecipherable ciphers. The computer makes encoding very easy and quite unbreakable. But each ciphered message can only be deciphered using a key. The recipient has to know the key. Banks would hire messengers to deliver keys to encrypted messages that needed to be sent from one bank to another. That proved to be a bureaucratic nightmare, and as the Internet created a need for encrypted messages between individuals and online stores or other persons, the deliverer of the key became very important. Martin Hellman, Ralph Merkle, and Whitfield Diffie decided the problem was not insoluble. As Hellman said, “God rewards fools.” Only a fool would be willing to work on a problem for which the experts had said there was no solution, and to be willing to keep getting excited by an idea only to have it flop, then try another. Their solution was unique. They eliminated the need for key exchange. Just how they did this is marvelous in its simplicity, but if I told you you wouldn't need to read the book, which is what I heartily recommend. PQP, the cipher made public so that anyone could use it, made the government nervous and civil libertarians and others in favor of privacy leap for joy. Now anyone could encrypt a message with total security. We hear constantly about the worry that the NSA, CIA, and others in government have about the easy ability of ordinary people to have a level of encryption that is indecipherable. But, of course, it=s in their interest to make everyone think they have an indecipherable message, so my guess is that those agencies already know how to break the unbreakable codes but just don't want anyone to know they can. "
14,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6324882-krycek,5,"I was fascinated with codes and ciphers when I was a kid. I even had a ""junior spy code kit"" with a bunch of cool stuff and I could send little notes to friends with secret messages like ""Mr. Nutzenjammer is a dork"" and ""Cindy eats her boogers"" and we would all congratulate ourselves with our cleverness. That's all pretty juvenile, but the ciphers included in my little spy kit were the basics in modern encryption systems and you can read all about it in Simon Singh's The Code Book, an excellent primer for understanding encryption methods and a fascinating account of its development through history.Amazingly, Singh has the ability to make this rather complex topic understandable as well as entertaining. I am by no means mathematically inclined, but Singh explains the processes involved in each cipher he describes through baby steps and multiple analogies. If one doesn't work for you then the next will until you get it. This book actually makes you feel like you're learning something. Nevertheless, some of the concepts are mind boggling. Imagine for a moment this number: 10^130. It's a huge number but can be factored by a computer in about 15 seconds. Now imagine the number 10^308, which is ten million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion times bigger than the number 10^130. It would take more than a thousand years for a hundred million personal computers working together to crack a cipher using a value such as this in its key, yet this is the scale of numbers that most modern banking encryptions use. As one might guess, these encryptions are pretty much unbreakable.Things truly get weird when Singh describes the concept of quantum cryptography, which I won't try to describe but will just say that I re-read that section a couple of times. Although quantum cryptography was just in a conceptual stage at the time of The Code Book's publication, who knows? It might be in usage now. The Code Book was first published in 2000 and a lot has changed since then (probably more than we realize, considering the secretive nature of the topic). At any rate, Singh makes a good point that cryptography, while historically of vital importance in political intrigues, is now of vital importance to most of our daily lives since the internet, for better or worse, has basically connected the world. Because of internet banking and commerce, information security is of prime importance.Singh also, however, does a good job of telling the stories of code makers and code breakers. Particularly interesting and moving is the story of the brilliant cryptanalyst Alan Turning who committed suicide after the war when attempts to ""cure"" his homosexuality drove him into a deep depression. However, Turing was one of those unsung heroes working in secrecy, without whom the Allies may very well have lost World War II. Singh's ability to weave these stories into the complex mechanics of cryptography make for an engrossing narrative and one that has excited my intellectual imagination like few others have.So ditch the ""junior spy kit."" That's kid stuff. Read The Code Book and you will know how to send inter-office gossip with complete security."

I love a good puzzle, and this history of making, cracking, and innovating secret codes was enthralling. And it gets better ... at the end of the book there are codes to try your hand out. I got pretty excited when I solved the first (and easiest one). They got harder and the book became overdue at the library so I gave it up. For about a week I had the idea that I was going to be the best code cracker ever and that the CIA would HAVE to hire me and I would find the secret buried treasure in the hills of Virginia (or wherever). I even bought a book of New York Times crossword puzzles to exercise my brain, and I have since come to accept reality. I will probably never solve an entire crossword puzzle on my own (by the way, the Wall Street Journal is sooooo much harder than NYT--just looking at them makes me feel stupid), much less crack secret codes. "

The book can be looked at in three perspectives. At a micro level, it is a guide to the various techniques of secret writing, and how they can be deciphered. Right from Caesar's cipher to quantum cryptography, the book traces how encryption and decryption has evolved in the last two millennia, which, by itself is fascinating. Second, it can be looked at as a history book. Not many of us may be aware of how cryptography has shaped world history, and it might come as a shock to know some of the key moments in countless wars were decided by the strength or weakness of a particular cipher. Be it the cracking of the enigma during World War II, or Charles Babbage's excellent method of cracking the ""Le Chiffre Indechiffrable"", it is a treat for history lovers.Finally, the book is a testimony to the will power and ingenuity of countless skilled men and women, who at various points of time, have contributed in one way or the other, knowingly or unknowingly, to ensure a safer and better world for us all. The constant battle between the cryptanalysts and the cryptographers is a recurring theme throughout the book, each one taking the lead in turns. Published in 1999, Simon Singh gives a hint at the future of encryption and also on how it would affect the privacy of every individual, something which is now transpiring. Would the code breakers have the final say, or will the code makers thwart their attempts again? It remains to be seen."

It explores the art of ciphering codes and encryption which has developed profusely over the centuries, with alot of help from Charles Babbage and the computer. Singh delves into the story of Mary Queen of Scots and explains in an epic and intersting way about how Mary's life depended upon whether her encrypted messages were deciphered. It goes on to the key role of mathematicians in WWII particulatly the ones based in the England, who successfully decoded messages that the Germans sent to each other and it is said that without mathematicians we would've lost the war!This is an engaging insight into the history of cryptography and a must read for any puzzle wizzes, mathematicians or historians."

This guy's knowledge and history is astounding, and while much of it is beyond me to fully understand, I am enamored with the way the stories unravel.

23,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11408214-tobias-langhoff,5,"I have a romantic view of old-fashioned, analog cryptography (and stenography). Every time I read about it, I feel like a kid again, sitting in a treehouse with the neighboring kids who make up our small detective/spy club, encrypting messages we hoped someone would care to attempt to read. If I were born a decade or two earlier, I surely would have become a ham radio operator. Recommendations for spy novels that capture this childish feeling are appreciated.This book details the world history of cryptography, all the way from simple letter substitution (which was easily broken once scholars discovered frequency analysis) to the possibilities presented by future quantum computers (which would render all current cryptography broken, but make way for unbreakable encryption). This history is presented as the evolution of cryptography by codebreaking selection.The book pedagogically explains in layman’s terms how each major cipher used throughout history works, and how its ingenious creators considered them unbreakable. Inevitably, it was broken, through an equal spark of ingenuity, and the world moved its secret communiques to another cipher, thinking that this time they had found the one that was impossible to crack, and the cycle begins again – a mental arms race between mathematicians and logicians.Sprinkled through this historical timeline are extremely interesting stories and anecdotes. I was happy that Singh give the Polish researchers who broke Enigma’s encryption the credit they deserve (something The Imitation Game does not, the recent film about Alan Turing and Bletchley Park, which are also given ample discussion in the book). These stories read as thrilling, miniature, real-life spy novels in their own right, and I've checked out the ""further reading"" section on each of them.Singh also touches upon the inherent conflicts of interest between the public, who want to guard their data as securely as possible, and government agencies, who want to be able to break encryption to safeguard national security. As the book explains, in the early days of computer cryptography, this was easily achieved because governments had access to vast computing resources compared to the public. This book was written in 1999, however, and after its publication – and especially after 9/11 – one such agency in particular, the NSA, has become infamous in this regard. Indeed, just as I’m typing up this review (literally!), Apple has publicly announced that they defy an FBI order of building a backdoor into the iPhone. After reading this book, and its clairvoyant Chapter 7 (about the heralding of the Information Age, or the Infocalypse), it becomes quite clear why Apple felt the need to write this customer letter.A minor complaint: Singh admits he has left out some important stories and ciphers, which is inevitable, but I was disappointed that he presented a few ciphers considered unbreakable without explaining how they were eventually broken. An example of this is the ADFGVX cipher. I feel I now understand the string of ciphers that make up the evolution of cryptography through history, but although I understand there are some intentional holes in that understanding because of complete omissions, I feel slightly cheated because some of the holes were presented but never plugged by the book.All in all a fantastic and exhilerating book for anyone interesting in cryptography, communication, secrecy, war (both hot and cold), technology, history and everything between."
24,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6063469-julia-hughes,5,"Mr Singh manages to explain concepts that should be way beyond this thickie's level of understanding. That he manages to do so in an entertaining page turning manner is testament to his skill both as a mathematician and a writer. This book examines how from earliest history in parallel with writing, it became necessary for human kind to devise ways to send messages in code. So we learn how complex codes developed from very simple ones, and Simon explains along the way that there are ancient codes still waiting to be decoded and we also learn how to identify when a code is actually being deployed. It seems the best codes are the simplest, but if you need to tell more than two people a code, like a secret, it becomes more vulnerable. Entwined with the stories of code, are the stories of people who throughout history have relied on those codes being unbreakable - in some cases paying with their lives (eg Mary Queen of Scot) when it this is proved not to be the case. We're all intrigued by codes - witness the popularity of newspaper coffee break pages which will usually include a codeword problem. This book is well illustrated, extremely readable and throws new light on an already fascinating subject. "
25,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917681-lady-clementina-ffinch-ffarowmore,5,"Singh does an excellent job explaining the development and process of cryptography and cryptanalysis in easy to understand terms (except (for me) perhaps the working of the Enigma, which still is a bit of an enigma!)- in fact so easy does he make it sound that one might be tempted to believe that one can be a cryptanalyst oneself- well until on turns to practically solving problems anyway. I also liked the way he wove the explanations of the actual process and working of encryption and cryptanalysis with the history and stories of how they evolved and were used and finally broken. Another plus for me was his inclusion of ancient scripts and their decipherment. The book is both informative and thoroughly enjoyable! The one issue I had was with the edition that I bought in which some of the pictures were really dark and hard to see. "
26,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16177981-tessa,4,"A history of cryptography ought to have spy stories and treasure hunts and daring wartime conspiracies, which Simon Singh provides, but he grounds it all in strikingly clear mathematical and logical explanations of cryptographic methods. He tells the history as a back and forth between cryptographers and cryptanalysts, with one group having the upper hand at different points in history. With the very early ciphers, I already had a background intuition about how they might be deciphered, but by the third chapter I was experiencing amazement along with cryptographers of various centuries as different ciphers were unraveled. One of the best nonfiction I've read lately."

28,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A journey through the history of coding, cryptography, and codebreaking.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Chronologically arranged, the book begins in ancient times and describes simple forms of encryption such as shaving the head, tattooing a message, waiting a few weeks or wrapping a leather strip described with essential words around a stick of specified thickness. The further the time progresses, the more complex and with an ever shorter expiration date the techniques of the specialists are provided.The methods used are described comprehensible and pleasant enough illustrated, which is unusual for beginners to advanced, for professionals too easy and probably too complicated for the total layman. Because of this, it is sometimes advisable to read over the purely theoretical descriptions as in my case (laziness and layman). The military-historical and political aspects are anyway much more interesting for philistines of applied science.Thus, in the race between decoders and creative code writers, not only the reputation of the technicians but often also the history of the world history was at stake. An earlier, later, or even non-occurrence of an encryption or decryption technique would almost certainly have led to another current geopolitical map.The closer the book comes to the present, the more explosive the stories become, such as a virtually undecipherable, standard and US-prevented encryption technique, which should never be widely used.The big unanswered question at the end of the book is whether today's very secure encryption technology has already been silently banished by an unknown nemesis called quantum computer into the ark of no longer reliable and thus antiquated encryption techniques.It would be interesting to know that almost all private and commercial traffic is secured in this way. Let us be surprised.Ein Streifzug durch die Geschichte von Kodierung, Kryptographie und Codeknackerei.Chronologisch aufgereiht beginnt das Buch in der Antike und schlichten Formen der Verschlüsselung wie Kopf rasieren, Nachricht tätowieren, ein paar Wochen warten oder einen mit wichtigen Botschaften beschriebenen Lederstreifen um einen Stock bestimmter Dicke zu wickeln. Je weiter die Zeit voranschreitet, umso komplexer und mit immer kürzerem Ablaufdatum versehen werden die Techniken der Spezialisten.Die jeweils angewandten Methoden werden verständlich und angenehm ausreichend bebildert beschrieben, was für Anfänger bis Fortgeschrittene interessant, für Profis zu leicht und für totale Laien vermutlich zu komplex sein dürfte. Deswegen ist teils ein Überlesen der rein theoretischen Beschreibungen wie in meinem Fall (Faulheit und Laie) anzuraten wäre. Die militärhistorischen und politischen Aspekte sind für Muffel der angewandten Naturwissenschaft ohnehin wesentlich interessanter.So stand im Wettlauf zwischen Dekodierern und kreativen Codetüftlern oft nicht nur das Renommee der Techniker, sondern oftmals auch die weltgeschichtliche Entwicklung auf dem Spiel. Ein früheres, späteres oder gar nicht erfolgtes Auftreten einer Verschlüsselungs- beziehungsweise Entschlüsselungstechnik hätte mit an Sicherheit grenzender Wahrscheinlichkeit zu einer anderen aktuellen geopolitischen Landkarte geführt. Je näher das Buch der Gegenwart kommt, desto brisanter werden die Geschichten, wie etwa eine praktisch unentschlüsselbare, billige und von den USA verhinderte Verschlüsselungstechnik, die niemals breite Anwendung finden dürfte.Die große unbeantwortete Frage gegen Ende des Buches ist, ob die heutige, auch sehr sichere Verschlüsselungstechnik bereits von einer unbekannten Nemesis namens Quantencomputer still und leise in die Lade der nicht mehr sicheren und damit antiquierten Verschlüsselungstechniken verbannt worden ist. Wäre eigentlich interessant zu wissen, da fast der gesamte private und wirtschaftliche Datenverkehr auf solche Weise gesichert wird. Lassen wir uns überraschen."

Singh has done a marvelous job of chronologically describing the art of hiding information from the Rosetta stone, to the lesser known message hiding tricks used in Queen Mary's court, followed by the Enigma machine, till the emergence of computers. He backs up the technical details with intriguing history, which only makes up for a wonderful reading experience. My favorite part in the book was the explanation of Quantum Cryptography. Having studied the basics of cryptography in my Engineering, I was delighted by the beauty with which Singh easily made accessible the difficult terrain where quantum physics, programming, and mathematics merge to form the future of information protection. Above all, it manages to pack so much in so less pages. If you are only as curious as I am and don't have the patience for David Kahn's mammoth 1200 pages comprehensive history of cryptography, I think Simon Singh's book will be enough to quench your thirst!

Singh also covers computer encryption in a manner which is easy to understand and fascinating in its detail.The best part about this book is its accessibility. You don't need to be a mathematician to follow how codes were developed and broken. I was riveted by the development of cryptography in a way I never I imagined I would.

33,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6214472-gabriela,0,"This was a delightful read on a subject that could have easily been too dry and textbook-like and I recommend it to everyone. The strength of the book lies in the fact that it doesn't just list the processes involved in cryptography and cryptanalysis, but it thoroughly discusses the social, economic and cultural processes that drove innovation in both these fields. It contextualises the ciphers it discusses so that it is clear why their discovery happened at that particular point in history, and not sooner or later. It mixes history and science in a way that makes everything so much easier to understand and remember because the facts are explained in a fully fleshed-out context. This also helps to outline the overall importance of codes in different circumstances, such as the WWs, understanding ancient civilisations and modern day encryption, which also justifies the book's importance and the necessity to understand and respect the effects the field has had on society. I loved the way it covered the methods used to decipher hieroglyphs just because the rationale applied to this is also used in code breaking, even if it isn't identical. It just added to the way the topic was contextualised and linked to other disciplines to the effect that it feels as more than just reading a book an isolated topic. Similarly. it also discussed 90s debates on internet cryptography and touched on what the major points on each side of the debate were. I think this was particularly useful at the time of its publication when maybe not many people were aware of the ramifications of encryption on privacy and state surveillance. Nowadays the topic has evolved and it's definitely in the media and the public's attention to a much higher degree. In terms of technical details I'd say it's mid-level, it certainly explains the way in which some codes were constructed and then cracked, but it thoroughly outlines the mathematical context needed to understand it and doesn't go into detail to the point where it's too dense to understand for a non-techy reader. Also because this book was published in the late 90s it's not up to date, but since its focus is the history of codes that's not too much of a drawback, except for the fact that the last two chapters might be a bit outdated."

My dear friends and family gave up eventually.But it wasn't the science of the ciphers that stuck with me the longest, it was the stories of the people who made them, used them, and most importantly broke them. Alan Turing practically invented the computer to break enigma during the Second World War. He broke it, invented new fields of science. That Apple symbol of an apple with a bite in it? That's to honour him, because he committed suicide by eating an apple injected with cyanide. Because being open about what he did at Bletchley and being open about his homosexuality were illegal.Fact is stronger than fiction, or something like that. Good anyway. Please read this.

The most important cryptographic techniques are explained as the battle between the cryptographers and crypto analysts. Simon Singh's choice of the stories to bring out the heroic efforts of the cryptoanalysts from Charles Babbage to Alan Turing is absolutely brilliant. In the past 20 years, since the publication of the book, there are a lot of advances in cryptography. But I think, this book is still relevant and the best introduction to anyone interested in the subject. Also, despite the advancements, our right to privacy still remains an illusion.

Moreover, it turns out that investing a little more time on the topic and reading a few core texts is by far more helpful and illuminating. Singh's book was a big exception to this rule.Singh is not just a great storyteller or educator (both of which he certainly is). In addition, he spends a lot of effort making sure he knows the subject matter well enough to stay focused and organized. His mini-biographies and anecdotes are all incredibly engaging, but he manages to maintain the historical and scientific through-line of the book and drag the reader into the fascinating puzzles of cryptography. If you've enjoyed this book, I highly recommend Dan Boneh's online course on cryptography. Singh's book and Boneh's lectures complement each other in providing technical detail and historical context to various concepts in the field. Singh often skips elaborating on the mathematical foundation of ciphers and the technicalities involved in defining modes of security, while Boneh rarely mentions the historical and etymological origins of various concepts. For instance I was utterly confused by his use of the term ""one-time pad"" until I learned about its history in the book.This is going to be one of my all-time favorite works of popular science, and certainly not the last I will read of Simon Singh."

This book does full justice to that faith. It is a very readable and enjoyable book on the difficult subject of cryptography. Singh starts out with the details of how Mary Queen of Scot's got beheaded due to her coded messages being de-crypted by Queen Elizabeth's code breakers. Then there is the lovely presentation of the details of the German Enigma machine being decyphered by the Allies during the second world war. It was also very interesting for me to read about the great contribution made by the Navajo Indians, who used a coded version of their native language in sending messages which helped in defeating the Japanese in WWII. Gradually, he takes us through to the current scenario of computer cryptography, the principles behind it and finally on to the future of quantum cryptography. All this is done without resorting to complex technological jargon or mathematics. One of the other positive aspects of this book is the presentation of each advance in cryptography to the historical events that provided the need for it shaped its development.I enjoyed reading the book and would recommend it strongly."

The beginning half was really good, but then when it became about secure internet banking and not wars and beheadings and secret languages it kind of got a little boring. Also it was SUPER Anglo-centric. I don't agree with that choice.I learned that once in ancient Greece somebody shaved the head of his messenger, wrote the message on his scalp, and then waited for the hair to regrow as a form of secret communication (aside by the author: ""This was clearly a period of history that tolerated a certain lack of urgency""). I also learned that there is a French book La Disparition that is written without using the letter ""e"" that was subsequently translated into English as A Void, which also does not use the letter ""e."" This English translation is delightfully readable: "". . . A rumour, that's my initial thought as I switch off my radio, a rumour or possibly a hoax. Propaganda, I murmur anxiously - as though, just by saying so, I might allay my doubts - typical politicians' propaganda.

The good and praiseworthy thing is how Simon has also tried to capture the effect of cryptography in the world around us i.e. business and politics.The only thing I feel was missing was the up to date nature of the book. A lot of developments particular in quantum computing has been made since 2000s. I wish Simon would write an updated version of the book soon. Surely, more and more people should read Simon Singh."

Having a perspective on the intellectual, mathematical side was incredibly enlightening (as a hopeful math/cs major), and Singh does an amazing job of breaking down the different types of ciphers and writing beautiful narratives of these mathematicians (hey, being a math major is cool!).

I picked up this book to better inform my own fiction writing and found it to be a fascinating book. The author starts with wax tablets, hard-boiled eggs, shaved heads, and invisible ink. Things get more complex during the Middle Ages with advanced mathematics and cryptography, and into the early modern era of the telegraph and today’s quantum realm. My only quibble—and it is a minor quibble—is that the author’s treatment of the World War I-II era focuses on European events, but little on events in America (such as the breaking of the “Purple” Japanese code). The absence of more detail on what was going on across the pond becomes stark when, with the invention of the computer, the book makes a sudden jump to American computer companies but without any of the detailed pedigree of the technology the book investigated in Europe. Finally, the book is quite dated now and one finishes with wanting to know how quantum computing and cryptography have progressed over the past 20 years, but that in no way detracts from the time frame covered by the book."

59,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88992247-ash-gawain,4,Excellent book. I really liked the historical approach. The only question that remains: Will quantum cryptography ever become affordable for the layman in the field? 
60,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17469602-swarbhanu-chatterjee,4,"A very interesting read. There is a certain amount of romanticism involved in stories of secret writing and ciphers. Usually, cipher solving is cryptic and difficult to understand. Simon Singh has a done a fantastic job making the codes often used in history understandable for layman, even those not mathematically inclined. Therefore, it is possible for every one to enjoy the art of secret writing by reading this book.However, I am not particularly sure of the historical accuracy of certain claims made in the book. There are a few conspiracy theories which seem to have been accepted as historical truths. For example, for certain historical events like the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, she was alleged to have corresponded in secret with a conspirator who wanted to kill the protestant Queen Elizabeth and restore to the throne the catholic Queen Mary. But that allegation made by Walsingham, the spy master of Queen Elizabeth, was rejected by Mary. The letters used for the trial which were apparently written in code cracked by Walsingham's cipher expert could have been forgeries made by Walsingham's man under his orders. My reason for suspecting this is because frankly the letter allegation does not hold water. The letters were apparently written in code by the conspirator and Queen Mary apparently could break that code and reply in the same cipher. Since Queen Mary was not a cipher expert herself, how could she or her maids crack the coded letters from an English conspirator outside her castle prison without ever having met the conspirator and therefore never having had agreed on the cipher system being used. Also apparently that cipher was not a well known cipher at that time. And the possibility that the cipher key was passed along with the letter smuggled inside a wine barrel (as what was alleged) does not make sense because who would pass a coded letter and also the cipher key through the same channel of communication. Therefore, I believe that the letter story was a sham. It is just one more cleverly resourceful way of falsely accusing someone that we have often seen in history. Ofcourse, Simon Singh, the author of this book does not investigate whether the story of Queen Mary having used secretly coded letters to communicate with conspirators as claimed by Queen Elizabeth's spy master is actually historically accurate. The story was too ""juicy"" for him not to have included it in his book, even if the story might be actually historically inaccurate and the letters were forgeries used by Walsingham and Queen Elizabeth to murder her cousin, Queen Mary, who was a political threat to her. My condolences to Queen Mary of Scots though I am several hundred years too late. She would have made a good queen of free Scotland if she could have reigned longer.Another point, which I am not sure of in terms of historical accuracy is the Betchley Park story. All the documents and machines, allegedly made there during World War II, which apparently broke every German code used in German communications (including Hitler's comms to his generals), are said to have been destroyed. If there is absolutely no evidence left, except the claims of a few guys after about thirty years, then how can these claims be trusted? If all German code was broken during the war, why did the British have such a tough time fighting? Ofcourse, the author, Simon Singh, does not care. He gets another to story to write about.Despite the historical lack of credibility of the book, I enjoyed reading it as it helped me understand several codes used and raised my level of interest in the subject. The book highlights how important persistence is in all human endeavors."
61,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6008885-rob-ward,5,"I had previously read/listened to Singh's Fermat's Last Theorum as an audiobook and had enjoyed it but though I had seen this on my brother's shelf whenever I was back at my parents' place in the British Midlands, it never quite made it into the more plausible ranks of my to read list. Experience tells me (or perhaps it should be, ought to tell me), there are things I believe I enjoy and in fact don't, and similarly, that there are things I think I don't much enjoy and in fact enjoy very much. Maths and science are two of those things I tend to enjoy very much, but underrate in my own mind so that they invariably give way to miserabilist novels, Czech grammar and dogged attempts at dictionary-aided french books.Singh writes about complicated material in a comprehensible manner. That much is fundamental to getting a book like this to be approachable and readable. He also has a pitch perfect feel for adding just enough human interest to each story (and both of the his books feel like they advance chapter by chapter, story by story), to humanise the highly abstract material whilst feeling unforced and certainly uncondescending.The book takes in the obvious and the relatively well-known, such as the story of the Enigma Code. It takes on public key cryptography, which is used on a daily basis by millions but understood by few. It discusses the implications of the battle between those who seek to encrypt information and those who attempt to decrypt and intercept it, most notably in terms of the future of the internet. It also, rather bravely, takes on a significant digression, on the deciphering of Linear B, an ancient text found in Greece and Crete.Singh succeeded in explaining each of these areas and contextualising them, populating them all with the stories of those individuals who made significant contributions. I did not know, for example, that it was the Poles who first made significant inroads into the Enigma code, furnishing the British with almost all of the elements necessary to breaking the code, which had initially been considered impregnable by both the Germans and the Allies. The sometimes stubborn tweedy eccentrics behind both the solving of the mysteries of the Linear B tablets and those who perhaps held up any progress for a number of decades was also fascinating. More contemporarily, Singh is also on comfortable ground with the baby boomers of Silicon valley and its peers and competitors, and explains the complexities of public key encryption and others forms of encryption used in home computing with consistent skill. After that the book unavoidably becomes a little more esoteric, but Singh tackles the bizarre laws of quantum theory and its implications for cryptography with as comprehensibly as I have ever seen. Though I increasingly found myself turning back pages to re-read sentences and refer to tables as I made my way through the book, I invariably did so with interest rather than frustration, and though I may be deluded, I didn't feel as though confusions and misunderstandings were piling up as I worked my way through to the modern day (or as much as we can be expected to know of it in such a work, which is in any case old enough now to make a considerable difference in such terrain.)I would recommend this book to anyone who uses the internet for private communication, banking or shopping, but also to anyone who enjoys narrative history, whether they would feel comfortable with maths and linguistics and the many other areas this work takes on, or not."
62,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50918142-lillian-elliott,5,"I loved this book. It was the textbook for a Cryptology class I took 2 years ago, but we only had to read a few chapters for class and I didn't get around to finishing it until this year, but I'm so glad I did. Simon Singh clearly explains the complex details of cryptology. The Code Book is an excellent history of cryptology, including the mathematics behind both the cryptography and cryptanalysis of codes dating from ancient times to the 1990's. It also includes an interesting chapter on the decipherment of ancient scripts such as Egyptian hieroglyphics and Linear B. It ends with a chapter about the predicted future of cryptography and quantum cryptography. It was interesting and easy to understand. I was always interested in cryptography, but after reading this book I am interested in everything it discussed from the Navajo Code Talkers to quantum physics. The only negative is that this book is slightly out of date. It was published in 2000, and a lot has happened in 21st century cryptology since. I want to follow up with a book specifically on advancements in cryptology in the 21st century, as well as learning more about Linear B, the Navajo Code Talkers, and quantum cryptography.In the back of the book, there are a few ciphers as a challenge for the reader. I solved the first two easily, and am planning to go back and attempt the third and fourth ones. However, the fifth cipher and those that follow are recommended for ""real enthusiasts"" or ""dedicated codebreakers,"" and I barely even know how to begin cryptanalysis. On that note, this book focuses on the developments in cryptologic history more than the cryptanalysis aspect. Although it details how simpler ciphers like the mono alphabetic substitution cipher and the Vigenere cipher can be solved, you'd need to research more if you wanted to learn in detail about cryptanalysis..The Code Book is a well-written history of cryptography. It sets a strong base of cryptologic knowledge for beginners, and includes details that I never learned after 3 separate cryptology courses. It is also just a very interesting and fun read, and that's coming from someone who usually avoids reading non-fiction. I would recommend this book to everyone interested in obtaining a basic knowledge of cryptology and the effects of intelligence on wars and governments. I also think it would be a fun refresher for anyone who already knows a bit about cryptography. Although I need to find more current updates on cryptology elsewhere, The Code Book was an informative, interesting, and enjoyable read."
63,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16085271-becky,5,"This book was awesome. It's an overview of the history of cryptography from ancient Egypt to lost languages to wartime communication throughout the ages, to quantum cryptography. The stories of the earliest cyphers are fascinating and concise - written in a way that lays a foundational education for cryptography but would also make great bedtime stories for smart kids. The subject got increasingly more difficult, and once it got into 20th-century encryption and the rise of computers, I have to admit it started to become a bit more difficult to follow - the brief description of how the German Enigma machines worked, and the even more complex overview of how they were encrypted by England's super-secret codebreakers at Bletchley Park involved a lot of thought breaks to digest just what was going on. (Yes, it was a bit more complex than the Cumberbatch movie.) However, it looks like Singh wrote another book just about the Enigma machines, and I can't wait to read it. And as the book got into its final chapters about RSA & DES encryption, I started to wonder how dated certain of the claims were concerning the impossible decryption of the then-modern tech encryption and I'd love to find a book discussing the advances in that area over the last 16 years since this book was published. The book ended with a discussion of quantum cryptography, which has it's roots in quantum computing theory, which in turn is based on quantum mechanics. I never thought I'd find myself curled up in the library's reading room at my alma mater (my 10-year college reunion was this weekend), contemplating the physical properties if light photons and the (very, very basic) principals of quantum mechanics. I wish I had spent more time studying the physical sciences and engineering, but I guess there's no time like the present. This has expanded my want-to-read list in a very abstract way: I know the subjects I'd like to explore, but I need to find the books. If anyone can recommend any excellent books on the Enigma machines, Bletchley Park, Alan Turing, and/or the basics of quantum mechanics or modern computer encryption, I'd love the suggestions!"
64,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,5,"Awesome--Simon Singh's provocatively titled The Code Book goes through the history of cryptography from, well, ancient times to the present day, explaining all the major ciphers ever invented and how they impacted the course of of general history, including Mary Queene of Scots, World War II, and privacy in the Age of Information. It is simply fascinating. Simon Singh is very good at elucidating the complex and complicated concepts of cryptography for laypersons, and consequently the book is very, very readable on top of being just exciting to read about the age-old battle between codemakers and codebreakers. A codemaker comes up with a cipher or a code, claims it unbreakable until some genius makes a breakthrough and proves the codemaker wrong. This pure intellectual battle between fundamental human desires - secrecy/privacy and curiosity - spanning over two millennia is a sheer joy to read about.One of the most fascinating topics was the problem of key distribution and its solution. Briefly put, any cipher needs a key to encrypt and decrypt a message (called ""plaintext""). Imagine Taka sending an encrypted message to Mom. Upon receiving the message, Mom needs to know two things: what kind of cipher Taka used to encrypt it, and a key to decrypt it. To use Mr. Singh's analogy, Taka sends Mom a letter in a safe with a padlock. If Mom doesn't have the key to the padlock, she can't open it and read the letter. So it seems that Taka has to send Mom the key to the padlock as well, perhaps via some secure route like courier. Even if assuming that using courier is perfectly secure, it still poses a practical problem: if Taka wants to send letters to all his friends, does he have to employ courier for all of his friends to send the key? That would be very expensive indeed. And what if courier gets intercepted?But there is a way to entirely do away with the problem, and it's brilliant. Without even sending the key, Taka can be assured that his letter in the safe is read only by Mom. How? Read the book and find out."

I got a little bogged down when they got to the Enigma Machine and more modern encryption and quantum cryptography but the first three quarters of the book was a breeze. In fact, I would recommend people not to view this as a book about codes but rather a book about history. The codes themselves are really only a part of the spectacular drama that plays out in the book. The book covers ancient Greece, Rome and Caesar, the execution of Mary Queen of Scotland, the French Revolution, Napoleon, World War 1, World War 2-it's all fascinating stuff.In the end, what I came to appreciate from reading the book is just how bloody smart people were back then.

Yet we have the advantage of all of the accumulated knowledge of the people who came before us. We really are standing on the shoulders of giants.The only reason I haven't given this book 5 stars is that it does lose my interest a bit post WWII.

When I finally got my hands on it, it certainly did not disappoint.Intelligence (in the military sense and otherwise) or the lack of it has determined the course of wars and the fate of many lives for centuries. Espionage has been the glamorous arm of intelligence gathering, but cryptography has been the backbone on which nations have conducted their military operations and the fundamental building block of the digital world in which nations, corporations and individuals operate today.Cryptology has always been a battle between those who encode (cryptographers) and those who try to break the code (cryptoanalysts).This books traces the evolution of cryptography from the times of Mary of Scot (who was executed as her communication was intercepted and deciphered, proving that she was plotting to assassinate the English Queen), through substitution ciphers in the 19th and 20th centuries and how they were finally broken in the Arab world to modern times and the impact of Enigma on the outcome of WWII and finally the current use of RSA encryption and cutting edge quantum cryptography.I would recommend this book to only those genuinely interested in this topic as it requires a certain amount of concentration and effort to understand how the various encryptions work and how ingenious the logic to break those codes is. Without that effort, the beauty of the code and its break is lost on the reader.Recommended to those genuinely interested in cryptography and military history."

I knew Simon Singh from Fermat's Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem and The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets, both of them books I liked. Thus with these precedents, it seemed a sure choice. It was.It is a little of the history of cryptography, as well as some anecdotes around it. Middle age in Britain and Scotland, World War (I and II), security in the Internet or quantum computers are some of the topics in which we trace the development of cryptography. The eternal battle between codemakers and codebreakers.I had almost no knowledge about this, only something about RSA and a bit of Enigma and Turing, so I learned a lot here. Besides I took notes while reading the book to further research on certain topics like Linear B or quantum computers. Amazing topics they are.I recommend it to anyone interested in cryptography, mathematics or just history. It's really a fantastic read you greatly enjoy.Also Simon Singh ends the book with a list of 10 challenges to solve. 10 cyphertexts you can decrypt if you have time and desire."
68,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3110967-stefan-keel,3,"Since I suck at math, I was a little intimidated by this book when I bought it almost ten years ago. I finally decided to pick it up and read it, only to discover a wonderfully approachable discussion of cryptography. The mathematically inclined will enjoy the book just as much as those of us who aren't so equipped. And for the latter, the math is presented in a way that even I was able to understand it. Cryptography can be a confusing topic, but Singh strung it together as one mystery after another. The book is packed with stories of actual uses which keep it engaging, and I quickly wanted more of the technical discussions just so that I could find out HOW one encryption system after another was created and then broken. There's also a great deal of actual history, that isn't accurately portrayed by modern media.While Singh doesn't go into the details involved with how block and stream ciphers are currently used in modern data encryption, and doesn't discuss the various algorithms such as BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, AES, etc., overall he provides a wonderful overview on the core techniques used in encryption. After all, a symmetric cipher is a symmetric cypher, whatever the algorithm used, of which there are legion. "
69,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7580677-utsav,5,"An excellent book on a fascinating subject. Simon Singh traces the evolution of cryptography and its perpetual battle with cryptanalysis right from ancient history to the end of the 20th Century in a very readable, entertaining style. He describes both the making and breaking of different codes over history, and details the algorithms in a very accessible manner. Honestly, you don't require any mathematical skills to appreciate any of this, but I guess it does take a certain kind of person to enjoy it so thoroughly. My only beef with it was that it has not been updated since 1999, so the ""modern"" chapters sound painfully out of touch (""Internet commerce is still in its infancy...""), and it would have been nice to read about developments made in the last 15 years. But given the quality of what's on here, that's a minor quibble. Besides, it ends with a wonderful description of quantum computing theory, which more or less justifies my ""science is drugs"" tag, so all is forgiven.However, the coolest part of the book has to be the Cipher Challenge at the end- a set of 10 enciphered texts for the reader to solve. I solved the first two pretty easily, and I'm working on the third one. They're supposed to grow in difficulty, so maybe that's as far as I make it!"

The book is interesting to a layman such as myself, precisely because it moves through the history by focusing on secrecy and code breaking technological advances through indicative vignettes, ranging from Mary Queen of Scots to the Zimmerman letter of WWI and beyond. While I was not personally invested in the epilogue, Singh does provide a workbook of sorts to allow readers to attempt to decrypt (solve) example ciphers to apply lessons provided in the text; which is a cool idea, especially if I had the time/inclination.It has been a great aside from my normal self-selected texts, and certainly piqued my interest in some of the more secret service oriented maneuvers of WWII and the years that followed in Europe, so all in all a real winner!"
71,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22127882-farfignugen,5,"I loved this book. It is incredible how clever some of these British cryptanalysts were. Without ever laying hands on an actual German enigma (though having a Polish reconstruction), they were able to crack it - mainly by exploiting not implementation weaknesses of the machine, but execution mistakes on the part of the German operators. Other tidbits from history were also quite amusing, as the Mary Queen of Scots section, and the brief overview of Arab contributions to cryptanalysis.I would say this is a good book for history buffs and geeks. It gives good insight into exactly how communications get cracked, and the various tricks used to con the enemy into spilling the beans. It also demonstrates many popular ciphers of old. I thought it was quite interesting how the Enigma machine was essentially a multi-stage, electromechanically-implemented version of the classic pen-and-paper two-stage Vignere cipher.I did not pay close attention to the section on quantum cryptography at the end, since the mathematics and concepts are somewhat over my head, and to the best of my knowledge, actual quantum cryptography/decipherment has not yet been experimentally demonstrated."

Having said that, I found his writing style to be a bit too grad student paper-y for me.

Nevertheless, a truly interesting read for the most part and one I will definitely have to reference when teaching in particular about the history of warfare, as it's nice to know that defining moments hang as much on a series of letters as they do on a hail of bullets."
78,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11592552-daan-debie,4,"The Code Book gives a very comprehensive and detailed overview of the history of cryptography. One of it's greatest strengths is that it doesn't expect any prior knowledge of the reader, such as an advanced understanding of Mathematics or Computer Science. You could say it falls in the category of ""Popular Science"" books, but that doesn't detract in the slightest from it's comprehensiveness and usefulness.I used it as a textbook in the Cryptography 101 course I taught, and the students loved it! It also comes with software to try out a lot of the concepts talked about in the book. The Code Book CD-ROM, as it's called, is a bit outdated in terms of the user experience, and it sadly doesn't work on 64-bit systems, but apart from that, it's a great help."
79,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65913-tim,4,"A highly readable popular work on encryption, from the earliest substitution ciphers up through the Enigma machines of WWII, modern public-key encryption, and the possibility of quantum computation. Singh's book is really a textbook piece of popular science writing. Pick a topic that is (1) highly technical, but also (2) romantic and exciting. (3) Identify an organizing scheme (here: the arms race between code-makers and code-breakers) that you can return to periodically and use that principle to lay out the (4) history *and* (5) provide a pedagogical introduction to the concepts. The author hits all highlights and unless you're already an expert you're very likely to learn something. This is of course not the first or necessarily the best book on cryptography, but it's a fun intro."
80,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4356381-troy,4,"A very informative book about an interesting topic. Singh is a great writer, and I have thoroughly enjoyed a couple of his books now. He does an amazing job covering the history of a single topic, and I would definitely recommend his books to anybody with even the slightest interest in the topic he is covering. This book in particular is fascinating. It shows the progression of cryptography and cryptanalysis throughout history, illustrating the constant fight between code makers and code breakers. Many times we have thought codes finally reached the point of being unbreakable, yet this always fails to be the case. Overall, this is a great read, especially for anyone with an interest in puzzles. "
81,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9370434-earl,5,"A superb work on the history and logic of cryptography, I should say. From the baffling hieroglyphics to the cryptic enigma, Simon Singh was able to cover the important parts that defined the art of writing and deciphering the secret messages that people are sending over from one place to another. Most interesting for me is how the art of replacing letter gradually shifted to producing encrypted one-way mathematical functions, a complicated process that has been useful in our everyday life ever since RSA publicized its findings. This is a good read for those who are not only interested with sending and receiving encrypted messages but also for those who want to create one for themselves and their companions."
82,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22388092-tamaghna-hazra,4,"He starts out slow, with plenty of seemingly superfluous classifications but if you bear with him through the first few bits, he takes off on a delectable journey through the ages. A very refreshing take on the pivotal role that the security of communication has had on our history, which ends with a meaty and balanced discussion of the precariously balanced state of secure communication in the digital age. There were points when he moves painstakingly slowly, especially when he is explaining how a code works or something similar, and it isn't technically watertight in the quantum cryptography section, but he manages to distill the outsider's perspective and layman's understanding into an engrossing and well-packaged whole. Definitely, someone I would like to read again."
83,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/941200-ryan-reed,5,"You don't have to go to the nerdiest school in America, like I did (CMU. Sorry MIT you can't have the title. Your school has girls), to enjoy a book that is about the history of cryptography. No, really. Simon Sing weaves each of these items into an engaging narrative to introduce the concept. At times you'll forget that you're essentially reading a history mathematics. By the time he gets to the specifics of how the Allies broke the Nazi Enigma machine or the formula behind RSA encryption Sing has already gradually bumped up your IQ to allow you to understand it. Yes, you will understand it. You'll feel smarter for having understood it. "
84,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1113365-clay,3,"This was a engaging read. Even though I wouldn't say the title is completely inaccurate, it is a bit misleading. This edition of The Code Book is more of a synopsis of code history and code breakthrough both on the code making side and the code breaking side.The genius of some of those code makers and breakers is just astonishing. In addition to the great historical overview, it also discusses some of the security and ethical questions that we must face in this digital world.If you have an interest in code I would definitely recommend it, but if you have never been interested in code, this book probably would not excite you too much."
85,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1300032-keith,5,"To anyone interested n the art of cryptology, this is the book for you. It is simply written so that any novice can understand why coding messages is so important and why breaking codes is the same. Singh basically writes a chronological history of codes and code breaking as it occurred over the centuries. There are some excellent individual stories along with stories of countries using codes. Writing how each code became more complex and how each code breaker came up with ways to break the codes is fascinating, especially the way that Singh writes. If you are interested in this topic, this book is one that you won't be able to put down."
86,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5163298-becks,4,"Makes cryptography seem accessible to the reader new to the world of cryptography. I really enjoyed the intricate weaving of historical events and cryptography with a seamless weaving of the mathematical concepts to explain how those versions of cryptography work.The biggest drawback of this book is that it was written in the late 1990's, which is evident when discussing cryptography in the world today. It would be interesting if that section of the book would be updated to analyze the impact that 9/11 and the Patriot Act has had on cryptography.Overall, I would recommend this book. It definitely makes you want to encrypt everything you send over the internet, but in a good way."
87,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6827965-karol,5,"Simon Singh does a really great job in both explaining the concept of a cipher and/or attack on a it, as well as putting them in a useful context throughout history. Personally I was more interested in the latter, as I was quite familiar with most of the presented ciphers already. To learn about their historical context was both interesting as well as insightful. To be honest, I wasn't aware of the fact, that cryptography is that old, especially that it was used that much throughout ancient history and that the life of so many persons was depending on it.Definitely a must-read for anyone interested in cryptography and/or cryptanalysis."
88,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6462529-bhanu,3,"The book starts out and builds very well in the middle. It gives a good summary of the history of code-making and code-breaking. Some of the stories are really intriguing, the stories around WWII and the wars before that are a wonderful read.The book though begins to lose it's charm the moment it enters the post RSA phase of cryptography (post-1970). Explanation of RSA itself is too long and un-necessary (may be for those who know what it is), but the talk around quantum computing is absolutely useless. The book should have ended with RSA.Overall good fun read, could have saved some time not reading the end."
89,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11644366-rafaila,5,"The truth is that I absolutely hate history books and I find history very boring. So, when one friend recommented me this book, I was afraid that I won't like it.Well, in fact, the book is surprisingly amazing! I love everything related with cryptography, so it was absolutely delectable for me to learn, step by step, all the evolution from the ancient years til nowadays!Thumbs up for Simon Singh for keeping all my interest through almost 600 pages! I would definetely recomment it, and I am going to read his first book too, I really hope it is as good!(I just felt it was a pitty that the cryptography competition is over by now, otherwise I would definetely go for it!)"
90,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19133337-david-muir,5,"Loved this book. Fascinating glimpse into history as well as a being a readable primer on how to create and crack ciphers. Gives clear illustrations and makes the maths clear without dumbing it down. I especially enjoyed the sections on Babbage, the Enigma machine and the introduction to RSA and public key encryption. My only criticism is that the last chapter on quantum computing was a bit too speculative and theoretical... But it is a very minor criticism. Happy to recommend this book to anyone with even a passing interest in the science of secrecy. P.S. Just noticed... This is my first five star review. :-)"
91,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5142429-rob,5,"This is one of the best non-fiction books I've read.Of course, the subject is inherently interesting. But Singh stays away from what could presumably be some very interesting stories, and instead goes through how a variety of ciphers were invented and and exactly how they work.This could be a very dense and confusing book, but he keeps it readable without being condescending (which many popular books like this would do).By the time you finish this book, you'll understand RSA/PGP encryption, the Enigma machine, the dechiperment of Linear B, and quantum cryptography. And you'll be able to explain exactly how they work."
92,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13084633-monica,5,"My dad had a tall bookcase stuffed full of books. This would have been cool, but they were all technical manuals and nonfiction books about computing, science, and math. I would spend a lot of time standing in front of these books as he worked on his computer next to me. I'd try to find something new to read that I might actually find compelling or interesting. Every single time, I'd walk away disappointed and go back to re-reading my beloved SFF YA. One day, he recommended this to me.It was absolutely phenomenal. Highly readable and engaging, informative, and fun. A wonderful memory and a wonderful book. Would re-read."
93,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8559936-d-ma-eleonora,4,"Got this from the library.Very entertaining and good read, up until the last chapter, where the author passes from RSA and PGP into more complex encryption, where I completely lost interest and skipped to the appendices.I really enjoyed the interview snippets and the historical information, as well as the biographical information on the person he's speaking about. It really adds character and dimension to the person, instead of just a name and accomplishments. I took extensive notes and have some jumping off points now.I'm a little disappointed that he does not mention numbers stations.Would recommend to new to the subject readers."
94,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5564949-stephanie,4,"I thought this book was fascinating. A book about cryptography can very quickly turn dry and boring, even for the nerdiest of us. However, the author impressively keeps things interesting, often describing different types of codes by giving examples of their use in history in a page-turning way. Even stories where I knew the end result - like the breaking of the Enigma during WWII - had me staying up far later than I should have so I could finish just one more chapter.Cryptography is one of my favorite subjects in computer science so I am probably biased, but I found this book to be well worth my time."
95,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10112134-lyndsey,5,"Singh has a good way of breaking down theory and concepts for the lay person, and making it feel like an adventure. This is a great primer on cryptography and it's history, told in a very engaging way. This, in my opinion, is what good non-fiction is about - drawing you in as much as any novel, with interesting stories that are made even more amazing because they're true! It made me want to read more about a vast array of subjects that Sing touches upon, in fact I picked up a book on Linear B today! (Though it isn't a ""code"" per se, Singh touches on lost languages since unraveling a lost language employs a lot of the same strategies that code breakers use.) Do it! Just read it already!"
96,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46073176-tomf,4,"An excellent overview of cryptography's influence on the world, and its inner workings. Singh travels swiftly but satisfyingly from the pre-crypto days of 'invisible' clay tablets, through the spy games that lost Mary Queen of Scots her head, into the war-altering mind-games of WW1 & 2, all the way up to current 'civil rights vs organised crime' dilemmas, and even off into the nearish-future of quantum cryptography. Interleaved amongst the history are dalliances with everything from 'boys own' challenges to examples of translating forgotten tongues, all embellished by the characters and happy accidents that have driven this 'arms race' on. 4+"
97,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46314890-n,4,"I thought ""The Code Book"" was a very informative and interesting book. Although it was interesting, I did have a bit of trouble getting through the quantum leap part of the book. It wasn't as interesting, to me, as the other parts of the book, such as where they wrote messages on people's heads, or executed Queen Mary. Overall, I thought the book was great, but there were just a few parts that were too complicated for me to understand without having to read it over many times, and I don't enjoy having to re-read things to understand them. I would suggest reading this to anyone who has any interest in codes, it is an interesting read."
98,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/836363-jeffrey,4,"Skillfully written and engaging history of the 2000+ year old struggle between the people who try to make messages secret and the people who try to decipher them. Singh is brilliant at creating detailed examples phrased for the general reader to demystify the math behind most modern cryptography, as well as finding historical examples of cryptography's often crucial role in world events. The only reason this book gets four stars instead of five is that it outdated... the last 10 years have seen exponential growth in the use and role of crypto, and this deserves a new revision to keep up. "
99,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6506088-elyse,4,"Can't say I followed everything in this book but I comprehended enough to enjoy it immensely. The secret codes used in early Western History (substitution and frequency codes) are easy to understand i.e. Mary Queen of Scots secret messages were fairly simple and it's a wonder she wasn't beheaded earlier. The Enigma machine and quantum cryptography made me dizzy. The author includes ""fun exercises"" in the back of his book. I skipped them. My brain is too out of shape. I mainly read this for the history of cryptology and I finished this book very satisfied."
100,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,4,"I am definitely not a maths geek and it's a tribute to Singh that I could follow the theory of cryptography enough to be excited about the process itself as well as the history of its role in politics, war and internet security. Fascinating at every stage. I found myself wanting to know what has happened in the 15 years since the book was published. His last chapter forecasts the current debates sparked by revelations of mass government snooping on mobile phone and internet communications. A great read somewhat to my surprise."
101,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11513040-siobh-n,5,"Another reviewer put it best in calling this geek porn, which is exactly what this is. The history, the math, the computer science, the linguistics, the politics: all of it was addictive. Some parts of the chapters did become more technical in how a process works but those I was able to follow along with due to my background in computer science; if you couldn't or didn't want to, you could just skim it and catch the gist. The last two chapters suffer the most due to the age of this novel but it's easy enough to imagine continuing his predictions forward, but an update would be fantastic."
102,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16038834-andrei-dulvac,5,"An interesting perspective on cryptography. This book works for everybody, providing accurate information on the cryptographic techniques to non-savvy readers and giving a juicy historical context to people familiar with the evolution of secret codes; also working well for everybody in between.It's incredible how such a topic can create climax and force you to read the next chapter and the next one, and the next one. Every time you think ""good for him/ her, this code is brilliant, it cannot possibly be cracked!"", you're proved wrong by the end of the chapter."

This is a book that is mostly self explanatory, it is a book about the history and art of ciphers from the most basic Caesar shift to quantum cryptography. This book can be hard to get into but once you do, stories of buried treasure and a arms race of sorts with the code brakers rushing to catch up with the code makers. It shows a different side of history and makes you think. I would recommend this book to people who like a challenge and want to learn something new. "
104,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/230344-james,4,"I'm generally not a fan of pop-science books, blogs, or magazines. I don't need or want the technicalest of readings, but something in between. This really fit the bill. For me, this was the perfect balance of giving me enough details and math to feel like I understand things more than just the headlines - so much so that I feel like the early chapters could be a primer for solving escape rooms. Difficult concepts were also explained with clear analogies, and I'm now only a little confused by the lack of physical key exchange in computer cryptography. :)"
105,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27279716-vishwanath-saragadam,5,"The book takes the reader from something as simple as the mono alphabet substitution cipher to making him/her relatively comfortable with understanding quantum cryptography. What is interesting is that the author has not intimidated the reader with jargon and technicalities, but has kept the book true to its name, popular science. A must read for everyone, especially to understand what it means to live in the information age and why cryptography is the daily bread of our communication systems."
106,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33131867-neha,4,"A fantastic mix of cryptography and history -- and good writing! In general, Singh presents the intuition well without assuming the reader has a technical background. This particularly helped for the last chapter dealing with quantum cryptography. Earlier in the book, however, I felt a bit babied (ex. He spent a paragraph explaining the definition of a prime number). Having a stronger technical background, I would've liked something a bit more math-based."
107,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21526761-jesse-voet,5,"Well written book, which gives a short summarised history of cryptography, in a format which is understandable for a broad audience, more than just computer specialists alone. The focus is more on the history and the purpose of cryptography, with some of these techniques explained. It is a bit outdated - written in the 90's, so much happened since, it could use an update. It read easily, and I would recommend it to everyone interested, as an introduction work."
108,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1452001-chris,5,"I really liked this! It's non-fiction, but it reads like a drama/thriller type book. I picked this up after reading ""Counting from Zero"" by Johnston (a fictional book), as he recommended it. The material is very approachable, you don't need special math skills or anything to understand it, as Singh does an excellent job walking through each kind of crypto he covers. It was also really cool to get a total understanding of the Enigma machine, as I never knew how one worked."
109,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6216433-wilson,5,"The more Singh I read the more I really wish I'd pursued maths further than I did. The man has an excellent ability to mix the maths and number theory behind a code/encryption/cypher with the personal, social, political, and historical context that really brings it to life. Singh brings an intrinsically theoretical concepts into so many dimensions. Excellent read, would recommend."

I thought the author had a good knack to explain the more math heavy parts without discouraging the less math and as a math nerd, I appreciated that I could still look up the more crunchy math bits in the annexes.of course, even with the layers of simplification and explanation, quantum physics hurts my brain."

Singh is surpassingly excellent at explaining abstruse topics in lay-person's language. Most of this book is timeless enough (most of it is a rollicking good historical narrative).

131,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82127794-claire-h,4,"I was all set to give this book five stars, but, well, we’ll get there. The book started out very strongly. I loved the detail. The histories are well-told and rich with contextual detail, and they paint a colourful and compelling picture of the evolving nature of cryptography and cryptanalysis from ancient times till the first and second world wars. There are moments now and again where the level drops right down Spot The Dog Does Codebreaking and the level of simplicity is actually a bit excruciating, and then it will suddenly leap up to Get Your Cryptography PhD Here, but these are forgivable given that at times the book attempts to explain the inner workings of complex machines undertaking even more complex tasks to total amateurs.But then something weird happens. Maybe the book needed to be finished or the topic got dry or the author lost interest. I don’t know. For about the last 25%, where the book turns to the digital age, the polish is lost. Sometimes it feels like whole paragraphs are repeating the same thing in different words, or that the ideas are disjointed, and that the meticulous care of the first three quarters just wasn’t present for the finish. Another major, but unsurprising issue, is that this book is now nearly twenty years old and the datedness is particularly obvious in the later sections on the internet, email, and online commerce. All that could be done here would be a revised second edition, but then, in another twenty year, we would be in the same position, so I would most strongly recommend this book for what it has to say about the origins of cryptography and cryptanalysis, and not so much for the current state of the art (which has presumably moved on radically in the past two decades).Overall, then, this is a fascinating read from start to finish. I learned a huge amount from it, touching on everything from quantum computing (which I now know at least something about, versus previously when I knew nothing) and photons to Euclid, prime numbers and factoring, to the work of various security agencies, and even some of the vagaries of the academic fields in question. It’s engaging, informative, mostly well-written, and the appendices at the back are an excellent addition, including as they do a series of ten increasingly difficult codes for the reader to break. In short, I strongly recommend it."

I have taken 3 days to plow through it because it is truly fascinating. One reviewer asked about the book's relevance today, as it was published in 2000 It is more relevant today, as our political system as well as internet freedom are both involved.Singh's explanations of how the codes and ciphers were built were difficult to read for a woman whose idea of a code was pig-Latin, but in persevering I finally begin to understood the massive complexity of the world before and after the Enigma machine (Robert Harris' terrific book touched on this and I now understand more fully). One civilization which Singh did not refer to is, oddly, one I am familiar with. The Maya civilization has a hieroglyphic record cut in stone, and the cartouches shown of Egyptian origin are remarkably similar to those of Chichen Itza. One error --though actually simply what history says about the death of Mary, the true Queen of Scotland and England--is in Singh's acceptance of the handwriting of the ""postscript"" regarding Elizabeth I's assassination plot. I have seen this letter inn its case and Mary's handwriting is a scrawl, while the postscript is in a strong precise script. Elizabeth I would never have let her opponent live.Fascinating reading and, as I said before, extraordinarily relevant. Imagine this month's headlines if Stroz and Page had not exchanged messages in ""plaintext""?"

It's like a mystery novel spanning millennia, tracking the development of encryption and decryption techniques, going hand-in-hand with warfare and the development of information technology.Mostly it's engaging because the fates of whole nations rested on people's ability to encrypt or decrypt important messages. But Singh also gets directly into the details of how these techniques worked, which is the other half of the fun. These people were really smart and obsessive. Following as they try to create and solve puzzles is exciting and endearing, and the technology is incredibly interesting.My only complaint is that the book is twenty years old and I'm curious about the state of digital (and quantum) cryptography today. I need to find another book (or maybe a series of articles or essays) to catch my up on the last twenty years.I recommend this book to anybody who likes history, science, warfare, or real-life mysteries."

You won't find here much content regarding modern day, except rather enigmatic & abstract topic of quantum-based cryptography (seriously: this is a mind-boggling stuff, at least for me).What I've liked most? Historic content was very well picked - author didn't focus on the most basic cyphers that may seem very different (as they are many ...) but are in fact based on the very similar ideas, but he progressed towards more sophisticated methods - far more interesting & ... entertaining. Interludes about decyphering ancient writing forms (like hieroglyphs) could have been just a ""distractor"", but I've read them with undeniable pleasure.I'd very much like to give this one a full 5-star rating, but with such poor formatting it would just not be fair."

I thought it would take me a lot longer to get through this book, but I kept wanting to pick it up and read more. It was well written and kept my interest throughout with engrossing stories about the significance of cryptography throughout history. I especially liked the stories during WWII and their significance on the outcome of the war, with Alan Turing's cracking of the Enigma and the Navajo Code Talkers in the US. I knew I would enjoy learning about some of the mathematics behind the different ciphers but everything was well presented without getting overly bogged down with the details. At the end the book outlines some thought provoking moral arguments both for and against absolute secrecy of communication without getting too preachy for either side. Overall a great read - even for those who aren't into the math."

If you are a generalist like me.This book obviously covers cryptography, but it also straddles language, statistics, mathematics, war, social issues, history, politics, physics, romance, futuristic uses of quantum mechanics, and more. This book was a lot of fun for me to read. I know for some folks it would be exasperating.It is a great combination of story telling, theory, practice, and particulars. My only wish would be for Simon to do another, more recent edition of the book. This book was written in 1999, and so much has happened since then."

Ofcourse no-one had the time to test it, it would amount to nothing and infact I didnt even base my final year project on it.This book is a reminder of those days. Starting from the basics - monoalphabetic substitution to quantum computing (which I didnt understand), it covers pretty well almost everything worth knowing about cryptography. The sections on ancient scripts was a joy. So was the section on Americans using Navajo language as ciphertext. It is amazing how we know about Enigma but not Navajos.Found the cracking/cryptanalysis of Enigma a bit too much. But it can be safely skimmed. I think Simon Singh is the best science-fiction author. Sad to have finished all 3 major books by him !"

It combines a history of ciphers, codes, and code-breaking, along w/ info on digital encryption. A couple of the appendices contain codes for the reader to break, w/o the solutions, so they are a true test of your learning. (I solved all three of the quotes using the most basic code and the two using frequency analysis, but again, I really LOVE doing this.)I only got lost in the weeds in the chapters on digital encryption, just b/c the numbers are just mind-boggling. I think I understood the basic principle, though. This chapter made me happy that I had purchased the “young reader” version! If you enjoy history and are curious about codes, give this book a try.

The explanations given by the author are lucid and easy to understand in general terms. I am glad I read this book as it gave me some understanding of data encryption, private key & public key of which I had only known the terms so far. The chapter on quantum computing was very interesting though one has to be quite imaginative to understand its implications. And it is very difficult if not impossible to think how this will be brought about in future, if at all. Since the fundamental particles behave differently than the visible matter. I found the chapter on 'Hieroglyphics' a bit boring though."

He has a flair for narration and masterfully blends history and the notable cryptographic events. It is this particular aspect that makes this book a page turner. Reading this book is akin to embarking on an adventure through time where we witness the ingenious battle of wits between the code makers and the codebreakers. A must read for anyone who's interested in the science of cryptography."

About the ones who put the Rules and those who try to break them. It’s a battle of patience, intelligence and most importantly finding mere patterns in Grand Randomness all for the sake of just one thing, secrecy. The book unfolds the story of Cryptography through history in an elegant way. From the Egyptian, Greeks and The great Romans, moving to the world war II enigma and finally to RSA and the Quantum Cryptography. If you’re fascinated by codes, history, and encryption I’d suggest you pick up this book. "

Highly recommended read, truly fascinating from first to last page.PS. Addendum: I'd suggest to also check out the review written by Jim Reeds for this book (it's a four page pdf file, can be easily found online.)

I was genuinely surprised that the book was published in 1999 - it seems that most of the encryption details on RSA and PGP have not fundamentally changed since. Yes, the chapter on quantum encryption is a bit dated, but it still affords a great explanation of Shor’s algorithm and BB84. Most fundamentally, Singh writes in an extremely accessible style, combining the narrative and intrigue of war and politics with the skill and knowledge of cryptographers, linguists, and mathematicians. The book is well organized, clearly moving from simple to complex, although the placement of the Egyptian cryptography after Turing was a bit disorienting. Highly recommend for anyone interested in security in the modern era. "

My naïvety.Coming to the book review, the author has excellently explained the evolution of cryptography and codeanalysis with quite interesting anecdotes from ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography to keep the reader engaged and the working of those ciphers also demonstrated in layman terms. Interesting book for anyone looking for introduction to Cryptography evolution. "
146,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64484002-william-smith,3,"Singh eloquently retells salient moments in the history of code-breaking from the emergence of steganography, with examples including the Babington Plot and Demarcus' betrayal of Persia, to the transition from the mono- to poly-alphabetic cipher, namely the Vigenere Square due to the ramifications of Arabian-devised frequency analysis - a core example of the basis of cryptography . These key moments, and others including the cracking of Scherbius' one-time pad cipher, the Enigma machine, by the ingenuity of Rejewski and the Bletchley group, are intertwined with comprehensive but not exhaustive mathematical analysis that partially illuminate the underlying discoveries of modern mathematicians and linguists in this field. In short, Singh's book provides a competent indulgence into some of the subjectively important events in the history of code-breaking with a diverse range of examples stretching from the use of Navajos language in the Pacific by the Americans in WW2 to the deductions of Kober, Ventris, and Chadwick unveiling the origins of Cretan lost language famously named Linear B as well as the advent of Zimmerman's 'pretty good privacy' encryption to the general populous. In addition, topics such as quantum computing as well as a more poignant discussion into the divide between privacy and security are transiently addressed. In summary, like Singh previous work ('Fermat's last theorem'), this is an approachable yet roundabout glance into cryptography providing an adequate synopsis or introduction into a detailed, a naturally secretive, field.

The final chapter about quantum cryptography and computing seemed a bit unpolished but it might have been because the subject itself is difficult (and I don't have a clear understanding of it either).Books like these make me wonder if future generations will find concepts which we now consider advanced, very easy.

170,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4706292-adam-wiggins,5,"Political assassination plots, romantic liaisons, military secrets, and buried treasure are just a few of the themes wrapped up in the history of cryptography.This book makes an dry and highly technical subject extremely accessible. First, by telling these stories from history -- ranging from the assassination plot by Mary, Queen of Scots against Queen Elizabeth of England in 1586 up through the political martyrdom of Phil Zimmerman for the invention of PGP encryption, which brought computerized encryption to the masses and ushered in the era of secure online commerce. And second, by providing plainly-written step-by-step descriptions of the functioning of each cipher and the technique that can be used to break it. It should be noted I have a professional background in software cryptography, but I still think these descriptions would be understandable to a lay audience.For example, a monoalphabetic substitution cipher (what I call ""secret decoder ring cryptography"") was the world's gold standard for encryption for thousands of years -- until Arab mathematicians invented frequency analysis in the 9th century AD, almost completely nullifying the value of that cipher.Thus began the arms race between cryptographers (aka codemakers) and cryptanalysts (aka codebreakers), a multi-eon game of cat and mouse between thousands of the world's mathematical and linguistic geniuses. This war is fought almost completely behind closed doors because of the massive military value of secure communications, so most of these individuals didn't get recognition for their work until after their death.One of the most tragic cases is Alan Turing, who broke the Enigma cipher during World War II, and in the process invented the modern computer (""Turing machine""). Despite having almost single-handedly defeated the Nazis and creating the technology that would usher in the Information age for mankind, his work was considered military secrets and known only to a few. He was outed as a homosexual in his middle years, resulting in criminal prosecution and chemically castrated by the government. He committed suicide a few years later.The book also takes a chapter to dive into a related topic: deciphering ancient written languages. While not cryptography, similar sleuthing techniques can be applied to try to read written texts in languages that have been lost to humanity's collective knowledge. The book details the deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphs (made somewhat trivial by the discovery of the Rosetta Stone, the ultimate crib), and Linear B (a script used in the kingdom of Minos, the place where the labyrinth/Minotaur legend originates). Linear A remains undeciphered and continues to enthrall the minds of linguists and codebreakers to this day.The book was written in 2000 and concludes by talking about the battles between civil libertarians (who wished to make encryption freely available for all) and governments (who wish to control encryption as a weapon of war). This is instructive in and of itself -- just in the twelve short years since that time, this issue has been completely resolved. The civil libertarians won, and as a result we have a thriving online economy made possible by asymmetric key cryptography."

He touches on all the topics I'm interested in; including cryptography during roman times, the dark ages, renaissance, the great wars and most recently during the growth of the internet. He describes concepts with sufficient brevity such that I'm never lost or bored, but with enough technical details such that my intellectual curiosity is satisfied; there's always the appendix if the main text is not enough. His writing is very clear and conscience making it a very simple and fluid read, but I still feel as though I become a better reader and writer due to the discrepancy in our literary abilities. Overall, I just love reading his books. My favorite part was definitely the section about internet cryptography, diffie-hellman and RSA public key cryptography. These were all concepts I was familiar with, but this text brought a lot of clarity to it in terms of how it's implemented, how it works, and I really enjoyed reading about the history behind how these algorithms were created and the people who created them. In particular, I also loved that he shed light on Ellis at GCHQ. I had also known for quite a while that quantum computers could brake our cryptography but never understood why until reading this book. I loved every bit of it.That being said, everything from how Egyptian hieroglyphics were being deciphered, to the Rosetta Stone, the various cyphers (monoalphabetic, enigma, vigenere) all have fascinating stories and histories behind them. Small things like knowing that the decipherment of the enigma machine started in Poland, and Alan Turing based his grand ideas on the work of previous cryptoanalysts. Or the fact the Beal ciphers had never been deciphered and gold may still be lying around. Perhaps that the young professor (whose name escapes me) was so excited by his decipherment of Egyptian text he fainted. It's also hard to believe that in the 1970s, there were messengers flying around the world delivering keys because there was no other way to exchange keys. All of this is extremely interesting, and it's amazing to see how far we've come and see the path we took to get there.Thank you for putting this together Simon!"

175,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1223283-tanya,4,"I really enjoyed the majority of this book, as it traced the development of code-making and code-breaking. Some of the material was familiar to me, as I recently read The Girl Who Smashed Codes, but I feel this book did a much better job of explaining the process of code deciphering. Starting with the simplest shift cyphers, it walks the reader through monoalphabetic cyphers, the Vigenere square, and more, showing weaknesses and ways to attack these codes, such as frequency analysis. I was especially impressed with Singh's clarity in revealing the processes of the Enigma, Germany's encryption machine from WWII, and his detailed explanations of how this complex code was cracked. Another chapter that amazed me was ""The Language Barrier,"" which discussed the decoding of Linear B script from Minoan Crete. The Code Book demanded very concentrated brain power from me, especially when it got into the nitty-gritty of computer encryption and the solution to the key-distribution problem. For the first time in my life I encountered the concept of modular arithmetic, which I think I understand the basics of now, though I'll probably have lost the details by tomorrow morning. (Alas, if only I could hold onto everything I read!!). Anyway, I only skimmed the last chapter of this 1999 publication, which covers Singh's musings about the now-past future of cryptology. One really cool feature of this book which I did not avail myself of: after the appendixes are a series of increasingly difficult ciphers. Really motivated readers can take what they have learned from the book and put it into practice. Honestly, my brain is too tired to even try!4 stars, though I wish Singh would write another chapter on the advances of 2000-2018! Still, everything but the final chapter is completely relevant to today, and presented in an exciting and comprehensible way, even for non-math and computer people."

As a not-so-technical geek, I found the explanations clear and easy to follow, particularly on the current RSA method of encryption. A far more techy-geek friend tried to explain the concept but didn't make it clear; subsequent Wikipedia study left me still in the dark. But Singh came through, finally enabling me to grasp the concept.The book also contained a number of anecdotal tidbits I look forward to following up on. The mathematician who told the poet that 'a man born every minute' should be changed to the more precise '1 1/16 of a man born every minute' literally made me laugh out loud. Poland's triumph over the German Enigma machine after Britain and France gave up made me clap my hands. The Navajo contribution to American WWII security was awesome.There were some things left hanging. I was left curious as to the of Polish cryptographers after German invaded, not to mention curiosity over how they kept the enemy from realizing Enigma was cracked. I learned that the head of Britain's WWII team was punished even more by the government he'd served. And the author's reference to the Kama Sutra as a book teaching women how to work on practical skills left me wondering if there were two books of the same name (there aren't).Overall, however, I found the book a fascinating and easy read (though it would have taken me more time had I actually taken the author up on his frequent code breaking challenges). Very insightful and educational.In fact, clarify just how smooth and interesting it was read, I'm suggesting it my year old, spy (and , but not book) obsessed son."

The chapter on Enigma was a really tough one personally. I feel perhaps a few more illustrations could've helped. I may re-read that chapter just to understand a bit more."
178,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9755537-muhammad-al-khwarizmi,4,"Really good history overall with a few flaws, none of them a deal-breaker.One was perhaps inevitable: the way the mathematical and computational content is presented. While Singh gets credit for avoiding the dismal trend in science writing for a general audience towards glibness, he sort of finds an unhappy medium. This content is in places described in sufficient detail to say something concrete, yet leave something essential out. Since I read this book as a prelude to more a technical exposition of cryptography, I eventually decided to focus mainly on the historical content, as well as skipping most of the discussion on Linear B and the final chapter's discussion of quantum cryptography. (That stuff is not historical as such and—barring classified breakthroughs—too far away for me to be greatly concerned with at the moment; in any case I'd rather approach it with a stronger grasp of quantum mechanics and quantum computing.)Surprisingly, he also repeats the myth that ARPANET was devised to keep vital military communication alive in the event of nuclear attack.But overall this was well worth the read and amazingly brisk. Unless my focus is stronger than usual, Singh has a real knack for clear writing."
179,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/578536-ty,5,"i have always been fascinated by codes and encryption, so i really enjoyed this book about the history of codes. after all the history of codes is history: wars, spying, intrigue, politics... the book starts with the earliest known codes from Greek and Egyptian times and works through all the major conflicts in history. starting around WW1, the story of codes merges with the history of computing, as the first machines were invented and then enhanced. Singh does a great job highlighting the incredibly critical role that codes (Alan Turing and his machines, the Navajo code talkers of the Pacific, Enigma, etc.) played in how WW2 turned out. the most interesting part for me was a straight language description of the modern encryption standards like DES and RSA. i finally understand these after years of using them. the book was published in 2000, so it finishes with an early look at the growth of the internet and the first wave of massive information gathering by the NSA. lots of great info...would like to see an updated version one day."
180,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/774453-rowland,5,"An excellent read. I never realised how far back encryption went and how interesting it’s history (present and future) can be. Mary Queen of Scots undoing was weak encryption. World War II’s allied victory is attributed to the information received through the breaking of the Enigma code. Treasure apparently buried in the USA with the location encrypted and published in the Beale Papers (yet to be decrypted). Today we are all indebted to cryptographers who developed DES and RSA encryption without which shopping online would not be possible.The Code book also goes through the process of how Egyptian Hieroglyphics (both in meaning and phonetics) were deciphered, and the ancient language of the Mycenaean called Linear A and B, (although Linear A has yet to be deciphered).Overall this is a very well written book that allows you to understand the intricacies of encryption and decryption and at the same time keep things interesting. "
181,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4218513-d,5,"After reading Cryptonomicon (one and a half year ago), I decided I wanted to know a bit more about cryptography and ordered this book. It took a while for me to start it (one and a half years), but it was definitely worth it. Singh takes the reader through the history of cryptography, pretty much from start to near-future and does it in a way anybody can understand. His writing style is very 'chatty', informal, and he often tells fun and engaging little (true) anecdotes and stories involving crytography to illustrate his points. And talking about illustrations, this book is chock full of them! And they are often well chosen and very helpful.Many times, I wished he would go a bit deeper into the technical details, but I understand this wasn't his aim when he wrote this book. I suppose I'll have to do some further reading for that. For what it is though, I feel this book couldn't do its job better."
182,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5024788-eric-kolb,3,"This book was essentially a primer on cipher-breaking, stepping through the most primitive monoalphabetic ciphers and advancing through the decipherment of Enigma in WWII and the birth of modern cryptography. This story is well appointed with historical narrative, but this starts to fade fast in the modern era. While the drama of cryptography and cryptanalysis was literally a matter of life and death in the time of Mary Queen of Scots and through to WWII, western courtrooms strip the drama down like a collapsed soufflé. Furthermore, I ran into a challenge against my expectations from when I bought the book: I was thinking this was a recent publication from Singh. In truth, it's actually one of his first books, and the sources he cites when discussing the importance of modern crypto are already ten years dated. That doesn't make them any less valid, but in the Information Age, a decade is a very long time to overlook."
183,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2822398-avinash,5,"The title pretty much says it all: Secrecy in communications from Ancient civilizations to the current age RSA ciphers and a peek into the future of cryptography. The book is very well written in terms of maintaining the balance between the technical details of various ciphers and interesting tales from history where the respective cryptography techniques played a crucial role. At places I felt that the author could have made the mathematical details less elaborate. But I suppose its done deliberately so that the book can be accessible to wider range of readers. The chapter on RSA topic is a good read. Starting from the roots of the search of pre-agreed key less method and how that lea to Public key cryptography.I really liked the part at the end too, about Quantum physics, quantum computing and quantum cryptography. It definitely aroused my curiosity regarding Wave-particle duality. I am going to look for books, not totally technical physics textbooks, o these topics. "
184,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16747730-bao-thai,5,"It is a great book about the history and development of ciphers and the battle to attack different kinds of cipher. The stories in the book suggest how important ciphers are in shaping the modern world as well as in daily life. The ending chapter of the book also raises the wariness of people about privacy and how to protect privacy in the modern Information Age. The only downside of this book is the fact that it was written more than 10 years from now, which mean that many technology that is described as ""modern"" in the book might have been obsolete. Based on the information given in this book (as well as other sources online) and my little knowledge of Java programming, I was able to write programs that mimic and even enhance the Enigma cipher, do automatic Vigenere, Affine and Ceasar encryption and frequency analysis. I am also working on RSA and Diffie-Hellman public key transferring algorithm on Java based on the description in the book. Thanks so much Mr. Singh!"
185,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4061431-alex-jones,5,"I found this book exceptionally interesting and extremely well written. It mixes up the details of code making and breaking with their historical details in a really readable manner. I found all the technical details very easy to follow (and unlike other 'pop-science/maths' authors, it isn't over simplified to the point of being incomprehensible) and in sufficient detail that I can understand the formal aspects at work. The historical side was really interesting and it was all wrapped up in a very followable package. Whilst the internet side already seems like it is starting to need updating (one example involved a 1MHz processor...) it had some very prescient points and the fundamentals, to my knowledge, are unchanged. The section discussing how much access governments should have to our private communication, given the recent revelations about how much access they do have, was particularly interesting. Highly recommend for anyone marginally interested in cryptography!"

I like when non-fiction books feed me detail a little beyond what I actually want... this book did that... fluid writing style that builds tension and then pays off... for the most part, it did... one that ties together improbable elements like Mary Queen of Scots and the Enigma Cipher... yup... but I was ready to put it down... the great ones you want to go on forever...His discussion of the future of cryptography (this book written in 1999) presages the Snowden affair and the continuing battle between NSA surveillance and individual privacy rights... he does his very best to make quantum computing understandable and interesting... I loved the intrigue surrounding Mary QOS.... but the best bits were on Enigma/Ultra and on the deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphics, IMO... this is a very good read and not too long... highly recommended!

187,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8359144-rockwell,5,"I've been chasing this book for ages (I think it was recommended in the further reading section of Cryptonomicon?), and ended up having to get it through an inter-library loan. I'm really glad I did - it's lucid, readable, charming, and surprisingly funny. It has some great stories, and some great examples for you to play along with. Most importantly though, it describes some truly funky mathematical ideas in a way that a non-mathematician can actually follow, while still highlighting the breakthrough required to come up with them in the first place. I really enjoyed this, and I plan to track down my own copy to keep and lend out to other people. Even if it is a little old.(The last chapter or two, on the future of cryptography, are simultaneously super dated and weirdly prescient in a post-Snowden landscape. )"

Cryptographic techniques explained in the context of major ND minor historical makes for one unexpectedly wild read. Upon finishing the book, one can expect to fully appreciate the genius that goes into both code-breaking and code-making. I am a software engineer, and I have done little work(wait, none) in the area of cryptography. This book exceeded my expectations and served as a delightful introduction to the topic. The beauty of this book is that it can be appreciated by anyone except the most knowledgeable of experts. Singh is capable of taking a florist, and enabling them to converse with and enlighten peers on both future cryptographic methods and those of the years gone by. I will now move on to the book 'Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms and Source Code in C' by Bruce Schneier, as it provides practical teachings for implementing many of the modern algorithms discussed in this book.."

You'll zoom through it, only to find yourself wishing for more when you're done. But, the author's clever storytelling ability makes it accessible and compelling enough to get anyone hooked."

Goes from the methods used to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphs, to other key historical stories involving broken ciphers and the military applications and work done on codes and code breaking by brilliant minds in the field of cryptology. Moves on to the internet era with good explanations of encryption methods for the masses and how the extraordinary minds of the geeky minded civil libertarians who believe in privacy for the average person (the masses - lol) worked so hard to invent these things for us. Ends with an overview of quantum mechanics and quantum physics theories, 'ideas', critical overview points... and goes on to discuss what some possible ramifications will be when we figure out how to build a quantum computer. Yes I am a geek... "
191,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/157265-chris-herdt,4,"The main reason Chassy lent this book to me is for the chapter explaining asynchronous or public key cryptography, which makes secure communication over the Internet feasible. I had to read that chapter twice, but I am happy to say that I understand it now.However, the rest of the book is pretty amazing too. The Beale Cipher is a fantastic story (and which I believe is a hoax, although you never know), and cracking the German Enigma machine is an important and often overlooked part of W.W. II history. On top of that, you get Linear B--a fascinating tale of how a dead language was resurrected.It is interesting to note the early deaths of many of the wunderkinds and polymaths whose achievements comprise this book. One is bound to get the impression that a great mind is doomed to die young, but I wonder if perhaps they all chain-smoked."
192,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444658-charlie,3,"Simon Singh traces the history of cryptography (creating secret codes) and cipher-breaking (code breaking) explaining each step by exploring more and more complex codes. Singh begins each chapter explaining how each new secret code was discovered finishing with how it was cracked. I experienced the same emotion with each chapter. First, amazed about how clever and creative the code creators were. Each new code seemed unbreakable but by the end of each chapter I was even more surprised by the genius of the code breakers and how they found weaknesses in the codes to exploit. This book was a good ""Math Geek"" book being both technical and complicated at times. Little was held back in the areas of mathematics which I appreciated. I would recommend this book to any who finds this topic interesting."

Reminded me of Timothy Ferris' ""Coming of Age in the Milky Way"" (which is amazing)—both good historical narrative along with the nuts and bolts of the science. All the material up through WW2 kept me super engaged. Slight drawback is his over-over-over explanation of technical details. ""Yes, I already know how the Enigma machine enciphers, because you explained it ten pages ago. And ten pages before that. And ten pages before that. And I still remember all three times you've already explained it."" But other than that, really engaging. But after WW2 it starts to go downhill. RSA and public-key encryption sections are okay, PGP is mediocre, and the chapter on the future of cryptography is downright bad. So first 70% of the book is really good; after that it's your call whether to keep going."

This was actually a required textbooks for a friend's college course, and I borrowed it after he was done with the class. I literally read it in five days. Me, having studied linguistics, absolutely loved everything this had to offer. From the story of Mary Queen of Scots to cracking the German Enigma cipher to encryption in the digital age, there was simply so much to learn that I couldn't put it down.This book was written in 1999, back when the digital age was picking up enormous speed. I can only imagine what changes in codes and encryption have happened since then, and hope that Singh would come out with an updated version of this book sometime in the future.Must read for puzzle and language and math lovers."

My favorite part was the discussion of the work to crack the enigma code. Imagine that the ability to read or not read Nazi communiques literally meant the difference between life and death to members of your family, community and nation. Imagine that your activities in this intellectual pursuit of decryption made you a target of Nazi Germany. It's not just a puzzle you are solving, but life and death is in the balance. On another front, imagine that you had broken the enigma code and were responsible for saving countless lives, only to be imprisoned for a homosexual act with no one knowing your role in the war? In the end this book, brought a very human element to what might seem such a cerebral activity. "
196,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6593701-josh-davis,5,"An amazing overview of cryptography. Like the title suggests, the author takes us through history to show how cryptography has changed and evolved. It is such an interesting story.I felt the last few chapters had the most bang for the buck. Considering the PRISM project has been unveiled by Edward Snowden and run by the NSA, I couldn't help but compare what some of the early pioneers of cryptography, like Phil Zimmerman, warned when information was speeding around the internet without being encrypted.I definitely recommend this book if you want generally learn more about cryptography. The explanations are at times a bit dry and go on and on, but for the most part it is essential to understand them at a basic level (like symmetric key encryption, RSA, PGP, etc) if one wishes to discuss the implications of them."

SO that is why I liked it that much. But it's not for everybody.. difficult book, it sucked your attention from the outside world, if you read it properly of course. I've started three times before I've finally been able to finished it. Because I wanted to cherish the knowledge, use my brain and think through while reading. Finally I've found the time, on my vacation; during the day, on the beach :) evenings, on the balcony with the wind.. Not an ideal holiday for most of the people, I know :) to learn something on your free time; deal with math, solve cryptic texts or so. But, it was perfect for me. My only regret is, that I wish I've come across this book at the year 1999 :)"

I already familiar with a couple of computer science story (ie:the once powerful enigma machine, the tragic story of alan turing, etc) as well as some historical account of WW2 (ie: karl donitz, the highly successfull nazi admiral that eventually became hitler's successor), but finding the relationship between those two was quite eye opener. turns out that part of donitz's success was due to his men's discipline not to use regular predictable pattern when using enigma machine, the only hole available for british cryptanalyst to crack the code.another nice feature inside this book is that, the author spent lots of pages describing the personality of each actor, something that you can't find on cryptography course book. 5 stars."

Funny how things in life collide- In the middle of reading this, I saw the movie The Imitation Game, which is all about- you guessed it, code breaking! I'm happy I read some non-fiction material about Alan Turing before seeing the movie so I could tell what was just made up to make the movie more dramatic. Really fascinating work, and I can't believe it stayed classified for so long. I loved reading about the history of code breakers from ancient Egypt to WWII to more recent computer encryption. What I wasn't so into were the extensive examples and explanations of the minute details. I'll admit I skimmed some of the detailed math, which is why this isn't a 4 star book for me.

The book provided good details but didn’t get too technical in most places. The author provides an extensive list of materials for further reading and research so it’s easy to find more information on any topics of interest. While it is a little bit of a digression, I enjoyed the sections of translating ancient languages like Egyptian hieroglyphs and Linear B the best. I’ll admit, I didn’t find the final sections of the book on current web security and digital encryption methods as interesting as some of the older history. Overall, an enjoyable and informative read."

Even though the 2 last chapters are a tiny bit outdated, since the main focus is the history and evolvement in cryptography you should have no problem with the accuracy of all the information in here. It's particularly interesting to see how cryptography involves such a wide range of fields from mathematics to archeology and linguistics, which means no matter what type of nerd you are you would definitely find some topic you love! Especially if you took a course in abstract algebra and studied factorization of polynomials, you would find lotsssss of cool stuff in here! No worries if you don't have a strong math background though, Simon Singh did explain everything really thoroughly in my opinion, so definitely check the book out if you're in need of an exciting non-fiction :>"

Great book!I recommend this to anyone interested in math, history computer science or all of the above. There's even a chapter that deals extensively with archaeology and linguistics. The research is incredible. However, do not shy away for fear of math. Almost all the math is simply straightforward, and its most of it is not even necessary that you really understand. The only part with slightly more advanced math is very well explained, and even if you don't understand it, the general concept will suffice to continue on in the book.I recommend the print version because of the graphics and the cipher challenge at the end."

I have a background in mathematics and eventually read it because of something that came up at work, but I'm really glad I did. It's very well written, describing the progression of cryptography through the centuries. Various important events are described in enough detail to give the reader an understanding, but without going into a lot of technical detail (although many references are given for those who are interested). I would recommend this to anyone with a casual interest in the subject. People with a scientific or mathematical background would probably get a lot out of this book, but anyone can follow the descriptions of the various cyphers."

Singh cleanly explains the history and concepts, expertly showing the evolution of codes and ciphers, and the methods used to break them; and how they changed the course of history at various important points.The chapter on Quantum Cryptography might take several readers to grasp the concepts, but that's not Singh's fault. Blame the universe for acting so screwy at subatomic levels. Singh does a fine a job as any author could explaining the subject."
210,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38988786-neil,5,"This book was amazingly approachable and actually fun to read. It explains cryptography through a chronological series of important events. In each event, the course of history was changed by a secret being unlocked or kept hidden by a new cryptographic idea. In addition to being entertaining, this format lends itself well to concepts becoming incrementally more complex as history plays out. The concepts build on each other very smoothly and were much easier to understand than I expected.I've always been curious about how security works. Now I know!I highly recommend this book."

I especially like the book because it sequentially went through the development of modern cryptography and tied it together with historical events. The book dually taught cryptography and history; assuring that the cryptography aspect would stick because of the history behind it. The book really did cover everything from ""The science of secrecy from ancient Egypt to quantum cryptography"". ""The Code Book"" is essentially a manual and a tremendous one at that. Simon Singh did a fine job with this book."
212,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31053607-amaan-cheval,4,"Simon Singh's books seem to be quite enjoyable because he dives deep into the history of a field, crafting cinematic narratives out of what might otherwise simply be disjointed events in history. Most of the book was fairly simple (read: boring) for anyone who's taken a Crypto 101 course, but it was amusing nonetheless. Chapter 5 (The Language Barrier) talked about deciphering ancient lost languages (such as Linear B) briefly, and that was definitely my favourite chapter, along with Chapter 8 (about quantum cryptography). Overall, it's certainly a good book!"

What I found interesting is the history and importance of cryptology and how it could make our break successful campaigns. The future and importance of data security is now of equal importance in the mass market due to the proliferation of computers. We need to protect our security from crooks as well as overzealous governments. Governments need also to make sure crooks and terrorists are dealt with swiftly.

215,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078732-will,4,I've had an interest in cryptography most of my life so I was already aware or had at least heard of most of the topics/concepts written about in this book but I was still impressed with the way that Simon Singh presented the subjects. The book shows the human element of cryptography and places the abstract concepts in their historical context. My only disappointment is that the book is very much out of date in terms of modern computer cryptography but I suppose that cannot be helped.
216,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1769702-richard,4,"Mr. Singh's book on cryptography and cryptology is a fascinating read, if you're already interested in that sort of thing. It's a little breezy in parts, and the chapter on quantum computing and cryptography gets a little dense (unless you've already got a good grounding in quantum physics, I suspect). Even so, it's a great book for stimulating thought about concepts like privacy and what we consider to be privileged communication, or how we would protect it."
217,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16901153-lindsey,3,"Lots of fascinating stories from history about how different codes were broken from antiquity to modern times. Admittedly, I was less interested in the encryption methods for computers than the ones used during the world wars or the uncovering ancient texts. I skimmed some of the more technical aspects of the book, preferring to concentrate on the impact of breaking various codes and the people who were able to do so. Enjoyable read - 3.5 stars. "
218,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12623961-alex,5,"This is an excellent and thorough introduction to cryptography and newcomers to the field will hopefully be drawn into the world of codes, code-makers, and code-breakers. Even if you are not new to cryptography you will still gain something from it. I'm pretty well-read in this area but enjoyed the explorations of some topics I was rusty on, including the Vigenere cipher and the analysis of Linear B. "

I have always loved math and codes, the author broke everything down to simple enough terms for anyone to understand. It was quite amazing to read about so many people were unable to talk about their achievements in code breaking until decades later. If you have any interest in code making, breaking, or how forgotten written words are unlocked this is the best book I have read for it all."

I found the parts on modern cryptography a little hard to get through having studied it previously and there not being much history/drama to that part of the book. Still, it's only a small portion of the book and the rest more than makes up for any lack of excitement in those chapters. Fascinating read, highly recommended!"
221,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21919657-sirbriang2,4,"A very interesting and well-explained history of cryptography and crypto analysis. The explanations and examples made sense without seeming too dumbed-down. The last two chapters are the least interesting because they become a discussion of cryptography by computer. It makes sense to discuss this, but the time it took to explain the concepts felt like a drag. Also, many of the claims about the future of computing (written in1999) are a little dated. "

It was heavier on the practical aspects of breaking certain codes, and in some cases I skipped through these rather than following them step by step (though, if you're more inclined to follow the techniques through from start to finish - it would be a very good read!)

Its fascinating to read regarding the war between code-makers (cryptographers ) and code-breakers ( cryptoanalysts ). How encryption enabled Germans to dominate the World War II and the importance of code breaking or crypt-analysis has been explained vividly by the author. The ending of the book is bit weak, else its a wonderful read overall"
227,0385495323,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7967425-chris,4,"A really interesting read that did an excellent job of explaining how asymmetric keys and RSA encryption work. The tone of the book seemed to shift about halfway through when the topic switched from simple codes and ciphers (like the Caesar cipher and the German Enigma machines) to data encryption. It could use an update, though, as it was written at the turn of the century and we've come no closer to quantum computers but have seen a rise in cryptocurrency like BitCoin. "

The author also explains the various cipher and code systems at, for my liking, just the right level of detail. 3 stars from me is perhaps a bit mean but I didn't feel it was quite engrossing enough to merit 4. Still very much a recommended book."

My only criticism would be that, despite a repeated theme throughout the book about how we become very confident that a cipher is secure, only to discover it's not quite as secure as we thought... the book concludes, without a lick of irony, discussing how quantum cryptography is the final word in crypto. :|"
