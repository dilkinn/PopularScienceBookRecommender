0,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,4,"The doorbell rang the other day and when I answered it, there was a very slick guy in a nice suit standing there and a limousine parked at the curb. He started shaking my hand and wormed his way into the house.“Mr. Kemper, I’m John Doe with Dee-Bag Industries Incorporated. I need you to sign some paperwork and take a ride with me. Don’t worry, I’ll have you home in a day or two,” he said. Then he pulled a document out of his briefcase, set it on the coffee table and pushed a pen in my hand. “Wait a second. What the hell is this all about?” I said as I tried to pick up the paper to read it, but Doe kept trying to force my hand with the pen down on it so I couldn‘t see what it said.“Oh, that’s just legal mumbo-jumbo. You’d rather try and read your mortgage agreement than this old thing. Just put your name down and let’s be on our way, shall we?” he said.There was a brief scuffle, but I managed to distract him by messing up his carefully gelled hair. As he shrieked and ran around looking for a mirror, I finally got to read the document.“This is a medical consent form. What’s going on?” I demanded as I shook the paper at him. Once he had combed and smoothed his hair back into perfection, Doe sighed.“Very well, Mr. Kemper. I guess I’ll have to come clean. Do you remember when you had your appendix out when you were in grade school?”“Sure. That gave me one of my better scars, but that was like 30 years ago. Why are you here now?” I asked.“You’re probably not aware of this, but your appendix was used in a research project by DBII,” Doe said.“Really? I assumed it just got incinerated or used in the hospital cafeteria’s meatloaf special. Why would anyone want to study my rotten appendix?”“Oh, all kinds of research is done on tissue gathered during medical procedures. Most people don’t know that, but it’s very common,” Doe said.“OK, but why are you here now?”“Well, your appendix turned out to be very special. It was secreting some kind of pus that no one had seen before. After many tests, it turned out to be a new chemical compound with commercial applications. So a patent was filed based on that compound and turned into a consumer product,” Doe admitted.“That sounds disgusting. What was it used in? Because I want to make sure to never buy it,” I said.“It’s the basis for the adhesive on Post-It Notes,” Doe said.“Are you freaking kidding me? Post-It Notes are based on my old appendix?”“I’m absolutely serious, Mr. Kemper. Now we at DBII need your help. Unfortunately for us, you haven’t had anything removed lately. So I have to get your consent if we’re going to do further studies,” Doe said.“But you already got my goo-seeping appendix. I don’t have another one,” I said. “True, but sales have been down for Post-It Notes lately. So after the marketing and research boys talked it over for a while, they thought we should bring you in for a full body scan. Maybe you’ve got a spleen giving out or something else that we could pull out and see if we could use it,” Doe said.“This is pretty damn disturbing,” I said.“Why? You’re an organ donor, right? Same thing,” Doe said.“I don’t consider someone lucking into an organ if the Chiefs win a play-off game and I have a goddamn heart attack the same thing as companies making money off tissue I had removed decades ago and didn’t know anything about,” I said.“Fortunately, the American government and legal system disagree. So how about it, Mr. Kemper? Will you come with me?” Doe asked.“I dunno. What’s my end of this? You already owe me a fat check for the Post-Its.”“Oh, no. You won’t get any money from the Post-Its, or if any future discoveries from your tissues lead to more gains.” Doe said.“That’s complete bullshit!”“Again, the legal system disagrees with you. But this is for science, Mr. Kemper. You don’t want to hold up medical scientific research that could save lives, do you?”“It’s for Post-It Notes!”“Maybe, but who is to say that the cure for some terrible disease isn't lurking somewhere in your genes? Could you live with yourself if you prevented crucial medical research just because you were ticked off that you didn’t get any money for your appendix? Remember that it’s not like you could have NOT had your appendix removed. At least, not if you wanted to keep living. And I highly doubt that you would have had the resources to have it studied and discovered the adhesive for yourself even if you would have taken it home with you in a jar after it was removed. We’re the ones who spent all that money to get some good out of a piece of disgusting gunk that tried to kill you. So shouldn’t we be compensated? What are you? Some kind of damn dirty hippie liberal socialist?” Doe said in disgust“You’re a hell of a corporate lackey, Doe,” I said.“Thank you.”“Fine. I’ll do it,” I said as I signed the form. “But I want some free Post-It Notes.”“No deal. Steal them from work like everyone else,” Doe said.******Obviously, I‘m a big fat liar and none of this happened, but I really did have my appendix out as a kid. Plus, my tonsils got yanked and I’ve had my fair share of blood taken over the years. What this book taught me is that it’s highly likely that some of my scraps are sitting in frozen jars in labs somewhere. Yours, too. If any of us have anything unique in our tissues that may be valuable for medical research, it’s possible that they’d be worth a fortune, but we’d never see a dime of it.Henrietta Lacks couldn’t be considered lucky by any stretch of the imagination. A black woman who grew up poor on a tobacco farm, she married her cousin and moved to the Baltimore area. Her husband apparently liked to step out on her and Henrietta ended up with STDs, and one of her children was born mentally handicapped and had to be institutionalized. In 1951, Henrietta was diagnosed with cervical cancer by doctors at Johns Hopkins. During her biopsy, cell samples were taken and given to a researcher who had been working on the problem of trying to grow human cells. Henrietta’s cancer spread wildly, and she was dead within a year. But her cells turned out to be an incredible discovery because they continued growing at a very fast rate. The doctor at Johns Hopkins started sharing his find for no compensation, and this coincided with a large need for cell samples due to testing of the polio vaccine. The HeLa cells would be crucial for confirming that the vaccine worked and soon companies were created to grow and ship them to researchers around the world. Since then, Henrietta’s cells have been sent into outer space and subjected to nuclear tests and cited in over 60,000 medical research papersUnfortunately, no one ever asked Henrietta’s permission and her family knew nothing about the important role her cells played in medicine for decades. Poor and with little formal education, Henrietta’s children were confused by what was actually done to their mother and upset when they learned that her tissue was part of a multi-million dollar industry that they‘ve received no compensation from..Rebecca Skloot has written a fascinating book that clearly outlines why Henrietta’s cells were so important, why she went unrecognized for decades, the pain it’s caused her family, and the way that new medical discoveries over the last sixty years have opened a potential Pandora’s Box of legal and ethical issues regarding tissue collection, research, patents and money. This book brings up a lot of issues that we’re probably all going to be dealing with in the future. Also posted at Kemper's Book Blog."
1,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"This is an all-gold five star read.It's actually two stories, the story of the HeLa cells and the story of the Lacks family told by a journalist who writes the first story objectively and the second, in which she is involved, subjectively. The contrast between the poor Lacks family who cannot afford their medical bills and the research establishment who have made millions, maybe billions from these cells is ironic and tragic. It has been established by other law cases that if the family had gone for restitution they would not have got it, but that's a moot point as they couldn't afford a lawyer in any case. I have seen some bad reviews about this book. People who think that the story of the Lacks - poor rural African-Americans who never made it 'up' from slavery and whose lifestyle of decent working class folk that also involves incest, adultery, disease and crime, they just dismiss with 'heard it all before' and 'my family despite all obstacles succeeded so what is wrong with the Lacks?' I wonder if these people who not only totally can't see the wonderful writing that brings these people to life and who so lack in compassion themselves are the sort of people who oppose health care for the masses? As an extremely wealthy American tourist once put it to me, he had earned good health care by his hard work and success in life, it was one of the perks, why waste good money on, say, a a triple-bypass on someone who hasn't even succeeded enough to afford health insurance? That they were a drain on society, non-contributors and not the way America needed to go to move forward.I don't think you can rate people by what they have achieved materially. Success depends a great deal on opportunity and many don't have that. Henrietta Lacks didn't have it and her children didn't have it, not even her grandchildren made much of a way for themselves, but the next generation, the great grandchildren - ah now they are going in for Masters degrees and maybe their children will be major contributors. The author intends to recompense the family by setting up a scholarship for at least one of them. All of us came originally from poverty and to put down those that are still mired in the quicksand of never having enough spare cash to finance an education is cruel, uncompassionate and hardly looking to the future.HeLa cells have given us our future. They are the most researched and tested human cells in existence. All of us have benefited from the medical advances made using them and the book is recognition of what a great contribution Henrietta Lacks and her family with all their donations of tissue and blood, mostly stolen from them under false pretences, have made. Indeed one of the researchers who looks like having told a lot of lies (and then lied about that) in order to get the family to donate blood to further her research is still trying to get them to donate more. She's a hard-nosed scientist, with an excellent job and income and to her the Lacks are no more than providers of raw material. Sometimes you can't make hard and fast rulings. No I don't think we should have to give informed consent for experiments to be done on tissue or blood donated during a procedure or childbirth - that would slow medical research unbearably. I don't think cells should be identifiable with the donor either, it should be quite anonymous (as it now is). However, there is only ever one 'first' in any sphere and that one does deserve recognition and now with the book, some 50 years after her life ended, Henrietta Lacks has it. Good on yer, Rebecca Skloot, you've done a good thing here."

“She's the most important person in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?”
I've moved this book on and off my TBR for years. The truth is that, with few exceptions, I'm generally turned off by the thought of non-fiction. I'm a fan of fictional stories, and I think I've always felt that non-fiction will be dry, boring and difficult to get through. Especially a book about science, cells and medicine when I'm more of a humanities/social sciences kinda girl.But this book... it's just so interesting. It's written in a very easy, journalistic style and places the author into the story (some people didn't like this, but I thought it felt like you were going along for the journey). It's all the interesting bits of science, full of eye-opening and shocking discoveries, but it's also about history, sociology and race.I started reading The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks while sat next to my boyfriend. Every so often I would unknowingly gasp or mutter ""oh my god"" and he was like ""what? what?"" and I hadn't even realized I'd done it out loud. It's just full of surprises - and every one is true! It uncovers things you almost certainly didn't know about. And it just shows that sometimes real life can be nastier, more shocking, and more wondrous than anything you could imagine.Maybe you've heard of HeLa in passing, maybe you don't know anything about these cells that helped in cancer research, in finding a polio vaccine, in cloning, in gene mapping and discovering the effects of an atom bomb; either way, this tells an incredible and awful story of a poor, black woman in the American South who was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She is given back her humanity, becoming more than a cluster of cells and being shown for the tough, spirited woman she was. From her own family life to the frankly nauseating treatment of black patients in the 1950s, her story emerges.Not only that, but this book is about the injustices committed by the pharmaceutical industry - both in this individual case (how is it that Henrietta's family are dirt poor when she has revolutionized medicine?) and on a larger scale (during the 1950s, many prisoners were injected with cancer as part of medical experiments!). It's hard to believe what so-called ""professionals"" have gotten away with throughout history - things that we generally associate with Nazi death camps.I honestly could not put it down. Maybe because it's not just about science and cells, but is mainly about all of the humanity and social history behind scientific discoveries. Maybe because Skloot is so damn passionate about her subject and that passion is transferred to the reader. Whatever the reason, I highly recommend it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"
3,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"This was a really good book that leaves one with more questions than it answers, especially at this moment with the explosion in investment and growth in health/biotech. A lot of those questions are ones I wouldn't know how to answer myself either. I think it's really important though that we all start grappling with and instituting better processes around things like informed consent. Also really horrible to think about this in larger societal terms, in the context of institutional racism, and the ways in which the Lacks family still is so socioeconomically disadvantaged while private biotechnology companies sell their mother's cells for so much money. I just feel so extremely uncomfortable with that. I think I wouldn't care so much if the cells were just part of the commons, available for free, or extremely cheaply, but to know people are profiting off of it, it really is quite disgusting. I try not to bring my politics to bear here quite too often but this really really makes me feel strongly that commercialization of things in biological research, especially people's biological matter and tissue shouldn't be happening. This whole situation just feels quite perverse honestly and the book left me feeling disheartened. The dual dehumanization of the Lacks family through science and commercialization is horrifying. And I think if we wants things to be better moving forward both need to be addressed, not just one."
4,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,5,"On October 4, 1951, Henrietta Lacks, a thirty-one-year old black woman, died after a gruesome battle with a rapidly metastasizing cancer. During her treatment, the doctors at Johns Hopkins took some cells from her failing body and used them for research. This was not an unusual thing to have done in 1951. But the cells that came from Ms. Lacks’ body were unusual. They had qualities that made them uniquely valuable as research tools. Labeled “HeLa”, Henrietta’s cells were reproduced by the billions over the following sixty years and have been instrumental in experiments across a wide range of biological science. Today, HeLa cells are sold by the vial at impressive prices. Yet, Ms. Lacks’ family has seen not a penny of compensation from the work that has been made possible by their relative’s unique cells. Rebecca Skloot - from Powell'sRebecca Skloot, a science writer with articles published in many major outlets, spent years looking into the genesis of these cells. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells four stories. First is the tale of HeLa cells, and the value they have been to science; second is the life of, arguably, the most important cell “donor” in history, and of her family; third is a look at the ethics of cell “donation” and the commercial and legal significance of rights involved; and fourth is the Visible Woman look at Skloot’s pursuit of the tales. Each story is significant. The contribution of HeLa cells has been huge and it is important to know how these cells came to be so widely used, and what are the characteristics that make them so valuable. Skloot goes into a reasonable level of detail for those of us who do not make our living in a lab coat. She adds information on how cell cultures can become contaminated, and how that impacts completed research. She also offers a description of telomeres, strings of DNA at the end of chromosomes critical to longevity, and key to the immortality of HeLa cells. Fascinating stuff. Henrietta Lacks - From Science And FilmSkloot constructs a biography of Henrietta, and patches together a portrait of the life of her family, from her ancestors to her children, siblings and other relations. It is with a source of pride, among other emotions, that her family regards Henrietta’s impact on the world. Skloot delves into these feelings, and the experiences the Lacks family members have had over the decades with people trying to write about Henrietta, and people trying to exploit their interest in Henrietta for dark purposes.The author had to overcome considerable family resistance before she was able to get them to meet with and ultimately open up to her. She takes us through her process, showing who she talked with, when, and the result of those conversations, what institutions she contacted re locating and gaining access to information about Henrietta and some other family members. Most interesting, and at times frustrating, is her story of how she gained the trust of some, if not all, of the Lacks family. This is like presenting a how-to of her research process, a blow-by-blow description of the way research is done in the real world, and it is very enlightening.The Immortal Tale of Henrietta Lacks has received considerable acclaim. It is all well-deserved. The book is an eye-opening window into a piece of our history that is mostly unknown. It presents science in a very manageable way and gives us plenty to think about the next time we have a blood test or any other medical procedure. This book may not be as immortal as Henrietta’s cells, but it will stay with you for a very long time.The HBO Film airs on April 22, 2017==============================EXTRA STUFF8/8/13 - NY Times article - A Family Consents to a Medical Gift, 62 Years Later3/29/17 - Washington Post - On the eve of an Oprah movie about Henrietta Lacks, an ugly feud consumes the family - by Steve Hendrix"
5,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34369915-nick,5,This is such an important story. HeLa cells were a miracle to humanity and all thanks to Hernietta Lacks and the doctor.It is a must-read.
6,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2085746-laura,3,"Fascinating and Thought-Provoking.
Strengths:
*Fantastically interesting subject!One woman's cancerous cells are multiplied and distributed around the globe enabling a new era of cellular research and fueling incredible advances in scientific methodology, technology, and medical treatments. This strain of cells, named HeLa (after Henrietta Lacks their originator), has been amazingly prolific and has become integrated into advancements of science around the world (space travel, genome research, pharmaceutical treatments, polio vaccination, etc). *Thought-Provoking Ethical Questions This book makes you ponder ethical questions historically raised by the unfolding sequence of events and still rippling currently. Ex. 1) Informed consent: Henrietta did not provide informed consent (not required in those days). Ex. 2) Genetic rights/non-rights: her family (whose DNA also links to those cells) did not learn of the implications of her tissue sample until years later. Ex. 3) Patents and profits for biologic material: zero profits realized by Henrietta or her descendants; multiple-millions in profits have been realized by individuals and corporations utilizing her genetic material.*Biographical description of Henrietta and interviews with her family.  The biographical nature of the book ensures the reader does not separate the science and ethics from the family. These are not abstract questions, impacts and implications. We're reading about actual, valuable people and historic events.
Weaknesses:
*Framework: the book is framed around the author's journey of writing the story and her interactions with Henrietta's family. I thought the author got in the way and would have preferred to have to read less of her journey and more coverage of the science involved and its ethical implications. I found myself distinctly not caring how many times the author circled the block or how many trips she made to Henrietta's birthplace.*Lack of Clarity: By mid-point through the book, I was wishing the biographical approach was more refined and focused. The narrative swerved through the author's interest in various people as she encountered them along the way: Henrietta, Henrietta's immediate family, scientists, Henrietta's extended family, a neighborhood grocery store owner, a con artist, Henrietta's youngest daughter, Henrietta's oldest daughter, etc. Everything was a side dish; no particular biography satisfied as a main course.
Bottom Line:
This book won't join my 'to re-read' shelf...but has whetted my appetite for further exploration of this important woman, fascinating topic and intriguing ethical questions.I was left wanting more:-more detail surrounding the science involved, -more coverage of past and present ethical implications-a more refined biography of Henrietta, and -a more focused look at the impact and implications of the HeLa cell strain line on Henrietta's descendants."

A young black mother dies of cervical cancer in 1950 and unbeknownst to her becomes the impetus for many medical advances through the decades that follow because of the cancer cells that were taken without her permission. This book evokes so many thoughts and feelings, sometimes at odds with one another. It is thought provoking and informative in the details and heartbreaking in the rendering of the personal story of Henrietta Lacks. I was madder than hell that people/companies made loads of money on the Hela cell line while some members of the Lacks family didn’t have health insurance . Yet, I am grateful for the research advances that made a polio vaccine possible, advanced cancer research and genetics, and so much more.Rebecca Skloot does a wonderful job of presenting the moral and legal questions of medical research without consent meshing this with the the human side giving a picture of the woman whose cells saved so many lives. We get to know her family, especially her daughter Deborah who worked tirelessly with the author to discover what happened to her mother. This made it all so real - not just a recitation of the facts. The scientific aspects are very detailed but understandable. It was the sections on Henrietta and her family that I wanted to read the most.In 1950 there was “no formal research oversight in the United States.” Years later there are laws on “informed consent “ and how medical research is conducted, and protection of privacy for medical records. Yet even today, there are controversies over the ownership of human tissue. The in depth research over years in writing this book is evident and I believe a heartfelt effort to recognize Henrietta Lacks for her unwitting contribution to medical research."
8,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114573-chelsea,3,"This could have been an incredible book. Henrietta Lacks' story is finally told--and Skloot makes very clear how important Lacks' cells have been to the last 60 years of science and, paradoxically, how much Henrietta and her family suffered because those cells were taken from Henrietta without her consent. But in her effort to contrast the importance and profitability of Henrietta's cells with the marginalization and impoverishment of Henrietta's family, Skloot makes three really big mistakes. First, she's not transparent about her own journalistic ethics, which is troubling in a book about ethics. Did the Lacks family end up benefiting from her book financially? Did all Lacks give permission for their depictions in the book? We never know. Second, Skloot's narration when describing the Lacks family suffering--sexual abuse, addiction, disability, mental illness--lacks sensitivity; it often feels clinical and sometimes even voyeuristic. Again, this is disturbing in a book that concerns the importance of dignity, consent, etc.Finally, Skloot inserts herself into the story over and over, not so subtly suggesting that she is a hero for telling Henrietta's story. Sometimes, it appears that she is making the very offensive suggestion that she, a highly educated unreligious white woman, has healed the Lacks family by showing them science and history."
9,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/731872-kathleen,3,"My thoughts on this book are kind of all over the place. I feel for the Lacks family, I really do. It's hard to read about the poverty and lack of education and the cavalier approach towards informed consent in the early days of Johns Hopkins Research Hospital. The fact that the HeLa cell line is the foundation of so much valuable research is rightfully a source of pride for the family of Henrietta Lacks. I don't think they will ever see monetary compensation for their mother's cancer cell line, however. That horse left the barn a long, long time ago.Furthermore, I don't feel the admiration for the author of this book like I think many others do. She wanted to make herself out to be different than all the rest of the people who wrote about the woman behind the HeLa cell line but I only saw the similarities. Yes, she has established a scholarship fund for the descendants of Henrietta Lacks but I got tired of hearing again and again how she financed her research herself. I think the exploitation is there, just prettied up a bit with a lot of self-congratulatory descriptions of how HARD she had to try to talk to the family and how MANY times she called asking for interviews. At times I felt like she badgered them worse than the unethical people who had come before.The sadness of this story is really about the devastation of a family when its unifying force, a strong mother, is removed. Piled on with more sadness about the appalling institutional conditions for mentally handicapped patients (talking about Henrietta Lacks' oldest daughter) back in the 50's and you have tragedy on top of more tragedy."
10,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,4,"This is a very powerful and informative story. Also, with the history of personal freedoms, civil rights, and right to privacy/requiring consent, this is a very important books. I am not sure the details about the science involved in the story will appeal to all. Just the same as how those who are here for the science may be disinterested in the background stories of the people involved. But, if you think you will like one of the other, I don’t think the one you don’t care for will be distracting.With that in mind, I will continue with the statement that it really is two books: the science and the people. First, the background of cell and tissue research in the last 100 years is intriguing and to hear about all of the advances and why Henretta Lacks was key to them is fascinating. Second, the background of not only the Lacks family, but also others who have had their tissues/cells used for research without permission, gives a lot of food for thought. Almost every medical advancement, and many scientific advancements, in the past 60 years are because of Henrietta Lacks. But, questions about the consent she gave, what she understood about her cells being used, and how much the family has benefited are all questioned and discussed. It really hits hard to think that you may have no control over parts of you once they are no longer part of your body. Also, the fiscal and research ramifications of giving people more rights over their body tissue/cells really creates a huge Catch-22. As I had surgery earlier this year that involved some tissue being removed for analysis, it started to make me wonder what I signed on all those forms and if my cells might still be out there being used for research.The only part of the book that kind of dragged for me was the time that the author spent with the family late in the book. After listening to an interview with the author it was surprising to hear that this part of the book may have been her original focus (how the family has dealt with the revelations surrounding the use of their mother’s cells), but to me it kind of dragged and got repetitive. I don’t think it is bad and others may find it interesting, it just was what brought down my interest in the story a little bit.If you like science-based stories, medical-based stories, civil/personal rights history, and/or just love a decent non-fiction, I think this book is very worth checking out."
11,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1992225-liz-nutting,5,"When I was a graduate student in the field of Ethics, one of my favorite pedagogical strategies, as both a teacher and a student, was the case study. A good case study can make an abstract ethical issue more concrete. A really good case study can turn a deeply contentious issue into an opportunity for thoughtfulness and compassion; right and wrong (to the extent that those concepts even belong in the study of ethics) are nuanced by descriptions of circumstances or values or human need that can make it easier to see and hear and believe the ones on the other side(s) of an issue. Often the case studies are hypothetical, or descriptions of actual cases pared to ""just the facts, ma'am,"" without all the possible extenuating circumstances that can shape difficult decisions. For some students, this causes great angst. How could they be asked to make a judgment, especially one that might involve life or death, without knowing all the details? And of course, at the end of the lesson, everyone wants to know what really happened, how things turned out ""in real life."" On those rare occasions when we actually do know something of the outcome, it is clear that knowing what ""really"" happened almost never makes the decision easier, clearer, or less agonizing. And that is what makes The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks so deeply compelling and challenging. It is the rare story of the outcome of a seemingly inconsequential decision by a doctor and a researcher in 1951, one that few at that time would have ever seen as an ethical decision, let alone an unethical one. A researcher studying cell cultures needs samples; a doctor treating a woman with aggressive cervical cancer scrapes a few extra cells of that cancer into a Petri dish for the researcher. The missing cells had no bearing whatsoever on the outcome of the woman's disease, so no harm done. A few weeks later the woman is dead, but her cancer cells are living in the lab. The bare bones ethical issue at stake--whether it is ethically warranted to take a patient's tissues without consent and subsequently use them for scientific and medical research--is even now not a particularly contentious one...yet. Legally, the case law is settled: tissue removed in the course of medical treatment or testing no longer belongs to the patient. It is, in essence, refuse, and one woman's trash is another man's treasure. Ethically, almost all the professional guidelines encourage researchers to obtain consent, but they have no teeth (and most were non-existent in 1951 anyway). In reality, the vast majority of the tissue taken from patients is of limited use. But there are those rare times when a single person's cells have the potential to break open the worlds of science and medicine, to the benefit of millions--and the enrichment of a very few. Such was the case with the cells of cervical cancer taken from Henrietta Lacks at Johns Hopkins University hospital. HeLa cells grew in the lab of George Gey. And grew. And grew, unlike any cell before it. Next, they were carried to a different laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, where Jonas Salk used them to successfully test his polio vaccine, and thus the cancer that had killed Henrietta Lacks directly led to the healing of millions worldwide. Soon HeLa cells would be in almost every major research laboratory in the world. They traveled to Asia to help find a cure for hemorrhagic fever and into space to study the effects of zero gravity on human cells. Even today, almost 60 years after Henrietta's death, HeLa cells are some of the most widely used by the scientific community. With such immeasurable benefits as these, who could possibly doubt the wisdom of Henrietta's doctor to take a tiny bit of tissue? But the ""real"" story is much more complicated. Henrietta Lacks was uneducated, poor and black. Her cancer was treated in the ""colored"" ward of Johns Hopkins. Her death left five children without their mother, to be raised by an abusive cousin. Should any of that matter in weighing the morality of taking tissue from a patient without her consent, especially in light of the benefits? God knows our country's history of medical experimentation on the poor and minority populations is not pretty. Ironically, one of the laboratories researching with HeLa cells in the 1950s was the one at the Tuskegee Institute--at the very same time that the infamous syphilis studies were taking place. In light of that history, Henrietta's race and socioeconomic status can't help but be relevant factors in her particular case. But her children's status? What bearing does that have? According to author Rebecca Skloot, in ethical discussions of the use of human tissue, ""[t]here are, essentially, two issues to deal with: consent and money."" Both become issues for Henrietta's children. The family didn't learn until 1973 that their mother's cells had been taken, or that they'd played such a vital role in the development of scientific knowledge. They spent the next 30 years trying to learn more about their mother's cells. As they learned of the money made by the pharmaceutical companies and other companies as a direct result of HeLa cells, they inevitably asked questions about what share, if any, they were entitled to. As Henrietta's eldest son put it, ""If our mother so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?"" But even more than financial compensation, the family wants recognition--and respect--for their mother. They want the woman behind her contributions acknowledged for who she is--a black woman, a mother, a person with name longer than four letters. And they want to know the mother they never knew, to find out the facts of her death. In the lab at Johns Hopkins, looking through a microscope at her mother's cells for the first time, daughter Deborah sums it up: ""John Hopkin [sic] is a school for learning, and that's important. But this is my mother. Nobody seem to get that."" Would a fully informed Henrietta Lacks have made the decision to give her tissue to George Gey if asked? Would her decision either way have had any affect whatsoever on her children's future lives? We'll never know, of course. But reading the story behind the case study makes these questions far more potent than any ethics textbook can. And as science now unravels the strains of our DNA--thanks in no small part to HeLa--these are no longer inconsequential questions for any of us. Perhaps we, too, like the doctors and scientists who have long studied HeLa, can learn from the case study of Henrietta Lacks. "
12,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-bionic-jean,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is is an extraordinary book. By turns it is shocking, informative and tragic. There is brilliance - but also deep injustice. It is in part an account of the development of genetics, part social commentary, and partly the story of one woman, Henrietta Lacks. She was an African-American woman descended from slaves and one white slave-owner (Lacks), and she lived as many hundreds of black people still did even as late as the 1950's, in poverty in an old slave-cabin - the ""home-house"" - in East Baltimore. And although the events do not always make for easy reading, the author assures us that it is completely non-fiction. Nothing has been invented, nothing exaggerated. The author has done her level best to tell things as they were. Although the name ""Henrietta Lacks"" is comparatively unknown, ""HeLa"" cells are routinely used in scientific experiments worldwide today, and have been for decades. They are the only human cells thought to be scientifically ""immortal"" ie if they are provided with the correct culture and environment they do not die. They were cut from a tumour in the cervix of Henrietta Lacks a few months before she died in 1951; extracted because she had a particular virulent form of cancer. Despite extreme measures taken in the laboratories to protect the cells, human cells had always inevitably died after a few days. HeLa cells though, stayed alive in the petri dish, and proved to be virtually unstoppable, growing faster and stronger than any other cells known.These HeLa cells were used to develop the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilisation and a host of other medical treatments. They were sent on the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity. It is fair to say that they have helped with some of the most important advances in medicine. But there is a terrible irony and injustice in this. The people to benefit from this were largely white people. Henrietta Lacks's family and descendants suffered appalling poverty. Working from dawn to dusk in poisonous tobacco fields was the norm as soon as the children were able to stand. Moving from Virginia's tobacco production to Bethlehem Steel, a boiler manufacturer in South Boston, was little better, as they were then exposed to asbestos and coal. The families had intermingled for generations. Henrietta and Day, her husband, were first cousins, and this was by no means unusual. So the predisposition to illness was both hereditary and environmental. But access to medical help was virtually nil. Most hospitals accepted only whites, or grudgingly admitted so-called ""colored"" people to a separate area, which was far less well funded and staffed. The Lacks family had to travel a long way in order to be treated, and then were not allowed the privilege of proper explanations as to the treatment given - or the tissue samples extracted.At this time unusual cells were taken routinely by doctors wanting to make their own investigations into cancer (which at that time was thought to be a virus) and many other conditions. No permission was sought; none was needed. The Hippocratic oath doctors set such store by dates from the 4th Century BC, and makes no mention of it; neither did the law of the time require it. It was not until 1947, that the subject was raised. Nazi doctors had performed many ethically unsound operations and experiments on live Jews, and during the trials after the war the Nuremberg Code - a 10 point code of ethics - was set up. This states that, ""The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential."" Even then it was advice, not law. Rebecca Skloot says that Howard Jones, the doctor who had originally diagnosed Henrietta Lacks' cancer, said, ""Hopkins, with its large indigent black population, had no dearth of clinical material."" It was clearly a racial norm of the time. In fact to be fair, the white doctors had no real conception that what they were doing had an ethical side. George Gey and his assistants were responsible for isolating the genetic material in Henrietta's cells - an astonishing feat. Gey happily shared the cells with any scientists who asked. The issue of payment was never raised, but the HeLa cells fast became a commodity, and the Lacks's family, who were never consulted about anything, mistakenly assumed until very recently that Gey must have made a fortune out of them. As Henrietta's daughter Deborah said, ""Them white folks getting rich of our mother while we got nothin."" Skloot carefully chronicles some of the most shocking medical stories from these times. The reader infers from her examples that testing on the impoverished and disadvantaged was almost routine. One notorious study was into syphilis and apparently went on for 40 years. It was called the ""Tuskegee study"", and involved thousands of males at varying stages of the disease. At the time it was known that they could be cured by penicillin, but they were not given this treatment, in order that doctors could study the progress of the disease. In this case they were volunteers, but were encouraged by the offer of free travel to the hospital, a free meal when they got there, and the promise of $50 for their families after they died, for funeral expenses. There are many such poignant examples. The author also says that in 1954 thousands of chronically ill elderly people, convicts and even some children, were injected by a Dr. Chester Southam with HeLa cells, basically just to see what would happen. Of course many of them went on to develop cancer. One man who had Hela cells injected in his arm produced small tumours there within days. But the patients were never informed of this, and if they did happen to ask were told they were being ""tested for immunity"". (We are told that Southam was prosecuted for this much later in 1966.) It was not until 1957 that there was any mention in law of ""informed consent."" Confidentially and privacy violation issues came far later.After her death, four of Henrietta Lacks's children, Lawrence, Deborah, Sonny and Joe, were put in the charge of Ethel, a friend of the family who had been very envious of Henrietta. It appears that she was incredibly cruel to the children, hardly ever feeding them until late, after a day's work, when they would be given a meagre crust. She would also drag the youngest one, Joe, out of bed at will, and beat him unmercifully. Joe was only 4 months old when his mother died and grew up to have severe behavioural problems. In fact later on on life, all these children grew to have not only health problems (including all being almost deaf) but a myriad of social problems too - being involved in burglary, assault and drugs - and spent a lot of their lives in prison.One of Henrietta's five children had been put in ""Crownsville Hospital for the Negro Insane"" when she was still tiny, because Henrietta was too ill to care for her any more. The story of this child, which is gradually told through Skloot's text as more of it is revealed, is heart-breaking. It is not clear why Elsie was so slow, but her mental retardation is now thought to be partly due to syphilis, and partly due to being born on the home-house stone floor - which was routine for such families at the time - and banging her head during birth. It was not known what had subsequently happened to Elsie until Skloot's research, but then some records were discovered. A photograph of Elsie shows a miserable child apparently in pain in a distorted position. Apparently brain scans then necessitated draining the surrounding brain fluid. Never mind that the patient might then suffer violent headaches, fits and vomiting for 2-3 months until the fluid reformed; it gave a better picture. Many people had been sent to this institution because of ""idiocy"" or epilepsy; the assumption now is that that they were incarcerated to get them out of the way, and that tests like this, often for research, were routine. Figures from 1955, when Elsie died, showed that at that time the hospital had 2700 patients, which was 800 over the maximum capacity. The ratio of doctors to patients was 1 doctor for 225 patients.Add into this the appalling inhumanity of history where white people used black people for their own ends, and the fears of Henrietta's family and community become inevitable. There had been stories for generations of white-coated doctors coming at dead of night and experimenting on black people. This became confused - or perhaps vindicated - by the Ku Klux Klan. Stories of voodoo, charismatic religious experiences, dire poverty, lack of basic education (one of Henrietta's brothers was more fortunate in that he had 4 years' schooling in total) untreated health problems and the prevailing 1950's attitudes of never questioning the doctor, all fed into the mix resulting in ignorance and occasional hysteria.Much of the first part of this book includes descriptions of scientific research and discoveries; both the theory and practise of how genes were isolated. Alternating with this is the background to the racial tensions, and the history of Henrietta Lacks' ancestry and family. Rebecca Skloot, a science writer, had been fascinated by the potential story since school days, when she first heard of HeLa cells, but nobody seemed to know anything about them. She started this book in her 20's, and spent a decade researching it, financed by credit cards and student loans. As a white woman she was treated with gross suspicion by all Henrietta Lacks's family. Eventually she formed a good relationship with Deborah, but it took a year before Deborah would even speak to her, and Deborah's brothers were very resistant. Several of them were pastors, as was James Pullam, her husband. They believed the Bible literally and had many fears about how Henrietta's cells were used. Deborah herself could not understand how they were immortal. Could her mother's cells feel pain when they were exploded, or infected? Would they develop into half-human half-chicken freaks when they were split and combined with chicken cells? Were there millions of clones all looking like her mother wandering around London? The media worldwide had played its part in adding to these fears, which had been spawned by a genuine ignorance.The interviews with Henrietta's family, and the progress and discoveries Skloot made accompanied by Deborah in the second part of the book, do make the reader uneasy. Indeed parts of these passages read like a trashy novel. Skloot says she wanted to report the conversation verbatim, so the vernacular is reported intact. Fair enough. But there is a lot of, ""Deborah shouted"" or, ""Lawrence yelled"". Of course they did! All of Henrietta's children had severe health problems, probably due to a variety of factors; their environment, upbringing and genetic inheritance. They were all very hard of hearing, so yes, they would shout when amongst themselves. Add to this Skloot's tendency to describe the attributes and appearance of a family member as ""beautiful hazel-nut brown skin"" or ""twinkling eyes"" and there is a whiff of condescension which does not sit well. Does it add anything to this account? Would a description of the author as having ""raven-black hair and full glossy lips"" help? Of course not. The author may feel she is being complimentary; she is not. She is being patronising. But it is difficult to know how else the total incomprehension and ignorance of how a largely white society operated could have been conveyed, other than by this verbatim reportage, even though at worst it comes across as extremely crass, and at best gently humorous.It would be convenient to imagine that these appalling cases were a thing of the past. But the book continues detailing injustices until the date of its publication in 2010. Henrietta's son, Sonny had a quintuple bypass in 2003. Skloot reports, ""The last thing he remembered before falling unconscious under the anesthesia was a doctor standing over him saying his mother's cells were one of the most important things that had ever happened in medicine."" So far, so good. There was recognition. But Skloot then delivers the final shot, ""Sonny woke up more than $125,500 in debt because he didn't have health insurance to cover the surgery."" As Lawrence (Henrietta's eldest son) says elsewhere, ""It's not fair! She's the most important person in the world and her family [are] living in poverty. If our mother [is] so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?""Henrietta's original cancer had in fact been misdiagnosed. It was discovered years later that because she had syphilis, she had the genital warts HPV virus, which does actually invade the DNA. There is an intriguing section on this, as well as the ""HeLa bomb"", where one doctor painstakingly proved to the whole of the scientific community that a lot of their research had been flawed, as HeLa cells were contaminating many of the other cells they had been working with and drawing conclusions from. They were so virulent that they could travel on the smallest particle of dust in the atmosphere, and because Gey had given them so generously, there was no real record of where they had all ended up.Deborah herself always lived in fear of inheriting her mother's cancer. Because of this she readily submitted to tests. Victor McKusick took blood samples, which Deborah believed were for ""cancer tests."" In fact though, Skloot claims, they were for his own research. This is another example of chronic misunderstanding. He knew of the family's mental anguish and the unfair treatment they had had. He thought she understood why he wanted the blood. He gave her an autographed copy of his book - a technical manual on Genetics. Of this, Deborah commented wryly, ""It would have been nice if he'd told me what the damn thing said too."" And again, ""I would like some health insurance so I don't got to pay all that money every month for drugs my mother cells probably helped to make.""In 2001, Skloot tells us, Christoph Lengauer, now the Head of Oncology in one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, said of Henrietta, ""Her cells are how it all started."" And to Deborah, ""Once there is a cure for cancer, it's definitely largely because of your mother's cells.""In 2005 the US government issued gene patents relating to the use of 20% of known human genes, including Alzheimer's, asthma, colon cancer and breast cancer. The injustices however, continue. Pharmaceutical companies, scientists and universities now control what research is done, and the costs of the resulting tests and therapies. An example of how this continues to impede scientific development according to the author is that of the company Myriad Genetics, who hold the patent on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. (These are the genes which are responsible for most hereditary breast cancers.) The company had arbitrarily set a charge of $3000 to have this test, amid furore amongst scientists. They had licensed the use of the test. Anyone who ignored it received a threat of litigation. Eventually in 2009 they were sued by the American Civil Liberties Union, representing a huge number of people including 150,000 scientists for inhibiting research. The commercialisation of human biological materials has now become big business.There seems to have been some attempts at restitution since this book was published, the most recent being in August 2013. There was an agreement between the family and The National Institutes of Health to give the family some control over the access to the cells' DNA code, and a promise of acknowledgement on scientific papers. The committee set to oversee this arrangement will have 6 members, 2 of whom will be members of the family. The wheels have been set in motion.All in all this is an important and startlingly original book by a dedicated and compassionate author. It speaks to every one of us, regardless of our colour, nationality or class. Skloot admitted that it took a long time to decide the structure of the book, in order to include all the important aspects that she wished to. There are three sections: ""Life"", ""Death"" and ""Immortality"", plus an ""Afterword"". The main thrust throughout is clearly the enduring injustice the Lacks family suffered. So perhaps the final words should be Joe's, or (as he changed his name when he converted to Islam in prison), Zakariyya's: ""I believe what them doctors did was wrong. They lied to us for 25 years, kept them cells from us, then they gonna say them things DONATED by our mother. Them cells was stolen! Those fools come take blood from us sayin they need to run tests and not tell us that all these years they done profitized off of her…. You don't lie and clone behind their backs. That's wrong - it's one of the most violating parts of this whole thing….Then doctors say her cells [are] so important and did all this and that to help people. But it didn't do no good for her, and it don't do no good for us. If me and my sister need something, we can't even go and see a doctor cause we can't afford it.""It's too late for some of Henrietta's family. For how many others will it also be too late?"

(Matthew 26:26-28, NIV Bible)From The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks: There's no way of knowing how many of Henrietta's cells are alive today. One scientist estimates that if you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown on a scale, they'd weigh more than 50 million metric tons--an inconceivable number, given that an individual cell weighs almost nothing....Her cells were part of research into the genes that cause cancer and those that suppress it; they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, and Parkinson's disease; and they've been used to study lactose digestion, sexually transmitted diseases, appendicitis, human longevity, mosquito mating, and the negative cellular effects of working in sewers....Like guinea pigs and mice, Henrietta's cells have become the standard laboratory workhorse.(The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, pp. 2-4)Questions:1) Assuming Jesus Christ was speaking literally, please calculate the total mass and volume of the Body of Christ consumed in the period between the Last Supper (c. 30-36 AD/CE) and the present day.

But what happens when her biological material generates billions of dollars for the drug and pharmaceutical industry, leaving her dirt poor descendants in the lurch?Yeah, I know I wrote that like the teaser for one of my mysteries but the only mystery here is how people who have profited from the diseased cells that killed a woman can sleep at night while her kids and grand kids don't have two nickels to rub together.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is really two stories. One of Henrietta Lacks and her cancer cells that lived decades beyond her years, and the other of Rebecca Skloot and the surviving members of the Lacks family.Henrietta Lacks married her counsin, contracted multiple STD's due to his philandering ways, and died of misdiagnosed cervical cancer by the time she was 30. However, the cancer that killed her survives today in the form of HeLa cells, which have been taken to the moon, exposed to every manner of radiation and illness, and all sorts of other experiments. While other people are raking in money due to the HeLa research, the surviving Lacks family doesn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of, bringing me to the real meat of the book: The pharmaceutical industry is a bunch of dickbags. Imagine having something removed that generated billions of dollars of revenue for people you've never met and still needing to watch your budget so you can pay your mortage. Fair? Shit no, but that's the way it is, apparently. It also seems illogical that you can patent things you didn't create but again, that's the way the cookie crumbles.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is an eye-opening look at someone most of us have never heard of but probably owe some sort of debt to. Also, it drags the big money pharma companies out in the sun. Sadly, they do not burst into flames like the vampires they are. Four out of five stars. I'm going to go read something happy now."
15,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,5,"The gift of life is surely the greatest gift of all. So how can the story of the remarkable woman who gave that gift over and over again to millions of people have been overlooked for so long?In 1951 a poor African American woman in Maryland became an uninformed donor to medical science. Henrietta Lacks died at age 31 of cervical cancer at John Hopkins hospital in Baltimore. Then doctors discovered that tumor cells they had removed from her body earlier continued to thrive in the lab - a medical first.Before long, her cells, dubbed HeLa cells, would be used for research around the world, contributing to major advances in everything from cancer treatments to vaccines; from aging to the life cycle of mosquitoes; nuclear bomb explosions to effect of gravity on human tissue during flights to outer space. An estimated 50 million metric tons of her cells were reproduced; thousands of careers have been build, and initiated more than 60 000 scientific studies until now, but Henrietta Lacks never gave permission for that research, nor had her family.In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Rebecca Skloot gracefully tells the story of the real woman and her descendants; the history of race-related medical research, including the role of eugenics; the struggles of the Lacks family with poverty, politics and racial issues; the phenomenal development of science based on the HeLa cells, in a language that can be understood by everyone. She combined the family's story with the changing ethics and laws around tissue collection, the irresponsible use of the family's medical information by journalists and researchers and the legislation preventing the family from benefiting from it all.COMMENTSI was gifted this book in December but never realized the impact it had internationally, neither would have on me. Until I finished reading it last night, I did not know it was an international bestseller, as well as read by so many of my GR friends! It was total surprise, since nonfiction is normally not a regular star on bestseller lists, right?The debate around the moral issue, and the experiences of the poor family were very well presented in the book, which was truly well written and objective as far as possible. For me personally, the question of how this woman, who basically saved millions of people's lives, were overlooked, is answered in the arrogance of scientists who deemed it unnecessary to respect the rights of people unable to fend for themselves.The ethical and moral dilemmas it created in America, when the family became aware of their mother's contribution to science without anyone's knowledge or consent, just enabled the commercial enterprises who benefited massively from her cells, to move to other countries where human rights are just a faint star in a unlimited universe. The Lacks family drew a line in the sand of how far people must be exploited in America. Unfortunately the medical fraternity just moved their operations elsewhere.Tissue and organ harvesting thrive in the world, it is globally a massive industry, with the poorest of the poor still the uninformed donors. An open secret. There are numerous stories, especially in India, where people wake up and realize they were operated on and one of their organs is missing. Stolen. By the time they became aware of it, the organ had already been transplanted in America and elsewhere in the world. That's no secret. Everything is justified as long as science is involved.  Nowadays people in other parts of the world sell their organs, even though it is illegal in most countries. According to American laws people cannot sell their tissue, which is part of human organs? People can donate it though, then it is acceptable.Yet someone else can patent your cells, but you're not allowed to be compensated, since the minute it leaves your body, it is regarded as waste, disposed of, and therefor not deemed your 'property' anymore. Huh?This book was a good and necessary read. The human interest side of it, telling the story of the family was eye-opening and excellent. A little bit of melodramatic, but how else would it become a bestseller, if ordinary readers like us could not relate to it. It was very well-written indeed. Thanks to Rebecca Skloot, in 2010, sixty years later, HeLa now has a history, a face and an address. Finally, Henrietta Lacks, and not the anonymous HeLa, became a biological celebrity. In 1951 Dr. Grey's lab assistant handled yet just another tissue sample of hundreds, when she received Henrietta's to prepare for research. She named it HeLa(first two letters of the patient's name and last name). But a few months later she visited the body of the deceased Henrietta Lacks in the mortuary to collect more samples. When she saw the woman's red-painted toenails, a lightbulb went on.Mary Kubicek: “Oh jeez, she’s a real person. . . . I started imagining her sitting in her bathroom painting those toenails, and it hit me for the first time that those cells we’d been working with all this time and sending all over the world, they came from a live woman. I’d never thought of it that way.”John Hopkins hospital could have considered naming a wing of their research facilities after Henrietta Lack. Why don't they?Nevertheless, this book should be read by everybody. Without it the world would have been a lot poorer and less human.The world has a lot to answer for.RECOMMENDED for sure!EDIT I googled the Lacks family and landed upon the website of the Lacks Foundation, which was started by Rebecca Skloot. http://henriettalacksfoundation.org/That news TOTALLY made my day. I wish them all the best and hope they will succeed in their goals and dreams. A wonderful initiative. Just imagine what can be accomplished if every single person, organization, research facility and medical company who benefitted for Henrietta Lacks's tissue cells, donate only $1 (one single dollar)? Yes, just imagine that!So many positive things happened to the family after the book was published.

16,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,5,"There are some books that I finish and am left in awe, questioning everything that I thought I knew on a subject. Or, as is the case hear, having learned so much about which I knew nothing. My jaw is still on the floor after I finished this book and I can only imagine the controversies and discussions it might provoke. A thank you goes out to three Goodreads friends who recommended that I read this book and open an avenue for discussion. Aven, Brenda, and Rae, I hope we can begin a wild and intriguing dialogue, pulling others into the mix as things gain momentum.Who was Henrietta Lacks? What are HeLa cells? These are two of the foundational questions that Rebecca Skloot sought to answer in this poignant biographical piece. While I have tackled a number of biographies in my time as a reader, Skloot offered a unique approach to the genre in publication. Henrietta Lacks grew up in rural Virginia, picking tobacco and made ends meet as best she could. After marrying, she had a brood of children, including two of note, Elsie and Deborah, whose significance becomes apparent as the reader delves deeper into the narrative. Skloot offered up a succinct, but detailed narrative of how Lacks found an unusual mass inside her and was sent from her doctor to a specialist at Johns Hopkins (yes, THAT medical centre) for treatment. The mass was malignant and Lacks was deemed to have cervical cancer. Her surgeon, following the precedent of many doctors in the early 1950s, took samples of her tumour as well as that of the healthy part of her cervix, hoping to be able to have the cells survive so they could be analysed. Past attempts by doctors and scientists failed to keep cells alive for very long, which led to the constant slicing and saving technique used by those in the medical profession, when the opportunity arose. As it turns out, Lacks' cells were not only fascinating to explore, but George Gey (Head of Tissue Culture Research at Johns Hopkins) noticed that they lasted indefinitely, as long as they were properly fed. Gey realised that he had something on his hands and tried to get approval from the Lacks family, though did so in an extremely opaque manner. After Lacks succumbed to the cancer, doctors sought to perform an autopsy, which might allow them complete access to Lacks' body. Ignorant of what was going on, Henrietta's husband agreed, thinking that this was only to ensure his children and subsequent generations would not suffer the agony that cancer brought upon Henrietta. So began the conniving and secretive nature of George Gey. He harvested these 'special cells' and named them ""HeLa"", a brief combination of the original patient's two names. Their phenomenal growth and sustainability led him to ship them all over the country and eventually the world, though the Lacks family had no idea this was going on. HeLa cells were studied to create a polio vaccine (Jonas Salk used them at the University of Pittsburgh), helped to better understand cellular reactions to nuclear testing, space travel, and introduction of cancer cells into an otherwise healthy body during curious and somewhat inhumane tests on Ohio inmates. During all this, Johns Hopkins remained completely aware of what was going on and the transmission of HeLa cells around the globe, though did not think to inform the Lacks family, perhaps for fear that they would halt the use of these HeLa cells. Through the use of the term 'HeLa' cells, no one was the wiser and no direct acknowledgement of the long-deceased Henrietta Lacks need be made. Skloot provided much discussion about the uses, selling, 'donating', and experimenting that took place, including segments of the scientific community in America that were knowingly in violation of the Nuremberg Rules on human experimentation, though they danced their own legal jig to get around it all. The crux of the biography lay on this conundrum, though it would only find its true impact by exploring the lives of those Henrietta Lacks left behind after her death.Skloot took the time to pepper chapters with the history of the Lacks family as they grew up and, eventually, what happened when they were made aware that the HeLa cells existed, over two decades after they were obtained and Henrietta had died. Skloot split this other biographical piece into two parts, which eventually merge into one, documenting her research trips and interviews with the family alongside the presentation of a narrative that explores the fruits of those sit-down interviews. That Skloot tried to remain somewhat neutral is apparent, though through her connection to Henrietta's youngest daughter, Deborah, there was an obvious bias that developed. Superimposing these two narratives would, hopefully, offer the reader a chance to feel a personal connection to the Lacks family and the struggles they went through. In her discussions of the Lacks family, Skloot pulled no punches and presented the raw truths of criminal activity, abuse, addiction, and poverty alongside happy gatherings and memories of Henrietta. No biographical piece would be complete if it were only window dressing and trying to paint a rosy picture of this maligned family without offering at least a little peek into their daily lives. However, it balanced out and Skloot ended up with what the reader might call a decent introduction to this run of the mill family unit. Their ire at being duped by Johns Hopkins was apparent, alongside the dichotomy that HeLa cells were so popular, yet the family remained in dire poverty in the poor areas of Baltimore.The legal ramifications of HeLa cell usage was discussed at various points in the book, though there was no firm case related to it, at least not one including the Lacks family. One person I know sought to draw parallels between the Lacks situation and that of Carrie Buck, as illustrated wonderfully in Adam Cohen's book, Imbeciles (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...). While the courts surely fell short in codifying ownership of cells and research done on them, the focus of Skloot's book was the social injustice by Johns Hopkins, not the ineptitude of the US Supreme Court, as Cohen showed while presenting Buck v. Bell to the curious audience. While George Gey vowed that he gave away the HeLa cell samples to anyone who wanted them, surely the chain reaction and selling of them in catalogues thereafter allowed someone to line their pockets. Skloot offers up numerous mentions from the family, usually through Deborah, that the Lacks family was not seeking to get rich off of this discovery of immortal cells. While companies were spending millions and profiting billions from the early testing of HeLa cells, no one in the family could afford to see a doctor or purchase the medicines they needed (all of which came about because of tests HeLa cells facilitated!). It is both fascinating and angering to see the system wash their hands of the guilt related to immoral collecting and culturing of these HeLa cells. Skloot did explore the slippery slope of cells and tissue as discarded waste, as well as the need for consent in testing them, something the reader ought to spend some time exploring once the biographical narrative ends. It is sure to confound and confuse even the most well-grounded reader.The latter chapters touched upon the aptly used word from the title ""Immortal"" as it relates to Henrietta Lacks. Be it a biography that placed a story behind the woman, a detailed discussion of how the HeLa cell came into being and how its presence is all over the medical world, or that medical advancements as we know them will allow Henrietta Lacks' being to live on for eternity, the reader can reflect on which rationale best suits them. While there is a religious undertone in the biography as it relates to this, Christianity is not inculcated into the reader's mind, as it was not when Skloot learned about these things.Do I know Henrietta Lacks any better now, after Skloot completed her work? Most definitely! Can I, a complete scientific dunce, better understand HeLa cells and the idea behind cell growth and development? Completely! Do I feel there was an injustice done to the Lacks family by Johns Hopkins in 1951 and for decades to come? Yes, I do harbour a strong resentment to the duplicitous attitude undertaken by a hospital whose founder sought to ensure those who could not receive medical care on their own be helped and protected. Is there a lingering legal argument to be made for compensatory damages or at least some fiduciary responsibility owed to the Lacks family? That is a very grey area for me, only further complicated by the legal discussions in the Afterward and the advancement of new and complicated scientific discoveries, which also bore convoluted legal arguments. I will say this... Skloot brought Henrietta Lacks to life and if that puts a face to those HeLa cells, perhaps all those who read this book will think twice about those medicines used in their bodies and the scientific breakthroughs that are attributed to many powerful companies and/or nations. Maybe then, Henrietta can live on in all of us, immortal in some form or another.Kudos, Madam Skloot for intriguing someone whose scientific background is almost nil. You brought numerous stories to life and helped me see just how powerful one woman can be, silenced by death and the ignorance of what those around her were doing.Like/hate the review?

17,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol,4,"This 2010 work of non-fiction regarding THE IMMORTAL LIFE OF HENRIETTA LACKS is a sad story and a tough, draining read that shocked me more than once along the way.Henrietta was a poor black woman only 31 years of age when she died of cervical cancer leaving five children behind, her youngest, Deborah, just a baby. Her story is a heartbreaking one, but also an important one as her cancer cells, forever to be known as HeLa taken without her consent or knowledge, saved thousands of lives.Through ten long years of investigative work by this author, this narrative explores the experimental, racial and ethical issues of HeLa (the cells that would not die), while intertwining the story of her children's lives and the utter shock of finding out about their mother's cells more than twenty years later.""Physician Seeks Volunteers For Cancer Research."" Yeah, right........So many parts of this book made me sick to my stomach.....like the uncaring treatment of animals and all the poor souls injected with cancer cells without their knowledge in the name of research and greed; and oh, dam Ethel for the inhumane and brutal abuse to Henrietta's children too. Unbelievable!Whew! I must admit to being glad when I turned the last page on this one, but big time kudos to Rebecca Skloot for researching and telling Henrietta's story. She deserved so much better."
18,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,4,"Overall, a four star read that should probably be required reading for both biology and American history classes. (Actually, it was a far more interesting read than that makes it sound). While I had heard a great deal of buzz on the book, I wasn't prepared for how the story evolved. The book alternates between Henrietta Lacks' personal history, that of her family, a little of medical history and Skoot's actual pursuit of the story, which helps develop the story in historical context. Skoots included a lot more science than I expected, and even with ten years in the medical field, I was horrified at times. Skoots does a decent job of maintaining a journalistic tone, but some of the things she relates are terrible, from the way Henrietta grew up to cervical cancer treatment in the 50s and 60s. These were the days before cancer treatments approached the precision medicine it is aiming for today, and the treatments resembled nothing so much as trying to cut fingernails with garden shears. Just the thought of a radioactive seed tucked in the uterus causing tissue burn was enough to give me sympathetic cramps.Part of the evil in the book is the violence her family inflicted on each other, and it's one of the truly uncomfortable areas. I think that discomfort is important, because part of where this story comes from has to do with slavery and poverty. There isn't really an ethical high ground here, and that's part of Skoot's skill in setting up the story, and part of the problem in being a white woman telling the story of a black woman. The only reason I didn't give this a five star rating is that the narrative started to fall apart at the end, leaving behind the stories of the cell line and focus more on the breakdown of Henrietta's daughter, Deborah. While I understand she is the touchstone for the story, that she is partly telling the story of the mother through the daughter, much of Henrietta and the science is sidelined.Interesting questions popped up while reading; namely, why does everyone equate Henrietta's cancer cells with her person? As an illustration, if you tell people they have a cancerous tumor, the reaction is ""get rid of it."" It is categorized as ""other"" in everyone's mind and not recognized it as an intrinsic part of the person with cancer. It is not ""them."" Biologically speaking, I'm not sure the book answered the question of whether of not the HeLa cells actually were genetically identical to Henrietta, or if they were mutated--altered DNA. While that might be cold comfort, it's a huge philosophical and scientific question that is the pivot point for a number of issues. Treating the cells as if they were ""normal"" is part of what lead the scientists into disaster as evidenced by the discovery that so many cell lines were HeLa contaminated (I don't believe that transmission mechanism was explained either, which irks me). It also could be the basis for a sophisticated legal and ethical argument."

Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead in 1951. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز سی و یکم ماه آگوست سال 2014 میلادیعنوان: حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس؛ نویسنده: ربکا اسکلاوت (اسکلوت)؛ مترجم: حسین راسی؛ تهران آرامش‏‫، 1390؛ در 426ص؛ شابک 9789649219165؛ موضوع: هنرییتا لکس از سال 1920م تا 1951م؛ بیماران و سرطان - اخلاق پزشکی - کشت یاخته ها - آزمایش روی انسان - سده 21م‬زندگینامه ی بیماری به نام «هنرییتا لکس» است، نامش «هنریتا لکس» بود، اما دانشمندان ایشان را با نام «هلا» میشناسند؛ یک کشاورز تنباکوی فقیر جنوب بود، که در همان سرزمین اجداد برده ی خود، کار میکردند، اما سلولهایش - که بدون آگاهی ایشان گرفته شده - به یکی از مهمترین ابزارهای پزشکی تبدیل شد؛ نخستین سلولهای «جاودانه»ی انسانی که، رشد یافته اند، و امروز هنوز هم زنده هستند، اگرچه ایشان در سال 1951میلادی درگذشته اند؛ اگر بتوانیم همه ی سلولهای «هلا» را که تکثیر شده اند، وزن کنیم، شاید وزن آنها به بیش از پنجاه میلیون تن برسد؛ سلولهای «هلا» برای ایجاد «واکسن فلج اطفال» حیاتی بودند؛ سلولهای ایشان، پرده از اسرار «سرطان»، «ویروسها» و اثرات «تشعشعات بمب اتم»؛ برداشتند؛ همچنین پیشرفتهایی همانند: «لقاح آزمایشگاهی»، «کلونینگ» و «نقشه برداری ژن»، یاری کرده است؛ و توسط میلیاردها انسان خریداری و فروخته شده اند؛ با اینحال «هنریتتا لکس» ناشناخته مانده، و در یک گور نامشخص دفن شده استاین کتاب به بخش‌های: برخورد اخلاق در حرفه پزشکی با نژادپرستی، و محرومیت‌های «تاریخی- اجتماعی» رنگین پوستان، برخورد جنبه‌ های معنوی، و حقوقی مالکیت بافت‌های بدن انسان، به تنگدستی و خرافات‌، و برخورد با اکتشاف‌ها، راهکارها، و شیوه ‌های نوین پزشکی هم پرداخته، و نکاتی خواندنی را پیش روی خوانشگر میگذارد؛ «حیات جاودانه هنرییتا لکس»: صحبت‌ها، یادمانهای نزدیکان «لکس»، و نگاهی به اسناد قانونی، و پرونده‌های پزشکی ایشان نیز هست؛ نگارنده، در این نوشتار علاوه بر نگارش تاریخچة زندگی «هنریتیا لکس» به معرفی «سلول‌های هیلا» و پاسخ‌گویی به پرسش‌‌هایی درباره ی دانش پزشکی، اخلاق، نژاد، و طبقه‌ بندی اجتماعی نیز، پرداخته استا. شربیانی"
20,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6050722-rachel,5,"Full disclosure: I come to this book from a weirdly fortuitous place. Take my brief, but mind-searing, stint in gynecologic oncology research ca. 2002, which involved a weekly trek to the OR to pick up still-warm tumors, with the women who informedly consented to donate them often open on the table as I did so. Then throw in two years working in a tissue culture hood, two more in a narrative nonfiction book group, and another big chunk of time studying infectious diseases. Mix in interests in social justice, bioethics, the history of science, and mysteries, and you’ve got me primed for some outsized adoration of Rebecca Skloot’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, because its three main narratives are: 1) The history of tissue culture, particularly the contribution of the “immortal,” fabulously prolific HeLa cells that revolutionized medical research.2) The life, disease and death of Henrietta Lacks, the woman whose cervical cancer cells gave rise to the HeLa cell line.3) The story of Henrietta Lacks’s impoverished family, particularly her daughter Deborah, belatedly discovering and coping with their mother’s cellular legacy.Intertwined with all three is the concept of informed consent in scientific research, and who owns those bits of us and our genetic information that are floating around the research world. See? That perfect scientific/bioethical/historical mystery doesn’t come along every day. My expectations for this one were absolutely sky-high. And Rebecca Skloot hit it higher than that pile of 89 zillion HeLa cells. Thing is, my particular background can make reading about science kind of painfully bifurcated. I mean first, you’ve got your books that are all, “Yay! Science is totally objective and awesome and will solve all of our problems, so just shut up and trust it already!!” But then you’ve definitely also got your, “Science is just one (over-privileged and socially influenced) way of knowing among many / Medicine is patriarchal and wicked and economically motivated and pretty much out to get you, so avoid it at all costs” books too.Yes, Skloot could have written the story of a poor, black, female victim of evil white scientists. But she didn’t do that. Given her interests, it’s conceivable she could have written the triumphant history of tissue culture, and the amazing medical breakthroughs made possible by HeLa cells, and thank you for playing, poorblackwomanwhomnobodyknows. But she didn’t do that either. Instead, she spent ten years researching and writing a balanced, multifaceted book about the humans doing the science, the human whose cells made the science possible, and the humans profoundly affected by the actions of both. Her book is a complex tangle of race, class, gender and medicine. Of reason and faith. Of knowledge and ethics. Of the chasm between the beneficiaries of medical innovation and those without healthcare in the good old US of A.And Skloot doesn’t have the answers. We don’t get to tut-tut at how much things sucked in the past, while patting ourselves on the back for living in the enlightened present. This is vital and messy stuff, here. The problems haven’t been fixed. Who owns our pieces is an issue that is very much alive, and, with the current onslaught of new genetic information, becoming livelier by the minute. Which is why I would feel comfortable recommending this book to anyone involved in human-subjects research in any capacity...so a boatload of us, really, whether we know it or not.But, buyer beware: to tackle all this three-pronged complexity, Skloot uses a decidedly non-linear structure, one with a high narrative leaps:book length ratio. The three main narratives unfold together and inform each other: we meet Deborah Lacks, while learning about the fate of her mother, while learning about what HeLa cells can do, while learning about tissue culture innovators, while learning about the fate of Deborah Lacks. And Skloot saves the nuts and bolts of informed consent and the ownership of biological materials for a densely packed Afterward. Me, I found this to be a powerful structure and ate it all up with a spoon, but I can see how it could be a bit frustrating. You should also know that Skloot is in the book. According to Skloot herself, she fought against this for years. But you know what? I think she needs to be there. This is a book about adding the human complexity back into an illusion of objective scientific truth. When the author has become a character in the lives of her subjects, influencing events in their lives, it works to have the author be a textual presence disrupting the illusion of the objective journalistic truth. She only appears when it’s relevant to her subjects’ story; you don’t hear anything about her story that doesn’t pertain to theirs. And having been in that narrative nonfiction book group for two years, Skloot’s stands out as an elegant and thoughtful approach to the author/subject connection (self-reported femme-fatale author of The Angel of Grozny: Orphans of a Forgotten War, I’m looking at you so hard right now.)
This book pairs well with:
 The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures, another excellent, non-judgmental book about the intersection of science, medicine and culture. With The Mismeasure of Man, for more on the fallibility of the scientific process. It would also taste really good with a kick-ass book about the history of biomedical ethics in the United States, so if you know of one, I’d love to hear about it!"
21,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"I am late to this book party, but let me explain: I get twitchy about medical stuff. Earlier this year I had to abandon Rosemary Mahoney's book about the blind because it described an eye surgery. I have never been able to finish Dr. Atul Gawande's Complications because of its description of medical procedures. It was a small miracle that I was able to finish the Call the Midwife series, because I hate childbirth scenes. When this Henrietta Lacks book started tearing up the bestseller lists a few years ago, I read a few reviews and thought, ""Yeah, that can wait.""Then I started a new library job, and the Lacks book was chosen as a Common Read for the campus. Guess who was volun-told to help lead upcoming book discussions? (Hint: it was me.)So, with a deep sigh, I started reading. And then, oh happy day, my fears turned out to be unfounded because I ended up really liking the story. Rebecca Skloot wrote that she first heard about Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells in a community college biology class. Lacks was a black woman who died in 1951 from cervical cancer. Before she died, a surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. A key part of this story is that Henrietta did not know her tissue had been taken, and doctors did not tell her family.Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in culture for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal cells ever grown in a laboratory.Henrietta's cells, nicknamed HeLa, were given to scientists and researchers around the world, and they helped develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, Parkinson's disease, and they helped with innumerable other medical studies over the decades. At first, the cells were given for free, but some companies were set up to sell vials of HeLa, which became a lucrative enterprise. The reason Henrietta's cells were so precious was because they allowed scientists to perform experiments that would have been impossible with a living human. They cut HeLa cells apart and exposed them to endless toxins, radiation, and infections. They bombarded them with drugs, hoping to find one that would kill malignant cells without destroying normal ones. They studied immune suppression and cancer growth by injecting HeLa cells into immune-compromise rats, which developed malignant tumors much like Henrietta's. If the cells died in the process, it didn't matter -- scientists could just go back to their eternally growing HeLa stock and start over again.Unfortunately, the Lacks family did not know about any of this until several decades after Henrietta had died, and some relatives became very upset and felt betrayed by the doctors at Hopkins. A few threatened to sue the hospital, but never did.There is a lot of biology and medical discussion in this book, but Skloot also tried to learn more about Henrietta's life, and she was able to interview Lacks' relatives and children. Additionally, there is some good discussion on the ethics of taking tissue samples from patients without their consent, and on the problem of racism in health care.""I always have thought it was strange, if our mother cells done so much for medicine, how come her family can't afford to see no doctors? Don't make no sense. People got rich off my mother without us even known about them takin her cells now we don't get a dime. I used to get so mad about that to where it made me sick and I had to take pills. But I don't got it in me no more to fight. I just want to know who my mother was."" -- Deborath Lacks, who was very young when her mother diedMy favorite parts of the book were the stories about Henrietta and the Lacks family, and the discussions on race and ethics in health care. There's no indication that Henrietta questioned [her doctor]; like most patients in the 1950s, she deferred to anything her doctors said. This was a time when 'benevolent deception' was a common practice -- doctors often withheld even the most fundamental information from their patients, sometimes not giving them any diagnosis at all. They believed it was best not to confuse or upset patients with frightening terms they might not understand, like cancer. Doctors knew best, and most patients didn't question that. Especially black patients in public wards. This was 1951 in Baltimore, segregation was law, and it was understood that black people didn't question white people's professional judgment. Many black patients were just glad to be getting treatment, since discrimination in hospitals was widespread.Skloot worked on the book for more than a decade, paying for research trips with student loans and credit card debt. I would highly recommend the book to anyone interested in medical ethics, biology, or just some good investigative reporting. Favorite Quote""Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different."" -- Deborah Lacks"
22,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61753513-christy,5,"I do believe this book must have scored near the top of all books used in college courses these last 5-6 years - from English to history and social sciences, but I wonder how much traction it got in medical school and across the healthcare and medical research fields. It quickly became a ""classic"" because so many issues are covered: race, class, gender, genetics, property rights, and about the social ends of science and our technological choices. As well, it's a story of how some people are used by institutions for other ends, whether admirably or not, and how unjust and unfair it was to Henrietta to have her cancer cells taken without her permission. She died at age 31 from the cancer, yet the gene treatment her cells produced is tremendously useful in the medical field and will be for a long time to come, hence her ""immortal"" status, yet it gives little comfort to the reader. Ironically, her own family now suffers from a lack of access to healthcare.Kudos to author Skloot who started a the Henrietta Lacks Foundation to help families like the Lacks with healthcare and other financial needs, including more victims of similar experiences, including those of the infamous Tuskeegee experiment with treating only some Black soldiers with syphilis. You can check it out at http://henriettalacksfoundation.org/"
23,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020736-stacey,5,"I've started and erased my little book commentary so many times because this story is so overwhelming and so important on multiple levels, I'm not sure anything I could say about it would do justice to the complexity and dichotomy of the story surrounding Henrietta Lacks. It might not be far from the truth to state that she was the most important person who ever lived. A physical part of her body has saved hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of lives, and improved the lives of countless others. And her story is not over yet. Her cells are still being used in medical research all over the world. But these benefits came at the cost of a violation of her rights, in a time when it was commonplace for doctors and researchers to just do and take, without consent, especially among poor populations and people of color. Some of the things done with Henrietta's cells saved lives, some were heinous experiments performed on people who had no idea what was being done to them, in a grotesquely distorted and amplified reflection of what was done to Henrietta. Nuremberg was dismissed in the United States as something that only applied to the fallen Nazi's. Any act was justifiable in the name of science. And yet, some of the things done right her in our own nation were reminiscent of the research being conducted under the direction of the notorious Dr. Mengele.Reading certain parts of this book, I found myself holding my breath in horror at some of the ideas conjured by medical practioners in the name of “research.” Of course, we know.* Anyone who is even moderately informed on this nation's medical history knows about the Tuskegee trials, MK Ultra, flu and hepatitis research on the disabled and incarcerated, radiation exposure experiments on hospital patients, and cancer, cancer, cancer. The poor, disabled and people of color in this country, the “land of the free,” have been subjected to so many cancer experiments, it defies belief. Many of these trials, including some devised of Henrietta's cells, have involved injecting cancer, non-consensually, into human subjects. So while it is true that there can be utterly no doubt that our lives, and the lives of much of the world, are better, because of the knowledge made possible by parts of Henrietta Lacks's body, still acknowledgment of this reality comes at the cost of knowing that procedures were performed on her without her knowledge or understanding, and without her consent, with impunity; these actions were made even easier because she was poor, black and female, and this is to say nothing of the numerous and unethical violations of her (and her children's) privacy. It's an old story. It's a story that her biographer, Rebecca Skloot, handles with grace and compassion. Henrietta is not some medical spectacle, she was a real woman. If she has been deified by her friends and family since her death, it is maybe the homage that she deserves, not for her cells, but for her vibrance, kindness, and the tragedy of a mother who died much too young. There are a great many scientific and historical facts presented in this book, facts that I couldn't possibly vet for veracity, but the science seems sound, if simplistic, and the history is presented in a conversational way, that is easy to read, and uninterrupted by footnotes and references. Family recollections are presented in storyteller fashion, which makes for easy and compelling reading. Fact-checking is made easy by a list of references, presented in chapter-by-chapter appendices. Rarely do I read something that makes me want to collar strangers in the street and tell them, “You MUST read this book,” but this is one of those times. Henrietta's story is bigger than medical research, and cures for polio, and the human genome, and Nuremberg. Henrietta's story is about basic human rights, and autonomy, and love. It's about knowledge and power, how it's human nature to find a way to justify even the worst things we can devise in the name of the greater good, and how we turn our science into a god. This story is bigger than Rebecca Skloot's book. But I am grateful that she wrote it, and thankful to have read it. Would the story have changed had Henrietta been given the opportunity to give her informed consent? That's the thread of mystery which runs through the entire story, the answer to which we can never know. *documentation in this list is inconsistent, but most of these experiments can be independently verified."

25,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,4,"A lot to process with this book. This book's been out for a while, so I'm just going to put down a bunch of thoughts rattling around in my head, and probably leave it at that:-legacy left by slavery and how it affected Henrietta Lacks and the members of her family, and African Americans in general (where they lived, what kind of employment was available to them, the quality of education available to them, the history of abuse and violence, and the impact on their mental health, and the quality and availability of healthcare)-the assumptions and treatment by the medical establishment, at the time, of their patients and patients' rights-the lack of laws, or their lack of clarity, around a patient's consent, and the ownership of a patient's waste products from medical procedures. This was well illustrated in this book, from the 1950s to the time of the book's publication. -the quality of scientific education and knowledge in the general public. Unless people have some understanding of science, how are they to know what questions to ask of their doctors? The more affluent will generally fare better here, I suspect, what with their access to probably better trained teachers, and the ability to get higher education. And affluence and better outcomes would be partially dependent on where one started out in life.-thank goodness medical procedures improve over time, or are retired in favour of treatments that work!!-bioethics--thank goodness there is debate and evolution of ideas and laws. Though there are probably still lots of grey areas around research and commercializations -I was interested to find out more about the point raised about the DNA of the cell descendants of Henrietta's original cancerous cells.-I was sickened by the treatment, or perhaps I should say mystery around the treatment of Elsie, Henrietta's eldest daughter at the hospital for the insane. Or what doctors could call insane at the time.This was a painful read, but an important accounting of a part of US history, and more specifically, the legacy of slavery on a family, and the changing attitudes and practices in medicine and science."
26,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"I am not sure how is it in other countries but here in the Philippines, if you bring your car for repair in a service center and the serviceman says that he replaced a part, you how to do in you should find that replaced part inside your car. I think it is their proof that they actually replaced that part and also for you to decide how you want to dispose, resell, reuse or recycle it. Normally, this practice bothers me because I have a very small space for junks at home and I do not know what to do with a malfunctioning compressor, air vent, axle, mudguard, leaking pipes, tubes, coolant container, etc. What am I going to do with them? The only thing I know w.r.t. car is how to replace the battery or a flat tire. So, I always end up giving those away to the poor junk man so as to have something to load in his pushcart.It may not be the best analogy to introduce a very compelling book like this. However, the logic is the same. The organ, tissue, cells or fluids that you left in the hospital during your last hospitalization or check-up is totally different from the car spare parts. But both are left after you get what you want and you think they are of no use to you anymore. You gave the authorization for the part to be removed and replaced (if possible) and you deserve to have the replaced unit because legally, you are still the owner of the original or replaced part. However, just like me and the car junks, I would imagine that you don't want to bring home with you some test tubes filled with your excess coagulated blood, liquified Chlorox-smelling semen, miniscule torn ligaments or decayed tooth. What are you going to do with them? Henrietta Lacks, a poor black Tobacco farmer, died of cervical cancer in 1951. Without her knowledge, the doctors got her cancerous tissue and tried to use its cells in a cell culture. Surprise. Surprise. Henrietta's cells propagate like wild fire and they are still alive up to now. It was the first successful cell culture since in all the previous attempts, the cells only lived for few days before dying. The book explains that in Henrietta's chromosomes has enzyme called telomerase that continuously rebuils the telomere which is a string of DNA found at the end of each of Henrietta's chromosome. Skloot says in her introduction that there is more to this, as well as other issues, but apologizes for not excluding them in this book's scope. That's fine with me, because the scientific discussions in the book are just enough for me not to fall asleep and lose interest. We all took Biology in high school and the Cell and its parts, how they work, etc is always that's subject's first lesson so I think you can get by.So what if Henrietta's cells are still alive today? Medical discoveries still happen and we don't know or don't care to know their history. Well, those cells have been used to developed vaccines for polio, gene mapping, cloning, etc. So? Well, Henrietta's cancer cells were used without her or her families consent. Henrietta died 2 weeks after being diagnosed with cervical cancer and she was so poor she had to be buried in an unmarked grave. So? Well, Henrietta was black and the doctors were white. In the 50's, America was still not so open with mixing the two colors. The whites probably would not want to have anything in their body taken from a black person. So? This book tackles a number of controversial questions on medical ethics, racism and social discrimination. However, this is not a serious boring book. Skloot's storytelling does not leave any tinge of textbook formality and this can be read just like any A-grade medical crime bestseller that has some sprinklings of family drama (Henrietta's children have to be given away to relatives after her death), incest (10-y/o Rebecca, Henrietta's daughter, escapes a horny uncle showing his erect penis and she does not know the meaning of a rigid penis) and the struggles of a black family despite having a world-renowned mother whose cells, called the HeLa cells, make a unprecedented contribution to the medical field and in prolonging our life expectancy.So? Well, what if the same thing happens to you? What are the chances that your excess semen was not put in the wastebasket but stored in a sperm bank and given away to childless couples for in vitro fertilization of the wife's ovum? Then what if that child becomes the new Einstein? a new Picasso? a new Shakespeare? a new G.G.Marquez? I'm just saying...  "
27,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3893454-christina,4,"This was an interesting read. While I applaud Skloot's attempt to present a fair look at the history of the HeLa cell line used in research labs all over the world, the book is clearly skewed toward sympathy for the family. Not that they don't deserve sympathy, but really, the problems of the family is NOT the fault of anyone involved with the cell line. Don't get me wrong, Henrietta and her family have had a hard life, and they do deserve some sympathy. But not for this particular issue.The sad fact is that Henrietta died of an aggressive cancer, leaving her family to live their lives without her. That was not her fault or the fault of her family, but it was also not the fault of the hospital staff of Johns Hopkins. Yes, there was racial and socio-economic discrimination, but the fact remains that Henrietta was treated to best of the ability of the doctors at that time. Do we view the taking of cell samples from Henrietta without her permission as unethical today? Most people would say yes. But the law still remains unclear about that, and in 1954 that was most certainly not seen as unethical - it was common practice. So in the context of the time, the act was not unethical. As for monetary compensation, Johns Hopkins did not profit from the growth of HeLa cells; in fact, the scientist that first worked with HeLa cells GAVE the cells away to many many many other labs FOR FREE. Those labs shared with other labs, etc. Are there companies that profit from the cells now? Yes. But they got the cells the same way everyone else did back then - for free. The company then did their own research to find a way to mass produce, store and ship living cells. At the point the first company started mass producing and selling the cells the identity of the donor was long hidden, and the fact the cells were widespread at that time made them common property, so people in possession of the cells could do pretty much anything they wanted with them. And now for the part that is a little stickier - the family found out about Henrietta's cells, were (sort of) tricked into donating blood and cell samples and were kept in the dark about the cell line for decades. Was that right? NO, absolutely not. HOWEVER, I will point out that some of the subsequent anger, confusion and fear on the part of the family was due to their extreme lack of education rather than a malicious attempt to prey upon the Lacks family. The science presented in the book is simplified somewhat for the lay person, which is nice, as is the look at the advances in medicine and research that HeLa cells have brought to the world. As a scientist, however, I think that Skloot's explanations were a little fuzzy and did not really dispel most people's image of how science works in the real world. Perhaps a little more objectivity and less family bonding would have made this a better book.In conclusion: though Skloot claims she tries to give an unbiased view of the history of HeLa cells and the family from whence it came, I am concerned that lay people who read this will not understand some of the finer points and it will increase the already rampant fear of science that pervades American culture. The majority of Americans are woefully un-educated in the sciences, to the point that many people view it as no different than magic,but weirder and scarier. "

And the way she told Henrietta's story was beautiful and almost reflective of Henrietta's life. The story started at a point and then spread out to become a story that enveloped all of humanity. I read this as more research on Henrietta for my forthcoming novel THE BOOK OF PHOENIX and it was exactly what I needed and wanted. I wanted the science but I also wanted the close personal narrative of this woman and the people in her life; I wanted the good, the bad and the ugly. This book was all of that. Some of it is lovely, some was disturbing, plenty of it as shocking, and lots of it was heart-breaking. Her story is so deeplyAmerican. Also, it was really cool how close the writer got to the narrative. and eventually became a part of it. I love that. Oh and there's a touch of African magic in the story, which didn't surprise me at ALL, considering what this book was about. <3'd this book!"

The tedious, repetitious ones that you could have sworn you already completed at least a thousand times? Next time you sigh loudly or roll your eyes at the prospect of this task, think about the people who came before us who were never offered the luxury of informed consent, confidentiality, and protection from discrimination. Horrendous injustices prompted these forms into action so that history does not repeat itself. It's a sad thought.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks offers historical insight into human rights issues within the medical field. Primarily though, it focuses on the woman behind the most famous and widely researched human cells in the world: Henrietta Lacks. Her name has only recently become known to the world which is quite sad, but thanks to her family's perseverance and Rebecca Skloot's heavy research and publication, the world now knows who to credit with most medical advances to date. It has been reported that Ms. Lacks had no knowledge of her contribution, as she was unaware that tissues were saved after multiple cancer biopsies/treatments, and therefore, she gave no permission for her cells to be used in any way, shape, or form, but Ms. Skloot reminds us that even today, none of us have any say over what is done with our cells and tissues once removed from our bodies. I appreciated Ms. Skloot's attention to Ms. Lacks' remaining family members and their immense struggles in spite of all the progress (and profits) made in the medical field. In my opinion though, she was a bit too forthcoming in regards to the family. Factors related to race, poverty, education, medical issues, disabilities, and access to healthcare are definitely warranted in a book like this to show the overall contrast between those benefiting from Ms. Lacks' contribution and the family that was left behind, along with the insensitivity and injustice of it all. However, criminal histories, superstitions, and mental illness had no place in this book in my opinion. I believe this was potentially harmful to the family's character, and some portions of the book painted the family in a money-hungry and incompetent light which was unnecessary even if that may have been Ms. Skloot's perception or experience. Regardless, the family's inclusion in this book did make all the difference and I thoroughly enjoyed my reading experience. If you'd like to gain some insight into the history of medical/science research along with a look at human/civil rights issues throughout the decades, check out The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks!My favorite quote:""You don't mess with Henrietta — she'll sic HeLa on your ass!"""
30,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,5,"Henrietta Lacks is a woman who was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1951. The cells cut from her body, because of their aptitude for growth and replication, still play a significant role in treating disease and other medical tests. She did not know her cells were being used, and her family did not benefit financially. The author writes extensively about her family, as they were a crucial source for the book. Because of so many trust relationships violated over the years, she had to first work to build trust and prove herself reliable. She went on to establish a trust for the family.This book discusses science, both the present state of medicine while Henrietta was being treated for cervical cancer (nothing short of radium tube inserts and lead!) and how science has grown in its understandings and treatments because of her cells. The book has to address the ways African Americans have been treated badly by the American medical establishment from Tuskagee to forced sterilizations, to even some patients injected with Henrietta's cells without their knowledge! I felt like I knew much of the story already, but only because this book has received so much acclaim and press, and I find rightly so. I'm not a scientist but felt I could understand it as Skloot presented the information.I also learned some terrifying things that don't soothe my paranoia. Huge government stores of cells that no longer belong to you - not owning the rights to your bodily tissue - still all true in the 21st century. Ever wonder where your blood, teeth, etc. got to? Ha. I read this during Banned Books Week 2015 because earlier this year it was challenged by a Tennessee mother who felt it was ""pornographic."" The woman had cervical cancer, cancer of the CERVIX, a body part all women have. Oh please. This book isn't pornography, it's science. Discussed on Episode 042 of the Reading Envy Podcast."
31,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186579-kate,1,"This book irritated me from the beginning. It couldn't decide if it was a history of the cells, the life story of one woman, a chronicle of how an author tracks down the life story of a woman, a position paper on racism, a position paper on human tissue ownership, or a position paper on disorganized rhetoric. I think it was all of those, and it drove me absolutely up the wall.As a history of the HeLa cells ... I read a Wired article that was better.As the life story of Henrietta Lacks ... it read like a list of facts instead of a human interest piece. And it kept going on tangents (with the life stories of each of her children, her doctors, etc.)As the story of the author tracking down a story ... that was actually kind of interesting.As a position paper on racism...it had a lot of disturbing stories - but no cohesive point.As a position paper on human tissue ownership... the best chapter was the last one, which actually listed facts and laws. And while the author clearly had an opinion in that chapter -it was more focused and less full of unrelated stories intended to pull on your hearts strings and shift your opinion.As a position paper on disorganized rhetoric...it was a stellar exemplar."
32,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"I don't know how many copies of a book need to be sold before it can be fairly described as a best-seller. In any case what kind of bearing does the number of copies sold have on the amount that a book is read? The success of Rebecca Skloot's book is maybe entirely unsurprising as it covers a wide range of angles and caters for many tastes. It has something of the ever popular misery mémoire, some social history, an investigative aspect with detective road trips, along with an exploration of one of the wonders of modern science. All of this comes together in two alternating narrative strands, the death of Henrietta Lacks from cancer and the strange ongoing life and use of a tissue sample collected from her that has been used for a host of purposes from cancer research to gene mapping to assessing human sensitivity to commercial products, as well as the impact of her life and death on her young family. As a whole it was a moving reading experience.The story told is a very simple one, and I found how it is told completely effective. It is not surprising that some forms of cancer, even with treatment, are fatal. It is not surprising that poor black people in the USA remain poor over time, it is not surprising that difficult childhood experiences can overshadow later adult lives, it is even not surprising that something if not entirely free to obtain like the tissue sample in question, has come to be a source of profit for many companies while providing no benefit to either the donor’s family nor the institution which provided Henrietta Lacks with medical treatment and collected the sample in the first place. Perhaps part of the success of Skloot's narration is just how unsurprising those elements of the story are juxtaposed with the completely unexpected survival and continuing life of Henrietta Lacks' tissue sample. There is a recognisable slice of life married with something unique so far in science and of enduring scientific impact.For me the most serious downside is that I had the feeling that Skloot had hoped her book might start a public debate on issues of sample ownership, but so far that discussion so far has not escaped the courts. That leaves us with a great piece of non-fiction writing rather than a rallying cry for change."
33,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,5,"In reading non-fiction, and particularly scientific non-fiction, my two most frequent gripes are: a lack of personal story, and a lack of overall narrative. It's my opinion that just because a work isn't fiction, it shouldn't miss out on the use of structural elements more common to fiction: a strong narrative and narrative structure can improve any kind of communication.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a near-flawless implementation of this. The book has three components: the story of Henrietta and her family, the story of the science made possible by Henrietta, and the story of the author, Skloot, researching the book. I can't stress enough how effectively these three threads are woven together, making a educational, intersectional, and ultimately tragic story. If you are interested in the human side of scientific advance then this is an absolute, absolute must-read. Highly recommended."

They turned out to be very essential to modern medical advancements.I found this to be an interesting book, mainly because it taught me a few science/medical bits, and it made me think more deeply about ethical issues related to tissue ownership. As always, I enjoyed the close-up views of racial issues.I'm glad that the author wrote this book, as I'm sure it helped Henrietta's family understand what really took place all those years ago. It also makes all of us aware of the debt we owe to Henrietta.4 Stars = Outstanding. It definitely held my interest."
35,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5036644-meredith-o-donnell,2,"Interesting concept. Reading it with my book club... Upate: Finished. I am always up for a rousing ethical debate. The deplorable breach of privacy, a basic human right, displayed in the book was appalling. Anyone who has ever been dehumanized can relate to the way Henrietta was objectified for the sake of science. It was beyond unconscionable. I am glad the story was told. I hope that Skloot's efforts will remind the industry of science and medicine that they need to be held accountable for their actions, and the finished product is not the only thing that matters, but the methods taken on their road to discovery count as well. Henrietta's cells have provided mankind with a lot to be grateful for, and for that we must thank the scientists and doctors who worked feverishly and masterfully, experimenting and coming up with new ideas. However, the people behind the cells have rights too. Bioethics have come a long way since the 1950's, but there are still flaws.  I learned in several journalism courses I took in college that the job of the journalist is to hold accountable those who serve the public--be it in politics, consumerism, or medicine. That is what Skloot has done by tackling the story of Henrietta Lacks--the person behind the immortal HeLa cell line. For that, I commend her. While I agreed with the endeavor, I had a few issues with her strategy. As others have mentioned, she placed herself in the story excessively. She claimed it was necessary, but I doubt if it was necessary to the extent that she did it. She seemed to want to constantly remind the reader of her plight. This is not the place of a journalist--just tell the story, don't tell your own story of getting the story. Also, she had an incredibly obvious bias, and a suspiciously not-so-obvious agenda. I did question Skloot's intentions. She spoke as an advocate for the Lacks family, but I do wonder whether or not she was a welcomed one, or a useful one.  She classifies the book as nonfiction upfront. And that it is. Or was intended to be... the story is real. But the details were so convoluted, shrouded and murky that it became difficult to truly believe with any authority one thing or the other. For instance, Skloot admits that the medical field was not proficient in recording things during this time (no computer.) Consequently, a lot of important details concerning Henrietta's illness, diagnosis, the retrieval of her cells, her death, her autopsy, her burial, among other factors, were not clearly documented. Also, Skloot's main sources of information were the Lacks family--a family frought with incest, disease, mental illness, partial deafness, drug abuse, a lack of intelligence and a lack of education--none of which was their fault, but all of which made them unreliable sources of information. For instance-- did Henrietta ever meet Gey? His assistant Mary swears yes. But Dave Lacks says absolutely not. The tie breaker is dead..and was on her death bed/twisted with pain/heavily medicated during the time of the alleged meeting so it is not out of the realm of possibilities that she either forgot about the encounter or didn't think to bring it up. It's also just as possible that Mary was confused (no documentation,) or was lying. I have no reason to believe one over the other. Also, Joe's murder. Skloot decided to present the family's convenient recollection of events authoritatively--that it was self defense. However, a witness testified under oath that the fatal attack was unprovoked. Again, I have no incentive to take one side over the other, but Skloot's selective storytelling contributed to my distrust of her as a narrator, a writer and a reporter.  When I read a nonfiction piece, I prefer for the facts to be indisputable. Aside from credibility issues, I also questioned Skloot's true motives. She hid behind an ultra-liberal facade: a sympathetic crusader who was empowering this poor, uneducated family with the voice they never had. But notice how she proudly boasts of a deep friendship with Deborah Lacks in the beginning of the book... but I wonder if Deborah, God rest her soul, would confirm this claim. We'll never know. Skloot seemed to pester the family, while at the same time condemning those who did the same...as if her reasons were more pure and justifiable. She also clearly lamented their lack of medical coverage and financial compensation, and a portion of the proceeds for the book will go to a scholarship fund for the family, but why didn't she just write them a big check? They didn't benefit directly. If you read closely, Skloot reveals that she had to agree to certain conditions before the Lacks family would agree to talk to her. She had to tell the family's story exactly the way it was told to her, whether facts were verified or not. She was so desperate to satisfy, what started out as her own morbid curiosity, and grew into an obsessive mission, that she agreed to this stipulation. That almost concealed little tidbit, combined with the unreliability and untrustworthiness of the medical profession during that time, left this reader skeptical of nearly every word. However, the subject matter and her insistance to reinstate the human side to a research subject, as well as the fact that Skloot manages to make very technical terminology and notions perfectly clear to a former B student in Biology, earn the writer one star each. I recommend reading along side Oliver Sacks' The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat-- another nonfiction piece about the humanization of patients. Meredith O'Donnell"
36,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43377498-hannah-greendale,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is fascinating and heartbreaking in equal measure. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Before she died, a surgeon took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in cultures for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta's were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory. Those cells, known as HeLa, are still alive today and have advanced medicine and science in countless ways; it seems there's no end to the list of discoveries made because of HeLa.I've tried to imagine how [Henrietta would] feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. Henrietta's cells helped launch the fledgling field of virology. As the Cold War escalated, some scientists exposed Henrietta's cells to massive doses of radiation to study how nuclear bombs destroyed cells and find ways to reverse that damage. Others put them in special centrifuges that spun so fast the pressure inside was more than 100,000 times that of gravity, to see what happened to human cells under the extreme conditions of deep-sea diving or spaceflight. The author took great care to learn about Henrietta Lacks. She paints Henrietta as a woman who accepted her illness and faced her treatment with unparalleled resilience and strength. One afternoon, as Henrietta lay on the couch, she lifted her shirt to show Margaret and Sadie what the treatments had done to her. Sadie gasped: The skin from Henrietta's breasts to her pelvis was charred a deep black from the radiation. The rest of her body was its normal shade -- more the color of fawn than coal. ""Hennie,"" she whispered, ""they burn you black as tar."" Henrietta just nodded and said, ""Lord, it just feels like that blackness be spreadin all inside me."" Cancer is a foul creature, sinister and terrifying, but Henrietta's cancer was a force of evil from the nadir of Hell. It ravaged her body in unmerciful ways; it's no wonder those cells survived in a test tube where all other cells died. Suddenly [Henrietta's] body went rigid as a board. She screamed as the nurse ran to the bed, tightening the straps around Henrietta's arms and legs to keep her from thrashing onto the floor as she'd done many times before. Gladys thrust the pillow from her lap into Henrietta's mouth, to keep her from biting her tongue as she convulsed in pain. The book is extensive; all of the information is efficiently organized and comprehensive. Part of what makes this book so tantalizing are all of the near-misses, all of the moments when the author was turned down in her quest to learn the truth about Henrietta Lacks. Had she given up, as so many others did, Henrietta Lacks might have been forgotten and this riveting book would have never existed. "
37,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6942006-suzy,5,"I was completely in the thrall of author Rebecca Skloot while listening to the audio of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. This is at once a scientific story of Henrietta's cancer cells, called HeLa, which were harvested from her as she was dying from cervical cancer in 1951. These are the first human cells to become ""immortal"", perpetuating themselves even to today, and being used in many important health discoveries including polio vaccines, in vitro fertilization, aids research, cancer drugs and too many others to mention. It is also the story of Henrietta and her family, who had no idea that their mother's cells were taken or the importance of the cells to medicine. Her children learn about this from Skloot's research and this knowledge causes misunderstandings and various reactions in Henrietta's adult children from some wanting financial remuneration to others just wanting their mother to be honored and respected for her contribution to science. My heart went out to Henrietta and her family who, because they were poor and black, were treated, and lived, as second class citizens. They are often at the mercy of their many health problems through lack of education, lack of access to health insurance and suspicions about the medical establishment. It seems so unjust! (Thanks to GR friend Will Byrnes for posting this NY Times article on the consent agreement reached with the family finally . . . 62 years later. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/sci...)At first I found the structure of the book a little frustrating because it jumped in both time and storyline, but once I decided to just flow with it, I was completely engaged. I think listening helped. It was as if the author was telling her story just to me, and that I was discovering it side-by-side with her. There are so many layers, that my thought is there's something to connect to for everyone based on a reader's interests coming to the book. Skloot reveals early in the book that she learned about HeLa in a biology class when she was younger and decided then and there to research and write about them. Little did she know that she would be telling the story of the Lacks family right along with the scientific importance of the cells. I appreciated the interview at the end of the audio where Skloot tells us how she decided on the focus and the structure of the book. This was the February book club pick at our wonderful art museum here in Minneapolis, and I enjoyed the discussion. I'm eagerly anticipating the HBO movie based on the book which will be aired April 22 here in the States. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5686132/"

The fact that her family can't even get reliable health insurance really just adds insult to injury. This is a well-researched, well-written book. The issue it discusses is extremely important, and the last chapter about tissue ownership is outright terrifying. It was the first time I heard of ""gene patents"" (what?), and this:Myriad Genetics, which holds the patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes responsible for most cases of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, charges $3,000 to test for the genes. Myriad has been accused of creating a monopoly, since no one else can offer the test, and researchers can’t develop cheaper tests or new therapies without getting permission from Myriad and paying steep licensing fees. Scientists who’ve gone ahead with research involving the breast-cancer genes without Myriad’s permission have found themselves on the receiving end of cease-and-desist letters and threats of litigation.I don't know what to say. I think this paragraph sums it up very well:
The debate over the commercialization of human biological materials always comes back to one fundamental point: like it or not, we live in a market-driven society, and science is part of that market. Baruch Blumberg, the Nobel Prize-winning researcher who used Ted Slavin’s antibodies for hepatitis B research, told me, “Whether you think the commercialization of medical research is good or bad depends on how into capitalism you are.” On the whole, Blumberg said, commercialization is good; how else would we get the drugs and diagnostic tests we need? Still, he sees a downside. “I think it’s fair to say it’s interfered with science,” he said. “It’s changed the spirit.” Now there are patents and proprietary information where there once was free information flow. “Researchers have become entrepreneurs. That’s boomed our economy and created incentives to do research. But it’s also brought problems, like secrecy and arguments over who owns what.”

If it doesn't win every non-fiction award for 2010 than whoever votes for non-fiction awards should have their library cards taken away from them*.The author, Rebecca Skloot, does a masterful job of seamlessly weaving in the scientific story of Henrietta Lacks' immortal cells and the effect they have had on medicine and medical ethics with a real human interest story about Henrietta and the struggles of her family. Skloot does this without coming across as maudlin, preachy, overly technical, guilt ridden, condescending, or just plain boring. She deftly weaves two legs of one story together, darting in and out with ease and keeping the reader interested in learning the science and caring about the people. She does this all while doing her best to avoid passing judgment or creating villains. Like a good journalist, she simply reports the facts of a fantastically and seemingly thoroughly researched book and lets the reader interpret them as they will.In all, this is not only a terrific science book that is not afraid to tackle gray areas of ethics and leave them unanswered without getting preachy, not only a gripping human interest story with more than one human we are interested in, but also a socioeconomic look at the educational opportunities and struggles of poor, disadvantaged people across several generations of our country. Most of all though, this is a uniquely American story.*Seeing as how Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World by Liaquat Ahamed won the last Pulitzer for history, perhaps voters should have already had their library cards taken from them because that book was so bad I wouldn't even use it as a doorstop and besmirch the dignity of my door."

Her cells are another story, they continued to live on after biopsies of her cancerous tissue was taken without her permission or her family's knowledge and grown in labs to be shipped around the world to test diseases, develop gene therapy, and ultimately change the world. All the while, her children and family had no idea that this was happening, and they struggle to come to terms with what it means to have immortal cells, while the family can barely afford medical treatment.Rebecca Skloot takes a nearly impossible task of researching something that was breaking at the time, and challenges human rights to our own tissue and most importantly how client consent has changed over the past couple of decades. Fascinating story merging the lines of racial and gender discrimination, while also facing class struggles. In my opinion, this book should be required reading."
46,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9554958-sara,1,"The story behind the infamous ""HeLa"" cells are interesting to most scientists, as most of us have either worked with them, read endless research articles/journals utilizing them, and know about their contributions to science and/or medicine, among many more things. This immortal cell line was derived from Mrs. Lacks' cervical tissue, which became cancerous after she was infected with HPV. She recieved treatment for cervical canver at Johns Hopkins University, known at this time period for treating black patients. Though I don't know how her race/ethnicity/social status affected her personal treatment at the hospital, the actual medical treatment for her condition was unbiased and the normal protocol for any one with the condition. During this time period, research physicians, or physicians who were interetsed in biomedical research were striving to culture an immortal cell line, which has enormous applications and implications in biomedical research. The physicians, with the help of other scientists and technicians, were able to create a cell line that had greatly sought-after conditions for the purposes of biomedical research, inlcuding immortalization and ease of growth in culture. The use of her cells greatly impacted the field of biomedical research, and the cultivation and use of the HeLA cell line contributed to the establishment of the first Polio vaccine, cancer research, and countless other types of research where the characteristics of the HeLa cell line offer great advatange and resource for pusuit of scientific knowledge. My review of this book has nothing to do with the contributions her cells have made to the scientific community. The physicians at the time did take her cells and culture them without her consent, but that was standard protocol at the time, and she was not isolated for that purpose. We have all contributed from the use of her cells, therefore, it is hypocritical to be critical of the use of them.Despite a major attempt to create a ""boogey-man"" portrait of the physicians/scientists that worked with her cells, none of them were awarded financially for establishing the HeLa cell line. The author tries to create an image of a poor black woman who was robbed of her cells without consent and not awarded the enormous monentary prize for their use, but the truth is, this was standard procedure at that time period,and her cells just happened to actually work for that purpose. I was very interested to learn more about Mrs. Lacks in this book. What made this book impossible to read was the author. She hardly writes more than a few pages about Mrs. Lacks. She mostly wrote a biography detailing her attempts at finding information, without providing anything insightful about the actual woman it was supposed to be about, Mrs. Lacks. Most of the book is about her relatives and their immense anger and resentment about not being compensated for the use of Mrs. Lacks' cells. I don't really give a shit about that. A lot of shitty things happen to people in this world, this wasn't in any way the worst, and that would have made a decent book if that was what the book was supposed to be about. This book was so boring, I didn't even finish it. "
47,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,4,"This book has been around for a while now, so most people know the basis. Rebecca Skloot tells the story here of Henrietta Lacks, the poor black woman who died of cervical cancer in 1951. Why do we care about Henrietta Lacks? Quite simply, her cells, which were taken without her knowledge or consent, became known as HeLa cells. Now does it sound familiar? HeLa cells have been around for a while, recognizable to many for their importance in developing the polio vaccine and gene mapping. HeLa cells have survived and grown since 1951.But Skloot recognized there was more to the science than just the letters HeLa. She set out to uncover the truth about the person behind the abbreviation. With the help of members of Lacks's family, Skloot spent about a decade on this book. She visited the now-defunct Clover, where Lacks grew up, she took Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, to the hospital where her sister, Elsie, was put away as an ""imbecile"" and where she died under suspicious circumstances. Deborah, who was four when Henrietta died, was just as committed to finding out the full story about her family as Skloot was.The book bounces around in time, from the 40s and 50s as Skloot detailed Henrietta's life and illness, to ""present day"" of 2009 when the book was published. Skloot's own journey with her research began in the late 90s. She got married and divorced during the writing of this book. She knew Henrietta Lacks was unknown by the public, even though her cells had been such a vital part of medicine and science for decades.The heartbreaking part about this real-life story is that Henrietta's descendants and family knew nothing about the HeLa cells themselves. They were never given any real explanation about the cells, nor were they compensated in any way. The book brings to light a lot of issues, from social to ethical. Most impressive is the concept that all tissue in and on your body belongs to you while it's attached to you, but as soon as it's removed from you, it's not longer ""yours"". You have no rights over it. It can be researched and sold and re-sold and modified and studies. You get no say in whether you want studies on pieces of your body to go towards the cure for cancer or for the creation of atomic bombs or other devices of mass destruction.Years ago I had a cyst removed. Thinking of a Margaret Atwood story, I asked my surgeon (and every subsequent tech and anesthesiologist whom I met prior to surgery) if I could keep my cyst once they excised it. After their initial responses of ""Ew, WHY?"" they told me that would not, could not, should not ever be available to me. ""But it's MINE"" I tried to argue. They claimed liability, and disease (not that I had a disease, but it's jut not sanitary). None of them had read the Atwood story I was referencing, but if they had, they would have been even more adamant that I should be allowed nowhere near the cyst once it had been removed.I've thought about the same thing during a breast biopsy and then more recently, when they removed my thyroid. What are they going to do with it? What I really would like, more than being able to keep these things that have been pulled from my body over the years, is frequent updates about the road my tissues have traveled. Remember in the 90s the popularity of things like adopting a star, or a whale, or a polar bear. You'd get a picture in the mail for the low-cost of whatever, and then a few updates throughout the year about where your whale is and how it is faring.That's what I want with the tissues that have been taken from me. Just a postcard with a picture of what they're doing with my tissues, a little update that says ""ElPa cell was just sold to Norway for the price of 8 million where they will study the effects of cigarette smoking on this tissue taken from your breast in the early 2000s!""As Skloot spent more time with the Lacks family, she became almost a member of the family herself. After the initial periods of suspicion and caution, Skloot was embraced and was called for all the important family births and deaths and other major life experiences. From a personal storytelling point of view, I found that touching, though it wasn't exactly a necessary part of the main story.I suppose really it means that HeLa (Henrietta Lacks) is a part of everyone, brings us all together. She continues to live, and while her family will never see any portion of the proceeds and still have no say over their mother's cells, there's some satisfaction that can be derived from how common the name Henrietta Lacks is now. The woman behind the cells should never be forgotten. Her contributions (that she didn't even know she was making) should be told. She was more than just the abbreviations HeLa.I know everyone has read this book already by this point, but it came up in my little world because I'm now on the Common Reader Committee at the university where I work. At the first meeting, it became obvious that very few of us are actually readers (one went so far as to say he doesn't like to read, which begs the question as to why he was even there). This book was one of my recommendations, even though I hadn't read it yet. My boss read the first six chapters and felt that it would cover a lot of the bases that our university likes to cover, and would appeal to the three main colleges very well by dealing with social justice issues, science and medicine, legality, ethics, and health and wellness.Now that I've read this book on my own I can go back to our meeting next week and say, holy shit guys, this book really does cover ALL the bases. The idea is this would be a book that everyone could read - every student, staff, and faculty member. While the story meanders a bit and gets a bit dry in other places, I think ultimately the story of Henrietta Lacks and her cells will appeal to all readers in the university.But if I hear one more time from anyone ""But are they mature enough for it"" I will scream. College students aren't quite as dumb as everyone likes to think they are. Maybe they're lazy, but cheese and rice, I'm not going to dumb down the Common Reader in concerns that students won't be able to read a book anymore.Plus there's an HBO movie coming out next month based on this book, so if just reading a book isn't incentive enough, maybe Oprah will be.(My other top contenders would be The Handmaid's Tale and March: Book One. Though some on the committee thinks if we give a graphic novel to college students they will think we're giving them ""cartoons"" to read and there may be an uprising. It's fascinating to me how little faculty and staff know the students at their own university. To be fair, those who suggest an uprising are also the ones who don't read, and they claim not to know how to read a graphic novel. Someone asked ""Do you start at the front or the back?"" conflating graphic novels with manga, I believe. This committee will be a long road for me. Someone just put me in charge already.)"
48,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422276-mag,5,"It reads like good crime fiction. It chronicles the life of the woman whose cancerous tissue became the first tissue in history which could be successfully grown as culture and used in various, and countless, experiments from vaccine research to cloning. Her tissue was so successful in fact that it became virtually immortal, surviving in various environments and proliferating at prodigious rates. Yet, very little was known about the woman herself, her life, her family, her history, and this is what Skloot set out to uncover. What she found out is absolutely stunning from the point of medical ethics, American history and American healthcare. Fascinating. Highly recommended."

50,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27544898-bookishrealm,5,"This book was phenomenal in more ways than one. I knew a little bit about Henrietta Lacks, but I was definitely not aware of the extent to which her family was affected by the use of her sells in modern day biology. It broke my heart to see how her family, deeply rooted in religious beliefs, was broken because they felt as though Henrietta's soul resided in those cells. I have my own personal opinions about the entire concept of doctors taking medical waste for their own advantages. Nevertheless, what I can say about this issue is that it is stories such as the Tuskegee Experiment and the use of Henrietta's cells that have ultimately made the black community hesitant about wanting to go to doctors. I plan to do more research on this topic and it may be a project that I throw myself into. Hopefully I can find more text that really delves into the black community's experience with the medical field. This really opened my eyes to a lot of issues related to the medical field/industry and I can't wait to read more. "

I like a book that makes me think, just as I did when I was a college student. There's a fine line between what is ethically/morally ""right"" and that which infringes on a person's own being and that person's (or family of said person) rights to his/her cells. There are never any correct answers or final conclusions in the world of bioethics...it's an ongoing dispute but one that really caused me to question my own decisions and how they are interpreted."
52,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350218-booklady,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is required reading for pharmaceutical students at a nearby Oklahoma University where a friend of my daughter goes to college. She told me about this book over Christmas. I can see why it’s required reading. I’m glad it is and I hope it is for medical and research students everywhere.It tells the story of an African American woman, Henrietta Lacks, who went to Johns Hopkins in 1951 for treatment for cervical cancer. Some cancerous cells were removed from her body. This much she knew. The cells were also saved, cultured, and reproduced—without her knowledge or consent—as was common practice at the time. What makes this an amazing story is that Henrietta’s cells have never died from that day until the present, hence the title. They continue to grow and reproduce at a phenomenal rate. They currently exist in laboratories, hospitals and warehouses all over the world; have been used in almost every form of scientific research from the 50’s until now; have gone to space; have been contaminated and caused contamination. The scientific and medical communities owe untold debt to the cells it calls HeLa and yet not one dime of compensation, even in terms of discounted medical care or health insurance has ever been received by any of Henrietta’s numerous descendants. Interestingly enough, they aren’t looking for anything in that way. Now isn’t that refreshing? Rather, in spite of all they have suffered—and indeed this is a book about pain—their focal interest throughout was in finding out what happened to their mother since she died so young, gaining recognition for her and learning what happened to Henrietta’s oldest daughter who died in a ‘hospital for the negro insane’, which was 1950’s terminology.  The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks crosses many disciplines and for that reason I expect scientists might skim the vignettes about Henrietta’s children, while those who prefer human interest could find themselves avoiding the technical sections. Virginia Woolf’s Common Readers, however, will positively adore this book! It has everything they look for in the written word. Not only what was just mentioned, but also: the complexities and importance of the ‘tissue issue’, what are the medical, legal, ethical, and other parameters for tissue gathering, storage, research, usage, and compensation. And I commend the author, Rebecca Skloot, a self-proclaimed non-believer for her sensitive handling of the many stressed and stressful events, issues and personalities she encountered concerning matters of faith, morals, and religion.  A very important book to read!  Here is a rather long but fascinating 1998 BBC documentary about Henrietta Lacks and HeLa.  Here is an article which gives some more current info about the Lacks family and the issue of privacy v. tissue donation. "
53,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,3,"Henrietta Lacks, a young African-American mother of five children, died in Baltimore in 1951 from a highly aggressive form of cervical cancer—but more than fifty years after her death, part of her lives on in the form of HeLa, a cell line cultivated from a tissue sample of hers which played a key role in several major scientific and medical breakthroughs. Skloot's book tells Lacks' story, partly to pay tribute to a woman who was forgotten by all but her family for many years despite her importance to medicine; partly in order to examine the complex attendant issues of medical ethics, race and class. Skloot's writing is fluid and accessible, and I learned some things which were shocking though not surprising to me (see the organ retention scandal which broke in Ireland a few years ago). That said, I would have liked for a stronger focus on the ethics and the science aspect of the novel and less on the lives of Lacks' children and other relatives. Skloot's focus on them and on some of the more unpalatable aspects of their lives felt quite voyeuristic to me at points, recounted not because Skloot wanted to examine the effects of the vicious cycle of poverty on people's lives but because it would inject more drama into the book. The author talks at length about the less-than-pure motivations of those who had previously profited from Lacks' cells, and their refusal to compensate Lacks' family in any way, about how she was financing her research with credit cards and student loans—and yet her end-goal was always to acquire a book deal, and her account of her relentless attempts to get in touch with members of the Lacks family made me highly uncomfortable. Much of the latter half of the book dealt with the relationship between Skloot and Deborah, Henrietta Lacks' youngest daughter—again, uncomfortable to read about at several points, and not especially relevant to the book's main thrust. Overall, an interesting read, but I feel that The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks could easily have been edited down to half its length—and focused more on Henrietta because of it."
54,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/925949-jude,5,"it's as if the writer wanted the story the way i would want it, and self-observes the arc of her own education the way i would, so the emotional style resonated at a profound level: a combination of passion, humility & fearlessness that makes me trust the her completely, that makes me grateful she is the person who chose this story - or that it chose her.& then there's the story - the science. the race & class issues, the muck of medical ethics before patients were real people and blackfolk were real patients... that's the warp. The weft is the story of a friendship between two women meeting each other on the edge of both their worlds, brought there by Henrietta: her immortality is not simply a series of cells.the narrators are excellent. the pacing is a tiny bit slow, but that works for the direct quotes - and hearing voices in dialect anchors the story in time and place. The voices in this story - the amount of quoted text & speech- keep this story very immediate - with the feel of a good documentary or good fiction.a joy."
55,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3214537-sequoia-m,2,"I had heard so much about this book and was so excited to read it . . . but there's not much to read. I tell you the premise, and that's the book. It just keeps doubling over itself to tell you the same science, the same sad story of the people it affected, and nothing ever really happens. People say things like ""hold on, are you ready for this?"" and then nothing happens. It's the same information over and over. So I'm going to spoil the whole book for you; Henrietta Lacks was a poor syphilitic black woman who married her cousin, had a bunch of kids, and died very young of an aggressive cancer, the cells of which doctors took samples of without asking and then developed into the first 'immortal' cell line, which went on to be used by scientist and doctors around the world. Her descendants are plagued by poverty and bad health. That's it. Now imagine me telling you different versions of that over and over while I also tell you about how I'm researching and writing about it, dealing with this difficult and suspicious relatives. That's the book. "
56,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7542614-jennifer,5,"Very well written book that talks about race,science,and issues relating to ethics. Henrietta Lacks was a poor black women who cells were taken without her consent and used by many scientists to develop vaccines,cloning, and many more things. Unfortunately her family was very poor and never received any money from her cells being used.They had many health problems and could not afford health insurance and died young as a result. I learned a lot of interesting facts while reading this book. "
57,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/188447-jessica-jeffers,5,"The latest in my ""should've read a long time ago"" project did not disappoint. "
58,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36293066-dawnie,4,"Its a very important story, its unique in its format of that the cells of Henrietta lacks are doing and how it seems that even today nobody understand why or how those cells are even still alive, BUT sadly the actual story of doctors doing something without permission is NOT a unique one, since sadly there are still today patients being used without their knowledge -as it is even stated in the book itself. And i think that especially that is something that should be taking away from this book: This story is important and interesting, but so far not much has changed in the medical field so that this type of thing does not continues to happen without permission from the patients themselves. This book does point out quiet a lot of positive things that happened because and with cells and how it could have never happened without them. Some horrendous things, some wonderful things where achieved thanks to those cells and with that thanks to Henrietta Lacks. And i am defiantly one of the first people to point out that medical advances are necessary and that we still have way to little knowledge and actual solutions for way to man illnesses! But i think that this book also points out two very important things and drives them home quiet nicely: 1. Human tissue was once part of a person!We all should respect that. Yes its important that a lot of different science fields have access to tissue samples. But its also important to remember the people that gave those samples. Be it willingly, unwillingly, during life or after their death, it was once part of a living breathing person! I think a lot of us prefer to ignore that, or try to forget it and i think that is defiantly one thing we all should work on always remembering when we take any kind of medicine without a second thought! 2. there are lot of loopholes legally that should be worked on!All this talk of ""technically it wasn't required"" in this book just made me want to shake someone! What it comes down to in very basic forms -especially in regards of this specific book and the story it tells- is that everyone should be asking for permission. Doctors and scientists should explain in understandable terms what they want and why it could be helpful and i am pretty sure that a lot of people -especially those with illnesses!- will be more than willing to hand out tissue samples for further use! No need to just take them without asking! So why do it?Which brings it all back to the first point: lets not forget all those ""samples"" actually come from someone that is not just there to be a lab-rat!Now the one ""negative"" thing of this book is that i personally didn't really like how the Skloot wrote this book. Some sections felt as if she wanted to get that particular part of the story told and done with as fast as possible and shoved a lot of details and information into a pretty small section and number of pages. And than sometimes she would go on and on about some things for endless number of pages that i personally felt that it wasn't necessary to go on about it for that long. To say it short it is not he best nonfiction writing i have read. BUT its also far from the worst. Its very readable and yes it could have been kept a little shorter, but all in all it was done pretty well in the writing department. of course that is completely personal and some of the reviews i read LOVED the writing, so clearly that part is debatable.If you are interested in this book, defiantly give it a try. If you are going into a scientific field? Defiantly read this!"
59,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,3,"A book like this makes me realize how important education in general and particularly science education is. Today’s science is yesterday’s magic—for those who don’t understand science, it can seem like very frightening black magic. The story of Henrietta Lacks explores the intersection between science, research, education, capitalism, civil rights, and consent.The major question implicit in this book is whether we have any claim to our own cells after they have been removed from our bodies. Is it ethical to take “discarded” cells—those left over after medical procedures—and do research from them and potentially make money from either the cells or the research. This issue gets us down somewhere in our irrational subconscious—after all, we all “know” enough about voodoo and black magic to know that curses require hair, nail clippings, blood, or other bodily secretions in order to be effective. In many ways, the story of the HeLa cell line traces the history of medical research in the US (and to some extent, other countries), evolving from the exploitation of vulnerable people towards the concept of informed consent. It also traces the history of an African American family, liberated from slavery, but not from poverty and deprivation. The current distrust of science has some real roots in situations like these, where people were used without their knowledge for experimental purposes. But the lack of scientific literacy in the general population helps with the proliferation of conspiracy theories and the prevalence of medical quackery. Witness all the “miracle cures” that people buy into. One older lady that I used to work with was always pouring money into some miracle weight loss scheme or another—it didn’t seem to occur to her that if the method actually worked, it would be front page news on Time magazine, not some obscure ad in the back of a newspaper.We have to seriously question ourselves and our politicians about the quality of our educational systems. Are they being funded? Do we have enough teachers? Can poor children hope to get education equal to that of rich children?As my grandfather used to say, no education is wasted."
60,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,"For a non-fiction book about science, this book is pretty interesting. Chapters about genes, cloning and cancer are juxtaposed with chapters about Henrietta's personal life and about the author's interactions with the Lacks family. I think this book would scare a lot of people about how privacy is dealt with as a legal issue in the medical community. The book is about Henrietta Lacks - a woman whose cells live on and on to be experimented with, cloned, put into space, blown up, used to make human-animal and human-plant hybrids, etc. The point of the book is that these cells were taken from her without her knowledge or consent. Today, no one in her family can afford medical care, even though their mother/grandmother's cells are stored by the billions in laboratories around the world. This brings up many interesting points in debates about what rights the medical community has to do procedures 'for the benefit of humankind' vs. the rights of the individual and patient. Do your cells and tissues belong to you? Do they still belong to you, even when removed from your body? It is surprising how fuzzy the laws still are on this issue. The book also touches a little bit on racism - Henrietta was black, and the doctors who took and distributed her cells were white. But racism isn't the main focus. I found this book fascinating - and cell research isn't really my forte. I recommend this book, even to people who generally don't read or like non-fiction."
61,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,5,I read this book back in 2013 just before I joined Goodreads. I found my review on Audible and decided to add it to Goodreads for my records.This is a well written non-fiction book that provides back ground information about unfair treatment of minorities by medical research. Cassandra Campbell and Bahni Turpin did a great job with the narration of the book. The story of Henrietta Lacks and her family is interesting and the discovery and care of the Hi La cells. One major item about the family is the lack of education that played a major role in their understanding and ability to control the situation. The book accomplishes its goal of promoting proper documentation of biological tissue research. It raises the question of ownership of our own tissues and whether or not we have proprietary rights to our bodies in situ or in vitro. This question needs to be answered NOW not in the future. The other teaching of the book was how important education is to each individual. This is an absolute must read book for everyone on this planet.

64,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"I blew through this fascinating audiobook, practically manufacturing housework to do so that I'd have an excuse to plug myself in (okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration; there was plenty of housework to do without my having to manufacture any). I would recommend this book to just about anyone seeking a great read -- even if you're usually more of a fiction person, this non-fiction book offers plenty of interesting characters and storylines as well as being informative and provocative in the way of non-fiction.Did you know that much of medical research (and the benefits we derive every day, including many routine vaccines and medications we take for granted) is dependent on a culture of human cells that continue to live and reproduce even after their original owner died in 1951? Well, I didn't. And I wouldn't have thought that this factoid would interest me particularly, not being much of a science person myself. But somehow, Rebecca Skloot was able to make the dynamics surrounding these cells not only comprehensible to me but intriguing (no small feat). Even more intriguing, though, was the story of the late human being behind these cells, Henrietta Lacks, who never knew that her cells had been taken for research. Henrietta's surviving children, tragically losing their mother at a young age to cervical cancer and raised in a poor and abusive environment, only learned about this later in life and never saw a penny of the proceeds.""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" contains several stories. There is the story of Henrietta, a poor young African American woman with incurable cervical cancer, and of her children struggling to grow up without her after her early death. There is the story of the doctor who decided to slice off pieces of her tumor just prior to her death without asking or even informing her, who then discovered that these cancerous cells were immortal. There is the story of the cells, which began to be mass-produced and distributed to researchers for a wide variety of interesting and often ground-breaking experiments. And there is the story of Rebecca Skloot, a journalist who was persistent and dogged in her efforts to win Henrietta's family's reluctant trust (after they had been duped by others attempting to capitalize on Henrietta) so that she could learn and tell their story.Henrietta's adult children in this book are colorful characters with their own stories who overcame some difficult situations, some more successfully than others. We also meet different doctors and researchers -- while some prove to be profiteers, others are truly dedicated to science for its own sake. The doctor who originally took Henrietta's tumor for research without her knowledge fell into the latter category, which is part of what makes this a three-dimensional book rather than a simplistic polemic. A product of his times, this 1950s doctor was less sensitive to the medical and research ethics which have since received more attention, particularly when it came to a poor African-American woman. Should you care if someone uses your body tissues for medical research without your consent? Before I began reading this book, my thought was, why the heck would I care? Assuming that these tissues need to be removed in any case, why not use them to do some good for science and for mankind? But Rebecca offers some anecdotes which complicate this question, and the irony running throughout the book is that Henrietta's descendants cannot afford decent medical care, even as the entire medical profession benefits from Henrietta's unwittingly donated cells.Even if you think you're not a science person, even if you think you're not a non-fiction person, I would recommend checking this book out."
65,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"On the threshold between medicine and ethics.This book talks about ethical and legal conflicts, historically raised by the discovery of immortal cells that changed medicine and patients life's for the better. It‘s an astonishing story you probably didn‘t hear about before:In 1951 a colored poor woman named Henrietta Lacks walked into the Hopkins University, where a doctor extracted cells from her large cervix tumor, that killed her briefly after. But as they discovered in the laboratory, those were anything but normal cells, but the first immortal human cells grown in culture. They are still alive today and were replicated to millions and spread to laboratories all over the world, though Lacks has been dead for more than sixty years. They called them HeLa cells and they were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. What interested me the most was the scientific and legal part of that book. Ultimately it‘s a question of property and if we have the right on our cells, once they leave our body, particularly if we don‘t know about it.First there is the problem with uninformed consent. Henrietta did not provide informed consent for her cells to be used, she didn‘t have knowledge. Beyond that people were later unknowingly injected with her tumor cells, for the purpose of medical research. The same was performed on healthy prisoners with their knowledge, though their free consent seems to be questionable. They developed tumors, sometimes killing them. Furthermore her autopsy report was later published in the book of a journalist, the family didn‘t knew about and didn‘t want to see published. The question is the violation of privacy rights.The second problem are genetic rights/non-rights. Her family (whose DNA also links to those cells) did not learn of the implications of her tissue sample until years later, and didn‘t fully approve of it‘s usage A big focus also are patents and profits for biologic material.Henrietta and her family were very poor and didn’t even have health insurance. They received zero profits, while her cells sell for multiple-millions until today.Very shocking are also racism claims. Because the cells were discovered in the 50, making public that white people were treated with cell stems of a black woman would have had a major impact. Additionally implications are made, that colored people were categorically abused, abducted, purposely infected and killed to perform medical experiments. The biographical nature of the book ensures the reader does not separate the science and ethics from the family. These are not abstract questions, impacts and implications, but actual, valuable people and historic events.What I didn’t like just as much though, is how the story is told at times, jumping between characters and writing styles; sometimes loosing the silver lining. The writing is very simple and doesn’t at all feel factual. As a non fiction fan, I miss that at times but I guess that others appreciate it even more. It reads a lot like a novel, particularly since a lot of content is told through conversations. In conclusion a super interesting story I won’t forget quickly!"
66,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16002711-anna,5,"What a wonderful book! It describes the life of Henrietta Lacks and her family, the origin of the HeLa cell line (the first human immortal cell line), the research conducted with these cells, and also the author’s research and interviews in unfolding this story.“I’ve tried to imagine how she’d feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. I’m pretty sure that she—like most of us—would be shocked to hear that there are trillions more of her cells growing in laboratories now than there ever were in her body.” "

This book can satisfy several audiences on several different levels. The technical information about the science of cells is fascinating. The ethical questions raised by the unauthorized use of someone's cells are important to ask and ponder. But most fascinating is the story of the Lacks family. Skloot's exhaustive research spanned a decade and she tells a story that is honest, heart wrenching and provocative. "
68,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl,5,"This is one stellar piece of nonfiction that has a bit of everything in it for everybody. Beautifully written and structured because it is clear that while there's SOoo much information here, it is arranged in such a way that you don't get lost. Sure the author is a science writer, but she's also a creative nonfiction writer so the book doesn't read like a nonfiction textbook, and has the plot structure of fiction. Some chapters tell the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family, others take you on the research journey with Rebecca Skloot. The interactions she has with the family makes for light, sometimes humorous reading. In fact, the chronology is done in a way to make the book more interesting. The book is as much about family, as it is about science, history, racial tensions, and of one extraordinary black woman who has done more for medical research and advancements, than anything or anyone the industry has seen. It will have you crying, laughing, yelling at people...you name it. Born in 1920, Henrietta Lacks was thirty years old when she went to see a doctor for ""spotting"" and pain, and started getting treatments for cervical cancer (mind you, in the ""colored"" wards of John Hopkins. This was during the Jim Crow era). The researcher/doctor who treated her, collected samples of her cells (without her knowledge) while he placed radium inside of her. She soon deteriorated and each time she went in for treatment, her cells were taken and stored. Yet she knew nothing of the cells growing in a lab, or the fact that she was now infertile because of her cancer treatment. When she died, her husband signed paperwork to have an autopsy performed, because he was under the impression that doctors would find out if his children were predisposed to whatever his wife had, not knowing that his signature allowed his wife's body to be cut open to help with more research.This is the breadth of the story I think. A story about an African-American woman whose life and death seemed to be an irony--she wasn't allowed to mention her white, slave-owning family, yet she was buried next to them. She wasn't allowed to use the ""white-only"" medical facilities, yet her cells were mixed with white cells. In science cell culture, there were no other cells with the ability to multiply and stay immortal like hers. So every major medical breakthrough, like polio vaccine for example, came from the usage of her cells. The main thrust is, she didn't know. Her family didn't know, and they didn't find out until twenty years later because the name Henrietta Lacks was hidden by the doctors who used her cells as research. Scientists made millions from her body and her family had tons of health issues, with no help from their mother's cells and no health insurance. ""A search of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office database turns up more than seventeen thousand patents involving HeLa Cells,"" Skloot wrote. But Henrietta's son Lawrence wanted to know, ""She's the most important woman in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?""There they were, at a time when the country was learning about the ""Tuskegee Syphilis Study"" (where African-American men with syphilis were recruited for research, then made to die slow, painful deaths even after their researchers realized that penicillin would cure them), and cells from a black woman was being used to save millions of Americans, mostly white.In this book, Skloot brings the woman behind the cells to life, talks about her life, her troubled marriage, her children. She develops a relationship with Deborah, Henrietta's daughter who suffered the most from all of it. She talks to scientists and researchers. She brings in history. She talks about race tensions and shows how when slavery was abolished, African-Americans became slaves to another master: medicine. I'll admit, at times it was an emotional roller coaster for me, but one quote from Deborah stood out for me and should for you:""Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different.""So anybody should be able to read this book because the way in which it is written, is not to point fingers (not even at the medical industry because the author manages to explain those times as well) but to glean the truth. To finally give credit where credit is due, and to educate. To honor a woman, a mother, a wife, whose body makes it possible for us to get some of the modern medical treatments that we get today. This is one book I will remember, that's for sure! "
69,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon,4,"In 1951, Henrietta Lacks passed away due to complications arising from cervical cancer. Following her death, cancerous cells were harvested from her body and used in ongoing experiments regarding the growth of cells outside the human body. Previous to Henrietta, scientists could only make it a few days before the cells would ultimately die, forcing them to start all over. Henrietta’s cells were different, they grew at an astounding rate and researchers were able to keep them alive. Since the discovery, they've been used in countless experiments and led to numerous scientific breakthroughs - most notably the polio vaccine.Today, Henrietta’s cells usually go for a few hundred dollars a vial but her descendants live in poverty. While many of her children believe they should be compensated for the sale of HeLa cells, court cases involving similar claims have always found in favor of research companies rather than individuals - the argument being that once a procedure is performed and tissue is removed from a body, it is no longer of use to the individual and the hospital can do with it as it pleases, be it incineration or study. On one hand, it makes sense given that it was highly doubtful Henrietta’s husband could have opened a cellular research facility, however, the problem lies within the fact that researchers did not tell Henrietta’s family about the importance of HeLa cells and lied to her children when additional bloodwork was requested for further study.The story of the Lacks family is a heartbreaking one. Henrietta had a terrible upbringing and following her death, things became that much worse for her children. While the book mainly concentrates on the HeLa cells, there’s a shocking piece on her daughter Elsie, who had been diagnosed with “idiocy” and institutionalized at Crownsville Hospital Centre (a.k.a. The Hospital for the Negro Insane) following her mother’s death. The conditions at the time of Elsie’s arrival were deplorable. They had a total of eight attendants (four in the day, four in the evening) for five hundred and sixty patients. One ward in particular had seventy eight patients with only twenty eight beds. There were also only three toilets to share amongst them all. You can imagine how much this upset the family when they found out decades later.While The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks can be deeply upsetting, it is without a doubt an important book. Author Rebecca Skloot spent years interviewing the Lacks family (which at times was certainly no easy task) and researching Henrietta’s life and death, all information that had been buried over time. The story flows well and her afterword provides greater insight into the legal ramifications of future soft tissue research. Henrietta’s youngest daughter Deborah always wanted the world to know about the person behind the HeLa cells, the real human being who provided the ammunition for several medical discoveries. Thanks to Rebecca’s tireless work, Henrietta Lacks' incredible true story is out there for the world to see.Also posted @ Every Read Thing."

Some people comment on the human interest aspect of the story with regard to the Lacks family. Other people mention the cell science. For me, the most interesting thing was the history of informed consent, or the ""Lacks"" thereof. (Go ahead and laugh now at my clever wordplay. You know you want to.)It's hard to believe the bizarre ways people's bodies were used for medical research, with or without their consent. Even when they did give consent, they did so without being told exactly what would be done to their bodies. Too often the people used for the studies were the poor, the uneducated, and prison inmates. Back in the forties and fifties, ""Many scientists believed that since patients were treated for free in the public wards, it was fair to use them as research subjects as a form of payment."" YIKES! That's not just unethical, it's abominable.Rebecca Skloot's dedication to the research and writing of this story is remarkable. She spent pretty much the entire decade of her twenties in pursuit of the truth about Henrietta Lacks and her ""immortal"" cells. My only reason for not awarding the full five stars is that I thought the book could have used one more ruthless edit before final printing. "

Clearly, a result of hard work and intense research and, above all the fact that the author has taken student loans and used her credit cards for the research work and had no other backing or support.

76,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66292681-sarah-lumos,4,"  “Henrietta’s (cells) were different: they reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. They became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory.”  Argh, I feel embarrassed admitting this, but before reading this book, I had no idea what the HeLa cells were. I never studied science in-depth, which is now one of my biggest regrets. However, I guess in some ways I was lucky: I got to know who Henrietta Lacks was before meeting her famous cells. In this well-researched biography, Rebecca Skloot tells the story of Henrietta Lacks, a poor Black woman who was only 31 when she died from cervical cancer. While she was getting treatments at John Hopkins Hospital, Dr. George Guy took cells from Lack’s tumor without her consent. After examining her cells, Guy felt amazed. He realized her cells were unlike any he had seen - Henrietta’s cells refused to die.HeLa would become the first immortal cell line grown in a lab. For scientists, this discovery was monumental. It would allow them to conduct experiments they never could before. Henrietta’s cells would later help create in vitro fertilization, polio vaccines, and cancer treatments. Although HeLa cells have affected each of us in different ways, before this book’s publication, most of us had little to no idea who Henrietta Lacks was.Here is what I found riveting: Henrietta never graduated from high school, yet she became one of the most important people in science. Sure, science has its own explanation for how this happened, but her family believed God chose Henrietta. God wanted her to come back to Earth in the form of her cells to help others. Since the Lacks had a weak science background, faith was their way of understanding what happened to Henrietta, and making sense of the non-sensical. Though most of the Lacks were happy Henrietta’s cells were advancing science, some of them were mad. The Lacks had no science education, and scientists never bothered to explain to them what happened to Henrietta in a simple way. Researchers exploited their ignorance and the Lacks were never able to give informed consent. Their frustrations are understandable. I felt like giving each of them a hug when I read these passages. If I were them, I would be upset too. While HeLa cells were becoming a multi-million dollar industry, the Lacks were living in poverty, barely able to afford health insurance:   “...the last thing he remembered before falling into unconsciousness under anesthesia was a doctor standing over him saying his mother's cells were one of the most important things that had ever happened to medicine. Sonny woke up more than $125,000 in debt because he didn't have health insurance to cover the surgery.”  I also admire Skloot's grit because this was a massive project to undertake. I can understand why this book took her a decade to write. I think she wanted to do Henrietta's story justice, and she did. Skloot made sure the world knew about the Lacks and what they did for science. Furthermore, I liked that Skloot’s discussed the social determinants of health. Her clear prose helped me better understand patient rights, inequalities in medicine, informed consent, and tissue ownership laws. Overall, “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" was a magnificent treat. I am positive other readers will find this book as informative and awe-inspiring as I did."
77,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Skloot delivers a mix of science history and human interest in her journalistic style. She discusses medical ethics particularly the issue of informed consent as she tells the story of Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta was a poor black woman who joined the great migration of the 1940’s moving from rural southern Virginia to Baltimore, Maryland. She was treated for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins, the only nearby hospital that would admit blacks in 1951. After suffering through the then standard radium therapy, she died that same year. Samples of her tumor were removed and became the first successful human cell culture to sustain itself. Known as HeLa her cells live on today in labs around the world the subject of endless experimentation. Most of the book is spent on Henrietta’s life, her daughter Deborah, their families and extended relations as well as the author’s work with the family to research the book. We follow Henrietta from her childhood in the 1920’s growing up in former slave quarters on the wrong side of the tracks in the small tobacco country town of Clover, Virginia. Skloot gives a somewhat romanticized version of what must have been a harsh life of poverty and discrimination. Similarly Skloot tries to bring out the positives while dutifully reporting the difficult lives of Henrietta’s descendants who suffer from chronic mental and physical illnesses, limited education and continued discrimination in the Baltimore area. Particularly interesting to me was the communication gap between the scientists and Henrietta’s working class African American family. A big part of the problem was the history of exploitation of African Americans by white doctors and their medical institutions. This history had been internalized into a pervasive distrust of doctors and hospitals by Henrietta’s family. Henrietta’s and her family’s fear is understandable and it struck me as part of a broader issue. With unarmed black men dying regularly at the hands of the police, we see similar fears by African Americans today. Skloot points out that scientific progress was made from practices that now would be clearly unethical. Henrietta’s cells sped up the development of the Polio vaccine in the early 1950’s saving many from this devastating disease. Concepts such as informed consent did not exist in 1951. Even today the issue is very murky which the author addresses in her afterword. At the end of the book Skloot returns to Clover to find it gone. All the ramshackle old buildings torn down, just empty fields remaining. Most of those who knew Henrietta had now passed on too. Only her cells remain, thriving in labs everywhere and generating the ground breaking medical discoveries of a new era. "
78,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2528841-claire,5,"In the same way we sometimes debate whether the story should be seen as an entirely seperate entity to the writer, so too do scientists perceive a sample of cell tissue as seperate to the human body it was extracted from. Except that it is not possible to extract a story from a writer's imagination without their consent. Henrietta Lacks was a young mother in her early thirties when she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer that would quickly take her life. She was fortunate to live close to the John Hopkins hospital, set up to ensure equal access to medical care for all' no matter their race, status, income or any other characteristic that might have otherwise given cause to discriminate.Before undergoing treatment, one of the Doctors took a tissue sample of her healthy cells and the cancerous cells, as he had been doing to most patients, in an effort to try and find cells that would continue to replicate without dying - the elusive ""immortal"" cell. It had never been done successfully with human cells before.He succeeded and the cells became known the world over as he gave them away freely, known as HeLa cells, the immortal human cells that never died and could be used over and over again to test for cures to disease and to observe how cells react to numerous variables, furthering science in ways unimaginable previously. Few paused to ask who the woman behind these cells was, what was her story, how did her family feel about this multi million dollar research industry that was making great strides in science yes, and also making entrepreneurial types wealthy in the process.Rebecca Skloot made Henrietta the subject of her research for 10 years in the creation of this thorough, respectful account of the life of Henrietta Lacks and her journey to uncover the events of the time within the context of what was the norm in her day. In much of it she is accompanied by Henriettas daughter Deborah, a passionate woman who was unable to find peace in her own life, until she had helped bring her mother's story to light.A brilliant and informative story and piece of scientific medical history that reads like a novel and brings our awareness to the many who unknowingly make sacrifices for the better of others and that always present aspect of those hovering in the wings, recognising an opportunity to profit."

The votes have been in for years: author Rebecca Skloot’s book racked up 19 significant awards and citations in 2010 when it was first published. The 2011 trade paperback edition I read boasts five pages of exuberant blurbs before you even get to the title page. I wanted to be a curmudgeon about it, but the story is so serious that I had to relinquish my pissy attitude. It is just that type of story: a sensational true crime story with ramifications in the fields of health and science; race and sociology; ethics, history, and journalism. Suspenseful, cinematic, and factual, Ms. Skloot manages to pack it all inside of 310 pages, with 71 pages remaining for appendices, acknowledgements, notes, and discussion group questions! She writes knowledgeably, intelligently, compassionately, and skillfully. This book is all that! The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family. It is about the miraculous and immortal cells---taken from her cervix without her permission in 1951 and how they have been serving medical research ever since. It is a story about her daughter, Deborah, and a science journalist (Rebecca Skloot) dedicating years of her life to questioning, investigating, researching, and writing. It is about injustice and justice; human liberties, and privileging science over human life and the right to make informed decisions. This book chillingly illustrates the complex path of ethics and medical research in the United States from the 1950s to the present. It made me mad, but it also educated me in a profound way."

In fact this is the first book to keep me so intellectually and emotionally engaged in a very long time. I struggle to find the words to express what it meant to read about the plight of this woman and the medical knowledge gained from her cells. To read this book is to begin to understand the impact of these cells on modern medicine. Then the book takes you further to read about what has happened to her family during these medical breakthroughs, the impact of what happened and its influences on the laws and the practice of medicine. Just an amazing book with so many elements intertwined and presented with such empathy and beauty. As a brief aside, shortly after I finished the book I had a minor medical procedure performed. Before they would begin, the patient must sign a medical release form and on the form was a statement asking the patient to relinquish all rights of ownership to any tissue samples removed. After reading this book I understand the implications (signed it, but was much more aware of the rationale behind it). This was a life affecting book for me. I didn't close the book thinking that I knew the answers to the ethical questions it raised. What I did feel was that it just seemed some how unjust that her family fared so poorly when her cells were so vital to so many of the scientific advancements made after her death. It presented legal and ethical quandaries that some of the finest legal minds still haven't wrapped their minds around. Engaging and enlightening book? And how!! Highly recommended!!!"

As someone who is strongly considering donating my body to science when I die, this was a probative read to think about the changing ethics of medicine, and a reminder that so much scientific development has been done on unwilling, non-consenting, and uninformed individuals. Top among these unwitting contributors, must rank Henrietta Lacks, whose indomitable cancer cells have led to inestimable developments. Though the ethics have tissue collection has drastically changed since the 1950s, it is surprising how much of a wild, wild west this area remains.

“Everybody in the world got her cells, only thing we got of our mother is just them medical records and her Bible.”
In 1951 doctors at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore diagnosed an unusually extreme case of cervical cancer. The breakneck growth rate and resistance to common remedies were unlike anything previously seen. Without informed consent, the doctor scraped a clump of cells from the cancerous tumor during one of the 30 year-old woman’s visits and deposited them with a nearby cell culture lab operated by George Gey. There, in the air-controlled space of Gey’s facility, something happened that researchers had long suspected out of reach. Where countless other cells before them had died, hers survived, and multiplied indefinitely. The immortality of this one cell line would prove instrumental in treating a number of the world’s most heavy-hitting diseases and set the stage for an all new era in cell research, medical diagnosis, drug development and bioethics. But this is a story not just about bundles of cells, but about the humanity behind them, and in particular the family to which they will forever be tied.That woman was Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta passed away just nine months after diagnosis, but it would be more than two decades before her family received word of the namesake cell line which survived her—HeLa. Its value as a scientific and commercial commodity was paramount, getting bogged down in the thicket of rights and privacy less so. Once researchers discovered that Henrietta’s cells did not die but instead bred a new generation every twenty-four hours, HeLa quickly became the tireless workhorse of the culture community. Vials were trucked to research facilities around the world, where they were regularly exposed to a pavilion of infectious diseases, merged with non-human DNA, and even shot into space in an effort to study the influence of zero gravity.Over time, details about the parent of the eponymous cells funneled out of view. Henrietta’s own kin were oblivious to the fact that her cells lived, were being studied and tested in dozens of countries, and were being exchanged at great profit. Once the unwitting donor’s official name was released, journalists descended in full fervor, leading to a lifetime of turmoil and unrest for the Lacks household. Set against the rich legacy of the family’s cells, their life of poverty and unpaid medical bills seemed untoward by comparison, and this sense of injustice only mounted as more details filtered in from the press.Rebecca Skloot’s segue into this lush narrative was by and large a product of serendipitous circumstance, having first heard of HeLa in an intro to biology course at her local community college. After learning that these cells had lived outside their host's body for the better part of a century, and about the remarkable advances they have gifted to science, Skloot shot up her hand and innocently asked, ""Who was she?"" The professor's reply proved unsatisfying: ""An African American woman."" The seed of curiosity had been planted. By the time Skloot graduated she'd decided to write a book to recover the disremembered woman whose cells had won so many victories for science and society.Who Was Henrietta Lacks?For more than a decade, Skloot layered herself into the Lacks’ story, befriending and forming deep bonds with Henrietta’s children and cousinry. She forges an especially strong connection with Deborah Lacks, Henrietta’s youngest daughter, who was unfortunately too young to remember much about her mother. With a mix of patience and persistence the two work together to dig up Henrietta’s heritage and bring to light her hitherto uncelebrated legacy. It is Skloot’s at times unstable relationship and camaraderie with Deborah that gives the narrative its steam, as the two probe ever deeper into the mystery surrounding her mother.Tracing the family’s roots places Henrietta’s childhood at the tail end of the Jim Crow era, a time when segregation meant a great deal more than which bathroom and water fountain one was required to use. Rampant legal disadvantages in the South bred systemic, institutionalized maladjustment for blacks, and this included limited access to medical care. Having spent her youth on a slave plantation in Clover, Virginia, Henrietta joined in the Great Migration at the ripened age of twenty-one, exchanging her familiarity with tobacco fields for a new life in Baltimore. Nine years later, she would be diagnosed with the malignancy that led to her iconic cell line. And it would be another fifty years before Deborah, with the help of Skloot, laid eyes on her mother’s original medical records.Johns Hopkins Hospital was founded for the express purpose of treating Baltimore's poor and, unlike today, informed consent upon providing blood or tissue samples was neither required by law nor common practice (the term did not even appear in a court document until 1957). Like everyone at the time, Henrietta hadn't a clue about what would become of her excised genetic material and the boons it would lavish upon the scientific community. This became a flashpoint issue in the years that followed as the occasional patient attempted to turn a gray area into a lucrative venture. While we learned more about DNA and transmissible disease, Henrietta's resilient cells inaugurated an international conversation on the commercialization of biological materials and where exactly the donors fit within that ecosystem. In many ways, the conversation is ongoing. (Skloot includes a superb summary in the afterword which draws together the various threads of this nuanced debate.) The HeLa LegacyTo properly gauge the vastitude of the legacy tied up in Henrietta’s cells, it’s important to understand 20th century cell culture. Until Henrietta came along, cell immortality was a pipe dream. While standard, non-cancerous cells had been grown in vitro since 1907, none of them survived long enough to endure important testing, petering out after 50 divisions, on average. Even cancer cells, like those common to cervical cancers, died shortly after relocation to the culture environment. This meant not only was there a brief window for experimentation but that a continuous supply of fresh cells was needed to sustain research. Many in the field yearned for a better way.HeLa keynoted a paradigm shift. They were robust enough to survive in the bricolage of materials used in Dr. Gey’s culture medium, and they were susceptible to the same range of infectious diseases as were normal cells. This allowed researchers to inject the lively DNA with diseases as well as cures. Not merely a boon to science, this revolutionized the field, so much so that one of the researchers Skloot interviews in the book, when asked what would happen if HeLa was pulled from research use, replied, “Restricting HeLa cell use would be disastrous. The impact that would have on science is inconceivable.” (p. 328)Thanks to Dr. Gey’s partnering efforts with labs around the globe, the benefits of HeLa manifested seemingly overnight. In just one year after HeLa’s genesis, Jonas Salk and his team were able to derive a vaccine for polio by infecting HeLa cells, followed shortly by drug treatments for HPV, herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia and Parkinson’s disease. In 1953 HeLa became the first cells to be cloned successfully. In total, some 60,000 papers have been published on HeLa, and cell culturists still use her cancer cells as a model for human biology.What was it exactly that gave HeLa cells their added dose of moxie? Even today, we can only speculate. We now know that Henrietta was infected with both HPV and syphilis, so one theory is that this virulent combination may have helped suppress PCD. A rival theory suggests she had highly atypical genes to begin with, perhaps a rare mutation, that enabled the cancer to spiral in unspecified directions. We still are uncertain. HeLa has also been the source of much frustration over the years from regularly contaminating other cell lines, often halting research until the botch-up is sorted.Closing ThoughtsRebecca Skloot’s ten-year effort is a literary and cultural marvel balanced between unsheathing the posthumous success and humanity behind one of the richest narratives in science and laying bare the bioethical implications to which it is attached. It succeeds on both fronts. Skloot is at her most animating when channeling the lens of Deborah Lacks as they band together to reach some much-needed closure to the saga thrust upon the Lacks family. With her first book, Skloot has demonstrated in equal measure her facility for conveying scientific nuance while weaving meaning and poetic force into a cohesive whole. Yes, this is first and foremost a work of nonfiction, but its pages are emblazoned with enough touches of novel-like charisma to beckon both crowds. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a timeless story delivered by a gifted writer and the definitive presentation of the legacy Henrietta never lived to see. Highly recommended.Skloot also founded The Henrietta Lacks Foundation - click here for more - to provide support for the Lacks as well as assistance to African Americans pursuing education in science and medicine. A portion of her book’s proceeds are donated to the Foundation.Note: This review is republished from my official website. Click through for additional footnotes and imagery."
85,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7983564-kaora,4,"A really powerful read about HeLa cells, taken without consent from a woman named Henrietta Lacks. Her cells contributed to many of modern medicines discoveries, including the polio vaccine and gene mapping, and yet her family is still so poor they cannot afford health care hacing seen none of the money generated by these cells.This book explores the debate about what makes up a person's body. Is a shed skin cell the property of the person whose DNA is within the cell, or have they given up their ownership? And what exactly constitutes informed consent?I thought it was a fascinating read, and while it appealed to my Science background by explaining the advances made, and the complications that arose, it also brought to light the bittersweet story of the family that thought they had lost their mother, and never knew that a little piece of her still existed until years after her death.A powerful read I'd recommend to everyone."
86,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101060033-woman-reading,4,"In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (ILHL), Skloot blends the Lacks' family history with that of medical sciences and all against a backdrop of systemic racism. For decades, her cell line, named HeLa, has far eclipsed the woman of their origin. Henrietta Lacks was born in 1920 as the ninth child of Eliza and Johnny Pleasant in Roanoke, Virginia. When Eliza died after birthing her tenth child in 1924, the family was divided amongst the larger network of relatives who pitched in to raise the children. Henrietta and David Lacks, her first cousin and future spouse, were raised together by their grandfather Tommy in a former slaves quarter cabin in Lacks Town (Clover), Virginia. Lacks Town had been the inheritance carved out of Henrietta's white great grandfather Albert Lacks' tobacco plantation in the late 1800s.From Skloot's interviews with relatives, Henrietta was a generously hospitable, hard working, and loving mother whose premature death led to enormous consequences for her children. Henrietta suspected a health problem a year before her fifth and last child was born. She went to Johns Hopkins, a renowned medical institution and a charity hospital, in Baltimore and received a diagnosis of cervical cancer in January 1951. (view spoiler)[Since cervical cancer is caused by a sexually transmitted virus, it seems likely that she had contracted the virus from her husband, who had not been monogamous. (hide spoiler)]During her first treatment for cancer, malignant cells were removed - without Henrietta's knowledge - and cultivated in a lab environment by Johns Hopkins researchers attempting to uncover cancer's secrets. Although the brachytherapy with radium was initially deemed a success, Henrietta's brown skin turned black as the cancer aggressively metastasized. After several weeks of great pain, Henrietta died in October 1951.ILHL raises questions about the extent to which we own our bodies, informed consent, and ethics surrounding the research of anything human. The HeLa line was a rare scientific success as those malignant cells thrived in lab conditions and eventually became crucial to thousands of research projects. Skloot reported that in 2009, an average human body was worth anywhere from $10,000 to $150,000. In the case of John Moore who had leukemia, his cell line was valued in millions of dollars. To prevent human trafficking, it is illegal to sell human organs and tissues, but they can be donated while processing fees are assessed.As a charity hospital in the 1950s, segregated patient wards in Johns Hopkins were filled with African Americans whose tissue samples were regarded by researchers as ""payment."" One cannot ""donate"" what one doesn't know. The Lacks family discovered HeLa's existence 22 years after Henrietta died. They've struggled to pay their medical costs while biotechnology companies have reaped profits from cultivating and selling HeLa cells. In 1999, the Rand Corporation estimated that 307 million tissue samples from  178 million  people (almost 60 percent of the population) were stored in the US for research purposes. Although the US is nowhere close to definitively addressing the questions raised by ILHL , a little progress has been made. In 1974, the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects (the ""Common Rule"") required informed consent for federally funded research. The Common Rule was passed in response to egregious and inhumane experiments such as the Tuskegee Syphilis project and another scientist who wanted to know whether injecting people with HeLa would give them cancer. Note that this rule exempts privately funded research. In 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) made it illegal for health practitioners and insurers to make one's medical information public without their consent. This was after researchers had published medical information about the Lacks family. It should be evident that human tissues have long been monetized. One method of creating monopoly - like control has been to obtain a patent. As of 2005, the US has issued patents for about 20 percent of all known human genes. Myriad Genetics patented two genes - BRCA1 and BRCA2 - indicative of breast and ovarian cancer. In 2009 the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), on behalf of scientists, sued Myriad Genetics. In 2013, the US Supreme Court gave the victory to the ACLU and invalidated the patents, thus lowering future research costs and obliquely taking a step toward defining ownership of the human body."
87,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27117957-stephanie-anze,5,"Henrietta Lacks was a mother to four children and about to become one for the fifth time when she started to feel sick. After the birth of her son, she only grew sicker. At John Hopkins, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer and underwent treatment. Unfortunately, the cancer spread quickly and Henrietta died. Before her death, a sample of her cancerous tissue was taken and cultivated in the lab. Her cells grew at an unprecedated rate and became extremely valuable to the scientific realm. Called HeLa, Henrietta's cells were the first to reach ""immortality"". Her family did not know this information for several years. This is the story of the woman behind the cells.I began reading more non-fiction books last year and have since come across some amazing works. 'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks' will join those ranks. Hands down, this is one of the best non-fiction books written. Broad-in-scope, thought-provocking, awe-inspiring and jaw-dropping, this book is the perfect marriage between science and human interest. Greatly researched and with much heart, the prose is magnificent. Henrietta Lacks was a poor tobacco farmer, descended from slaves. When she was diagnosed with cervical cancer, she did not particularly stand out but when her cancerous tissue was cultivated in the Hopkins lab, that was a different story. Until HeLa, scientists had not been able to produce a cell line that perdured. With HeLa cells, however, they hit the jackpot. Used in everything from the development of vaccines to genetic research and even to test out the effects of a nuclear bomb, the impact of these cells is immesurable. Just one problem, Henrietta did not give consent to give her cells and her family did not learn of just how important Henrietta was until many years after her death. About 50 miillion metric tons of HeLa cells have been produced to date, more than enough cells to populate a village full of Henriettas. While Henritta never travelled far form her home, her cells have been all over the world and even into outer space. They have been infected with several illnesses and combined with other cells. Odds are eah of us has, in some way, come in contact with HeLa.The way in which Skloot balances the science aspect with the human asprct of the book is done with finnesse. The HeLa cells are something impressive but more so is the woman behind them. Henrietta was strong, confident and resourceful. By all accounts, she faced her cancer diagnosis with sheer bravery and never stopped thinking about her family, even when she knew she would not survive. Its truly sad that for that Henriettas's cells did for the world, her heirs do not even know where the exact location of her grave is. What stood out for me most was the relationship that developed between Sloot and Deborah (Henrietta's daughter). Until Skloot, most were merely interested in the cells with Henrietta as an afterthought. I love that Skloot focused on Henrietta. Its time she gets the recognition that is way overdue.This work raises many questions. With the ""Tissue Issue"", consent and scientific progress are at a standstill. Henrietta's cells were taken without her knowledge or that of her family. The exact amount of money made off the HeLa cells is not known but its exorbitant. Her family never saw a cent and sadly struggle to pay their health insurance. Biological ownership is a tricky subject matter. The John Moore case was one of the cases that put it on the map and it has been a hot botton issue since. While there are some basic rules to follow, the gist is that once any tissue is ""abandoned"" at a hospital, it ceases to be property of the patient. Blood tests, biopsies and tissue taken from surgeries are property of the hospital and they have no obligation to let their patients know if and for what their tissues can be used. The scientific communty argues that to seek consent would lead to a decreased access to materials or have people seek financial gain. Personally, I find this troubling. The moral and ethical concerns are overwhelming and getting to an agreement between both parties is a battle. Scientific progress is important but at what cost? This is a book that will stay with me for a while. Its up there with 'The Radium Girls' (another great non-fiction work). Highly recommended!"
88,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4776032-cher,2,"2.5 stars. I found the 1st 1/2 of this book fascinating and eagerly awaited to hear more of Henrietta's story. Henrietta was someone you couldn't help but root for and you were amazed to hear of her strength and perpetual optimism. The 2nd 1/2 of this book was tedious and annoying. The book started to drag and focus too much on the researcher's hardships, but mostly, I found Henrietta's family to be utterly unlikable. I kept thinking of that saying, ""I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you"". I felt much of the Lacks family, particularly Deborah and Joe (who changed his name to the long Z name), enjoyed being miserable. Despite being corrected again and again on their misbeliefs, they would resort right back to harboring on their anger/hatred/anxiousness over falsities. I felt their actions reflected a disregard for much of the advancements that came about from their mother's indirect contribution to medicine, but focused instead on a victim mentality and desire for monetary contribution - monetary contribution for something they had absolutely nothing to do with and had not worked for one iota.  As for the ethics surrounding Henrietta's cells being taken, be it right or wrong, she was not treated any differently than rich white patients were at that time when it came to taking cells/tissue without informed consent. In that sense, I don't think she was personally wronged in an intentional manner, though I think it's crazy what could be done without informed consent at that time. If you want to talk about who was wronged in an intentional manner, we'll talk about Elsie. Furthermore, I'm not completely convinced that some things were not explained to Henrietta regarding sampling cells. It was stated by Henrietta and the Lacks family time and again that they often came away with a poor understanding after speaking with MDs, yet they did not ask further questions or state their lack of understanding. Therefore, anytime it was exclaimed they were told ""nothing"", I had doubts. Henrietta's cells as they were taken, were of very little worth. It was the ingenuity of the people that used them that gave them their worth. Should Henrietta have received a modest compensation? Perhaps, it's muddled for me. Organ donors do not receive compensation (or their families). The reward is knowing you have saved other's lives. Should her children be entitled to compensation decades later for advancements that continue to be made 50 years after the cells were taken - cells that were not even from their own body? Definitely not. Is her family entitled to give permission for what can and cannot be done to Henrietta's cells? Absolutely not. Informed consent (which was not legally required at that time) is between the patient and the MD - what other family members wish is insignificant. The most interesting part of this story for me was easily Henrietta's story. Her childhood, the abuse of the time to the poor and minorities, the overt racist culture, and her strong optimistic nature that she maintained despite the world burning around her. The part that made the story a chore to finish was the ignorance that the family clung to despite being informed of truths, and the smallness with which they appreciated the lives that have been saved due to the awful cancer their mother acquired compared to the greatness with which they felt they deserved money as a result of research and ingenuity that they had never participated in, let alone understood. Azle - 7/16"
89,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt,5,"This remarkable story about how people live on sometimes in the material way just as much as in memory, about science, ethics, the search for a cure to a potentially deadly disease, well, it's unforgettable and unlike any other book because it wasn't just her cells that kept Henrietta alive after her death - it was her family, whose lives were transformed upon hearing of her story and the research done on cells taken without her consent.

90,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33069645-jennifer,5,"I absolutely loved this book! The intense ethical, moral, legal, and scientific dilemma that arise throughout the book make this book a MUST read! It is very well written and has given me so many things to think about. I am so glad my book club is reading this book for our first ever meeting. I am thrilled to be able to discuss the book in detail! I highly recommend this book to everyone."
91,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268245-greta,4,20th century medicine is another area of institutional racism that the story of Henrietta Lacks illustrates in very fine detail. Those who claim there is nothing different in the treatment of whites and blacks in health care and medicine need to read this story. When will the sorrow end?
92,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51094260-julie-zantopoulos,5,"I’m not in a scientific field & I don’t remember studying anything about HeLa cells in school but when this book came across my radar (the mother I work for purchased it) I had to read it. I’m pretty ignorant to the inner workings of the medical research world but the ethics of using cells seems pretty clear. I’m thrilled HeLa cells have lead to epic medical breakthroughs and continue to help find cures for cancer, etc. but what the Lacks family has gone through when their mother’s cells are involved is heartbreaking. Currently, HeLa cells are being used to try and find a cure and vaccine for Covid-19. The widespread medical advances that were/are possible thanks to Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells are staggering and a blessing. So reading about her family, too poor to afford health care and medicine their mother’s cells likely helped develop is just shitty. Still, I’m so happy I read this book and educated myself. TW: (severe) child abuse, graphic medical situations, cancer, molestation, pedophilia, incest, mistreatment if mentally handicapped in hospital settings in 50s, mistreatment, abuse, and murder of black people at the hands of the medical field, murder, drug use, cheating, domestic abuse... this isn’t an easy read, friends.

93,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol,5,"Skloot, Rebecca - The Immortal Life of Henrietta LacksThis has been on my TBR list for most of the year. I knew I wanted to read it as soon as I heard it involved The HeLa Cells. Somewhere in the back of my mind I knew I had heard about these famous cells taken from an African American woman diagnosed with cervical cancer in the 50’s. The cells were taken without her knowledge and without the knowledge of her family. The cells lived, she did not. Meet Henrietta Lacks.Like the author, Rebecca Skloot, I was curious to know more about Henrietta, to learn more about the details of the cell experimentations, what they have done for science and why they are important to our lives. Skloot is a science journalist and has the credentials to dig into the story and inform. I give her a great deal of credit for the ten years she took to research the book and for having the perseverance to continue to contact Henrietta’s relatives who were reluctant to talk to a reporter. Building trust with the family was not an easy task, but eventually Skloot was able to ensure them that her intentions were good. Though the story could have been told from interviews with doctors and possibly from records at Johns Hopkins, what really brings Henrietta alive in my mind is the personal stories of her kin, particularly her daughter, Deborah. I liked the format Skloot used to write the book. You can hear what she says about this in the FAQ portion of her website.Critics of the book complain that Skloot has made this a story of race. Personally, I don’t see how you can begin to know Henrietta and her family without talking about race. But, yes, it is more than that. It’s about informed consent, pharmaceutical companies making mega dollars, treatment of patients, and ethics. It is also the story of the quest of a daughter to better know her mother, who died when she was young. It is a story of this daughter’s love for the woman she comes to know. I am pleased that Rebecca Skloot has set up Henrietta Lacks Foundation, which this year granted five of the Lacks descendents for their education. There is much to think about after reading this book. I still have questions. Some of the science goes over my head, but Skloot did a good job keeping this in layman’s terms. Today, due to privacy laws we would not know the name of the woman that the cells were harvested from. I’m in agreement with this but am still glad that in this case, Henrietta Lacks was identified and that through the efforts of Rebecca Skloot that I have a better picture of who Henrietta was. She never knew her contribution to medicine, but it seems to be significant. "
94,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/287912-melissa,2,"I'm having a hard time accepting the fundamental premise of this book; that because Henrietta Lacks's cancer cells continue to grow and have since the 50s, she herself is somehow still alive. Because she's not. And these are cancer cells anyway - of her body, but not of her personally. If you scraped a cancer cell out of me, it wouldn't take care of my kid or go to work for me, so why would you say that I was still alive? I think a lot of Deborah Lacks's heartache might've been averted if this myth of Henrietta's aliveness hadn't been perpetuated. Without being told that her mother was still ""alive"", she'd have no need to stress out to the point of almost stroking out about her mother still being able to feel the pain of an atomic bomb blast, the pain of cancer treatment drugs, AIDS drugs, etc. I'm in no way denying the achievement of HeLa cells or what they've done to further scientific achievement, I just can't buy that their existence means that Henrietta Lacks is still alive. "
95,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10942210-john,4,Wow. I was enthralled during the first half of the book but it started to drag at the end. Definetly lost its magic of storytelling at the end and almost sounded just like retyped journal notes. BUT this tells an important story that should be required for all medical scientists. It humanizes their work and ties this to real people. 
96,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31167656-bookworm,4,A well researched and exquisitely told story. I listened to the audio which was highly entertaining. Absolutely fascinating! It's hard to believe this happened in the 1950's!!
97,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2299298-pages-for-breakfast-x1f4da-formerly-readage,5,"From my blog: https://bookgirl1987thoughts.wordpres...I'm sure many of you have already read this book, as it was published in early 2010 and made headlines as a bestselling piece of medical/science nonfiction. Rebecca Skloot is an award-winning science writer who became interested in the story of Henrietta Lacks (known as HeLa in the medical/scientific community) when she took a biology course at sixteen that changed her outlook on the world of science forever. Her instructor wrote the name HENRIETTA LACKS as he was discussing cell culture and Skloot was anxious to investigate. Her HeLa fascination started there, and continued throughout her graduate school studies in writing, as she contemplated researching and writing about Henrietta Lacks. Eventually, she put pen to paper and brought HeLa's story to light.The book is a wonderfully written, and in my opinion, smartly-paced piece of nonfiction. It does a masterful job of detailing Skloot's heavy involvement in the HeLa chaos that resulted from an unethical medical treatment on a poverty-stricken black woman from Virginia in 1951. If you decide to read this book, (and I really hope you do), in the first half of the narrative you will meet a lovely, sweet woman named Henrietta Lacks and discover that she is suffering from a particularly aggressive form of cervical cancer. Diagnosed at the tender age of 30, Henrietta's cancer spreads rapidly and cuts short her life in a tragic flash, leaving behind a husband, five children, and surrounding family members who eventually live in the upsetting wake of Henrietta's undisclosed, yet amazing contribution to science.(I dislike book reviews that give blow-by-blow, page-by-page details of the book; I want you to read the book, not just this review, so I refrain here from delving too deeply into the scientific material you will find in the book.) I do want to reassure any ambivalent readers that this is an incredibly entertaining science book, without being overly scientific or stuffy in any way! It is very accessible to readers of all scientific knowledge, and will most definitely appeal to people who know absolutely nothing about cellular biology and cell cultures. (It explains things along the way). I started this book hoping the information would not go right over my head, and I'm pleased to say that none of the concepts escaped me intellectually. From a scientific perspective, Skloot has written an informative history of the HeLa cells, and that alone makes this book rewarding.However, I must say that the human element of the book is the author's number one achievement. Meeting the Lacks family members, one by one, and learning of their daily lives and coping mechanisms was even more interesting to me than the amazing science behind the HeLa phenomenon. Once you absorb and process the initial shock in the first half of the book of how radical HeLa cells truly are, you begin to settle into a second half of the narrative that just grabs your heart and doesn't let go until the last page. Skloot skips back and forth in time, and it was an interesting way to tell the story. We have a few chapters detailing events in 1951 when Henrietta was alive and in the thick of her illness, and then we flash forward to 1999 and onward to events in the author's life as she makes connections with the Lacks family and begins her very hands-on research. (Personally, I didn't find the structure detracting in any way; I felt that it kept the HeLa history very rooted and upfront in the successive decades and chapters, therefore not allowing the reader to lose sight of the very real woman and family behind the science and medical discoveries.)Speaking further of the sincerely human element of the book, Deborah Lacks was my absolute favorite part of the book! (I won't go so far as to say that she overshadowed her mother in the narrative, but I admit that she really did manage to catapult me that much further into the story). The initial portrait of Henrietta Lacks begins the story, and when her daughter Deborah steps in later in the book, you really get the sense that Deborah is trying her damndest to resolve the chaos and confusion that factor so strongly in the book. Henrietta is no longer around to speak for herself, but her cells do much of the ""talking"" in this book, and Deborah's voice rings just as true and sincere as her mother's biological determinism.I'm going to wrap up here, because the longer I spend on this review, the longer you might spend reading about it instead of picking up the book! I strongly recommend that you find a copy of the audiobook of ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" by Rebecca Skloot narrated by Cassandra Campbell and Bahni Turpin. I read along and listened to this awesome recording and am so glad I did. I feel like the characters really came alive with this audiobook narration. The voices are very expressive, and I think you will enjoy it!"
98,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3106785-beth-bonini,5,"I'm not sure why it took me so long to get around to reading this book. I've had it on my shelf for years, and my daughter - who loves nonfiction - had read it and raved about it. But I'm a big believer in that some books just bide their time, waiting for the right moment, and perhaps this was true of this book. Just before reading this book, I saw the documentary Thirteenth, and I couldn't help but think of how Henrietta Lacks' family history is the living embodiment of the painful, tragic history of African Americans in the United States. Thirteenth traces the history of African Americans: from the 'official' end of slavery in January 31, 1865, when the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution abolished slavery except as a punishment for a crime, to the present day. It's an incredibly thought-provoking documentary and it makes the persuasive case that African Americans (or people of color, as they are usually referred to in the documentary) have never truly transcended their second-class citizen status. Every time one societal change is made, racism mutates (rather like a cancerous cell) to become a different and yet still malignant disease.Henrietta was born in Roanoke, Virginia on August 18, 1920. She was only four years old when her mother died giving birth to her 10th child. Henrietta was then raised by her grandfather, along with a slightly older first cousin called 'Day'. They lived on a tobacco farm, and from an early age the children helped pick and cure the tobacco leaves. When Henrietta was 14, she became pregnant for the first time; Day was the father. By age 31, Henrietta was dead. She had given birth to 5 children, and died of cervical cancer after a swift and painful illness. (Henrietta had the most virulent form of the HPV virus, and a vaccine for this virus was made possible by the research done with her malignant cells.) I suppose there were countless women like Henrietta - women who had short and painful lives - but Henrietta's life has its own strange and unique immortality because she happened to be treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and her cancerous cells (now known as HeLa) have become the most famous and useful cells in human history.This book combines two different strands - one of them the medical advancements made possible by HeLa, and the other being the parallel existence of Henrietta's descendents. The fact that Henrietta Lacks was poor and black has nothing to do with her cells, but there is the vexed issue of medical experimentation being carried out on the vulnerable - and author Rebecca Skloot does a good job of contextualising this for the reader. Henrietta didn't knowingly contribute her body to the advancement of science, but the truth is that most of the amazing accomplishments and discoveries of the 20th century can be traced back to her cells. (There are many examples of this in the book, and you don't need an extensive knowledge of biology to understand Skloot's explanations.) Sadly, Henrietta's descendents have in no way benefited from the cash cow of HeLa and their collective story was absorbing and rather heartbreaking. The heart of the story is Deborah - a daughter who never knew her mother - and whose long, painful quest to learn the truth of the HeLa cells is really a personal journey of finding her lost mother.This was a fascinating study of social history and I found it to be a completely absorbing read. I don't tend to think of nonfiction as 'unputdownable', but that is how I would describe this book."
99,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,5,"Compelling and fascinating pageturner that weaves the unique and groundbreaking story behind the HeLa cells that have revolutionized medical science in the last century. Skloot puts a name, a face, and a rich family history around the cells of Henrietta Lacks, who the ""immortal"" cells were essentially stolen from in the 1950s after she started treatment for severe cervical cancer. Medical records, archival research, and oral history paint a vivid picture of the Lacks' family's struggles in 1950s Baltimore. Skloot tells the story first hand, as she meets the surviving members of the Lacks family, and becomes very close to Henrietta's youngest daughter, Deborah. The book details very painful events (specifically Henrietta's abysmal ""care"" in the hospital after her tumors were discovered, and the treatment of Henrietta's other daughter, Elsie, in the Home for the Negro Insane) in the Lacks' family history. Skloot travels to southern Virginia where Henrietta grew up, and where she is now buried. The personal side of the book is so captivating, and the way Skloot interweaves this story in with the scientific information is near seamless. It's very well-done and quite accessible for a non-scientific audience. I learned a lot about genetics and about the research that the famous HeLa cells have engendered. I particularly enjoyed the portion of the book when the researcher spent the day with Skloot and Deborah Lacks, explaining the true breakthroughs from the HeLa cell line. There is soome criticism (here on GoodReads as well) that the book spent too much time with the Lacks' descendants, but I would argue that this is a very important part of the book - noting that while the Jim Crow laws are not in place, and the legal system is more aware of scientific research and patient ""rights"", there have not been socioeconomic strides for science education and alleviation of poverty in these inner-city areas. Skloot provided a very important context to the story of HeLa by setting the scene with Deborah, Zecharia, Lawrence, and the ""cousins"" in rural Virginia. On a local note, it was very interesting to learn the details about the Lacks family and their history in the Baltimore region. I have lived near Baltimore (and even worked and took classes at the institution that plays a large - and unfortunate - role in this book) for years and did not know some of the things that were discussed. Even closer to home, I was moved, and saddened to learn about the tragedies that happened at the Crownsville hospital, which is near my parents' home, and where I went to high school. I didn't realize the full history of the institution. Very moving story, and it is highly recommended. "
100,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h,4,"Henrietta Lacks was a poor Southern woman and mother of five children who died in 1951 as the result of a remarkably aggressive form of cervical cancer. While undergoing radiation treatment, doctors at Johns Hopkins took samples of her cells without her consent, to better study the cancer. These cells, known as HeLa, became an important scientific and medical tool—they were the first ""immortal"" human cells grown in culture, and they are still alive today. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. But very little was known about the woman from whom these cells came, and her family was unaware of Henrietta's contributions to science for many, many years. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells Henrietta's story and chronicles the struggles of her family, most of whom never had the opportunity to even finish high school, to understand what cells were taken from her and what scientists were doing with them. Rebecca Skloot also gives a great deal of background into scientific research, particularly where cell and tissue study is concerned, and the challenges both the scientific and medical ethics communities face relative to ""donations"" of cells taken from patients. But in the end, this is the story of Henrietta's family and the emotions that the discovery of her role in science uncovers. While the subject of this book is very scientific, much of it reads like a novel. It is a fantastic story—sometimes shocking, sometimes heartbreaking—but Skloot gives depth not only to Henrietta and her family, but the researchers who both studied and questioned the HeLa cells through the years. When this book was released last year to tremendous acclaim, I didn't think it would interest me much, but a friend recently recommended it, and I'm glad I was motivated to pick it up. Don't be put off by the subject matter; in the end, this will pique your curiosity and tug at your heart. And you'll definitely look with a different eye at the next medical procedure you have! "
101,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,4,"An important story, well-told by Rebecca Skloot, this book is about Henrietta Lacks and her cancerous cells that are known as the HeLa line. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks was a poor, uneducated black woman living with her husband and five young children in Baltimore when she developed cervical cancer and soon died. Without her knowledge or consent, cells from her cancer were cultured, distributed, and used in thousands of experiments continuing to this day, including pivotal developments in research about polio, radiation exposure, cancer, and more. The book successfully juxtaposes scientific information about the cells with the story of Henrietta's family and their fractured relationship with the medical establishment. The family was hounded by researchers who wanted DNA samples, without ever explaining what it was all about or offering any medical treatment to Henrietta's children who cope with multiple chronic diseases and no health insurance. Angry at what she sees as arrogant white doctors' appropriation of her mother, Henrietta's daughter Deborah asks, ""If our mother cells done so much for medicine, how come her family can't afford to see no doctors?"" The experiences of another family member, a developmentally disabled daughter called Elsie, reveal even more disturbing truths about the medical treatment of African Americans in the recent past.While the science and history aspects of this book are worthwhile, what makes the book really engaging is the human story about Deborah coming to terms with these terrible discoveries. When I read The Help, I was disturbed by what I saw as that white author's attempt to insert herself into a heroic role in the story, rescuing the black characters and earning their gratitude. This book could easily fall into the same trap, but Skloot lets Deborah take center stage and shows when Deborah is angry or mistrustful of her. Skloot may lead Deborah to some of the facts about Henrietta and Elsie, but the accomplishment of processing them is all Deborah's."

Makes science accessible and interesting and tells the story of the Lacks family easily and honestly. A sometimes painful story, punctured with humor and emotion balanced by impeccable research into medical history. If you have not read it, I would highly recommend it.Sometimes I could not put it down and other times I had to put it down to digest either the raw emotions sometimes described or to absorb my reactions to the medical progress and medical ethics presented. Sometime the facts made me mad, other times it just amazed me how far we have progressed. I think I understood even more of the suspicion of poor, black families have of white, educated scientists and reporters. It made me angry but gave me a deeper understanding of the great gulf that has been created by procedures that took place at the time of Ms. Lacks cancer treatments on then use of her cells. "

107,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,5,"This book is amazing, being pretty well written and very interesting, and in addition, raising so many questions and issues related to research and our rights for our cells and tissues. Henrietta Lacks and her family's story is fascinating, and the topic as a whole still have many open questions.It would be an understatement to say that Henrietta Lacks is one of the most important people in science. The cells that were taken from her cervical cancer, are called HeLa and were used to develop the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects and so much more. Henrietta did not get a thank you, neither her family get recognition (or a medical insurance), she did not even get a marked grave. No permission was asked to use these cells, and not for commercializing them. People do not own the waste of their tissues, especially not poor colored people, right? Henrietta's cancer killed her very young, and left her children motherless. But science wouldn't be the same without her, and she lived through her cells helping to make giant progress.As Charles Dickens said at the beginning of [A] Tale of Two Cities, ‘It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.’ But it was the best of times for science in that this very peculiar tumor gave rise to the HeLa cell line. … For Mrs. Lacks and the family she left behind, it was the worst of times. Scientific progress and indeed progress of all kinds is often made at great cost, such as the sacrifice made by Henrietta Lacks.Many scientists worked daily with HeLa cells, and didn't know or asked themselves where did these come from, and what is the story behind these important cells.He’d been working with HeLa cells daily his whole career, he said, and now he couldn’t get the story of Henrietta and her family out of his mind. Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, that lost her mother very young was furious. She did not know what exactly happened to her mother, or what is being done with her cells. She was rightly mad that her story, or even the recognition should be widely known. She was afraid, and being not very educated and going through very hard life, was paranoid from anybody that tried to talk to her about her mother, her medical files, or anything else related to it.“You know they shot my mother cells into space and blew her up with nuclear bombs? They even did that thing … what do you call it … um … cloning! … that’s right, they did that cloning on her.”... “You wouldn’t believe it,” she said. “You know they mixed her with mice to make a human-mouse? They say she’s not even human anymore!” She laughed a loud, manic laugh and ran to the window. “Holy cuss!”  But Deborah's fears weren't completely irrational. In the past black people were considered dispensable, their bodies were used for research, as they were slaves. And the Ku Klux Klan actually started as a threatening technique to prevent them from escaping from their owners. (I recommend The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration by Isabel Wilkerson to see how much more black people had to be afraid of, such as lynching). Just imagine trying on them surgical techniques without using anesthesia.Some of the stories were conjured by white plantation owners taking advantage of the long-held African belief that ghosts caused disease and death. To discourage slaves from meeting or escaping, slave owners told tales of gruesome research done on black bodies, then covered themselves in white sheets and crept around at night, posing as spirits coming to infect black people with disease or steal them for research. Those sheets eventually gave rise to the white hooded cloaks of the Ku Klux Klan. But night doctors weren’t just fictions conjured as scare tactics. Many doctors tested drugs on slaves and operated on them to develop new surgical techniques, often without using anesthesia. Fear of night doctors only increased in the early 1900s, as black people migrated north to Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, and news spread that medical schools there were offering money in exchange for bodies. Black corpses were routinely exhumed from graves for research, and an under ground shipping industry kept schools in the North supplied with black bodies from the South for anatomy courses. The bodies sometimes arrived, a dozen or so at a time, in barrels labeled turpentine.Prisoners were also a population that was under the threat of inhumane experiments on human beings. In some cases, they even signed up for the research, without really understanding what it means. Some would say that these are pretty similar to what the Nazis did. Cancer cell injections to inmates is just one exmaple of taking advantage of uneducated captured people for the good of science. Unimaginable in our world today that tries to prevent research on animals. Southam gave multiple cancer cell injections to each prisoner, and unlike the terminally ill patients, those men fought off the cancer completely. And with each new injection, their bodies responded faster, which seemed to indicate that the cells were increasing the inmates’ immunity to cancer. When Southam reported his results, the press hailed them as a tremendous breakthrough that could someday lead to a cancer vaccine. In the coming years, Southam injected HeLa and other living cancer cells into more than six hundred people for his research, about half of them cancer patients. He also began injecting them into every gynecologic surgery patient who came to Sloan-Kettering’s Memorial Hospital or its James Ewing Hospital. If he explained anything, he simply said he was testing them for cancer. And he believed he was: Since people with cancer seemed to reject the cells more slowly than healthy people did, Southam thought that by timing the rejection rate, he might be able to find undiagnosed cases of cancer.Coming back to the human right on the human body. Legislation around our user data, our documents etc is very advanced today. But what about our right for our cells and genes? Some claims about asking permission exclaimed that it would be against the progress of science, that it is just a human waste and therefore people don't have the right for it anymore. But it is probably not their place to decide, and the world is marching to defend people rights wherever it comes up. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is a good start to fix the problems that still exist in this field.And there is a bright side, and Henrietta is an example that one person can have a giant impact on the world. Without education, money, or too much luck, she succeeded to get science to great breakthroughs.he pointed around the room at Davon and JaBrea’s other cousins, saying, “So will that child … and that child … and that child. This is their story now. They need to take hold of it and let it teach them they can change the world too.”5 stars for a woman bigger than life, and an important historical evolvement in an ever changing world."
108,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1206965-rach,5,"If I could give this book 10 stars, I would. It is an amazing story of Henrietta Lacks, whose cervical cancer cells became the first ""immortal"" cells in the study of human cell cultures. It covers the story of her life, death, and how her cells have changed science as we know it. In 1951, it was common for tissue to be taken without a patient's knowledge, especially when the patient was black. This book touches on how that simple fact changed a family's life. Much of the book discusses how it effected Henrietta's children once they found out that their mother's tumor had been taken and experimented on without her consent during the biopsy of the tumor. Upon her death, consent was given for an autopsy and some samples to be taken, but it was because her husband wasn't fully informed and thought that the tests would detect whether his and Henrietta's children had cancer.The book also discusses race issues and class issues that have touched the Lacks family's life. It discusses what care was common for black people in the early 50s and how many black people didn't get basic health care because they simply couldn't afford it and because it was well-known that black patients were often experimented on. It's heartbreaking to read about her family's complete misunderstanding of what had been done to their mother. When Henrietta's children were told about the fact that Henrietta's cells were still alive and being studied, 25 years after her death, they first thought that their mother had been kept alive all that time and was being experimented on. This wasn't because they were intellectually unable to understand it (as shown by how Deborah, Henrietta's surviving daughter, taught herself a lot of the science surrounding the testing done on the cell line established from Henrietta's cell sample), but because they were so poor that they weren't given basic science education and because of the lingering taint on the medical establishment that remained due to the Tuskegee airmen experiment and similar experiments. It's also heartbreaking to read about the fact that the Lacks' family had, at the time of the publishing of the book, no health insurance, even though their mother's cells have been sold and resold uncountable times.The race issues are also discussed when it comes to the care of Elsie, who was institutionalized when Henrietta became ill, because she was significantly developmentally disabled. Unfortunately, Elsie's life wasn't as well-documented as Henrietta's life, and many of her medical files were lost between the time of her death and when Skloot and Deborah begin their research into Elsie's life. But it's made clear that experiments were done on Elsie without the family's consent and that it was quite common at the time for experiments to be done on those in mental institutions.Lastly, this book touches on how the issue of the ownership of tissues taken for samples and payment for any treatments or cures to the owner of the tissues is evolving. As of right now, once you sign away the rights to your tissue, you sign away the monetary rights, but the law is still trying to find the ""right"" answer to this issue.I cannot recommend this book enough. Even if you're not interested in the scientific aspect of it, it's a book that should be read for the human side of the story, along with the medical ethics issues. I'll end with saying that there are some triggery things in this book, especially if you have issues surrounding medical things being done to you without your consent. But I think that should go without saying. Everything is handled as sensitively as possible, though. I found that the matter-of-fact matter in which Skloot writes makes it all a bit harder to digest, especially if you're very unused to these things being discussed so openly. But I think that style suits this story -- the things that happened to this family should make you uncomfortable. "
109,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin,4,"This book was excellent and I found myself totally drawn into Henrietta's story right from the first few pages. Rebecca Skloot is a journalist with a keen interest in discovering the truth behind the HeLa cells, the infamous cells that multiplied faster than any others in culture and made dozens of new scientific break-throughs possible. These cells were taken from Henrietta Lacks, a black woman diagnosed with cervical cancer, when she was being treated, without her knowledge, and long after her death they continue to be used world-wide. What I loved about this story was the raw personable tone to the writing. This book fully deserved to win the Wellcomebookprize in my eyes, becuase it was truly a wonder of storytelling, fact and fiction all wonderfully blended. Skloot manages to tell us the important details of science in a way that feels approachable and easy, whilst also showing the raw side of the deal that the Lacks family ended up with, and the emotional connection she herself had with the daughter of the family. This is truly a story that more people need to learn about and experience. A beautiful book, an informative piece of writing, and a very deserved winner of the prize in my eyes. Excellent, 4.5*s "

112,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3258351-emily,2,"This book has already been lauded and reviewed to the moon and to the garbage can, which is where I think it should go. The story, as Skloot tells it, has already been told in articles and, briefly, in another book, but Skloot feels called to tell it again. Unfortunately, this is the very public story of a private individual and her family who have never consented to any of this and are tired of white people turning up on their doorstep looking for inside information. Skloot acknowledges this without stopping and finding a new hobby.Here's a far from complete list of problems with this book:So little science. It's written for your aunt's book club, but with Skloot's litany of, ""HeLa cells have been sent into space, blown up in an atom bomb, fought AIDS, etc,"" I would like to know how HeLa cells helped create bombs, for example. There's a little bit about cell reproduction and a little about the creation of the polio vaccine, but anything is exciting is when its blasted into space. Please explain how this was done. Use simple words. Use metaphors. But don't just say, ""Science happened.""My other problems are tied racism, mostly Skloot's. She drives through a Black Baltimore neighborhood for over an hour looking for a store without stopping because [stopping to ask black people for directions is scary]. She keeps waving at the same men. Children are running after her car. And she seeks a church for sanctuary.Formal address. Henrietta Lacks' children call Skloot ""Miss Rebecca."" (http://ask.metafilter.com/224268/Sout...) Skloot calls Henrietta Lacks and her relatives by their first names. Doctors and scientists are called by their last names.Mrs. Lacks' daughter Deborah makes an expository statement on doctors kidnapping and doing medical experiments on Blacks. Skloot explains at length why the medical establishment was not actually kidnapping Black people for the purpose of medical experimentation. Skloot does mention Tuskegee and some other documented incidents of non-consensual, fatal medical experiments; and later she and Deborah go to the Hospital for the Negro Insane, where Deborah's sister had horrific medical experiments performed on her. The kidnapping of Black people (Fugitive Slave Act, lynching, etc.) should be well known. But Skloot needs to refute, at length, Deborah's conflation of kidnapping and medical experiments. Aaargh! It is not up to the oppressed to determine which people are kidnapping them and which people are doing horrific medical experiments and then make the distinction between the two groups in casual conversation.And Skloot's treatment of Deborah in general. Skloot seems genuinely impressed by Deborah's research on HeLa cells, but she never goes so far as to help her, or connect her with a lawyer to look into the legitimacy of a suit against, say, Johns Hopkins for releasing Mrs. Lacks' medical records without consent. Skloot refuses to give a percentage of book sales to Mrs. Lacks' descendants directly, instead creating a scholarship fund of which she is the gatekeeper. And the last day Skloot and Deborah travel together, Skloot's describes Deborah's crazy, manic behavior as though it was a consistent with Deborah's normal self, even though Skloot learns the next day that Deborah was having a major medical episode that caused her to act erratically. The writing is bad. The progression of HeLa research through the Cold War era is appropriately chronological. But when Skloot comes on the scene, she describes everything in the order it happened to her, instead of pulling it together coherently and making it less of a travelogue into the lives of the Black people she was badgering.Also, Bahni Turpin does all the Black voices on the audiobook and another person reads the rest of the text. That might be an allegorical manifestation of the book itself. The white person speaks at length and freely, while the Black characters are handed a representation bone."
113,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2344676-neil,2,"I remember the first time I heard of Henrietta and her family's story; like Skloot, it was as a brief aside during a biology class and, like Skloot, it affected me much more than the teacher seemed to think it should. When I heard about Skloot's book, I was very interested.Unfortunately, Skloot's book's a bit of a mess, and the material itself makes the reasons why pretty clear. The idea has been gestating for at least 10 years, and she's probably been writing for at least five; she clearly had dozens of directions she wanted to go with the book - mainly, though, detailing the story of a wronged southern black family and talking about the injustices of the old South and telling the story of a cell line which have had a profound impact on science. Unfortunately, these two don't tie together in any significant way, and Skloot, probably because she spent so much time with the family and envisioned this book as a science-based human interest story, emphasizes, to the book's detriment, the human interest part (it may well be because - and I don't know because I don't know much about it - people familiar with science know of many accounts of the actual history of HeLa cells). To the point where we are finding out details of the lives of many of Henrietta's cousins and children and grandchildren, which just make the narrative a complete mess.Henrietta's story, too, is not particularly ethically complicated; she received what was proper treatment, and, though the biopsy was performed without her approval, it hardly added any pain to her situation, there was no malicious intent from the doctors, and indeed Skloot talks at one point about how little interest Gey, the scientist who originally worked with her cells, had in profit and instead how much he cared about the advancement of science at the expense of his own potential for patents, etc.Her narrative of the history of cell culture is interesting, but the science is massively toned down. She also tries to include silly stuff about religion v. science - she mentions some thoughts a little bit at the book's very beginning, but it disappears until the very end, at which point she has not at all established it as any sort of important consideration in this story.And, I really don't mean to go into ad hominem attacks here - Skloot seems well-intentioned and liberal-minded - but I feel that Skloot inserted herself into the story far too much. Like, with the whole storyline culminating in Deborah finally letting her look at the medical records, she seemed to paint herself as some sort of redeemer of all the prior sins against the Lacks family which she spent so long detailing. One particularly bizarre scene is when Deborah and her grandchildren ride to see Zakariyya (p. 242 in my version), and the grandchildren, whom Skloot described as ""strkingly beautiful"" say to Skloot both ""I love you"" and ""You're mine."" These eight lines could be stricken from the book without losing, you know, anything at all, but Skloot, a writing teacher, should know that every detail should be in a narrative for a reason. What is the reason here? It's strange. Why does she insist we see how much she is loved by the children, especially in this flirtatious way?"

While the content will most likely leave readers feeling a whole range of emotions from sadness to anger, the actual content of this book is something that needs to be read by all people regardless of color, age, or background. While there are parts of the story that seem exploitative (I honestly felt as if Skloot sometimes went into too much detail about different parts of the Lacks' family's dysfunction when describing individuals who are currently living), the overall story of Henrietta Lacks' body being defiled and her cells taken without her or her family's consent all in the name of science is something that everyone should read up on."

She doesn't tell us what to think (that much), but lays out the story in such a way that your own thoughts and emotions fill that last crucial gap. 3. I'm so grateful for HELA. Man, thank God for science!4. I was a bit uncomfortable with the way Skloot characterized the family.

I personally think that science and medicine is fascinating (as I want to study either pediatrics or dermatology), so I am very glad that I was required to read this book for school as it exposed me to HeLa cells and both the impact that they made on the scientific community and on Henrietta Lack's family.

I've summarized many of the reasons why the students and I developed such strongly negative opinions of ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" here:1. The author has created a mythology. By referring to Henrietta somehow being ""alive"" is falacious. The cells are not Henrietta - in fact they are the opposite of Henrietta. The cells are anti-Henrietta and are what actually killed her. Do you cry and worry over the hair that's left on the floor of a barbershop after a haircut? How about your nail clippings? What about baby teeth or a wart that is burned off? What is,the difference between any of these things and Henrietta's cells? The family were uneducated and superstitious and to continuously refer to the cells and somehow ""being"" Henrietta was a confusing and cruel fantasy.2. Why did the author inject herself into the story? Is that what historical biographers are supposed to do? Frankly, the only part of the book that isn't salacious, pandering, Jerry Springer-level anthropology is the 13 page Afterword, which is actually a well-written and thought-provoking essay. Now Ms. Skloot is forever linked to this pseudo-story, not as an objective observer but as a character in her own fevered imagination. It is a tremendous effort at self-promotion and glory-seeking which throws a dark shadow over the believability of any of the events of the story. 3. The author creates many 2-dimensional characters that are either all good or all bad. Cases in point- the elderly couple with the Confederate flags in the living room, Galen the sexual-predator uncle and Christoph, the noble and sympathetic scientist. 4. The author makes transparent attempts to link totally disparate events so that they seem to have something in common and almost cause and effect. Example - the descriptions of injecting the prisoners with cancer cells and the Nazi experiments (Chapter 17) can only remotely, peripherally be construed as having ANYTHING to do with HeLa cells. It's comparing apples to oranges and these conversations have no place in this book. 5. The family seem to expect that they are owed something because they are recipients of a genetic lottery ticket by their (in many cases) tenuous associations with Henrietta's DNA. For example - her husband Day can arguably be described as the person responsible for Henrietta's cancer, as he was the person most likely to have infected her with syphilis and HPV - why should he or any of the other extended family financially benefit from the hard work of the geneticists and scientists that developed the successful cell cloning techniques?6. The whole Lacks family are depicted as intellectual children and borderline retarded.7. Why did the author use the convention to colloquialize the speech of the minority characters (the Lacks and Susan Hsu the Chinese lab assistant) but not any of the other foreign characters? Christoph Lengauer was born and raised in Austria. He studied human genetics/biology at the Unviersity of Salzburg, Austria. Dr. Lengauer received his PhD from the University of Heidelberg, Germany and went for his postdoctoral studies to the IMP (Institute of Molecular Pathology) in Vienna, Austria. He then joined the group of Prof. Bert Vogelstein at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. I cannot believe that Dr. Lengauer doesn't speak with an accent, yet the author elected NOT to colloquialize his speech or any of the other non-minority characters. This was probably the single most offensive thing about this book. It is condescending, sanctimonius, patronizing and probably racist.8. Why is Zakariyya depicted as a sympathetic figure? He is a murderer, a drunk and a violent societal parasite. Compare this with the depiction of the fake lawyer (Cofield). I'm not fan of lawyers, but as far as we know, Cofield never killed anyone. Why is Cofield a terrible, albeit bumbling villain, yet Zakariyya is someone that deserves sympathy and pity? These were some of the main points that came out in our discussion. Some of the students initially said that they enjoyed the book and they ""felt sorry for the family"", but once we actually began teasing apart the numerous problems with the novel, every student agreed that what we read was not the story of Henrietta Lacks or of HeLa cells, but instead the story of Rebecca Skloot and her naked ambition for fame.

125,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9361151-nada-elshabrawy,5,Terrific!
126,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5099486-lynndee-lynndee-s-library,5,"For a non-fiction book, this reads really well. The research is written in a way that is accessible to a reader who may be unfamiliar with the subject (like me...science is not my favorite thing to read about). And of course the human element of the story and discussion of ethics and moral obligation in science is well worth the read. "
127,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86936398-morgand,5,"This book was awesome!! I love medical stuff and I love learning about things like this. This book was about a black woman who’s cells were taken without her information and she died from cancer that was all over her body. This book talks about her childhood, while she was going through treatment, after she died, and what happened to her family afterward. Because of her cells we are able to have the vaccines and other things in the medical field because of her. Her family doesn’t get any of the money that the multi-million dollar medical industry makes, even though most of what has been discovered was because to her cells. The fight for justice with her cells is still going on today in courts."
128,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5739672-janet,1,"It was such a great story I was sure I was going to give it a 5. Then I entered the last 1/4 of the book and realized what a despicable person authored the book and gave it one star. I thoroughly enjoyed both the science, dilemmas, and human aspects of the story and I am very sorry it was not told by someone who was decent. Although feigning objectivity throughout it was obvious by the end that it was anything but. This author took advantage of this family for financial gain in a way much worse than any scientific research company. She spent an extensive amount of time convincing them they should trust her and she was on their side.-This was largely an biography of Deborah; and unbeknownst to her. She should have been compensated as such. The author told Deborah that she could not compensate her and would have to set up a scholarship fund for her instead. Deborah believed her because she trusted her and it did not occur to her that Rebecca Skloot had no right to decide that this family could not decide how to spend their money themselves and also figure out how to compensate them.-On page 267 she wrote her observations of Henrietta's sister Glady's upon having been invited into her private residence. Glady's was wheelchair bound and it was stated she was crippled by arthritis to the point that her chest was resting nearly on her knees. When the people came into the room this old woman trapped in a wheelchair is reported to have had her nightgown up around her waist and struggling to pull it down. Rebecca Skloot chose to forever strip her of the dignity she was desperately attempting to preserve by relating it in detail. Utterly despicable. -The accounts of Deborah's erratic behavior became lengthy and actually tedious the last 1/4 of the book. (It is an example of her lack of objectivity and there are many.) It is obvious the author meant to portray her in this way at that time. Rebecca Skloot was hanging on until she got Deborah to give her Henrietta's medical records. At this part of the book Deborah had given them to her and had nothing more she desired and her relating of her 'object' changed.-She accomplished nothing in pursuing these people in such an extreme way but her own profits. In the end the statement of one of the Lack's men was identical to what it had always been. They still did not know why they could not even afford health care if HELA had done so much to revolutionize healthcare and they wanted to educate their children in these matters so they would not be hurt like they were. (others pursuing them because Henrietta is HELA) There is no reason on Gods green earth why the Lacks cannot have those very reasonable things. Perhaps Ms. Skloot would like to see to it that happens starting with the profits from this book.-I cannot stand what this author did to Deborah in the end. She related such deeply personal details about Deborah's state of health and mental health that support much of the hyperbole already surrounding this family that it is she they should sue.-She violated the trust of Deborah in disclosing the personal medical records of her little sister. This was apparently an enormous struggle and the author relates extensive distressed conversation with Deborah extracting promises not to tell. She gave just as many extensive promises that she would not. Instead she related that young people institutionalized there were not separated by age or sex and that they endured sexual abuse. It is easy to figure out what Deborah was trying to protect her little sister and her dignity about. Ms. Skloot decided to violate that agreement as well as the trust of Deborah and trick her. Despicable."
129,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81322-chris,1,"This book represents, to me, much of what is wrong is pop non-fiction. The author was far too present throughout the entire book, and the book itself is a much more about her and her obsession with Henrietta Lacks than it is about anything else. White guilt and righteous indignation were two main themes pervading much of the writing. The narrative was all over the place, and at the end of the book, I couldn't tell why it had been written. To educate about inequalities of health care? (not really, the issue was never actually discussed in anything but a hyper-emotional way) To honor Henrietta Lacks? (not really--her person and character disappears after a few chapters) To explain what HeLa cells are for? (again, not really--it was discussed, but not with any sense of purpose, more just a rambling set of facts) To just review the history of the cells and Henrietta's family in a wandering journey highlighted by chapters that were unconnected to one another without a broad theme? Possibly. This sentence really illustrates everything that is wrong with this book: ""Though the judge in the John Moore case said patients must be told if their tissues have commercial potential, there was no law enacted to enforce that ruling, so it remains only case law.""What the HELL is she talking about? Case law IS law! For example, all law regarding the meaning of the fourth amendment (searches and seizures) is case law. Terry stops and frisks? Case law. Miranda warnings? Case law. Case law IS ENFORCEABLE LAW. That's why it's enforced. All the time. If this author managed to miss that fact, what else is wrong? I could spot places in the book where she was just wrong about law, or places where her statements amounted to inaccuracies. But I don't know anything about science--so I could not spot where she was wrong there. What the hell was going on in this book? Who edited it?And, also, as a personal note to Skloot: The John Moore case is not just law, it's a really important seminal case. So important that they make all law students read the damn case in their first year of law school. It's enforceable. Legislators don't need to enact another law to enforce it. "
130,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1886642-catie,5,"I think that I'm going to need to make a non-fiction shelf. I've always avoided non-fiction, thinking that it would be ""dry"" or ""boring"" or worse, too realistically tragic (I like to be able to put my novel down and comfort myself with the thought that it was all made-up). This book is engaging and moving and too good to be fiction. It weaves together three story lines - the story of Henrietta Lacks, a strong, confident, competent mother of five who was the unsuspecting donor of the first immortal human cell line, the long and complicated journey of the virulent and unstoppable cells that she left behind, and the story of the author of this book, who spent years researching this topic and getting to know the Lacks family. I remember the first time I googled ""HeLa"" about six years ago while completing some training for my job. At the time, the wikipedia article I read said that the cell line was a cancerous cell of african origin and had come from a woman named Helen Lane or Helen Larson or possibly Henrietta Lacks. It said that no one knew for sure. At the time I thought that was kind of interesting, and I wondered who she really was. When this book came out last year, I was intrigued, but my prejudice about non-fiction held me back from reading it. When this was selected for a book club I am in, I bowed to the pressure and picked it up. I am so glad that I did! All three story lines are wonderful and moving, and I even cried once. This book is special, because it combines science and human interest and faith so effortlessly. I know that it seems to me lately that religious leaders are convinced that science must be an adversary to religion and faith, but that's simply not true and this book is a beautiful illustration of how the two can come together. I also have to really praise Ms. Skloot for explaining all of the basic science information and the HeLa studies in a way that anyone can understand. I highly recommend this one!"
131,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93751-gail,5,"This book is so great on multiple levels but here's two:Level 1: It's just a fascinating story. Period. The birth of today's multi-billion (trillion?) bio-tech industry started with a few immortal cells that came from the cervix of one poor black woman by the name of Henrietta Lacks. Her family didn't know her cells were taken for decades. They never received a dime of all the money made off of them. As in, to this day. And that's a damn shame. Level 2: Rebecca Skloot is my journalistic hero. Having once been a journalist, I can recall the handful of times I worked on a story that I felt truly mattered. How I would spend but a few hours with the people I'd profile but how much work (observing, taking notes, research, etc.) was caught up in just doing that little bit. Rebecca is someone who spent YEARS working on this book. An idea that caught her attention at 16 (when she first learned about HeLa cells), followed her through college and carried her on as she began work on the novel with no advance (just her student loans and credit cards to get her by). The courage and tenacity it took to get this family behind her and then to stick with them as sources, coax them into trusting her, put up with their behavior (Henrietta's daughter Deborah ... wow, I couldn't imagine sticking with her..at one point in the book, she has Rebecca up against the wall) through publication of this book? Unbelievable. It's for these reasons alone that I highly recommend this one. By far one of the best non-fiction books I've read by an author for whom I have the utmost respect and admiration."
132,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6320013-alysia,5,"First let me start by saying...I loved this book! I loved the pace, the story, the history of the family and the history of medicine. Amazing! This book starts off with the story of Rebbecca Skloot (the author) and how she first questioned the life behind the name her professor quickly mentioned during a class. Her questions about the name grew into an obsession in finding out about Henrietta Lacks and the woman behind the cells that helped push modern medicine. Rebbecca tells the story with compassion, understand and with a bit of naive along with the help of Deborah Lacks, the other Lacks children, friends, and family members. There are few books out there that can be medically informative and hold my attention. I don't think any book has done that. EVER!The narrators Cassandra Campbell and Bahni Turpin read this book with the easy and non-acting I love. They were in the book telling the story without acting the story out. The best part of this audiobook was the interview at the end of the book with Rebbecca Skloot. This has will be on my list of best reads for 2012. "
133,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins,3,"3.5 stars. A good book about the famous HeLa cell line that has contributed so much to science, interlaced with the story of the original donor, Henrietta Lacks, and her family. Skloot objectively discusses the legal and ethical issues involved when research is carried out on tissue samples taken from human subjects.Do you own every piece of your body? Should you be informed whenever a bit of it, however small, is taken away and experimented upon? Are you entitled to compensation if a corporation profits from research done on your genetic material?You might not be surprised at the answers to these questions for a poor, uneducated black patient in 1951 - Henrietta was not asked, was not informed, was not compensated. It's interesting to consider that the answers are still uncertain for a modern patient.The science in the book is lightweight. I wish the author had written more about HeLa and a little less about her personal relationship with Henrietta's daughter."
134,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2079470-cheryl,4,"Henrietta Lacks was diagnosed with inoperable cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital in the early 1950’s. The young African American mother of five had little money. Without her knowledge, doctors removed some of her cancer cells to use in research. Henrietta’s cells were the first cells to ever survive for any length of time, and also to reproduce in large quantities. Her cells were shared and sold to many other researchers and research facilities throughout the world and are recognized worldwide as the HeLa cells. This book interweaves the story of Henrietta and her family with the story of the HeLa cells. Ms.Skloot explains the scientific part in easily understandable layman’s terms. This is a fascinating story of family, faith, science, and the use of human tissue with repercussions which reach far into the future. "
135,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/278339-rincey,5,"Holy cow, I looooved this book. I kept finishing each chapter wanting to exclaim ""Why isn't this book required reading of every child in school yet??"" Yes, I do realize it was published in 2009 and these things take time, but this story is something everyone should read. It brings up the tragic life of the Lacks family, the horrible conditions of blacks, and horrible things science would do to them. But this book does what the family always wanted, brought fame to the woman Henrietta Lacks and the miracle of her immortal cells. "
136,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4741108-lynn-mitra,5,"A very good non-fiction book based on the story of Henrietta Lacks, her family and her cells. Her cells, therefore Henrietta Lacks herself, have been important in curing disease starting with the polio virus and ending with HIV and cancer. Intertwined with this story is the story of her impoverish family and their quest for truth!"
137,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82984810-karina-flores,4,So this book did take me a long time to read because I’m not usually a non-fiction reader. But once I got into it I found myself really starting to enjoy it. More so towards the end than the beginning. All in all I love how the book jumped from Henrietta’s point of view to her daughters point of view and to researchers I feel like it made the story a bit more intriguing.

139,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,4,"Goodreads reviewer NW James really gets to the heart of ""The Immortal Life..."" when he says it's a book about miscommunication. ""It's amazing what feelings can be generated from a series of assumptions and misunderstandings,"" he goes on. ""It's also amazing and beautiful how the author and members of the Lacks family brought this story gently into religion and faith.""I agree. There's a way in which, by starting in a hospital and ending in a church, Skloot brings this from a place in which the Lacks family has traditionally felt disempowered to a place in which they feel powerful, grounded and loved. It's concerning that there are so few loci where science is infused with deeply felt spiritual, emotionally integrated regard for the other. The medical establishment, by and large, seems to enforce connections between doctor and patient that resemble Buber's I -- It relationship model rather than than the empathic and humanizing I -- thou. Another goodreads member commented on a different review that she worries this book is an extension of previous exploitation of the Lacks family. First Henrietta's cells were taken without her knowledge and used without any form of consent, acknowledgement or recompense. And now a white woman has exposed the family, their history and their present circumstances, for the sake of this book, once again using their story for other people's profit. Is she continuing the cycle of exploitation? I cannot answer that question. If it is true that this book is not wholly on the side of reparation and justice, at least the family participated with full awareness and consent. They are also being recognized in the form of a fund Skloot has set up, based partly on profits from the sale of the book. This fund is to benefit direct descendants of the Lacks family and also others who have been negatively affected by unethical medical testing, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis testing. This is a meaningful gesture on Skloot's part, but it doesn't really address the deeper issues at play. One thing that really interests me about this book is, both intentionally and perhaps not so intentionally, it explores the intersections of several forms of institutional (for lack of a better phrase I will say) abuses of power. There is the problem of the medical system, which is clearly not one static monolithic thing. Nevertheless, doctors and medical practitioners are in a position of power in relationship to their patients, as are research institutions and pharmaceutical companies, all in bed together in different ways, and though they often get in the way of each other's research with claims of ownership, it seems like they have an excessive fear of and distaste for individual people, with next to no power in the scheme of things, having any say in or benefit from how their tissues are used. Then there is the problem of the relationship between black individuals and communities and the American health care system, heck, with pretty much any American institutional systems. The histories of exploitation here are horrific and also, very difficult to mold into something less sinister. It is not that other communities and populations have not been negatively affected by differentials of power between individuals and American institutions. They have. The abuses of power, however, have not been as consistent, egregious and systematic. And then there is the problem of how people's stories are used in our culture, with its media industries that can really feed off the pain and suffering its victims, often in ways that are not concerned with people's dignity, and usually without giving much, if anything, in return. Journalists do this, and individual well-meaning writers do it too. Skloot's book tries to address some of the injustices done to the Lacks family, and I think I understand why she made many of the decisions she did in terms of how she wrote the book. But I'm not sure she fully acknowledges the power dynamics at play. Is she part of the problem or the solution? God knows. I sure don't. It's funny to me that various people criticize the book for being too focused on Skloot and on the present day life of the Lacks's. They wish there were more science or more about Henrietta herself. I am always up for more science and I think Skloot could have spent more time detailing and writing narratives about various kinds of research using the HeLa cells. Though where would she even begin? And I also would have been happy if Skloot got even more introspective about her positioning in this whole affair. I think this book reveals an astonishing failure of empathy on the part of the medical community, which is not hard to find if one is looking. I am glad there was some reparation, with Cristoph (I am forgetting his last name) offering some apologies and the beautiful photograph of Henrietta's cells. I love moment where Deborah, Lacks's youngest child, who I don't think was quite two when Henrietta died, is researching the word Hela and finds a Marvel comic book goddess: “a seven-foot tall, half-black, half-white goddess who’s part dead and part alive, with ‘immeasurable’ intelligence, ‘superhuman’ strength, ‘godlike’ stamina and durability, and five hundred pounds of solid muscle…” There's some truth to this and poetic justice in the ways that the HeLa cells have to some degree made a mess of the whole world of medical cell culturing. This is, all in all, a hard book to rate, and at times, a hard one to read, both because of what is now in the past and still painfully resonates within its pages, and because of what continues to be true. It was also a labor of love for Rebecca Skloot, a ten year project that brought her into the lives of some amazing people, who I'm glad I got to meet. I learned a lot about mutual respect and second and third and fourth chances, and about the importance of being able to see clearly into past, and also to be able sometimes let it go.  "
140,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56491386-kirsty,4,"A splendid biography, packed with so much depth, both scientifically and emotionally. Henrietta's story, and subsequently that of her children and grandchildren, is harrowing and incredibly sad, and certainly deserves to be told. Skloot has thoroughly and compassionately researched an important historical document, a reflection of a woman who has unknowingly done so much for scientific and medical research. So human, and eminently readable."
141,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3782741-lucie,4,"3.5 starsI really liked learning about Henrietta's cells and where they came from and how they are used. I'm glad this book is out there telling that story. I've seen other reviews complain that there's too much personal focus about Skloot writing the book and the history of the family, and not enough focus on the actual science of the cells. I don't agree as I thought the personal details made the book more readable and engaging. I also thought there was enough scientific detail that allowed us to learn about why Henrietta's cells were so important, but not so much that a layman couldn't understand.I also thought the conversation of cell ownership that Skloot brought up was quite fascinating.The reason I'm giving this 3.5 stars instead of 4 stars is because I feel really odd about how Henrietta's family was used by the author of the book. It *sounds* like Skloot had a good relationship with Deborah, but of course this book was written by her and I highly doubt she would make it sound like the family hated her guts. Especially since this is such a popular book (and was also turned into a movie) I'm sure Skloot has gained monumentally from the publication, did the family see any of that? I just feel a bit uncomfortable without knowing those details."
142,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2670571-kaion,2,"Perhaps I am the wrong audience of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. For one, though I am not studying medical research in particular, I am familiar with the basics of cancer genetics. While the science of Immortal Life was presented in a straightforward manner, I found it disappointingly cursory. Though Skloot does goes into a little more detail about how Lacks's cells were initially collected and propagated, she for the most part provides a very glancing look at the history of HeLa cells in cancer research.Furthermore, Rebecca Skloot's writing lacks the personality that would set it apart from your average newspaper of magazine article. If her goal was to avoid getting too technical, it still would've added a lot for her to provide more background on some of the breakthrough (and dead end) experiments Hela was involved, and a more ground-level look at its impact on the medical community, rather than broad sweeping statements.Far more troubling, however, is the social side of Immortal Life, in which Skloot shows a persistent tendency to over-sentimentalize and inflate her own role in the narrative. Skloot presents what little biographical information she was able to compile on Henrietta within a few short chapters, and fills the remainder of the book with the story of Henrietta's remaining family. It's a solid idea in theory-- contextualizing the poor, colored experience of medicine in America-- but in practice, Skloot seems unable to grasp the scope of her subject. Skloot sees enough to point out the irony of the Lacks family belonging to the large portion of Americans unable to get reliable health coverage, but is unable to go further in her analysis to explore the classist, racist, and historical roots of this situation. Furthermore, Skloot's prose often fails at the ""human interest"" level as well, blankly reporting decades of people's lives as series of major events in colorless summaries... with one major exception: Rebecca Skloot.Because the one thing we do get a lot of rambling about how SHE, Rebecca Skloot found this tale and how SHE, Rebecca Skloot got the family to talk to her, and how SHE, Rebecca Skloot gained a meaningful and worthwhile connection to the family, particularly close to Henrietta's daughter, Deborah (who mind you, was a mere baby when Henrietta died). It stinks of white-savior syndrome, complete with lots of exaggerated empathy from Skloot.Let's be real, Rebecca, no one cares about how first learned of HeLa cells when you were seventeen in a college class you were taking for credits because you went to kumbaya school, and how you were so moved and curious about the unknown donor of these miraculous cells.When it isn't tedious, Skloot's self-centered ""empathy"" is condescending. A large part of her so-called relationship with Deborah consists of how SHOCKED, SHOCKED I tell you with their cultural/class/religious differences, and Skloot's resulting white liberal guilt. But don't worry, Skloot never fails to tell us about how ultimately meaningful SHE found their connection and spiritually fulfilling because Deborah was just so inspiring. I cynically note that if it's not a narrative strategy rooted in a complete lack in self-awareness, it is one that is extremely commercial. Can't you see it now, a glossy film starring Julia RobertsEmily Blunt? As an idealistic young reporter who eventually working through the mistrust and cultural clash, forms a oddball patnership with religious black matriarch Alfre Woodward to get recognition for forgetten Henrietta Lacks? Portrayed dying tragically young in well-appointed flashbacks by Zoe Saldana, of course.This is a story that deserves a good telling. And it is perhaps more charitable to believe that Skloot felt so much of a personal stake in the proceedings that she couldn't get out of the way of her own narrative. Certainly it is less depressing than concluding that sentimentality and Hollywood feel-good-ism is considered necessary to make science writing palatable to a mass audience. Rating: 2 stars"
143,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47799008-tudor-vlad,5,"You know that book that left such an impression on you that there are so many things you want to talk about and you just don’t what to start with? (or how to even start saying anything) The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is just that. I just can’t stop thinking about it.
""But I always have thought it was strange, if our mother cells done so much for medicine, how come her family can't afford to see no doctor? Don't make no sense. People got rich off my mother without us even knowin about them takin her cells, now we don't get a dime. I used to get so mad about that to where it made me sick and I had to take pills. But I don't got it in me no more to fight. I just want to know who my mother was."" 
 The Immortal life of Henrietta Lacks is not just a story about the person that was Henrietta, it is also a story about her daughter Deborah and of course, about the HeLa cells that far outlived the person that they were collected from. I said that this is also a story about her daughter Deborah and that is half-true. It’s about Deborah and Henrietta’s other relatives and family but if I’m being honest, and I’m not trying to sound mean or anything, but I just didn’t care about them. I cared about Deborah because the author had a really strong relationship with her and she really focused on that. The other members of the Lacks family felt more like background characters. The only other member of the Lacks family I liked was Zakariyya.There’s a human element to the story but there’s also a focus on the HeLa cell which since it focused on the science, was more impersonal. I really enjoyed how the author switched between what happened with the HeLa cell in a time period and then to what the Lacks family was doing in that same time. It really help make the point of how clueless they were. There is a lot of debate about who owns the cells that are no longer attached to your body. Are they still your property? Are they not? I’m on the side that thing’s that they’re no longer your property but I also think that the identity of the “donor” should be kept a secret. The way that details about Henrietta’s medical chart, her HeLa cell and even her DNA sequence were released publicly for her family and the whole world to see was really disgusting. It makes me wonder about how I would react if something similar would have happened to me and I shudder.  
""There's no way of knowing exactly how many of Henrietta's cells are alive today. One scientist estimates that if you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they'd weigh more than 50 million metric tons- an inconceivable number, given that an individual cell weighs almost nothing."" 
There’s more I would like to talk about but it would require me to bring too much information from the book so I think I’ll stop here but before that I have to urge anyone that hasn’t yet read this book to do it. I know that the fact that this is nonfiction might put some people off but it shouldn't. The storytelling is moving and all the scientific information are conveyed clearly. To be honest, it reads more like fiction. The fact that it isn't is testimony to how well this is written."
144,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9777942-joe,4,"I considered several different reviews for this book. First, I thought I'd write about the book's central controversy regarding the use of human cells in scientific research. What rights do individuals possess regarding those cells? 'Who owns us?' was the operable phrase. But that idea went nowhere; it felt like I was reviewing the notes at the end of the book where most of the legal discussion takes place. Plus the courtroom battle over patients rights to their cells proves a dramatic dead end; the courts have ruled that we have no rights in this regard and this decision finds basis in the cold practicality of unfettered science.  Next, I attempted a review based on the diverse characters Rebecca Skloot meets on her quest for the story of Henrietta Lacks (who died after providing cervical cancer cells that built an industry.) The takeaway; 'look at all these fascinating, colorful characters! You never know who you're going to meet when you go out into the world, searching for the truth!' But this angle spoiled my favorite parts of the book; I loved the adventure element of this story, that Rebecca had little idea who she was going to meet when she journeyed to a small, marginalized Baltimore town or an old southern former-plantation. Reading a bunch of 1-sentence bios for these characters would've robbed me of that and I couldn't justify building a review in that way. Plus, some of the crazier characters I planned to reference (such as a Nazi-symphatizing medical researcher and the world's most litigious man) only appear tangentially and wouldn't fit the theme. A third attempt found me focusing on the word 'trust.' 'How do we choose who to trust?' That review began. 'Do you trust the customary bonds of family and familiarity? Leadership figures or signs of authority? What's written in books or what your gut tells you?' But this just didn't fit enough of the major decisions and attitudes in play. The poor black family at the heart of the story, Henrietta's descendants, each grapple with who they should trust (doctors, lawyers, reporters, medical horror stories), but I couldn't come up with enough other examples to unify the theme.  This review took over 2 months and frustrated me more than any other. And ultimately, this it's more about reviews that never happened than of the book itself. Rebecca Skloot's writing is so clear it stymies my perpetual quest for clarity, so instead I heaped upon it my own inconsistent ideas which I could clarify. I'll leave you with a evaluation simple and plain; this book is good, I learned a lot."
145,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a fascinating story, very well told, about the efforts of a poor black family to come to grips with an ethical issue. Should tissues removed from your body by a doctor be used by scientists, without any form of compensation? This book begins with the life of Henrietta Lacks, and her illness, horrific suffering and death of cervical cancer at the age of 30. She left behind five children. It wasn't until 20 years later that her children learned that their mother's cells were very special--they continued to live in medical laboratories around the world. They were being used for countless avenues of medical research, often with great success. For example, the use of her cells helped speed up the development of the polio vaccine enormously.While Henrietta Lacks' cells were originally taken by a doctor at Johns Hopkins, and then sent to medical researchers without compensation, some of the recipients of the cells started to grow the cells and re-sell them at profit. Thousands of researchers were using the cell samples, before the family even knew about the extended lifetime of their mother's cells. This was all done completely legally--no laws were broken, and all of this could happen again today, without breaking any laws.The question is, is this ethical? The Lacks family was desperately poor, and could not even afford to go to a doctor for themselves. Yet they decided not to sue the doctors or scientists. Instead, they preferred to get recognition for their mothers' contribution to science. To this day, it seems like Johns Hopkins has not given any official recognition to the contribution of Henrietta Lacks.Much of this book is the story of the author's research into the story of Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells, and her strange relationship with Henrietta's daughter, Deborah Lacks. Deborah accompanied the author on a journey of research and discovery. Deborah had to deal with demons that persecuted her from time to time, and the climax of the story occurs when her cousin Gary help throw the demons onto the author.By the way--I didn't read this book--I listened to it as an audiobook. It was read beautifully by Cassandra Campbell and Bahni Turpin."
146,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7298986-sarah-former-nefarious-breeder-of-murderous-crustaceans,3,"A fascinating, thought-provoking book. I've never liked science much but this book managed to get me interested in cell research and genetics, which is no small feat! ;) I think the strongest point of the book is the ethical questions it raises about informed consents, genetic research and the profits that can be made from anyone's cells. It amazes me that, to this day, anyone's tissues can be used for research without the person's knowledge or censent. To me, the weakest point in the book is the biographical part. It was high time someone wrote a book about Henrietta Lacks and how her cells where ""exploited"" by scientifics worldwide but half-way through the book the author starts writing about Henrietta's children & grandchildren and there is little to read about Henrietta's story and its implications after that. What also bothered me was the way the author made herself a character of the book. I just don't understand her motivations for doing so. What feels particularly strange here is that despite Skloot's involvement I still can't figure out what she thought of Henrietta's family. It sometimes felt like she wanted to like them but didn't manage to, she sometimes sympathizes and other times she seems to feel terribly annoyed. I think Skloot either wrote too much or too little. Since she decided to involve herself in the story she should have made it clear what her standpoint and feelings were. I think she should have focused more about Henrietta, cell research and bioethics. Now that would have made a really captivating book!"
147,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5498525-fionnuala,0,"Rebecca Skloot tells two parallel stories here, the history of modern cell culture research on the one hand and the family history of a young woman who died of cervical cancer on the other. The account of the development of cell culture would normally be of interest only to a small minority of people but by relating it to the life and death of Henrietta Lacks as well as to the lives of her extended family, Skloot has succeeded in linking two different genres, science writing and popular journalism. She weaves the two together very well, moving back and forth quite successfully between different worlds and different time frames, while linking both stories to the history of racism in the United States. The book very justifiably seeks to ensure that Henrietta Lacks' name goes down in history as the donor of the very resilient cancerous cells called HeLa, which established modern cell culture research. I was left with two questions, however. What enabled Henrietta's cancerous cells to grow and divide endlessly when all the other cells, both healthy and cancerous, previously gathered by scientists had eventually died? And why did Skloot feel the need to provide so many intimate details about Henrietta Lacks and her entire family even while she commiserated with them over earlier breaches of privacy. The only justification for revealing so much of the Lacks family history would be to show the reader why Henrietta's cells were so particularly resilient but unless I have missed something crucial, no such answer exists. "
148,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,3,"Doesn't live up to its promise to me. Useful to the general public I suppose for its history of how cells taken from a poor, black woman dying of cervical cancer became a cell line that revolutionized tissue culture and led to many benefits for medical science. But this progress is always placed in the context of the distorted perceptions of the surviving family members who either feel misused not being told for decades or not receiving receiving part of the profits. That the key surviving children were too young even to remember their mother makes the case of being wronged less compelling and makes for a weak link with egregious historical exploitations such as the Tuskegee syphilis study or broader base of experimental medical procedures carried out on the uninformed poor. I also didn't find it very edifying to learn the details of incest, abuse, and murder in the Lacks family or dwell on their false belief that the Johns Hopkins medical establishment made a profit off the cells or that the cell clone was somehow related to cloning their mother or lurid tabloid press responses to unusual uses of the cells (e.g. man-mouse hybrid cell lines). As reportage, the uncovering of details of the story and the experiences of the author also was not very compelling. The origins of informed consent practices is, however, nicely covered, as is the unresolved status of patient rights to cells or tissues taken in routine medical practice is unresolved. �"
149,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,3,"I have complex feelings about this book and not all of them good. Everyone seems to love this biography of Henrietta Lacks and while I enjoyed it, I found it, well, lacking. The blurb on the back was very intriguing, but I worried that there would't be too much more to add and after finishing the book I think I was mostly right. The main facts of Henrietta's life, how her cells were taken and what happened afterwards with their research, was fascinating stuff, but it didn't really fill more than a chapter's worth of information. While I enjoyed the first section of this book, finding out about Henrietta's young life, there were't enough known facts to really flesh things out. The majority of this book, especially in the second half, turned into Rebecca Skloot's investigation. Her journey to find Henrietta's family, travelling to their homes, meeting family members, staying in hotel rooms and difficulties writing the book. This was okay to read, but not exactly what I wanted to learn about. On the whole, I enjoyed the information I found and I'm pleased that Rebecca Skloot thought it was a story worth telling, but in all honesty there wasn't enough about Henrietta's life for me. Rebecca's writing was good and her relationship with Henrietta's daughter and other family members was endearing, but again this was not the reason why I picked this book up. I like science biographies and I read quite a few of them, so I'm probably being overly picky, but this one was just okay. "
150,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20229277-alissa-patrick,4,"This has been the most interesting nonfiction book I have ever read. If you like historical fiction/ sci fi/ legal battles, then give this book a try. It reads like a novel, but it is all true. This story is truly incredible. A woman named Henrietta Lacks dies of cancer in the 1950s, and scientists begin using her cells as research. It is now 2015 and her cells (called HeLa cells) are still alive and thriving in labs. Her cells are the first known human immortal cell line for medical research.Here's more fascinating info on HeLa cells:-Jonas Salk used her cells to come up with the vaccine for polio-Her cells were the first human ones successfuly cloned-They've been used for research into cancer, AIDS, effects of radiation, gene mapping etc and much moreIt also brings up an interesting debate about cells and tissues and if people are in ownershup of their own- Henrietta's cells were taken without permission by her or her family. It raises a lot about medical ethics without coming off too preachy. Don't be scared by the fact that there's a lot of science in this book. The author wrote this book to introduce the real woman behind the cells. There's a lot of stories about Henrietta herself, as well as her family.Highly recommend this one!!"

HeLa cells have affected so much and the average person does not realize it. More importantly, the book tells the story of Henrietta Lacks and tries to right the 50 year old wrong of the Lacks family not knowing what the rest of the world did without the world actually knowing the name of the person behind HeLa.""I can't say nothing bad about science, but I won't lie, I would like some health insurance so I don't got to pay all that money every month for drugs my mother cells probably helped make.""Not an easy read due to all the information, but I appreciate Skloot's ability to explain all of the scientific information without making it overly complicated or overly simplified.http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science...http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/scien...http://www.smithsonianmag.com/multime..."
152,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8173171-diane,4,"The author did a great job on intertwining a technical, scientific story with a historical, human interest story. Even working in a medical field, I had never heard of HeLa cells prior to this book coming out. I feel like it was a huge lesson about many medical discoveries over the past 50+ years. It was also extremely sad to learn about the Lacks family and about the many medical experiments done to people of less ""social value"" here in the US. It was disturbing on so many levels. But, I did really enjoy it and I think the author did a good job of capturing the various story lines she wanted to tell within this one book. "
153,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6683614-jenna,5,Fascinating and informative read about a subject that everyone has been affected by whether you know it or not. The ripple effects from a biopsy done in the 1950's is still being felt today. Amazing! Glad I work at a clinic that strives to achieve health literacy for ALL our patients. So important!
154,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5167235-sophie,5,"I'm not sure I would ever have picked up this book if it weren't for my fellow non-fiction fans in the Around the Year in 52 Books group. The hype was so big that this book could only be something truly special. And it was.I always loved science, and my boyfriend working in the research industry, we've had a few talks about research ethics, but let's be honest, they often were how painful it sometimes can be to comply with ethics committees. But reading this book really made me realise how little donors count. I'm not sure if it's a good or a bad thing, as there are two sides, as always. On one hand science needs tissues to do research, which people benefit from, but on the other hand it's ridiculous to see how much money companies make from tissues people have no control on once they leave their body.Coming back to the book, I found it really well done. I can't begin to imagine the amount of research Rebecca Skloot has done and the time she must have spent building and writing the book. I found the structure of it absolutely perfect, with enough science talk for people who understand the subject, but well-enough explained for laypeople (or at least I hope). The sequence of time periods in each chapter was well-balanced and I found the fictionalized bits about Henrietta and her family interesting and well written. I also found she showed a lot of respect to the Lackses in the way she explained things in an objective and non-judging manner. This book definitely put the human dimension back into the HeLa story.In conclusion, an amazing book to read for anyone, especially as an introduction to the non-fiction genre. Hats off Ms Skloot!"
155,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/520753-kim,3,"Henrietta Lacks was an ordinary woman and by that I mean, she grew up motherless on a tobacco farm in Virginia, made it through to the 6th grade before quitting to help man the fields, then married her first cousin, birthed 5 children, the first at 14, and moved to a town that no longer even EXISTS (how does that happen?).Her cousin/husband liked to drink and bring home ‘itching’ diseases that Henrietta had to go and get penicillin shots or be treated with ‘heavy metals’ to remove the ‘bad blood’. She had to commit her oldest daughter to the Hospital for the Negro Insane and at the age of 31 died of ‘uremic poisoning’  “The official cause of Henrietta’s death was terminal uremia: blood poisoning from the buildup of toxins normally flushed out of the body in urine. The tumors had completely blocked her urethra, leaving her doctors unable to pass a catheter into her bladder to empty it. Tumors the size of baseballs had nearly replaced her kidneys, bladder, ovaries, and uterus. And her other organs were so covered in small white tumors it looked as if someone had filled her with pearls.” You know… ordinary. Her story was one of millions of stories that still continue today, overworked, under appreciated, dedicated beings who got the wrong lot in life. We don’t really hear about these stories unless we seek them out. And it was no different for Henrietta, except that her cells, the HeLa cells, became famous for helping cure polio, or test the effects of radiation during cancer research, or AIDS, or gene mapping. Henrietta is buried in an unmarked grave alongside the tobacco farm that she worked on in Clover Virginia.What I found most interesting about this account of Henrietta and her family’s life is how arcane some of the treatments were, granted this is 1951, but:“The morning of Henrietta’s first treatment, a taxi driver picked up a doctor’s bag filled with thin glass tubes of radium from the clinic across town. The tubes were tucked into individual slots inside small canvas pouches (plaques) hand-sewn by a local Baltimore woman. .. With Henrietta unconscious on the operating table in the center of the room, her feet in stirrups, the surgeon on duty, Dr. Lawrence Wharton Jr., sat on a stool between her legs. He peered inside Henrietta, dilated her cervix and prepared to treat her tumor. But first—though no one had told Henrietta that TeLinde was collecting samples or asked if she wanted to be a donor---Wharton picked up a sharp knife and shaved two dime0sized pieces of tissue from Henrietta’s cervix: one from her tumor and one from the healthy cervical tissue nearby. The he placed the samples in a glass dish. Wharton slipped a tube filled with radium inside Henrietta’s cervix, and sewed it in place. He sewed a plaque filled with radium to the outer surface of her cervix and packed another plaque against it. He slid several rolls of gauze inside her vagina to help keep the radium in place, then threaded a catheter into her bladder so she could urinate without disturbing the treatment. “Holy hell. I won’t complain at my next pap smear. Then learning of some of the experiments done on patients without their consent/knowledge. “The Tuskegee syphilis experiment being one of them “was an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service to study the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in Alabama. They were told that they were receiving free health care from the U.S. government. The Public Health Service started working on this study in 1932 during the Great Depression, in collaboration with the Tuskegee Institute, a historically black college in Alabama. Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 600 impoverished sharecroppers from Macon County, Alabama. Of these men, 399 had previously contracted syphilis before the study began, and 201 did not have the disease. The men were given free medical care, meals, and free burial insurance for participating in the study. None of the men infected was ever told he had the disease, nor was any treated for it with penicillin after this antibiotic became proven for treatment. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the men were told they were being treated for ""bad blood"", a local term for various illnesses that include syphilis, anemia, and fatigue.”I don’t even want to get into Nuremberg or studies done on patients in asylums… my god. Give me those rose colored glasses, pronto. Yes, it is wrong of me to want to be oblivious, I, unfortunately, am AWARE of that. But this book throws a lot at you: Poverty, consent, experiments, trials, clinical reasoning, greed, exploitation, mass media hysteria, mad scientists, inequality, and how downright unfair life can be. I am glad that Rebecca Skloot wrote this book and I am glad that she got to know the Lacks’ family, treating them like real people, not petri dishes. The consent issue is one that I can’t reason with. I’m torn. I get it and I don’t. But, what I didn’t like was the cockiness of some of the doctors, granted this might be taken out of context, well… if it can be:“The dean of Stanford University School of Medicine told a reporter that as long as researchers disclosed their financial interests, patients shouldn’t object to the use of their tissues. “If you did, “ he said, “I guess you could sit there with your ruptured appendix and negotiate.”I know it is meant to be horrifying, another media hysteria thing, but Christ.  I really don’t know where I stand with this book, but it left me a bit shocked and a lot discouraged."

157,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19390520-lisa,5,"I won't add much to what's already been said about this book. I will admit to being overwhelmingly intimidated to read such a painfully grim and oftentimes difficult biography of another poor black person exploited by the medical industry.

I had a different take on the story than what I've read. I kept thinking what a terrible legacy that slavery had left the black culture even into the 1950s. Intermarriage with cousins & promiscuous sexual activity resulted in many physical & mental problems. At least in the 1950s there was a strong sense of family. However, I think that may have resulted from the rural origins of the Lacks family. While today we lament how Henrietta & later, her family were treated, we shouldn't judge what was done by today's standards. As Deborah said, ""Like I'm always telling my brothers, if you gonna go into history, you can't do it with a hate attitude. You got to remember, times was different."" p 276 What happened was ""In keeping with almost universally accepted practice at the time. . ."" p225 Understandably, the family thought they were exploited because some people/companies did get money from the HeLa cells. But Dr Gey and the original scientists didn't. Also, because of the lack of basic education, the family couldn't understand exactly what contribution was made to science that benefited millions of people. And it took Skloot to finally help them understand. Another point that Skloot points out in her afterward is that even today legislation hasn't kept up with science. I rated the book high because while reading it and even afterward, I think about the story, the family & the result of one patient's experience. I was moved by the family of Henrietta Lacks. My heart went out to them & I'm glad it seems they got some peace as a result of Skloot's effort."

Sometimes one family member will live out the family's neurosis. Of Henerietta's children, Deborah lived out the stress and depression and isolation. The rest of the family had problems likely related to their mother's early death. Deborah just had it the worst of the surviving children by the time Rebecca Skloot, an independent researcher, met Deborah decades later. Wih the kind support of Rebecca Skloot, Deborah was able to find answers to questions, The answers were not always the ones hoped for.Beyond the difficulties of the Lacks family, Skloot found out how Henrietta's cells found their way into medical research--how cells are too often find their way into research--without knowledge of the patient. When I sign release paperwork, I am often unwittingly giving permission to my doctors and labs and hospital to use my cells for research. I am not sure how I feel about that bit of information. While I tend toward generosity, I also have some reservations. So many of us who have or have in the family diabetes, high blood pressure, and cancer have benefitted from Henrietta's cells. A visual depiction of alleles (?) shows how other cells can be better. Maybe Henrietta's cancer can rest soon."

Skloot recounts the history and impact of of the HeLa cells - cancerous cells that have continued to grow and thrive long after the death of Henrietta Lacks. The book recounts the story Henrietta (her life and death), what happened afterwards to her family/children (and Skloot's interaction with them), and how these ""immortal"" cells have changed the course of medicine and scientific discovery. While this was a solid read, at times I found it a little too ""human interest"" in style. I wanted to learn more about the specific scientific discoveries that came from these cells or the bioethics of taking cells without permission. When the book focuses on these things, it is really strong and interesting. Skoots, however, spends the second half focused fairly squarely on Henrietta's children, particularly Deborah. Arguably this another strong aspect of the book, but it doesn't always square well with the more scientific portions. The Lacks family offers an interesting look into intergenerational poverty and family dynamics. It does not, however, always flow easily back and forth. Overall, an enjoyable read. "

But when my wife brought it home as part of a book club reading, and said she enjoyed it, I figured it was time to take it in.Overall, Skloot is a pretty good storyteller, and this is a pretty interesting subject. The importance of the ethical implications of biomedical testing and ownership of cells is brought to the fore in this story of a woman whose family is still haunted, nearly 60 years later, by what was done to this matriarch by the medical establishment. The story does bog down a bit in places, feeling rather repetitious - I feel like some judicious editing might have made the overall book a little more appealing to mass audiences. But I can see why the family of Mrs. Lacks would want the story told just as it is. Overall, this is definitely worth a read. "

And I'm so glad I did. While the subject matter is difficult, the writing is wonderful and engaging. Half the book is medical history - the story of Henrietta Lacks' cancer and how HeLa cells were used to discover a bunch of vaccines and cures - and the other half is the story of Henrietta Lacks' family and how much they struggled after her death. There's a lot of discussion of the legality of medical specimens, and the atrocities that African American people had to deal with in order to get medical care in the mid-20th century. Basically, it gave me a lot of feelings that I wasn't expecting, and I was totally fascinated throughout. "

Others have summarized the story line and I won't repeat it.

We must not see any person as an abstraction.Instead, we must see in every person a universe with its own secrets, with its own treasures, with its own sources of anguish, and with some measure of triumph. —ELIE WIESEL

Is it bad that I have no idea how to feel about this novel? Everybody around me has loved it, and well...I loved parts of it.Honestly, my biggest complaint was the author's many off-putting choices. I hated the way she inserted herself into the story. I hated the way she portrayed the Lacks family. I hated the way she bullied them for months...and then years...to get interviews, yet somehow considers her integrity above that of other journalists. And finally, I hated the way she became just another writer profiting from this family's heartache and confusion. Sorry, friends...setting up a scholarship fund just isn't enough, in my opinion. Other random points which bothered me--the fact that anyone can store my tissue or blood and use it for their own monetary gain, without my consent. That is wrong on so many levels, and I frankly don't care what the courts say. I was an operating room registered nurse. I took specimens to the lab daily--everything from tumors to fetal remains to excised limbs. I was always under the impression that after they'd been tested/biopsied, they were incinerated. That doesn't appear to be the case, and I find it quite disturbing. It's theft, plain and simple. If somebody comes into my house and steals a TV I no longer use, does that make it any less mine? Any less a crime? And if the thief were caught, wouldn't some time spent behind bars be in his future? It's my opinion that the same holds true for tissue and blood samples, particularly so. Just because I'm no longer ""using them,"" they're still very much mine. This is why I believe that, at the very least, the Lacks family should be receiving a percentage of HeLa all sales. Unlike most folks, I don't consider vaccines to be overly beneficial. In fact, in my experience, they're quite injurious. Otherwise, I do appreciate all the other advancements the HeLa cells have helped scientists accomplish. I just can't help but feel it's all tarnished by the despicable, underhanded methods used to obtain those cells in the first place...and by the way her family was left completely in the dark. To me, the most interesting sections of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks were those regarding Henrietta and her family. The scientific side was, for the most part, nothing new to me. Henrietta's family, however, was beyond interesting. I can't help but wonder how they viewed Ms. Skloot's descriptions of them, however, as most were made to look downright loony. I just realized today...this novel was the basis for a film, starring Oprah Winfrey as Deborah Lacks. I'm very interested in watching. If any of you have already viewed the film (and I'm certain many of you have...I'm very late to the party), please leave your thoughts in the comments below. Bottom line, the telling of Henrietta's story was long overdue, I just wish Rebecca Skloot had handled it all a little differently."
168,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,4,"Our science teachers do a remarkable job with what limited resources, time, and support they have in school today. However, one of the many areas in which public science education could be improved is the way in which we examine the hidden systems that power science itself, and the way these systems intersect with our society. Cell lines are a great example of this. We learn about biomedical research in school, about cells, about vaccines—but the actual processes and procedures behind this research and this science are often opaque to us. No one ever told me that laboratories around the world are using cells descended from a sample taken from Henrietta Lacks, a Black woman living in Baltimore, Maryland. And even when it does get mentioned, it’s often mentioned as an isolated anecdote, a “by the way, did you know…” type factoid rather than the opening of a much larger, deeper conversation on race and ethics and consent in the shadow of capitalism.There’s just so much to talk about here, and Skloot does an excellent job unearthing details and presenting the story in a precise, scientific, and human way. This is the type of journalism I like to read.Basically, there are two stories here. The first is the story of how Henrietta Lacks’ cells became the HeLa cell line used the world over. The second is the story of the Lacks family today and Skloot’s role in untangling the facts in Henrietta’s story. Ordinarily, when it comes to science history books, I’m not enthusiastic about the author inserting themselves into the narrative. I’m not here for “Rebecca Skloot, Super Sleuth”. In this particular case, however, I understand why Skloot feels the need to document how she went about this process.At the surface level, of course, there is just fascinating biology here. Take some cells. Try to grow them in culture. It doesn’t work. Why doesn’t it work? Hell if we know. Maybe it’s impossible. Take some more cells. They’re cancerous. Wait, they’re growing. They’re growing a lot. Well, fuck. We seem to have an immortal cell line on our hands.In this respect, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks chronicles the development of our understanding of cells in the twentieth century. It reminds us that science is this bizarre mix of years upon years of dedication and effort along with a whole lot of luck. Despite Skloot’s focus on Dr. George Gey as the discoverer/incubator of the HeLa cell line, she also makes it clear that even back then, science had already become a massive group undertaking. Were it not for George’s wife Margaret and Mary Kubicek and doubtless many other graduate students unnamed, there wouldn’t be a HeLa cell line as we know it. And of course, without Henrietta Lacks, none of this would have happened at all. Science is a collaborative endeavour—yet not everyone has equal awareness of their contribution, as Skloot points out.This is the second layer to the book. Dig deeper, and we find that there is more going on here than just a story of awesome scientific discovery. Science is not neutral and is not objective because it is done by humans within our messy, biased society. Henrietta Lacks’ experience at Johns Hopkins exists within the context of a wider, white supremacist approach to science and medicine. We can argue whether or not individual people’s actions with Henrietta involved racism, but the fact remains that the Tuskegee experiments were happening contemporaneously. Medical research institutions in the United States, with the backing of the US government, valued Black lives less. Black people (and Indigenous people) have always been granted less, if any, bodily autonomy, particularly around areas like fertility. So it is striking, this fact that science owes this huge debt to a Black woman whose cervical cancer cells were used and grown without her knowledge or consent.I think it’s really important that our science histories do not separate these questions of ethics from our retellings of great discoveries.Then we come to the final layer, the framing narrative of Skloot becoming fascinated with Henrietta Lacks, deciding to write this book, and spending years tracking down Henrietta’s family, earning their trust, and doing research. This is probably the part of the book that is most questionable in terms of whether or not you’re going to enjoy it. Skloot herself acknowledges there is something uncomfortable about a white woman rocking up to write about a Black woman’s experiences at the hands of white doctors—yet that acknowledgement does not in and of itself dispel such discomfort. This is a distinctly different phenomenon from someone like Margot Shetterly writing about Black computers at NACA/NASA. I can’t help but wonder what this book could have been if a Black woman had written about Henrietta Lacks. And this is not to diminish Skloot’s work here—because it is fine work—but to point out the inherent irony of privilege that means she is the one to be telling Henrietta’s story.It’s just messed up. Skloot shows us this impoverished, ignored part of the United States, and there are so many moments in this book that might break your heart. And that’s what a good book on science journalism should do. It shouldn’t be a dry rendition of the facts: it should make you feel for the humans whose stories are inextricably tied up to the science.I like that Skloot presents the words of Deborah and the other Lackses as verbatim as possible, including their vernacular. One of the more chilling aspects of this book is how it’s clear that many of the people Skloot interviews have a very poor or basic understanding of biology and medicine. This is not their fault. This is the failure of the American education system. As someone privileged enough to have access to a fairly good education, it’s easy for me to forget that not everyone is so lucky. Would I understand everything a doctor said to me as they requested my consent to use my tissue samples? Probably not. But I would understand a lot more than Henrietta or any of her children would. And that’s sad and racist and unethical, and we need to do better. We don’t just need better ethics in science; we need better education. To that end, I think it’s interesting and laudable that Skloot helped found The Henrietta Lacks Foundation precisely to help fund the education of people who are related to people like Henrietta Lacks.I highly recommend pairing The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks with 
The Vaccine Race: Science, Politics, and the Human Cost of Defeating Disease
. It covers similar topics, focusing more on vaccination, and features the life of Leonard Hayflick (who also shows up in this book). These are the science books we need in our lives.

169,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4096615-cam,5,"HeLa is an immortal cell line used in scientific research. It is the oldest and most commonly used human cell line. The line was derived from cervical cancer cells taken on February 8, 1951 from Henrietta Lacks, a patient who died of cancer on October 4, 1951. The cell line was found to be remarkably durable. The cells from Lacks's cancerous cervical tumor were taken without her knowledge. HeLa', the first two letters of the patient's first and last name; this became the name of the cell line. (Which originally her name was never known or was she credited because she was black). These were the first human cells grown in a lab that were naturally ""immortal"", meaning that they do not die. The hospitals were able to successfully grow polio virus, enabling the development of a vaccine,and by 1952, developed a vaccine for polio using these cells.To test Salk's new vaccine, the cells were put into mass production in the first-ever cell production factory.Since the cells' first mass replications, they have been used by scientists in various types of investigations including disease research, gene mapping, effects of toxic substances on organisms, and radiation on humans. Additionally, HeLa cells have been used to test human sensitivity to tape, glue, cosmetics, and many other products.Scientists have grown an estimated 50 million metric tons of HeLa cells,and there are almost 11,000 patents involving these cells.It is well known that minorities have been used as Guinea pigs. Example being The Tuskegee Experiments, where a lot of blacks where injected with std’s without there knowledge. Turned away for healthcare, had to travel long distances to still be treated other then human due to segregation. Lacks was experimented on and cells were taken from her body and used to profit others without her knowledge or permission. No one in here family have profited from this. "
170,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9873945-laura,5,"This is a wonderful story that certainly needed to be told. Kudos to Rebecca Skloot for sticking with the story (for 10 years) and finally publishing to make the world aware of all that is owed to Henrietta Lacks and her family. The scientific discoveries, as a result of her multiplying cells, are vast already and no doubt there will be many more to come in the future.There's quite a bit of scientific language in this story but the author does very well at dumbing it down for the average person. Including stories about Henrietta's family really provides the reader the ability to comprehend that she was indeed a real person."
171,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/674427-cara-putman,5,"I really enjoyed the audiobook. I’ve heard about the story, but so glad I made the time to dig in. Well told story. "
172,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6970638-sheri,5,"This is the 2nd non-fiction book I've read and enjoyed this month (the 1st being Devil in the White City). I have learned a ton. I was not familiar with any of the cell research described in this book and loved learning about the huge impact Hela has had on medical research. From polio and HPV vaccines to the development of the human genome project Hela has proven to be one of the most useful lab tools this century.However, I was surprised on a few accounts by the perspective of this book. First, Skloot doesn't really have a scoop. As far as I can tell, she doesn't really uncover any new info. Certainly I have not seen the BBC documentary, but from how she describes it (and the family's reaction) she really hasn't done anything new with this book. Second (and related) the only semi-tangible scoop I can come up with is that she presents the family's perspective. This she does well; however she does not really present them in a positive light. She is very sympathetic and certainly her leanings and biases are in favor of Deborah and the family. It definitely comes across that Skloot is representing them accurately, but they are far from appealing. The family comes across as not only uneducated and poor (both features that were thrust upon them at birth), but uninterested (even poor people can be curious and search things out on the their own), useless (lots and lots of theives and addicts), disgusting (are any of them not disease-ridden and grossly overweight?), and generally not sympathetic in any way. Skloot's slant is definitely that the Lackses should have been treated better along the way and should get some sort of compensation. The sole exception seems to be Deborah who is not interested in monetary gain and does make several attempts to understand the science surrounding the Hela cell line and even considers going back to school.I'm not convinced. I am glad to hear about the changes in informed consent and IRB policies (as a former grad student researcher I am very familiar with IRB procedures in a university setting) and the development of laws protecting patient's confidentiality. I completely agree that Henrietta should have been asked to donate her cells and that her medical records should have been kept confidential. However, given the descriptions of her as a person, I can only imagine that she would have agreed to allow them to study her cells. As for the rest of the family, I don't think that their consent was necessary. At this point in time, I think they spend a lot of time whining about how they have not been compensated instead of just moving on. After all, the scientists who have made the discoveries (unlike the Golde vs. Moore case in which Golde simply patented his patient's cells, which I think was wrong) spent their lives conducting their research.While reading, I frequently wondered about how Skloot could justify the profits that her bestselling novel would make her when the Lacks family was so impoverished (especially given the slant of her novel and her open criticism of the profits made and kept from the Hela line) and so I was happy to see that she established the henriettalacksfoundation.org with some of the book's profits.Overall, HeLa has become remarkably important to the medical field, but if they had not used Henrietta's cells to begin the line, someone else along the way would have provided cancerous cells that were also infected with HPV and became so easy to grow.Another random thought as an aside: Skloot briefly touches on the life and institutionalization of Henrietta's eldest daughter, Elsie. The few things that Skloot and Deborah uncover about Elsie's life are very disturbing and allow the reader to surmise just how terribly she was treated. However, I was upset to see that Skloot just writes it off as another episode of racism. I've done other reading on mental institutions (especially from the 1950s) and there is lots of evidence that all mentally handicapped people were treated inhumanely, regardless of race.Ultimately I gave the book 5 stars because it is very readable, informative, and provided great dinner conversation between my husband and kids and myself as we discussed the scientific discoveries and the ethical questions surrounding this topic."
173,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12839345-kym-moore,5,"This real-life story, as emotionally painful as it is, reads like a novel. It really makes you reflect on and examine the medical and ethical questions of the disruption between the practices of the science industry in relation to patient care and permissions they should be advised of with cell and tissue sampling.Who was Henrietta Lacks and how did her cells change the trajectory of a medical revolution in a multimillion-dollar industry that left her family completely in the dark? This book exposes several of the reasons why so many people do not trust doctors and the invasive procedures doctors may recommend. This distrust comes from genetic discrimination, racial discrimination, and even economic discrimination, where the poor are often ""mistreated"" or not ""treated"" at all simply because they are poor.Sadly, I did not know about Henrietta Lacks or her famous immortal ""HeLa"" cells, and neither did I know about how critical and powerful her cells were to research in so many areas, including space. Quite honestly, it wasn't until I watched the HBO movie where Oprah Winfrey depicted Deborah Lacks in 2017 that made me aware of the woman behind the HeLa cells.Rebecca Skloot did an amazing job with her years of painstaking research to get down to the bottom of who Henrietta Lacks was, giving her a voice and exposing her humanness within the pages of this book. It gives a face and story to her family as well, who were left in the dark, regarding a mother/sister/wife who was called in some reports Helen Lane. You couldn't help but feel compassionate and almost apologetic about why they were angered and felt such medical injustice and inhumane treatment they experienced. Such a grave injustice was done to the family on so many ethical levels leaving so many legitimate questions gone unanswered.As Skloot notes according to her research:- Without commercialization, companies wouldn't make the drugs and diagnostic tests so many of us depend on. The question is how to deal with this commercialization. It's illegal to sell human organs and tissues for transplants or medical treatments, but it's perfectly legal to give them away while charging fees for collecting and processing them.I truly understand the depth of their anger because I would feel the same way too. Henrietta's children felt their mother was treated like a thing instead of someone whose cells clearly contributed to some amazing discoveries in science and medicine on so many levels. It's inconceivable to me to comprehend how pharmaceutical companies and other medical entities can capitalize immensely on monetizing other people's cells and tissues without the donor/patient being able to afford the type of healthcare they need.This is one good in-depth read that I highly recommend."
174,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1132408-meg---a-bookish-affair,5,"I had heard a ton of really good things about this book but just hadn't gotten around to reading it yet so I was very excited when my book club picked to read the book. I ended up having to buy a copy (my book club is usually pretty good about picking books that are already at the library to lessen the burden on us) because there was still a crazy long wait list at the library and the book is already almost two years old! I always get excited about books that have been out for awhile but still have a long wait to read. I was entranced with this book. A decade in the making, Skloot explores the legacy of Henrietta Lacks, a little known woman, whose cells have helped scientists do really amazing things. Her cells have been launched into space. They've helped to make vaccines. They've been tested on by many different people and until this book, many people didn't really even know the name of the woman that the cells came from. All this from someone's cells being taken without her knowing. Although the idea of having one's cells taken without their knowledge does bring up sort of a ethical dilemma, that is not really the crux of the book. Skloot does present the dilemma but this is really more of a human story. It would have been nice to get a little more information on the dilemma though.Admittedly, I'm not a science person. I'm fascinated by science but I'll put it this way, I hated sitting in my high school and college science classes. Obviously the subject matter of the book is science-y but Skloot does a great job of making the science-y parts of the book accessible to all. The real story at the heart of this book is the story of Lacks' family finding out all of the things that Henrietta's cells have done. Really amazing!Bottom line: I know some of you are afraid of non-fiction books but this one is really wonderful and I hope that you will give it a try!"
175,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/124482-alison,5,"I loved this book!In the past week I have recommended this book or brought it up in conversation at least a half a dozen times. My father-in-law is now reading it, and he loves it too. Thank you, Shelia.Awesome things about this book:1. It's true, but it doesn't feel like it could possibly be so. Sometimes it feels like the plot of a black-and-white science fiction movie.2. The author took ten years of her life to research and write this book, and every fact, every conversation feels entirely true and accurate. The author's journey to tell this story is inspiring and impressive.3. Hela cells are amazing! Biology can be fun and so much easier to comprehend than one might ever imagine.4. It's so interesting how medical ethics have changed through the years. As science intensifies and evolves, so do the ethics surrounding it. Informed consent, the privacy of medical records, what is or isn't ethical to do in the name of scientific progress and medical discovery...a fascinating and TIMELY journey.5. It's important to realize how culture has shifted regarding racial equality in the past 80 years in America. It's important to understand how it was vs. how it is today, and to visualize how it should and can be.I file this one alongside Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption under: Required reading for everyone."
176,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5122457-caylee,2,"Okay, so consider this a two part rating - for the content on the history of the HeLa cell line, backstory about Henrietta's life, and a bit of the history of the exploitation of African Americans by medical researchers I would give this book four stars.For the rest of the book, which is outlining Skloot's journey in interviewing the Lacks family and finding out these details, I give it one star. A lot of the writing in these parts of the book is fairly self-indulgent, though that's not the biggest problem. I think the real issue is the shady racial undertones. She talks repeatedly about how scary it is to go into poor, predominantly African American, neighborhoods. She describes the Lacks family in very childlike terms, making them feel like they had little agency or intelligence of their own. One of the most disrespectful moments, to me, was in an interaction with Deborah where she is told not to include something in her book. I'd just like to point out that even though Skloot doesn't tell us what she wasn't supposed to include, she did take the time to point out that there was a secret in the first place. In short, a good third of the book feels like one long whine on how hard it is to be a white person interacting with people of color. Am I saying Skloot is a raving racist? No, but I think she was letting her privilege hang out in really inappropriate ways."
177,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/706193-katie,2,"I kind of hate to say it, but I found this book kind of boring. The parts about the science were interesting, but I had a complete lack of interest in Henrietta Lacks' life and the lives of her descendants. I think it's because this is a story about her cells and not her (she didn't actually do anything, science-wise, besides being unfortunately afflicted with cancer) and therefore why would I want to read all these details about a random person's life. It's like someone reading a big, long, detailed book about MY life, to which I say, that would not be interesting to pretty much anyone.Having said that, the science parts were somewhat interesting, especially all the debates over scientific ethics, and hearing all about how things changed in this arena since the 1950s. For example, it was interesting to note that Henrietta's personal medical records and genetic information was all published without anybody's consent, way back in the days before HIPAA. So it was a useful story of how we got from there to here, medical-ethics-wise. It was also interesting that the book pointed out other similar cases, where people with unique/useful genetic makeup or otherwise special or unique body tissue were treated in a range of ways, from honestly leveled-with to totally exploited by medical professionals. "
178,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12523810-alexa,5,"Starts off as a look at the specific case of Henrietta Lacks, a black woman whose cancerous cells became HeLa, the first immortal cell line. The author does a three and a half star job explaining the personal, scientific and societal aspect of how HeLa came to be. But then the book becomes something very different, an in-depth look at how the Lacks family went on after HeLa, at first without knowing at all and then unable to escape its legacy. You can tell that the author meant to write the first half and the second half came to her, and I feel very impressed that she chose to write about the family with such detail and respect even though their only ""claim to fame"" is their oblique relation to Henrietta's unusual contribution to science. To me, that makes the book much better than if she'd tried to maintain false distance from the less famous Lackses, She treats them with the dignity that was so lacking in how HeLa came to be, and you can really feel that in the writing. The afterward is an interesting look at tissue rights that is only as effective as it is in relation to booth halves do the book. I came away feeling both educated and moved, and while it may not be for everyone I personally found it to be fascinating."

""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" dealt with the 'shady'/unethical practices of how John Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland stole while harvested the 'immortal' cells of Henrietta Lacks without her or her family's consent.The year was 1951 when colored woman, Loretta Pleasant aka Henrietta Lacks was diagnosed with cervical cancer, treated and died on October 4th yet her durable and immortal cells: HeLa cells relentlessly thrived secretly due to Dr. Gey unprincipled medical practices. This is a must read for all readers interested in how Lacks' cells have been used to save lives from diseases ranging from Jonas Salk's Polio vaccine, cancers, HIV/AID, and even man's space frontiers as well as developing various anti-tumor medicines. Truly an amazing scientific story that makes you question how far doctors have gone to make a name for their scientific professions using unethical and unscrupulous practices.5+++ stars"
180,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/642041-sarah,5,"I've read a lot of panicked blogs lately by authors who feel that the novel is dead and non-fiction is a far more vital form. While I don't agree with that statement, this book would certainly be an argument for it. In the acknowledgements, the author thanks a bookstore owner who brought her novels with non-linear structures as she tried to figure out how to structure her own book; I think it's telling that she would look to fiction to construct her narrative. While the chapters about medical ethics are fascinating, it is the travails of Henrietta Lacks' family members that make the book so captivating. Henrietta Lacks, the woman whose cells are still dividing under microscopes across the globe, finally has a eulogy to go with her name. Hopefully this book makes up for some of the wrongs done to her family. "

It's a fascinating story weaving so many different skeins, as it veers between Henrietta's story, the work of the scientists studying her cells, the fate of Henrietta's family, and the author herself. A secondary mystery in the book concerns Henrietta's oldest daughter... what was wrong with her and what happened to her? When you find out, it's devastating emotionally - and also a damning indictment of the institutions that treated poor black people as subhuman.This book blew my mind. It also kind of broke my heart.

Skloot has done amazing research: 20+ page bibliography, 10 pages of acknowledgments, but the book suffers from trying to do too much. It is a profile of Henrietta Lacks, whose cancer cells were the first to survive outside the body and have been used by many thousands of research scientists for 60+ years, and her surviving family. It also takes a look at the moral and ethical issues around using human tissue, and the controversy about Henrietta's cancer cells, including how big pharma can profit while her family lives in relative poverty. I felt the 2-3 story lines were incongruous, making the book disjointed."
183,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1105306-lois,0,I've been sick and not keeping up with books online and listened to this during that period.I initially didn't add a review because I have such mixed feelings about this book.The research is impeccable and I appreciate the access to this story. At the same time I feel uncomfortable in a way with how the author handled her interactions with the family. They rubbed me the wrong way. I've since done some research and found perhaps the author did cross the line a bit with the family.That leaves me feeling differently about the book as a whole. Important information gained in a manner not handled as respectfully by the author as it should've been?

I think my experience at Goodreads has broadened me, into picking things up that I might not have - and non-fiction is never an easy choice for me. This book satisfies three challenges for me this month, but it was also just enjoyable to read. I really loved, as how Deborah/Dale was searching for how to narrate her experience, the answer really became quite spiritual and pure for her. It was beautiful to see that play out - and through the siblings and narrator as well. It was well done. Speaking of spiritual, now starting the God of Small Things."

Makes you question science and doctors and think about how rough others have it and how primitive health care used to be. Some of the experiments that were done are cringe worthy.

194,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20048682-karin,3,"3.5 starsNB Don't be fooled by my rating, this is an important book with a story that needed to be told, but I wasn't impressed by the actual writing. How much of this was the result of reading many rave reviews and expecting too much is difficult to say, but even without the hype, this wouldn't have had 5 stars from me.First off, THANK YOU to Henrietta Lacks' family and Rebecca Skloot for how we now have so much of this story, the good, the bad (the maybe) and the ugly. (but not nearly everything as you need to read the book to get much, much more!)Regarding the use of HeLa cells and cells in general:The ugly--the entire lack of ethics involved in American (and probably most of the world) medical and scientific research. True--African Americans have been mistreated for many, many years in this. Also true--they were taking samples from people of all races without permission, but Henrietta's were the first to work. But don't think that you get permission for your cells to be used for research today--once a body part or biopsy as been done, that is no longer legally yours. That said, if your body is to be used for scientific research, your permission is required.The bad--Henrietta's family was kept in the dark even after they started trying to get answers once they realized something was going on. (the maybe) - George Gey, who first took the cells without permission, as was commonly done, was doing it for altruistic purposes and freely gave the cells to other. You have to read the book to find out more.The good-- millions of lives have been saved as a result of research on HeLa, not to mention the many, many children who no longer become paralyzed from polio.Should you read this book? I think so."
195,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23954351-rod-brown,2,"This book makes me a bit grumbly. After a decent start recounting the life of Henrietta Lacks and the genesis of the HeLa cell line, I got bogged down in the middle section as it seemed to jump around a bit too much introducing a cast of thousands of scientists and Lacks. Then the third section seemed to be an entirely different book as the author ditched all pretense at objectivity and embedded herself into the Lacks family and their story.Having raised so many issues about ethics and remuneration for the Lacks family due to the profits so many have made from Henrietta's cell sample, Skloot seemed to turn the corner herself into exploitation as she fully inserted herself into the narrative. Much like tissue culture research, Skloot isn't legally obliged to pay the Lacks family a cent for their story. But once she mentions a scholarship fund she is setting up for the Lacks children's education, her book becomes part of the ethical quagmire she has been outlining for over 300 pages. She doesn't really mention what percentage of the book's earnings she is contributing to that fund, but I start thinking what would be ethical or fair or reasonable: 1%, 10%, 40%, more? How does one arbitrarily slap a number on something like this?In the end, this book is frustrating because it puts us in that gray area of what is ethical, what is legal, what is good for humanity as a whole, and what our gut tells us is fair for the individuals involved. There is no good answer to be had here, leaving me unsatisfied to the extreme."
196,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58077441-lucia-davis,5,"There are several storylines in this book, making it quite complex to write an encompassing review. This review will therefore most likely not do the book justice. That said, I thought it was a remarkably well written, easy to follow along book. The science was well explained and wasn’t too complicated. For a non-fiction book, it had me go through a whole range of emotions I had not anticipated. The book tells the story of Henrietta Lacks, from whom the HeLa cells were obtained, and of Henrietta’s family. It’s a story of recognition, told with grace; a story both sad and uplifting. Rebecca Skloot puts it all into context, explaining the prevailing convictions during Henrietta’s lifetime, while not shunning the ugliness of racial injustice. She describes the many shameful practices carried out for the sake of medical research, but also how much knowledge we gained by using them. Not infrequently, I’d come across a paragraph that forced me to stop reading and take a few deep breaths, before I could continue. Eye-opening. Highly recommended."
197,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35645863-lena,5,"Rebecca Skloot has set a new standard for evenhanded reporting, science journalism, and entertainment. Her decade of dedication, and gift of storytelling, has brought the story of Henrietta Lacks into the zeitgeist."
198,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2685851-sarah,4,"An interesting and a heartbreaking read. You get a bit of medical history, a family history, and a journalist's pursuit. the medical part was fascinating and it was easy to understand which is an A+.the family history was horrifying and just gut wrenching; the part about the asylum was so disturbing I had to take a break from reading it. an A+ to this part too.the Journalist part was good, a bit dull at some points but it helped in connecting the previous parts together. a B+ goes to this part. In short I'm glad I picked this one up, and I was surprised that I never gave it a glance before since the book has been going around for a long time in our bookstores. I guess it choose its own time to be read ~"
199,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2832635-cornerofmadness,4,"Upon reading this book I felt cheated, not by this book but by all the science books I’ve read before it. I earned my first three science degrees (including my medical degree) in the late 1980’s early 1990’s, and at that point women’s contributions to science were barely acknowledged, regardless of race. I’m convinced the only reason we learned of Madam Curie was she won the Nobel Prize and couldn’t be ignored. I never heard of Rosalind Franklin and her contribution to DNA studies until an injury-forced career change took me back in pursuit of another science degree. I’m working up two new anatomy classes both of which have chapters on genetics and there is still not one mention of Hela or Henrietta (though there will be in my own notes).I’m not including the tooting of my own horn here just to brag but rather to point out my own background in science is extensive and to illustrate just how ignore Henrietta Lacks’s unknowing contribution to science still is so I am very glad to have this book (which will be going on the suggested reading list for my classes). To begin with I think Ms Skloot manages a difficult task, making non-fiction as easy to read and as compelling as fiction (Personally I often find non-fiction to be almost like work in reading it, too dry). Her passion for this story comes through so strongly and her care and concern for the Lackses is touching. She had more patience than most people would have and I commend her for it.She deftly weaves Henrietta and the family’s past in with the modern day search to bring the truth to the surface. Henrietta had a hard short life and the sad reality was in 1950’s America people of African descent had every reason to fear hospitals. Any number of studies was undertaken then that today are horrifying to the point many of my students can’t even believe that it happened when I tell them about things like the Tuskegee experiments. I know from personal experience with patients that would have been Henrietta’s contemporaries that no one, regardless of race, questioned doctors back then. None of the family would have known that her cells had been harvested and that is true today (points to the afterward, most people don’t realize that biological tissues are often used for study rather than destroyed. My surgery last month was purposely done at a teaching hospital so that both the surgery and the tissues taken could be used for research but there were no consent forms for that purpose as they’re still debating the pros and cons of such a thing).However, this, along with fears that their mother was purposely allowed to die, tainted several generations of the Lacks family. Ms Skloot had a lot of hard work to win their trust. The inarguable thing about the whole story is though, how revolutionizing Henrietta’s cancerous cervical cells really were. They were so successful in living in culture that they are still here today decades after Henrietta’s death. This immortality of her cells allowed for an incredible amount of research done, vaccinations, the effects of space travel and so much more.I was stunned at how hounded for information Henrietta’s descendants were (given how little I have ever seen about HeLa cells in text books. Professional articles are a different story). At least from Ms Skloot’s telling of it, Deborah, Henrietta’s daughter, and her siblings did seem to find a measure of peace through Skloot’s investigation which is good especially in how wronged they felt (and rightfully so).I’m not sure at all how I feel about some of the questions raised about today’s medical ethics (you can not go back and apply today’s HIPPA laws and patented cells lines to the days when the cells were first harvested). I’ve volunteered for medical research (but only very occasionally, women are rarely taken as research subjects unless it’s female related). Sometimes you’re paid, sometimes not. What would happen to science if there had to be a pay out to every volunteer? It’s a question not to be taken lightly. Would it bankrupt the whole system? Or, like in the case of the Lackses who have very little, would it be fair compensation. I don’t know the answer to that. I’m not sure anyone does. I know I’ve always been bothered by funeral homes making extraordinary sums for tissue harvesting for donations while the family sees none of it. Is this any different? I guess you’ll have to read the afterward of the book and wrestle with these questions yourself. I did find it very telling as to where humans put their priorities though when the book talks about animal rights in the lab getting protected in 1909 and we didn’t even start talking about humans in the same way until 50 years later and legislation wouldn’t follow for another couple decades. Anyhow, to sum up this rambling mix of review and personal experience, go read this book. If you have any interest in science research, social injustice and medical ethics, this is an absolutely fascinating book that will amaze, frustrate and infuriate you as you go along for the ride. "
200,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2103532-reviews-may-vary,5,"I had avoided this book due to slight disinterest but knowing I was going to get mad and the injustices. It was an interesting blend of history, science, and the author's experience as she learned about HELA and Henrietta's family. "
201,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/854592-judy,5,"This is one of the best nonfiction books that I have ever read. I can't recommend it enough. Rebecca Skloot took a footnote from a basic biology book (about the origin of HeLa cells) and turned it into an investigation into the origins of the HeLa cells, the woman behind those original cells, racism, medical ethics, scientific research, and the effect of the HeLa cells on both medicine and on the Lacks family. One of the most powerful threads of the book follows the story of Henrietta Lacks, a poor, African-American woman, who died of cancer in the early 1950s. Unknown to Henrietta, doctors at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland took samples of her initial tumor and, to their surprise, those cells were the first cells to stay alive and continue to develop and divide in the lab and HeLa cells are still alive almost 60 years after Henrietta's death. Using HeLa cells, medical researchers have been able to make amazing strides in research into polio, TB, Aids, and numerous other diseases. In fact, anyone who has seen a doctor since the second half of the 20th century has been impacted by medical research based on studies using HeLa cells. But that is only part of the story. Henrietta's family was never informed by doctors at Johns Hopkins about the importance of HeLa cells in medical research and when information began to leak out about the significance of these ""immortal cells"", the family was confused, angry, and suspicious. Rebecca Skloot is able to form a relationship with the children of Henrietta Lacks, especially her daughter, Deborah, that gradually leads the family into a greater understanding and appreciation of the place that their mother holds in medical history. One of the great strengths of this book is that the reader is able to understand how the many players in this story interacted or failed to interact with each other over decades. The author also has a gift--she is able to take complex scientific issues and write about them in a way that allows readers to understand the basic scientific principles involved. I only wish that someone like Rebecca Skloot taught some of the science classes that I have taken in the past. Finally, this book raises some important issues about medical ethics in America. Many readers will be struck by the fact that while valuable medical research would not have possible without HeLa cells, the fact also remains that many people have made millions of dollars from that research while the Lacks family was so poor that they were not able to afford medical insurance. Incidentally, the author has established a foundation for the benefit of Henrietta Lacks' family. This is a story that needed to be told and I am grateful that Rebecca Skloot told it. "
202,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela,4,"Fascinating and mind-blowing! The eye-opening research surrounding Henrietta Lacks, HeLa cells, genetics, patient consent, privacy rights, and research ethics is quite evident, and Skloot is to be commended. Much of the information acquired didn't come easy. Ten-years researching and writing is a long-suffering investment, especially when opening a controversial, and often volatile, Pandora’s Box. People can be quite persnickety when it comes to their families, ethnicity, colleagues, and/or field of expertise being potentially perceived in a less-than-favorable light. However, Skloot did a relatively decent job presenting the objective and subjective even-handed and with empathetic-finesse. Additionally, though some of the medical terminology was a bit over my right-brained head, I greatly appreciated the book as a whole being layman-friendly. My two negative observations: 1. The chronological presentation is considerably fractured and jumpy at times and therefore information is sometimes repetitive. 2. In the dedication, only Skloot's family/friends are given notated named-honor. I thought it a little inconsiderate, not naming the Lacks family too, and/or mentioning any financial considerations towards the family. I would like to think the Lacks grandchildren benefited in some way from their mother's non-consensual donation to all of science. Overall, a great read for fans of biographies, cultural studies, medical history, or curious-topic-nonfiction. And a must read for anyone who’s ever had their blood drawn, or had a biopsy, or a mole removed, or appendectomy, or any other ‘ectomy.’ It’ll give you much to think about before your next doctor’s visit. "
203,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,4,"Rebecca Skloot does a great job researching the material for this book--one gets the feeling she could make anything interesting. It must have been a difficult book to write because of the yawning time lag and sketchy family and town histories. But Skloot manages to make the material immediate, fresh, and personal by introducing us to the Lacks clan, and by sharing with us her route to uncovering the science that makes Henrietta Lacks immortal. The sheer doggedness of her pursuit and the art involved in making the story not only readable, but riveting, is a good match for the best of science, much of which is healthy doses of perspiration with dashes of inspiration. I am pleased to see the book reach the bestseller lists, not simply because this is a story we all need to know, but because Skloot has promised to set up a scholarship fund for the family with some proceeds from the book. That payback must come from this source is regrettable, but somehow payback seems required. Skloot tells us that people often ask if taking cells without permission is illegal either then (in the 1950s) or now (in 2010). It is not. But even asking the question makes it clear that those people have some sense that payback is required. What kind of payback is something we need to think on."
204,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11978911-plethora,5,"Fascinating story about how the smallest thing can really impact large change. HeLa cells have had and continue to have an immense impact on the medical/science field. While some might find all the details about descendants of Henrietta and how they have had their ups and downs in life I find it helps put into perspective that she wasn't (isn't) just a cell factory. The family is human and has certainly had is shares of not stellar moments, they didn't hide these for the sake of the book. Skloot's journey to find out just who Henrietta was proved to be beneficial to her loved ones, the journey and discovery was a needed quest to answer their questions and doubts. I can't begin to imagine the emotions felt as relatives read the autopsy report first published elsewhere, not knowing and going through a graphic detailed description of her body being cut open and the details of what was found inside. On the flip side you experience a bit of joy when they get over anger at John Hopkins and start to come to terms with all the discoveries pioneered by this unsung hero. The anger was long lasting for some and it has been a long slow road to open up a discussion on do we have any rights to materials one they are removed from our body."
205,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27047099-allison,5,"Can I give it 10 stars? 100? 1000?I've never been so blown away with a book. Ever. I'm going to do everything I can to recommend to every human I know that they read this. It's essential reading. It's a story, so finely researched and written, that, at its very crux, reminds us to be thankful and generous. I admire that the Lacks family has come to see the incredible good that their mother has done for the world; this is a beautiful component of a heartfelt story. I have emerged from the book enlightened in so very many ways. Every person who has ever received healthcare (which is all of us), owes Ms Henrietta Lacks. That's the bottom line.I've donated to the Henrietta Lacks Foundation and may annually. I feel a moral obligation to do so in order to thank one woman who so has been so integral to the progress of medicine -- from which I have directly benefited. I donated with a focus on the unjust and unspeakable irony that her family cannot afford their own health insurance. The foundation is set up to pay for education, medical fees and other issues relating to descendants of Henrietta Lacks, and others who qualify. "
206,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3951747-b-andherbooks,5,"I have been meaning to read this book forever, and was aghast to realize it came out in 2010. Whoops! Well, I finally took the time after it was selected for my library's Women's History Month book discussion, and I'm so glad I finally tackled it.What I liked the best was how the author put herself into the narrative, because as the book shows Henrietta's legacy is best served by showing her family, her relatives, and those that survive her.I hope the author will put out an updated edition soon because upon some further research I did find there has been a little head way since 2018, including a board being formed to decide which proposals will be allowed to use Henrietta's immortal cell line, a board that includes two members of her family. Henrietta now further immortalized in the National Portrait Gallery, painted by the amazing Kadir Nelson. "
207,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1392376-erin,5,"I honestly cannot stop thinking about this book or the Lacks family. I spent all weekend with it because I couldn't put the book down. I am fascinated that not much has changed since 1951 with the legality of abandoned tissue. Sure, now there is informed consent, but what exactly does that mean? I think while the science of the book is great, the heart of the book is the Lacks family. Henrietta's children are more interesting to me than the science. I became interested in the same questions they were asking. What Henrietta's favorite color? How much pain did she suffer? Why did no one tell them what was happening with her tissue? If she saved so many lives through her donation, why couldn't her children get access to health care?Ms. Skloot has written a powerful book and I cannot stop thinking about Henrietta and the children and grandchildren that she left behind. Everyone should read this book."
208,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5304930-mary,3,"Good book; minor flaws. Make no mistake, the subject matter is utterly intriguing and the plight of the Lacks family is sympathetic and indeed shocking. Perhaps it was the format of the book that jarred me every time I felt I was really getting into it. I felt that the story got bogged down in certain areas (particularly the legal situations) and it became somewhat repetitive. I enjoyed the back story of Henrietta’s life and the chapters interviewing her family and especially the fascinating science explained in layman’s terms. As a side note I found it off-putting that the author berates other journalists for harassing the Lacks family when she herself did the same thing – example p.228 “For nearly a year after our first conversation, Deborah refused to talk to me.” P.228 “I’d leave messages for Deborah every few days, hoping to convince her that if she talked to me, we could learn about Henrietta together”"
209,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643325-paul,4,This is an important book about an important subject. Not being of a particularly scientific bent I only had a limited understanding of HeLa and the ethical implications. Rebecca Skloot provides an understandable explanation of the the history of HeLa and the person behind the science. The book looks at the struggles of the Lacks family as well as the history of the cells. At times the narrative jumps around a bit and the author's presence in the story can be something of an irritant. However she has done a great service in telling the story of Henrietta Lacks and opening up the ethical issues in an understandable way.The not so casual racism of the medical profession in the 1950s is clearly illustrated as is the experience of the Lacks family in their own struggles with the health services. Parts of the American health system still look too close to Eugenics for my liking and this book highlights areas for ongoing debate
210,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9750143-bookofcinz,5,"Rebecca Skloot deserves an award for this gem of literature/research. I learned so much about science, ethics, the Hela cell and research procedures during the 90s. In trying to tell Henrietta Lacks' story Skloot walked a thin line between science and explaining cells and the human interest. I found the book really interesting and I didn't find the science information particularly overwhelming. I am actually in awe that the Lacks family had no recognition for basically changing the course of history, it is interesting how time and time again African Americans are erased from the history books, well done Skloot on doing your research and bringing this to light. A MUST READ. "
211,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28403000-elle,5,Heart breakingly beautiful. I don't want to give away the ending but to here about the struggle of a family who unknowningly gave so much to the world to receive literally nothing in return is heart breakingly beautiful. Rebecca Skoot did Henrietta's cells justice; as an African American female scientist I could write all day long about the significance this book has to me. I strongly recommend it for everyone but especially those that aspire to work in the science or the medical field. We have to be mindful that everything comes from somewhere. Deeper appreciation for every component of my life the more I think about this book. 
212,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46843663-candace,4,"This one was on my TBR for a long time, and I'm so glad I finally got to it. An incredibly interesting story about one woman's cells, the interaction between scientific research, consent, and patient involvement (or lack thereof). I found the story of the Lacks family gave the book so much depth, where going into it I had no idea we would spend so much time with them.This was the audio version, which included a little interview with Rebecca Skloot at the end. Very interesting stuff, highly recommended."

214,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2748729-venus,1,"Wrote from a voice laden with white guilt, it became more of a story about a Black family struggle to survive with a lack of resources instead of the story of the source of the cell which has led to so many modern day advances.

219,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,5,"Henrietta Lacks has probably saved your life. If not yours, then almost certainly that of someone you know.And you don't even know who she is.Or, rather, who she was. The original Henrietta Lacks was a black woman who lived near Baltimore, grew up in poverty, worked hard, and died in 1951, overcome by a cancer that started in her cervix and spread out to take over her whole body. She left behind five children, a husband, and a legacy that would forever change our understanding of biology and medicine.When she first went to Johns Hopkins Medical Center and was diagnosed with cancer, her doctor took a small sample of cells from the tumor and sent it to his colleague, George Gey. Gey had long been in the pursuit of what seemed like and impossible dream: to culture human cells and keep them alive in the lab. By doing so, he hoped to create new ways to test medicine and study human biology without all those pesky patients getting in the way. Unfortunately, his work had thus far been a failure. Human cells, no matter how hard he tried, simply would not survive outside the body for very long. Gey tried all kinds of media and methods, inventing some machines that have become invaluable to cell culture research, but he simply watched culture after culture die in the lab.All of that changed when he got HeLa.The cells from Henrietta Lacks, which were known as ""HeLa,"" not only didn't die - they thrived. They were so robust that Gey and his staff soon had more HeLa cells than they could keep, much less use, so they started sending them off to any researcher who asked. With HeLa, researchers around the world began to make discoveries that would save lives and change the world.But with this ever-growing cell line - which was baked, boiled, frozen, irradiated, cloned, cut up, and sent into space - it was very easy to forget that there was once a woman named Henrietta Lacks, with a family and a legacy of her own.Plenty has been written about HeLa in the last fifty years, and any researcher who works with cells is probably well aware of its existence and importance. But very few people know about Henrietta, and it was this oversight that Rebecca Skloot is trying to correct in this book.She began her quest with a simple question: ""Who was Henrietta Lacks?"" The fact that she got the right name was surprising enough, actually. HeLa had previously been identified as Henrietta Lakes, Helen Lane, and Helen Larson in various publications. Skloot believed that there was more to the story than just a bunch of immortal cells, and was determined to find Henrietta's surviving relatives and learn more about this woman who had somehow become so important to the world.Skloot wouldn't be the first, however. A writer for Rolling Stone, a con man, and the BBC had all attempted to look into the life of Henrietta before, and found that the surviving Lackses were not only unaware of what their mother had become, but largely unaware of why it was important.The children and grandchildren of Henrietta Lacks had grown up in the Baltimore area, mired in the poverty of being black in the end of the twentieth century. Drug abuse, alcoholism, and a lack of education meant that their lives were full of hardship and struggle, and not likely to get any better. When they found out that Henrietta's cells were not only unique to science but being sold all around the world, this was news that they weren't all prepared to cope with. Some saw it as a religious visitation, others as a massive conspiracy, and still others as just a way to make money off some poor black folk from the city.The center of Skloot's narrative is Deborah, Henrietta's youngest daughter and the one Lacks who seemed most determined to find out what had happened. Deborah wanted so hard to find out what had happened to her mother that it almost killed her. The stress of not knowing - or, even worse, knowing but not understanding - took a heavy toll on her physical and mental health, and she was reluctant to talk to anyone at all about her mother. But it was Deborah that Rebecca had to convince if she was going to write this book, and in order to do that, she had to promise that the book would be about the woman Henrietta was, not just the cells she was famous for.That's probably what makes this book as readable and engaging as it is. While the science is handled well and smoothly, it's not nearly as fascinating or emotionally gripping as the stories that she tells about the Lacks family. She shows us a family that is held together by the strength of their faith in their God and each other, and who are desperately trying to understand their place in the world and how Henrietta came to be what she was.When the original cells were taken from Henrietta, it was done without her consent. She also had no say in what happened to those cells and how they were used, nor did any of her family find out the truth until years later. In an era long before the phrase ""informed consent"" was even coined, the medical establishment made massive scientific and financial gains, and in the meantime the Lacks were mired in poverty. As several of her children note, Henrietta has changed medicine forever, but her children can't go see a doctor.The struggle to understand must have been enormous. One of the moments that was most surprising and illuminating to me was when Henrietta's son Zakariyya asked Rebecca, ""What's a cell?""Just like Rebecca, I had to take a moment to absorb that question, and it put into sharp perspective the vast assumptions that I had made, coming from a well-educated white background. I thought that everyone at least knew what a cell was, but that assumption couldn't have been further from the truth. Deborah and her family are people of minimal formal education who are trying to understand a topic that people study for their entire lives. Their dedication to this quest is so strong, and the struggle is so great that their attempt is nothing less than heroic, to my way of seeing things.The story is still unfinished. HeLa is still out there, making news and causing trouble. The Lacks family is still living in poverty, although the new generation has been able to go to school and are aiming at a brighter future for themselves. And while patients' rights to control what is done with their bodies and their tissues is improving, the law is still on the side of the doctors and hospitals. Medical ethics is a lot better than it was, but the fight is fierce, especially when there's money involved.This book is not just the story of cells or of science. It’s the story of a woman and her family, and how sometimes people get lost in the inexorable movement of scientific progress. Some parts are infuriating, some are heartbreaking, but the book is an illumination into what is sometimes sacrificed in pursuit of a better world.-----""When I saw those toenails, I nearly fainted. I thought, Oh jeez, she's a real person. I started imagining her sitting in her bathroom painting those toenails, and it hit me for the first time that those cells we'd been working with all this time and sending all over the world, they came from a live woman. I'd never thought of it that way.""- Mary Kubicek, assistant to George Gey"
220,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,5,"Ugh... I'll tell you what - if it wasn't 2 weeks from the end of the year, and if I wasn't currently 12 books behind on my already-reduced yearly goal, I wouldn't actually be reviewing this book right now. I'd be sitting on it and waiting to re-read it, because I feel like it's a book that needs the proper kind of read, and... I just didn't really give it that. To be clear, I finished it, and really loved it, but... Basically I have been listening to this book in like 4 minute spurts for like 8 months. Never so officially that I even added it to my Currently Reading shelf. (And it kinda makes me a little neurotic, to be honest.) This book has been with me through two cars now, three if we count the rental while my poor car was being evaluated and eventually written off as a total loss. We've been through SEASONS together. And the whole time, I've been just fascinated and really enthralled with the story of these cells and this woman and her family, and the way that science and even ethics have changed because of them. It's a fantastic and heart-wrenching story, and one I absolutely will be revisiting more attentively at some point. No, attentive isn't really the right word, because as I listened, even in the few minutes I might be in the car, I was that. Maybe, consistently? Continuously? Something like that. Anyway, this is non-fiction, but it reads and feels like a fictionalized story. The 'plot' is incredible, the 'characters' are real and flawed and human, and the 'storytelling' is structured in such a way that the reader learns what the family learns essentially as they learn it. Knowing that these are real people, who actually LIVED this, just makes the story all the more powerful and important. I loved this book. Cannot recommend it highly enough."
221,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20735143-yaaresse,2,"Random thoughts and questions after reading this book: 1. As an acquaintance said of the book, ""The author was considerably less interesting to me than she was to herself."" Amen. 2. I am OK with a few praise blurbs from other authors in a book, and I guess the (exhaustive and exhausting three pages) listing of every prize or award Skloot won since her third grade spelling bee was inevitable, but to have to page through no fewer than 58 MORE quotes about how earth-shatteringly fabulous this book is....ARE YOU F***ING KIDDING ME? And a couple of these praise blurbs are only one or two words. That's what I call questionable use of a scalpel. It's possible to pull one positive sounding word from even the worst review. If she were male, I'd think she was compensating for a less-than-impressive body part. I have a theory that the number of praise blurbs and review quotes appearing in the front of a book is inversely proportional to the quality of the writing inside the book. This glut did nothing to convince me my theory is wrong. (Do authors really believe readers aren't well aware that many of those PR quotes are solicited (or wrangled, begged, and bought) or that authors usually write their own swaggering bios?) 3. Skloot emphasizes that the Lacks family was skittish about talking to strangers because of numerous bad experiences with reporters, con men, etc, but she hounded them longer and harder than anyone. She comes off like some wacko stalker -- calling several times daily, showing up at people's houses, working her way toward the family by trying to chum up to distant cousins or townsfolk, not respecting ""no"" as an answer. Considering some of the places she was inserting herself, she's lucky not to have ended up on the business end of a shotgun. (I grew up in an area very much like Halifax County, VA -- and not that far from it -- and it was clear to me while reading about her interactions with folks in Clover that Skloot has all the cultural insight of a housefly.) 4. Once Skloot wears the family down to get access to Deborah Lacks, she suddenly becomes Deborah's BFF. And yet, in spite of ALL those professed years of visits and phone calls and travels together where they giggled and read and...hell, IDK, painted each other nails...the family (supposedly) didn't have Skloot's phone number in order to tell her Deborah died? That seems weird. Even if they really had lost the number, there's this little thing called directory assistance. That is, if they really wanted to contact her. Methinks she wasn't as BFF as she wants us to think. Also? She should have shared author credit with Deborah if she wanted to be as ""fair"" as she claims.5. Skloot is President of the Henrietta Lacks Foundation, which she claims she set up prior to writing the book in order to provide educational care for the Lacks descendants. Is Skloot compensated financially in that role? If so, how much does she make from it? Good luck finding financial disclosures about this tax-exempt org. Call me cynical, but the whole ""an undisclosed amount of some proceeds from the book I wrote go toward the tax-exempt foundation I happen to be head of"" makes me think ""riiiight...PR stunt."" 6. The book is repetitive and organizationally all over the place, but there are basically two parts. The part about the HeLa cells, how they were acquired, grown, distributed, used, and the contamination problems with them, which is interesting and approachable. The part depicting the Lacks family and their long history of abuse, drugs, arrests, poverty, STDs, teen pregnancies, etc. felt gratuitous and exploitative. Skloot tries to paint herself as someone who ""gets it and will fix it"" and yet it's pretty obvious by her self-congratulatory comments that this really is all about Skloot: her interests, her curiosity, her book, her royalties. 7. I would have liked a clear explanation of why using cancerous cells to develop medications and treatments doesn't compromise the effect of those products. The issue was broached, then brushed aside. 8. I don't think anyone would argue that it's a sad irony that Henrietta Lacks' family can't afford medical care while Henrietta's cancer cells have made the career of many researchers and profited many corporations. Yes, that's tragic and seems like some kind of cruel joke of the universe; however, there's not a direct cause-and-effect relationship here. There are many, many poor people who manage to stay out of jail, stay in school, not abuse or molest anyone, and not do drugs. Deborah Lacks seemed to be the only one interested in more than a handout or someone to write them a check. If the Lacks boys want to blame someone for their situation, maybe they should have looked in mirrors. And maybe they should have asked their father why he couldn't keep his pants zipped or at least wear a condom rather than repeatedly infect their mother with every STD under the sun. The truly sad irony is that David Lacks lived to a ripe old age in spite of inflicting the effects of STDs on his entire brood. Now, that seems unjust.9. The hard part of history is that you have to put events in the context of their times. In 1951, even had Henrietta Lacks been a white, middle-class, educated woman, it is very likely that her cells still would have been taken without consent or compensation. Today it is easy to say the cells should not have been used without permission, but in 1951 that was not uncommon practice. What surprised me was to learn that, once removed from the host body, our cells can still be used without explicit consent. 10. Perhaps the most important part of the book is about current ethical questions surrounding cell collection and use. This is where the real meat is. Why is that stuck in the very back of the book?Summary: An important story, but the author's tendency to sensationalize and cast herself in the starring role as some great white savior marching in to educate and help those poor, simple, messed-up, backward black folks was just too much to stomach. I'd like to see this story told by someone who doesn't consider him or her self the hero."
222,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94065836-roxanna-l-pez,5,"What I wanted to talk about and not talk about too much is The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, probably the most important book that I have read in the last twenty years. It moved me, terrified me, intrigued me, and thoroughly exhausted every fiber of my being, however, and in spite of all of that, I strongly believe this is a book that every informed person in the Western world should read. I had to pace myself and not follow the desire of reading late into the night; the one time I did, I was not able to sleep well for a few days. This is a book that every writer in the world would probably wish to have written not only because of its immense success but because of its humanity, the lack of sensationalism, and the important and fascinating nature of the topics it covers. The writing is simple enough to make complicated real-life stories and real-life science relatively easy to understand; no purple prose, the power of the content needs no other adornment than a meticulous and well-researched treatment. A fantastic and thought-provoking read. If you have been thinking about giving it a try, brace yourself and go for it, it is totally worth it. You might also want to check out the webpage of the Henrietta Lacks foundation: http://henriettalacksfoundation.org."
223,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39972057-jennifer,5,"I'm normally not a non-fiction fan but The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks reads like historical fiction. The story of Henrietta is vivid and comes to life on the page. Not only is it a story about a family and the losses they are dealing with. It is a story of racial and ethical issues in medicine and all that is done for ""science."" I highly recommend this book and think it would be a great pick for book clubs. There's so much to discuss!"
224,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5037696-jess,4,"By some freak medical accident, the cancer cells of Henrietta Lacks lived and replicated outside of her body long after her death, revolutionizing the science of cell culture and leading to hundreds if not thousands of scientific advances in medicine. And that is the least interesting part of this story.What is interesting about The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is the combination of racism, poverty, and lack of patients' rights that led to this medical marvel, and the painful aftermath of Henrietta's death. Because the author rightly picked up on the fact that you can't tell the story of the HeLa cells without telling the story of Henrietta Lacks and her descendants. You can't separate the awful legacy of racism and poverty from the medical experimentation that made the HeLa cells possible. And you can't separate the real, tragic lives of Henrietta's family from the miraculous scientific advances to which the HeLa cells contributed.As someone who is firmly pro-choice, I found the legal aspect of the book deeply disturbing. Henrietta's cells were taken without her knowledge or consent. They might have died, in which case they would have been discarded like hundreds of cell samples before them. But they weren't: Henrietta's cells lived and multiplied, a genuine medical break-through. And yet she still wasn't informed. Henrietta Lacks wasted away in a hospital bed, dying of cervical cancer while doctors and scientists at Johns Hopkins made scientific history using her biological tissue. And she never knew anything about it.And I just... don't understand how that ever could have been legal. Not the use of the tissue, but the lack of consent. Mandatory organ donation is not legal, and using someone's body without their consent is not legal. So how was it ever ok for doctors to remove cells for experiments without getting the consent of the owner of those cells? That... is horrifying.I find it a little easier to understand the justification for using tissues removed consensually, without informing the tissue donor of their use. I get that restricting the use of donated tissues could put up a roadblock for medical science and we all might therefore miss out on medical advances. But to take samples without even asking? To keep tissue on file without consent? Murky ethical waters, man. But of course, Henrietta Lacks was a poor black woman. She was raised on a tobacco farm, married her first cousin, dropped out of elementary school, and had contracted a number of STIs from her husband. So who the hell cares what happens to her or what she thinks, amirite? The history of medical experimentation on impoverished black people was disgusting and shameful. And even now, based on the interviews Skloot conducted for this book, there are doctors who just. don't. care.Which is why the person of Henrietta Lacks can't be separated from the story of her cells. It's important that the author formed a personal relationship with Henrietta's daughter Deborah, because Deborah is a real person, deeply and negatively affected by what happened to her mother. This poor woman lived her life afflicted by all the ills of poverty, and was uniquely vulnerable to the stress and anxiety of knowing how her mother was violated and taken advantage of. And yet even when Deborah was paranoid and freaking out in a way that could even be called ""crazy,"" I felt nothing but admiration and compassion for her. Once she found out the truth of the HeLa cells, she fought constantly to educate herself, to uncover the truth, and to honor her mother, her family, and her history. And she did it all without the benefit of a high school education. This is an incoherent review, which is regretful, because there's a lot of complicated shit going on in this book. It inspired me to think critically about the cost of scientific and medical advancement. It inspired me to evaluate the power differential between the privileged educated and the impoverished uneducated. And on top of that, it's just a damn good story."
225,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9462235-rosemary,5,"Amazing story of an African-American woman who unknowingly provided cells for most of the medical research done around the world beginning in 1952. The Lacks family never benefitted from what became a billion dollar industry that cultured Henrietta's cancer cells for use in tests and experiments. In fact, they were economically deprived and could not even afford medical care. Author Rebecca Skloot investigates how this came about, tracking down the Lacks family members and learning how the family survived (it's a heart wrenching story) and informing them about Henrietta's importance. Chapters on the family alternate with the story with how Henrietta's cells were taken and how their culturing became such big business and so scientifically important. And all the chapters are page turners. The only place the book slows down is at the very end where there is discussion and analysis of how to deal with human tissue. Who does it belong to? Does a patient have to give consent for the tissue, blood, etc. to be used (think about organs removed during surgery, or moles taken off)? In 1952 no one even thought about those things. Now we're grappling with patenting DNA. There are no easy answers. I felt kind of sad and let down at the end of the book because the Lacks family (or what was left of it--many had passed away) was in such poor circumstances, until I found the page about the Henrietta Lacks Foundation, set up by Rebecca Skloot before the book was published. Some of the proceeds from the book go to the foundation. I went to the website HenriettaLacksFoundation.org where I found that several members of the Lacks family had been given assistance for medical and dental problems and others had received assistance in paying for their education. Assistance is available to any individual or their family member whose life has been impacted by medical research. This is not limited to the Lacks family; anyone who has had their tissue, blood, or genetic material used for medical research and received no compensation is eligible to apply for a grant.I urge you you to read this book to know Henrietta Lacks' story, to know the hard life of African Americans in the United States, to know how poor education and economic hardship combined with the medical practices of the 1950s to leave the family ignorant and bewildered about what happened to their family member, and to see how that situation created damaging fear and denial. You will also learn how science progressed so quickly that it ran ahead of rules and ethical practices and how racism was so ingrained in society that no one even thought about it when medical experiments were done on African Americans (the Tuskegee syphilis study looms large here). And you will be introduced to ethical dilemmas about balancing individual patient rights with the need to do medical research that benefits everyone (and there have been some huge benefits for all of us). Your brain will get a workout, your heart will be broken, you will be angry, sad, frustrated and, I hope, determined to do something. A donation to the Henrietta Lacks Foundation would be a good place to start. "
226,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301501-erin,3,"My thoughts about this book are a bit scattered, and perhaps my situation in the midst of what is starting to shape up as a chronic health problem didn't put me in the best frame of mind for reading it. I truly expected to love it, but I don't think I did. First, I almost always dislike it when the author of a non-memoir, non-fiction work becomes a main character in the story and that's what you saw here. I felt for the Lacks family, and the impact of the poverty and lack of education on the generations of the family followed here, but I also felt that Skloot might have done some members of the family a disservice by publishing this warts-and-all account of their lives, especially since their difficulties continue into present-day. Don't get me wrong - I don't doubt that Skloot had/has real affection for the Lackses, but they are portrayed as a family who hasn't risen above, and, in many cases, just the opposite. And she seems to place at least a portion for the blame for that at the feet of....well, who, exactly? Johns Hopkins? The medical research machine? For-profit biological corporations? A racist society? Or all of the above? However, there's no clear connection drawn.In addition, Skloot takes pains to separate herself from all the other journalists who have come to the Lacks story before her....SHE certainly had no intention of using this family in any way, right? Except that she's become a famous, award-winning author from this book, and while her brief statement at the end of the book indicating that she's set up a foundation for the family, indicating that ""some profits"" will be donated to it, there's no clear statement of exactly how much, and for what purposes, precisely (and I realize that her lawyers wouldn't let her be more specific, but still...) In distinguishing her own motives from other authors, she even chastises Michael Gold, but it seems clear that she used his work extensively as a reference source, a separation that strikes me as disingenuous at best. Perhaps my other difficulty with the book was the tone of an overall indictment of the medical research community. Cell research was in its infancy in the early 1950s. Henrietta's cells were a true miracle, but not one that could have been anticipated - I can only imagine that scientists all over the world took thousands of such liberties, but it would be difficult to argue that they didn't serve the greater good, and, as much as I feel for the Lacks family, there is simply no way to rectify that error now, so it was often frustrating to read about the Lackses palpable anger with no direction.It's not that I hated the book, I just didn't love it. Henrietta Lacks lived a brief, difficult life and died in horrendous circumstances that were borne of both biology and society. She lives on through what her wondrous cells have given the world, and even though I wasn't crazy about the book, I'm glad that she, and her family, are receiving their due. "
227,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/716578-shana,5,"Generally, I prefer fiction to non-fiction. Perhaps it's my way of rebelling against all the twits who say they don't read fiction because you can't learn anything from it. I don't know. However, I read a review of this book in The New York Times, and it was glowing, to say the least. They managed to convey both the skill of the writing and the pull of the story, and I knew I had to check out the book, so check it out I did, quite literally. I put my name on a waiting list at the library, a waiting list which was hundreds of people long, and I waited.Last Tuesday, I was finally able to get the book. As I've noted elsewhere, recently, I've been doing more knitting than reading. I haven't even finished reading a book since the beginning of the year, something very uncommon for me. I was excited, then, to have a book with a time limit. I had two weeks and only two weeks to finish before the book had to go back to the library and off to the next person on the waiting list. Well, since I'm writing this on Sunday and since I finished the book on Saturday, you can see that I didn't need the two weeks after all.Talk about a page-turner! I couldn't put it down. I was even reading in class, and I'm the teacher. Whenever I assigned my students something to read, they'd read their thing, and I'd read this book. When they had to write, they'd write, and I'd read this book. Aside from class, I read on the bus rides to and from the city. I didn't read much at home. Still, though, I managed to get through it pretty quickly.Part of what made it such a page-turner were the characters and the ethical issues the book brought up. The Lacks family is at the same time so foreign to my experience but also so utterly human and understandable. I couldn't help wondering how different their lives would have been had they known about their mother's cells and had they seen some of the profit that so many others have as a result of those cells. The ethical issues go beyond money and fair compensation, though. The issue of race and the racial history of the US also play a big role. I was absolutely tickled to think about how many virulent racists might have HeLa cells or medicines made from them floating around in their bodies. According to the one drop rule, we might all be black now. However, I also cried thinking that at the same time MLK, Jr. and others were fighting for civil rights, a black woman was helping to save so many lives from polio and getting no credit at all for it. The world truly is a complicated and messy place, and this book helps to bring to light some of that complication and mess and at the same time gives us faith in writers who want justice for their subjects and the people who somehow muddle through even when there is none."
228,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/305395-scrappymags,2,"A tough time rating this book... the questions raised by this book and the story that's in it - a 5 all the way, so I'll have to explain. I can see why there are great reviews - the questions raised in this book are timely and poignant and end in heated, gonna-slap-you-silly debates. But the book doesn't live up to that fever. I had a few jaw-dropping moments and ""Oh &*&*, can they really do that?"" questions. But I pretty much had that ephiphany in the first 100 pages and then the rest was sort of an anti-climactic ride. It's like I stood in line for 2 hours, anxious and excited to ride the best, most stomach-turning roller coaster in the park, arrive at the front of the line and realized with great dismay - I was in the line for the carousel! Boring. Eh. SOOOO disappointed by the hype. I felt bad for the Lacks family, but not as bad as maybe I SHOULD have. I couldn't help but be torn - if all of that GOOD came from the medical discoveries, perhaps there SHOULDN'T be a dime made off it, much like organ donation, but then when I read about the profits of companies off of HeLa cells for any jo-shmo stupid research? Yeah, I felt a tug toward the Lacks family. By page 230 though, I really was completely bored. I was bored with cells. Bored by the long list of doctors. Bored. And I'm ashamed to admit this, but I was sort of bored with the Lack's story; this sort of ignorance was actually making me mad. I felt like Deborah was the one making the effort and WANTING to learn and being tormented and that the others, who admittedly didn't really remember their mother, sort of jumped on the bandwagon. I felt Deborah was the only one truly tormented by the HeLa debacle and had an intrinsic need to know about her mother. I felt others in the family were victims of abuse and a terrible upbringing and lack of education, yes, but Deborah I thought was the one really affected by the HeLa mess. I think for years, people asked questions and noone really thought much about it until (tada)... the HeLa cells were being sold and whoa - shouldn't the family make a profit? THEN many family members cared. That kind of irked me thinking some in the family didn't really have the best of intentions, but it's hard to judge and I don't want to do that; I don't really know these people, but that's my honest reaction to the book. I definitely love social injustice stories, but that was in that first 100 pages and got me fired up, ready to care, but then... I didn't feel that was really the WHOLE story. Ah what can I say? It was just ok for me."
229,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2048986-carrie-kellenberger,5,"How would you feel if your doctor took a sample of your tissue without your consent and then used it to further his own research studies and then shared that tissue with laboratories and medical research centers around the world for a profit? After your death, what would happen if your family discovered that your cells had been used in medical research against the family's wishes for years, but that those cells had also been used to make some of the most important innovations that modern science has ever known? This is what happened to an African American woman named Henrietta Lacks in 1951. Henrietta was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer that eventually led to her death. Her doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore discovered that Henrietta's cells were immortal, meaning that they could be grown in a lab without dying after a few cell divisions. Samples of Henrietta's cancerous tissue were taken without her knowledge or consent during her treatments and then again after her death. Henrietta's cells were used to conduct many experiments from developing a cure for polio and studying the effects of radiation and other toxic substances on the human body to gene mapping as well as cancer and AIDS research. Her cells represented a boon to medical research.In the meantime, Henrietta's family had been kept in the dark. They lived in poverty and poor health, often without health insurance, and they only found out about her contribution to science years later. Journalist Rebecca Skloot does an excellent job of gathering what little information there is on Henrietta's life and telling her remarkable story and the aftermath of her death. It's unusual for a journalist to get so close to the subjects she is writing about, but Rebecca's close relationship with the family only made me feel more indignant about how they were treated. The end of the novel, in particular, was a real eye-opener for me. I had spent so much time feeling angry about what had happened to the Lacks' that I never stopped to consider what would've happened if Henrietta's cells hadn't been used. This isn't a story about Henrietta Lacks, although she is certainly the most important figure in this novel. It's about her children, her friends, and the debate over whether or not human tissue should be used with or without a patient's consent and what that means for the future of medical science. "
230,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2417010-sarah-weathersby,5,"Author Rebecca Skloot first heard about HeLa cells in an introduction to biology class she took at a community college as a makeup for a failed high school class. The lecture about HeLa cells and Henrietta Lacks ended with, ""She was a black woman."" That statement launched the author's interest in biology and piqued her curiosity into the life of Henrietta Lacks. By the time she earned a degree in biology, Skloot had decided to write a book about the woman whose cells survived long after her death.I almost didn't read this book. It was at first a need to read rather than a desire to read. Then my daughter (an Ob/Gyn) told me it was a must read, and my own Gyno said I must read. I asked my doc if a layperson would be able to understand all the biological/medical language and she assured me the book is historical and biographical as well. I was convinced to start reading. It didn't take long before I was reading into the night about the life of Henrietta Lacks.The author wisely alternates between chapters about Henrietta's genealogy, life, treatment, death; and the clinical studies, distribution of the cells grown from the biopsy taken from Henrietta's cervical cancer. The author chronicles her knowledge of unethical experimentation on human patients ranging from Nazi experiments on concentration camp inmates to the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. The outrage recorded during the Nuremberg trials never resulted in changes in medical practice or ethics, so that no requirement for informed consent was written into law.Ms. Skloot traces Henrietta's family back to a slave plantation in Virginia, through the Jim Crow era when there was little access to medical treatment for poor blacks. Henrietta was part of the Great Migration, moving to Baltimore where Johns Hopkins Hospital provided medical treatment for blacks often in exchange for uninformed participation in clinical studies.It became painful to read of Henrietta's lack of access to a peaceful and pain-free transition though a horrendously painful death, especially when juxtaposed against the multi-million dollar industry which grew out of the cancerous cells taken from her.Ms Skloot spent years tracing Henrietta's children, who were babies at the time of her death in 1951. As Skloot learns about the life of Henrietta, her children have a glimpse into the mother they never knew as well.This is a true story you must read. I give it five stars."
231,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4250714-greg-bates,3,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a paradox of a novel; it somehow simultaneously feels too padded and too cramped. In a scant three hundred pages it attempts to be a historical novel about the creation and importance of cell cultures, an even-handed treatment of ideas regarding the often shady and pockmarked intersection of science and ethics, and an inspirational family chronicle of the Lacks clan in the fifty years since Henrietta's death. And to be honest the first section of the novel dealing directly with Henrietta's life and death are just about able to pull it off. Unfortunately at some point it's obvious Skloot got overwhelmed and fell back on the easiest subject to write about: yourself. The second half of Henrietta Lacks is a scattershot mess, largely taken up by Skloot's personal odyssey to infiltrate the Lacks clan and her personal relationship with Deborah Lacks, the family's de facto matriarch. This is plagued with innumerable setbacks, tragedies, family members reversing their opinion of her, etc, and I couldn't help but feel that I was reading some bizarre ""making of"" book appended to the main story. Don't tell me about how difficult it was for you to make this book, about the struggles and hardships you faced - tell me more about Henrietta, more about the HeLa strain and it's history and importance to science. There's an incredibly interesting story about cross-contamination of the HeLa line causing a giant revamp to medical science (not to mention hundreds of millions of dollars in losses) in the 1980's that's glossed over in a few pages so I can hear more about Skloot's adventures living out of hotel rooms in Southern Virginia. Also, It just feels wrong to me somehow that she ""preserved"" the diction of Henrietta's family in order to make them sound like infantile morons, and I especially felt Skloot's whole ""gee golly I sure am an athiest but the faith of this poor black family who've been treated like dirt for 50 years is making me reconsider my faith in Jesus"" schtick near the end to be almost disgustingly patronizing. Henrietta Lacks' story is incredibly interesting to medical science, bioethics and American history - but this book does a terrible job of showing it."
232,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,3,"This is an interesting, if light, work of nonfiction. Henrietta Lacks was a poor black woman who went to the charity ward of Johns Hopkins in 1951 with cervical cancer. Cells were taken from her body without her knowledge, and unlike other cells collected up to that point, they kept reproducing.... endlessly. Mrs. Lacks died a few months afterwards, but her cells became standard lab material over the world, used in the development of everything from the polio vaccine to the atomic bomb. Her family found out two decades later, and didn’t see a dime of the profits.I enjoyed this book, reading almost all of it in one day. Skloot is a skilled storyteller, with an accessible, engaging journalistic style. The early section dealing with Henrietta Lacks’s life is probably the best. It's a kind of story that isn't usually told, and Skloot does a good job of relating the information she was able to gather, without speculating on the parts we can't know. A few chapters discuss the science, though mostly on a surface level; readers with little interest or background in science should not be scared away, as these chapters are brief and accessible. The section dealing with the history of medical experimentation on unconsenting African-Americans is especially memorable.However, a large portion of the book, particularly in the second half, deals with the author’s journey in researching the book and gaining the trust of the Lacks family, and focuses on her friendship with Henrietta’s daughter, Deborah. This story is well-told, and I do think the Lacks family needed to be part of this book; their discovery of their mother’s cells had an enormous impact on their lives, and the irony of their inability to afford health care would be impossible to miss even if the book didn’t point it out. But devoting so much of the book to the author’s researching it does make it seem, in the final analysis, rather light. Compared to most nonfiction, it’s less informative and a quicker read; this accessibility no doubt contributed to its bestseller status, but much as I enjoyed it, I didn't learn nearly as much as I'd expected. At least the Lacks family is finally benefiting from their ordeal."
233,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15249098-donald-powell,5,"An amazing book full of important scientific, legal, ethical, family, and medical industry information while also a very well told story of a woman and her family. Ms. Skloot is a very good writer, told an honest story and told it well. Very moving and very important in so many ways. The writing keeps you drawn in and interested in an amazing way."
234,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9086236-chaitra,3,"It's not my normal fare, this book. I've been most reluctant to delve into biology beyond the basics taught at high school, and I didn't think I would enjoy this book. I did and then I didn't, but the science was my favorite part. When the book focuses on HeLa, or Henrietta herself (which is a really tiny portion of the book, but it still stands out), or the ethics of the scientific community, it's at its strongest. I was fully engaged in the book when these were being discussed, especially since I'm kind of paranoid about hospitals and doctors in general. But focus is the problem here. Midway through, Skloot runs out of things to say about HeLa and science and ethics. This could be because the times were different, and the Lacks family didn't actually make a concerted effort to get their concerns redressed. In any case, there's nothing left to say on those fronts, and Skloot turns the book into a human interest story focussing on the HeLa offspring. But, she doesn't do a good job there. When I came to the portion where Deborah finally figures out that it's her mother's cancer cells that were multiplying and not her normal cells by a friendly oncologist, I didn't want to read anymore. Why could this information not have come from Skloot, who went out of her way to write several times that no one was giving the Lacks family any information? It's such a tiny piece that would have helped Deborah, and it bothered me a lot. There was too much of Skloot in the book, and not enough anyone else. I don't know - I like my non-fiction with the author at a distance unless it's an autobiography or an opinion piece. This was neither. The book really should have ended at around 200 pages.The book did make me think. I give blood, and I blindly sign my consent form. This is not because I'm not educated, or I'm lazy. I just lack the imagination. I've no idea what can happen. This book gives the answers. I just don't know if I like them. "
235,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4713140-heather,5,"As a medic just starting a new position in research I felt now was the right time to read this book which had been on my to-read list for years. The books tells the true story of Henrietta Lacks, a poor African-American lady in the 1950s who developed an aggressive form of cervical cancer. Unbeknown to her, cells were taken from her during investigation and treatment which become the 1st cells to survive and grow in cell culture. They went on to become the almost ubiquitous cell line HeLa which has been used in thousands of research projects since. Henrietta died leaving a devastated young family to grow up with much suffering along the way. This book tells their story as well as what little is known about Henrietta and provides a fascinating look into their difficult lives and is an interesting piece of social commentary. The family found out about the HeLa cells many years on and due to a lack of understanding were understandable very upset at the thought of their mothers cells being out there, still growing. The main problem, to me, was the total lack of explanation to the family or no attempt to seek consent. Personally, I don't think there was any ethical problem with using the cells but the lack of empathy towards the family is where the problems arose. The book also discusses the history of cell culture and delves into the development of research ethics as a concept. The values we base trials and research on have evolved from the issues discussed in this book and this is hugely important to maintaining trust with the public and medical researchers so drugs and treatments can continue to be developed. This book makes you think. It makes you want to discuss medical ethics. It makes me eternally grateful to the researchers, who even if they didn't go about things as we would now, worked tirelessly to develop cell culture which is a foundation of so much medical knowledge. Lastly, it makes me want to thank Henrietta Lacks"
236,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,5,"The history of medicine has a real sleazy side to it, and if you have any doubts about that, this book will put them to rest. It's the story of a black woman whose cancer was so virulent, it actually outlived her. Her cells have been cultured, reproduced, sold, and become the basis of some of the most important breakthroughs in modern medicine, but the cells were taken from her without her knowledge or consent. Her family only discovered it decades later. The book raises all kinds of sticky yet relevant questions about medical ethics and race, showing both the good and the bad of medical science.A few weeks ago, I reviewed Polio: An American Story here on Goodreads, saying that because of its focus on the human side of the search for the polio vaccine, the book read like a novel. That's even more true for this book since the author focuses so particularly on Henrietta's family and even on her own research process in tracking them down. So if my Polio review convinced you to read that book, I strongly urge you to read this as a follow-up. Henrietta's cells were central to the discovery of the polio vaccine, yet like with everything else connected with her, her story was completely unknown until this book. And the converse is also true: if you've read this book yet haven't read Polio: An American Story, I recommend it as a follow-up. I know it didn't mention Henrietta Lacks, and I don't think it even mentioned HeLa cells, but once you've read one book, you've got enough of a background to appreciate the other. "
237,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4238297-lauren,5,"I'm always stunned when I learn about a piece of history that seems much more like fiction. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot is just such a case. With each page, I couldn't help but shake my head in disbelief.In the 1950's, Henrietta Lacks, a young African-American mother of five, is diagnosed with a cervical tumor at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Her doctor removes some of her cancerous cells without her knowledge. Henrietta eventually passes away from her disease, but her cells live on. HeLa cells, as they are known, multiplied and multiplied...becoming the first human cells to do so in a laboratory. Since that time, HeLa cells have been used in experiments that have led to some of the greatest scientific innovations in the past century. Skloot weaves together this story with the story of Lacks' husband and children in modern-day Baltimore. How is it that the children of the woman who made one of the most important contributions to science can't afford their own health insurance? She examines what has become of Henrietta's descendants and the impact that the knowledge of what happened to their mother's cells has had on them.Skloot raises important questions about poverty, science, research and medical ethics in a book that reads more like a novel than reality. It is fascinating, deeply troubling and essential reading about medical issues that are still important today."
238,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146952-grumpus,2,"This was a tough summary to write. I kept editing it over and over and will probably update it at some point after posting. The book taught me about the science of HeLa cells and that was the main reason I wanted to read this. I found that portion of the book very interesting. I was also moved by the tragic story of Henrietta's life. She deserved much better. However, the story seemed to drone on about the life of her descendants to the point I didn't care about them anymore. They began to annoy me with their antics to the point that the sympathy I originally had for them disappeared. I understand their socio and economic background and understand their plight but as Henrietta's daughter said, ""times were different back then"" and nothing was done intentionally to defraud or short-change the family.The last part of the book was interesting where it discussed what is happening today legally and ethically regarding the use of human tissues when they leave your body. Like Henrietta, it is something you just don't think about. As I believe Henrietta would have wished, I would hope that my discarded tissues could benefit mankind in some way.This was one of those books that you're already looking forward to the next before this one ends. A good book is one that as you approach the end you wish there was more. Unfortunately, this was more the former for me."
239,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3739451-suzanne,5,"In 1951, a poor black woman by the name of Henrietta Lacks died of cancer. Her doctor took some samples (without her permission) of her cancer cells and her cervical tissue that later made history. These cells became the first to regenerate in a laboratory. They became immortal, because they kept on growing. This was important because most cells won’t do that, and having the cells for research provided important scientific breakthroughs like the polio vaccine and the available of chemotherapy in fighting cancer. In fact, most research done today uses the offspring of these cells – which are called HeLa.Skloot’s work of non-fiction is exemplary. She tells a very human side of this story. In presenting Henrietta Lacks and her family to readers, we can start to understand the ethical dilemma posed by the scientific and commercial value of human cells. Should individuals have a say in what happens to tissue that is removed in a doctor’s office? Do medical companies have an obligation to share in the profits of cells that are marketable? Rebecca Skloot does a wonderful job of exploring all these issues and more.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a fascinating story that you won’t want to put down. It draws you in from the very first page, and keeps you all the way to the end."
240,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7619789-leo-robertson,4,"Fascinating story. Though I picked it up because I was interested in the applications of HeLa cells and the experiments performed using them. Not so much the family drama. Irritating to read in that respect since they are interspersed--like, one interesting paragraph about unethical experimentation on prisoners embedded in the character study of some cousin or other.(Those of you reading this review in the year 2021, when you've just finished reading this book also, who are looking to write something like, ""Uh that prison-cousin mishmash didn't occur like that""--can't you tell I just invented that example because I couldn't be bothered looking back and finding one more specific? Also, do you really think I'm interested in pointing that out to you three years after I wrote this review? Crappy prioritisation like yours is why we no longer have bees![If we still have bees in 2021--it was a joke for those of us in 2018, the year at time of writing. DUH!!])That's why it took me so long to finish. Not at all to say that the Lacks family saga isn't important reportage; it's just for an almost exclusively different audience to those looking to know the history of a cell line. Which is maybe even the book's point.IDK but the book was good and so was the film anyway :)"
241,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2409240-janelle,5,"I read this in January and it's taken me this long to get to reviewing it. I've read many books between then and now, but it's a book that will never leave me. It was that fascinating to me.I learned a lot from this book. I'm grateful for it too! I learned about a dying black woman who unknowingly gave cancerous cells to the medical and scientific world many, many years ago that have reproduced so many times, it weighs as much as three Empire State Buildings. I learned that many blacks were subjected to harsh medical experiments that were completely hush- hush and little too hush-hush still if you ask me. Why didn't I know this?!I'm amazed that the family of Henrietta Lacks continues to struggle to get health insurance when their own mother was such a huge and vital part of exploring cures for many diseases with her incredible multiplying cells. While Johns Hopkins Hospital were the ones to cultivate the cells, they cannot pay a cent to the family. It's just so intriguing and strange. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has any interest in American history that is hardly made known as it should be!"
242,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael,4,"A fascinating true story of Henrietta Lacks. Before I read the book, I knew very little about Henrietta Lack, a poor African-American woman who died of cancer in the late 50's. During treatment at John Hopkins, some of her cervical cells were harvested for testing and to see if they could be reproduced in a lab. The cells are still reproducing to this day and have been used in many of the great medical breakthroughs of the past 50 years.But Henrietta and her family have been, tragically, forgotten to the pages of history. Rebecca Skloot spent ten years following the threads of the story to bring together this fascinating portrait of Henrietta, her family and the medical community that has used her cells for so long. Skloot makes the medical sections of the book easily accessible and tells the story of Henrietta and her family with dignity, respect and honesty. What you end up with is a non-fiction work that is easily as fascinating, compelling and absorbingly readable as any of the best fiction on the market today. "
243,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1008236-bookmarks-magazine,4,"In simple, straightforward prose, Skloot brings to life the woman unknowingly behind some of the 20th century's greatest medical advancements. In the process, she exposes the minefield of scientific, legal, and philosophical questions raised by Lacks's unwitting legacy. Skloot, who deftly weaves together the disparate threads of biography, science, and social history, provides a remarkably evenhanded assessment of the shadier dealings of the biomedical industry despite her obvious affection and sympathy for the Lacks family. Scientifically challenged readers will rejoice in Skloot's ability to explain complex technical processes in layperson's terms. Hailed by the New York Times as """"the book Ms. Skloot was born to write,"""" The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks """"is an important book, one that will linger--like Henrietta's cells--long after you've turned the last page"""" (Chicago Sun-Times). This is an excerpt from a review published in Bookmarks magazine."
244,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95110-jennifer,3,"I think this might be 3.5 stars. I was fascinated by the idea that so much research has come about because of one woman's cancer cells. I found the basic outline of her life and her children's lives interesting, and the writing was quick and engaging. But, I had two major issues with the book: (1) The story line was way too disjointed. I can appreciate the author interspersing her research with the story line, but I think she jumped around way too much. (2) The author is white and she did not adequately address, at least for me, how a white author writing a book about a poor black woman and her poor family (and presumably making money from said book) is fundamentally different from or better than white scientists making money from said black woman's cells, which she seems to suggest is unfair to the family. I did think her afterword did a good job of setting out the competing ethical and economic issues involved in tissue research without making her own position obvious, but she seems to be more sympathetic to the family in the rest of the book."
245,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3680008-michael,4,"I was always intrigued with the life of Henrietta Lacks. Reading this book expanded my little knowledge about her contribution to the medical field. Told from an outsider who always was,interested in her life,this book broadly described who Lacks was an individual. Despite the technical science language,I enjoyed reading about the childhood of Lacks,her rough upbringing and how she is still relevant today.I always been inquisitive about African American history and how things have changed since then. So many triumphs and heartaches,but glad that they overcame obstacles. Back to the book,it was hard to read through all the trials that Lacks been through. Interestingly enough,this book was,more about the people who influenced Lacks life than Lacks herself. Yet,it did not sway away from the shocking facts that you probably will never read in history books.Very good book,I am more intrigued by Lacks story!"

I will be forever grateful we will never know exactly what she suffered. Her image will stay with me for a very long time. This is a story that explores the kinds of assumptions that drive research and medical practices, about the assumptions a society makes about the relative value of particular race, demographic group(s), and/or profession and how those assumptions can reverberate in the lives of real, living, breathing human beings. It's a story of a society wrestling with the implications of the inequalities it's created and in fact requires in order to thrive. It's also about a family and their love for and struggles with one another. It's an amazing and beautiful book filled with amazing and beautiful and very real people."
247,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2900445-leslie-jenison,4,"I listened to this as an audiobook. What a fascinating story. I love how the author became intrigued by the story of the HeLa cells, and the fact that it took her 10 years to do the research for the book. There are so many things to consider when thinking about this story: how far we have come in terms of treatment modalities for cancer, the ethics of medical research, privacy of information, informed consent, providing information to patients in language that they can understand. Perhaps my perspective is a bit skewed by the fact that I have a medical background, but I believe the author explains complex information about cellular research in a way that is understandable to anyone. "
248,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3060349-karen-r,4,"I recommend this to those who like history and science. The author is to be praised for her exhaustive research into the history of HeLa cells and how they've made an impact on lives around the world to this day. Interesting and enlightening. However, my favorite chapters had to do less with the science aspect but more on the human side of Henrietta and her extended family, who experienced first-hand the poverty and racism in America and the abuse of African-Americans by the American medical community. We learn how each of them dealt with Henrietta's cells being used without their consent and the fact that the production of HeLa cells was commercialized without the Lacks family receiving a penny - most of whom remained poor their entire lives. They couldn't even get health insurance! "

Part memoir of Rebecca on the challenges brought in even getting to write this story. It jumps around quite a bit as it bounds around each of the three parts.What the Lackses went through depressed me. The callousness of Johns Hopkins does not really surprise me. The enormity of what science was able to accomplish was amazing. But the scientific misunderstandings the family suffered through, to me, is the worst part. For example, Rebecca helped Henrietta's daughter understand cloned cells is not the same thing as cloning Dolly the sheep, so she would not see her mother wandering all over London."

I have used human cancer cell lines in my schooling and I was so interested to see this ""human"" side to the story. This book was very well researched and compiled. Even though it is a work of non-fiction, I could still feel the emotions pretty strongly from the family members and other people interviewed. It was so interested to learn the history (as bad as it many times was) and to see how much things have changed in the medical science field. I absolutely recommend this to EVERYONE."

The abuse of these people and the humanisation of their story makes this a great book with plenty to think about."

Until I started reading, though, I had never put “Henrietta Lacks” and “HeLa” together.The impact that Henrietta's cells have had on scientific and medical discoveries in the last few decades is truly astounding. It was especially heartbreaking to see how Henrietta’s death affected her children. Skloot’s research provided very valuable information and I’m certainly glad I read this book, even if she did jump from subject to subject a lot. "

There was a lot of medical stuff that bogged the story down for me!!! I wish there had been more about Henrietta and less about her family... I was truly expecting to be more WOWWED by this book based on all the reviews!!! I felt like this book could've been 200 pages and done the same job conveying the story and the ethical issues presented!!! Sad to say that it was just'ok' for me... found myself being bored by the end!!!

But when I finally did, I finished it within 24 hours. It was extremely compelling and much more readable than I'd anticipated. This book is both a biography and a memoir. And in telling the story of Henrietta Lacks and her offspring, Skloot also recounts her personal experience searching for that story. She addresses issues of biomedical ethics and race and class tensions which make the book still so relevant."

260,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37406252-lindsay-detwiler,5,"Some books you read are entertaining, engaging, or page-turners. Some books are exciting, interesting, and fun. Although The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks has some of these qualities, there is one major quality that stands out from the rest: Importance. This book has great importance.Henrietta Lacks is a woman who has impacted millions of lives and probably indirectly impacted your life--yet few people know her story. Before Skloot, few people even knew her real name. This book is important because it gives a face to the name that has been so influential in science. Moreover, it is important because it addresses so many deep and potentially controversial issues, from racial tension to medical ethics to scientific research. This is a book to make you think but also to help you celebrate the life of a woman who certainly deserves our accolades.Henrietta Lacks died early in life from cervical cancer--but not before doctors at Johns Hopkins could take some of her cells for study. These cells proved immortal, leading to advances in tissue research and cell research. As the cells defied all odds of the time period and became immortal, they allowed for many scientific discoveries. The cells were used for everything from developing new medicines to searching for cures for cancer to testing nuclear radiation. Henrietta's cells quickly became the foundation worldwide for scientific study.This sounds like a noble pursuit and a positive thing. There are just a few problems with the endeavor. 1.) Henrietta Lacks never gave permission for this study, and her family was never even informed about the studies until years later 2.) The cells of Henrietta became a multi-million dollar industry, of which Henrietta's family never saw a penny.This book stirs so many emotions. First, I think this book stirs great sympathy. To read about Henrietta's immense suffering at the clutches of cancer is very sad. To hear about her families struggles afterward also really grips the reader. Skloot does an excellent job at portraying the human side of Lacks' story when no one else really did. Most only remember Henrietta as HeLa cells. They see her as a scientific commodity. Skloot puts emotion to the story and paints a picture of a strong woman dealt some difficult hands in life. I appreciated the honor and tribute Skloot paid to Henrietta in making her personal story known.The book also incited a lot of questioning and even anger within me. This story raises crucial questions about bioethics and how far science should go in the sake of discovery. The concept of medical testing and experimentation being done without consent was, quite frankly, frightening. It raises the question of ethics and what elements of the individual and privacy should be sacrificed in the name of science, a question that Skloot clearly emphasizes as a murky question. Although Henrietta's cells certainly lead to groundbreaking discoveries, the idea that this was done behind the family's back is angering. Perhaps the most frustrating part is the commercialism of the endeavor. The fact that these cells were sold for large amounts of money calls into question the motives of some of the scientists involved. The fact that the Lacks family struggled with poverty while scientists selling Henrietta's cells were making millions seems completely unjust.Finally, Skloot sheds light on racial tensions of Henrietta's time period. To learn about medical treatment--and the lack thereof--of African Americans during Henrietta's time period really opened my eyes. This is an issue not heavily discussed, but to hear about the lack of treatment or the sub par treatments afforded to certain races during this time period is angering. Skloot highlights how medical treatment and science aren't always a cut and dry issue. Politics, social values, and money all play a role in who gets treated and how.Some critics of this book find Skloot to paint herself as a hero. I did not find this to be the case. While she is inserted into the narrative throughout, it is to discuss her research endeavors. I believe this highlighted the depth and complexity of Henrietta's story. It showed just how much work it took for Skloot to find the truth. It showed how layered the truth was and how much mystery surrounded a woman who is still regarded as having the most important cells in science. I admire Skloot for all of the work she did to find the story and to tell the real truth about Henrietta Lacks. I do believe that paints her as someone to be admired. I did not feel like she wrote the book in a way that focused on that. I truly felt that her focus was on shedding light on Henrietta the woman instead of HeLa, the scientific entity. I believe she paid tribute to a difficult and sometimes controversial subject in the most sensitive, respectful way she could without sugarcoating the hard truths surrounding the story.This book should be read by everyone because of the importance of Henrietta's cells and how much they have contributed to science. I think we owe it to Henrietta to learn her personal story and to put a face, emotions, and personality to the cells talked about in scientific terms in so many contexts. I also think it is crucial that we explore the issues presented in this book such as tissue ownership, bioethics, and the motives of science in medicine in order to be prepared for the future. Henrietta's story is a cautionary tale in many ways. It cautions us to live life to the fullest, but it also cautions us that medicine is not always a cut and dry subject. Furthermore, it forces us to explore a human, controversial question about how much we are willing to sacrifice in terms of individual privacy and well-being for scientific exploration. Skloot's book does a beautiful job at weaving together these questions in bioethics with the personal tale of a woman I now feel like I know. She sheds light on a story often overlooked in history. Most of all, she puts a story to the woman, hands on hips, who appears in so many textbooks. Skloot has ensured that the world now knows her real name and much, much more. Thank you, Rebecca Skloot, for telling the story of a woman almost forgotten by science, by history, and by the world"
261,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9613048-ananya-m,4,"I had a slow start with this book, mainly bc it’s non fiction, but I am now so attacked to these people, I feel like I know them. I’m not used to reading real stories about real people which is why it took me a while to get into it. This story was simply fascinating, I learned so much about science, cell biology and how one woman’s cells helped develop a vaccine for innumerable illnesses like cancer, AIDS and polio. What hospitals did to exploit people of colour in the 50’s is explained in detail, it is painful and horrifying to learn of what they did without consent. Henrietta Lacks’ cells were taken without her consent, and without telling her family, and they turned out to be some of the most important ones in the world, even now. It’s a beautiful book, full of relationships, family and the way Henrietta impacted humanity. "
262,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48404-jg-introverted-reader,4,"HeLa cells (named after the woman they came from, Henrietta Lacks) have been used for about 60 years by scientists all over the world for all kinds of cellular research. Yet very few scientists could tell you the real name of the woman the cells came from, much less anything about her. Yet somehow, Rebecca Skloot stumbled onto the cells in a high school biology class. The teacher even got Henrietta's name right. The lesson spawned a years-long fascination with HeLa cells, Henrietta Lacks herself, her family, and the ethical questions that arise from the story. This book is the product of that research.I would honestly never have picked this book up on my own, but I've heard so many good things about the audio version that I decided to give it a try. One can't listen to fluff alone! All the praise is well-deserved.There is so much to chew over here. Parts were pretty upsetting, for a lot of different reasons. Henrietta's children had a very hard life after she passed away, and as I told my husband just a bit about it, he cut me off and said, ""Why do you always read books like that? Doesn't it depress you?"" Yes, it does, but it also reminds me how good I have it in comparison. We all need a little attitude adjustment occasionally, and difficult books like this serve that purpose for me. But aside from the family's personal hardships, it was hard to hear about Henrietta's death. It was not by any means an easy one. And then, less personal but more relevant to most of us, there were the ethical questions raised by Henrietta's story. I know times have changed, but I was appalled by the complete disregard for the family. Privacy was barely a concern for anyone, much less informed consent. The family didn't know anything about Henrietta's cells in research until decades after her death. Decades. Fifty years later, no one had ever taken the time to explain what was going on with the cells and the family couldn't tell fact from fiction. A collection of all Henrietta's cells at that time would weigh tons? There are a lot of clones of Henrietta walking around in London? It all sounded equally crazy and therefore equally plausible. This is only a side note to the story, but it rang so true with me that I have to mention it. A woman who was present at Henrietta's partial autopsy mentioned how much Henrietta's toenail polish bothered her. The woman had kept a clinical distance until then, but those toes made her realize that the body on the table had been a living, breathing person shortly before. I have mentioned in my review of Second Hand Heart that I used to very occasionally be the tiniest of tiny cogs in the organ donation process, doing electrocardiograms on organ donors before any harvesting began. I clearly remember a beautiful fifty-ish female organ donor and how much her perfect manicure bothered me. I never had full detachment when I had to fill that role, but she bothered me a lot. She had no idea what was in store for her when she got that manicure. So I know exactly where the observer was coming from.The book focused a little more on the family than I expected. My heart broke for them. They seem to have had such hard lives. And the research done on their mother's cells has done so much good for so many people, but they themselves don't even have the health insurance to be able to afford any of the medications or other advances that she helped bring about. There's something just not right there. The very last section was all about the ethics of cell research and where we stand today. I for one was surprised. I may not have the details exactly right, so don't hold me to any of this, but really, we don't have any rights to our own tissue. We mostly assume that if, say, our spleen is removed, it's going to be incinerated, right? There are no guarantees that's what's going to happen. There is apparently usually some small print buried in the consent form that lets the hospital or doctor or someone use it however they see fit. There are arguments that if we as individuals retain any rights to our tissue, we can throw up roadblocks to research. But what  does happen? A company gets a patent on a gene (like a breast cancer gene) and charges ridiculous amounts of money for other researchers to use it. So much for cooperation for the common good, right? This really happened.Maybe I was tuned out (I'm not a perfect audio book listener), but I wish there had been a bigger section about all the things HeLa cells have been used for. They're so common, it's probably hard to narrow down the list and then write meaningfully about it. Let's face it, something like ""HeLa has been used to manufacture the polio vaccine, develop the atomic bomb, and has been sent into space"" would get a little boring. But I wish I had a bigger idea about the research. Like I said, it might have been in there and I was too busy yelling at the drivers around me to notice.I really liked Cassandra Campbell's narration. She was very clear and easy to listen to. Maybe I was projecting, but I thought she sounded a little upset when she was reading the worst parts about the abuse Henrietta's children endured. It made her seem more human instead of just an emotionless voice reading me this book.You don't have to be a scientist to understand this book by any means. If you're interested in any of the topics--the research, the ethics, or the personal story--grab this one. I recommend the audio, but I'm sure this is a fascinating book in any format."
263,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15508217-lisa-montanaro,4,"This book was wonderful. Well researched with such a good balance of science and personal stories about the Lacks family. It is both disturbing and fascinating. Certainly opened my eyes to cell collection and research on a global level, as well as how it impacted the African American community and Henrietta Lacks and her family specifically. This story will stay with me. I will never forget the sacrifice that Ms. Lacks made, unknowingly, and how much HELA cells have done for the advancement of medicine. I just wish it hadn’t been at such a cost to her and her family."
264,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70632050-robin-tobin-on-the-back-porch-reading,5, Very interesting.... PopSugar 2020 for medical thriller. 
265,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17824940-janel,5,I had no idea I would enjoy this book so much. The author weaves a wonderful story in with many facts from countless hours of research. 
266,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6461259-conner,5,"Skloot ambitiously weaves together decades of family history and medical developments, scientific ethics, and issues of racism and poverty into a compelling and cohesive narrative. I can’t help but wonder how much better the general public’s understanding of science would be if we viewed all topics through such human stories."
267,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4673653-elizabeth,5,Well written. Science is understandable and kept interesting. Highly recommended. 
268,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3197487-patti,3,"I can do math, language arts, English, social studies, health, and even some art/music/gym, but I can NOT do science. So I picked up this book hoping I would learn me some science. And I did--I loved the science parts. With just the science parts, this book would have been 4.5 stars easily. As it was written though, it was more 2.5 than 3.First, I learned A LOT about science and cells and DNA (oh my!). Those parts were easy to understand and I enjoyed them immensely. Before I saw the Law & Order that is loosely based on this case, I had no idea that this sort of thing was happening. So for the great science writing, I recommend this book.I also think it's important to remember Henrietta as a person. She should be more than a scientific footnote (and she's sometimes not even that) and I have a feeling that if she were white and/or male, she would have gotten much more recognition. So for honoring someone who should have gotten recognition, I recommend this book.But the stuff about the Lacks descendants...Lord have mercy. I do have to credit the author for being nonjudgmental about Lacks' batshit crazy family. I really don't know why she included so much stuff about this group that is dysfunctional at best, downright nasty at worst. Did she want us to say things like ""I do have to credit the author for being nonjudgmental about Lacks' batshit crazy family"" and then judge them ourselves and feel bad about being so judgmental? Cuz that's kinda what happened for me. She indicated all of this weird shit and then was like, ""Ta da! Going on to something else now!"" Why include that stuff? How does that help honor Henrietta's memory?There was no time during the book that I loved Deborah. At some point in the book, she wrote off her troubled son saying there was nothing she could do, as the ""Devil"" had him. That's convenient. Takes the responsibility off her, huh? I'm sorry that her mother had a crappy life and died horribly, but that is not uncommon in life. You can't keep using that as an excuse to be an asshole. And that scene near the end, where the cousin ""channeled"" God simply did not need to be in there. I was seriously doubting these folks' sanity at that point and if that kind of shit started going on around me, I'da been outta there like yesterday. I also didn't really care about the youngest ""don't call him Joe!"" brother. (Did we need to know he was 400 pounds? Really? Why?) Again, how long can you blame the treatment of your mother for your anger and for being a dick? At some point, you have got to man (or woman) up and taking responsibility.I do wish that the author should have spent more time discussing the issue of being paid for cells. In my wildest dreams, I would never even consider the idea that the Lacks family should get money for this. Now yes, they should have been told what their mother's cells did for science and yes, they were treated like crap by a bunch of white asshole doctors, but I don't see why they should be paid for this. Now, if they wanted to use this knowledge and somehow market it for themselves--start a museum, sell ""I Heart Henrietta"" t-shirts at Hopkins, give speeches--that is fine. Really, that's what the scientists did. The mom had the cells taken, but the doctors and scientists did the work. Without them, the cells would have died with her. But as for the family actually being paid for the cells themselves? Uh, no.Btw, I know that some white person somewhere is going to bitch about the dialect that she used. Let me tell you, as someone who works with blacks from the South--that IS the dialect. There is nothing disrespectful or racist about how she quotes them. There is nothing wrong with this dialect and quite honestly, I love the dialect. If she had made them ""talk white"", I would have stopped reading the book because the cool dialect was sometimes the only thing that made me not want to smack the shit out of the Lacks family.So if someone took the book, cut out the crap about the descendants (except maybe the grandson Davon, who was awesome), then I would reread it again. Otherwise, it's going back to the library to await its next reader."
269,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26460780-janeane-diaz,4,"Rebecca Skloot’s “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks” tells the story of Henrietta Lacks, a young African American who has cervical cancer. The book is set on Clover, Virginia, during a time of racism and segregation, when African Americans were free but didn’t receive the respect and rights an American should be entitled to. Wanting to get rid of her illness and continue her normal life with her family, Lacks trusts the doctors of John Hopkins Hospital to treat her cancer and do all they can to help her get better. Unfortunately, they do not succeed. Lacks and her family had no idea that her growing cells were being used as a test subject, a procedure many doctors did to colored patients. The book combines the topics of cancer, racism, scientific ethics, and poverty.One memorable and important event in this book was when Dr.Richard Wesley TeLinde, a top cervical cancer expert, took samples of Lack’s tumorous cervix and healthy cervical tissue without Lacks knowing. He then gave the samples to Dr. George Gey, another doctor specializing in cells. Gey brought the same samples into his lab, where they’ve been spending so much time trying to grow cells. Mary Kubicek, Gey’s assistant, wasn't surprised when she saw the samples. She was used to disappointment, knowing that these cells would die. Surprisingly, the cells, which they called HeLa cells, continued to grow and fit each container Kubicek put them in. This discovery of Lack’s “immortal cells” was the beginning of her life changing story. Ultimately, her story and her international contribution to science is a story of selfish people using Lack’s cells to make discoveries, without giving any credit to her, forgetting about the family she still has, and forever changing their lives. It all adds up to a tale of the carelessness and selfish motives of people, an example that shows the ignorance society has which is sad to see in a country that is supposed to be a place of equality and happiness for all. This book tells that the story very well, showing success and victories for science and the sorrow and tragedies of the Lack’s family. This is definitely a great book that everyone should read. Skloot did a marvelous job combining science and society. Although Lacks gets no credit for any of the things her cells contributed, the author made it clear that because of her, all these things were possible. Skloot wasn’t like others who would get information and not even bother to see if it was right, Skloot involved Henrietta’s family with everything, and got the real story. The topics of cancer, racism, scientific ethics, and poverty are thoroughly incorporated in this book which makes it very interesting and fun to read. This is one of these books that makes you want to keep turning the page. This book taught me so much. This book includes a lot of information regarding biology, specifically cells. It expanded my knowledge about cells and their capabilities. This book also made me realize how horrible society was back then. I knew during those times, discrimination and inequality was everywhere., but I never thought it was this crazy. The way Skloot describes what the Lack’s family went through from their childhood up to today made me realize how thankful I should be for everything I have. I learned that there are many selfish people in this world and we’re all going to have to deal with it. We can’t stop them from getting what they want, despite of how unjust their actions are. Reading this book made me feel somewhat guilty. I have such a loving family, who cares and wants what’s best for me, yet I complain when they ask me to do something so little as cleaning my room. We have it so easy in our generation. At no cost, a sickness can be cured in the matter of months. Today, we are all equal. Lack’s had to go through so much more. Her family couldn’t be together all the time. The treatments she went through were far more than what we call painful. She didn’t have the respect get today. Because of Lacks, millions of people survived from a sickness. She definitely changed the world. "
270,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548813-natalie-curiousreader,4,"In 'The immortal life of Henrietta Lacks', Rebecca Skloot gives a much needed voice to an unsung heroine of medicine, whose cells has benefited us all. The story starts with a young black woman, married and with kids, getting the diagnosis of cancer. As part of her treatment, cells are removed for testing - the doctors soon discovers that her cells are remarkable in their ability to reproduce and prosper, making them perfect for research and medical experiments. The cells are saved and later used without the knowledge or consent from Henrietta herself, who shortly afterwards pass away from the cancer. The rest of the book goes on to tell two disparate stories - the first is the story of Henrietta's family in the aftermath of her death, the contact Skloot initiates to write the book and the process of piecing together both Henrietta's story and her family's. The other is the story of the cells themselves - named ""HeLa"" after their life-source - and the tremendous medical discoveries dependent on the access of those cells. Most of the time this book is incredibly angering and frustrating, saddening and incomprehensible. The ill-treatmet that Henrietta's family faces in journalists using their story for easy entertainment-value or the lack of respect or true consent over one's own body and cells from doctors and other medical staff is both infuriating and disheartening to read; while the cell removal itself raises important questions about ethics in medicine - some of which are not so easy to answer, as the author also points out at the end - the lack of proper respect payed to the woman whose cells have brought so much valuable progress is undeniable. Rebecca Skloot does a magnificent job of righting that wrong through the writing of this book - and an engaging one it is at that. This is a perfect example of the kind of story that has easily slipped through the cracks in history, especially of pieces of history where women have featured lead roles - this book is surely a classic piece of nonfiction that will stand for a long time to come.

272,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/727334-amy,5,"As a person who isn't particularly interested in medical non-fiction, I found myself really engaged in this non-fiction account of HeLa cells and the woman whose cells have had such an impact on modern medicine. I'm not a huge non-fiction reader (primarily because I find it difficult to find compelling non-fiction) but this particular book is fantastic. It's very engaging, very accessible and not at all 'over my head.' The mix of science and human interest was blended so effortlessly by Rebecca Skloot. I was amazed at how readable the medical aspects were for me. How Skloot made those sections interesting and relevant to a non-science fan like me! The human interest pieces were just heartbreaking for me. The honest look at poverty, racism, education and crime was very well done. Skloot's skill at weaving these more heartfelt pieces with the necessary biographical, medical and ethical pieces was just incredible! It came off so effortlessly to me as a reader. I felt bad for Henrietta's children and the impact of her death and all that came after that for each of them. They did not/have not have/had easy lives. I definitely think that the anger that they expressed repeatedly through the book was directly related to poverty and a lack of education. It came off as almost being greed in some instances in the book but I think that it really comes down to the cycle of poverty and abuse. The family couldn't understand any of this to any level of depth which I think made it impossible for them to understand the nuances that are at play when it comes to compensation, ethics, etc. In the end, I am thankful that the Lacks had Rebecca Skloot in their life to help them gain a better understanding of things. It seemed to me that once the understanding was there, the anger began to dissipate. And they were able to move beyond the anger into understanding and pride that their mother's cells were able to help so many people.I found a great deal of the socioeconomic aspects of the book just heartbreaking because of how difficult it is for someone surrounded by poverty, abuse and dysfunction to make the right choices that will lead down the right path. It happens but it is RARE. As a former social worker who worked with many families and individuals that struggled with escaping the cycle of poverty and abuse, it's very very very difficult even when opportunities come about. It's difficult to step out of your comfort zone (no matter how dysfunctional, depressing or heartbreaking it may be) to try to change yourself or your circumstances. I also think that any compensation for the family would not have actually help them economically or otherwise. They really needed to heal as a family and get perspective on something that was outside of their understanding.In the end, I absolutely enjoyed the reading of this book and recommend it wholeheartedly. It's a fantastic book that will stay with you after you close the book. It will make you think. It will give you perspective. It's just wonderful."
273,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24902718-sondous,5,"Can I give this book more than five stars???This book is a masterpiece. A literal masterpiece. It tells you Everything you need to know about Henrietta Lacks. I cannot imagine what it took Rebecca Skloot to write all of this. The sequence of events is perfect. The order in which each piece of information is presented in is perfect. The writing is perfect. Everything about this book is perfectIt was so painful to read about all the experiences in this book. Especially Deborah's. Everything she's gone through and how she carried on even when all the doors closed. And especially that this is non fiction - everything in this book is real. It all happened. Deborah was real. She was a person. Henrietta was a person. Elsie was a person. And this book yet again showcased examples of discrimination & awful treatment of black people. Many of the incidents were devastating. But Deborah went through it all. She died a ""nice and calm"" death. She never gave up. She was so inspiring. All throughout the book I found myself admiring Deborah and her courage to carry on and keep going. She was so lonely and she just missed her mother and her sister. She couldn't even trust Skloot until much later. She was afraid and just wanted a friend.And she always was hopeful no matter how bad things got(view spoiler)[As I neared the end of the book where Deborah has more role in researching information about her mother, I found myself hoping I'd get to meet her one day. I thought that maybe I'd get to see her talk at some conference or meet her or something. But soon in the last chapter Skloot revealed that she passed away (not sure if this is a spoiler) may she Rest In Peace  (hide spoiler)]It was also super cool to read about the evolution of science throughout the years. It's amazing how scientists have always been obsessed with immortality. And finding a cure for cancer. All the newspapers headlines were freaking out about HeLa cells and it kinda reminded me of Buzzfeed lol. But seriously thought reading how there were many different cases in which patients didn't consent the use of their tissue for research, and the story about the Jewish doctors who refused to do such a thing as injecting a patient without telling them they were injecting them with cancerous cells; those people were all brave. They wrote history, and in the same way, we are writing history today too. Humans have always been the same, and it's amazing to think of how slowly, little by little, laws were passed to protect people like Henrietta - and really, everyone - from their tissues being taken to be experimented with without their permission Besides Deborah and her inspiring person, this book has a way of presenting the events and what is relevant to what you're reading. It sure keeps jumping backs and forth between interviews and scientific stories and important incidents; but it was all in order. It truly read like a novel. It was entertaining and full of every detail you'd need in order to understand HeLa and what the Lackses had to go through in order to learn about their mother "
274,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,3,"(Update as of August 2013 at bottom.)Excellent, but not really a science book. Which is only of interest to me because it was the book-of-the-month for a one science café's reading group I sometimes attend, and the author read and answered questions at another science café I go to.Of course, science forms a large part of the background story. The changing paradigm of scientific ethics, actually, is central to how HeLa became famous and, now, infamous.But the twin narratives that really drive this book aren't scientific stories. One was the tale of how the HeLa cells got into the research domain in the first place, and how it has been used since then — and how a lack of understanding of the virulence of the cell line has caused no small number of problems.The other narrative was the personal story of how the author slowly won over the survivors of Lacks' family. Synergistically, the research Skloot had to do for the first was exactly what let her break through the barrier of suspicion and mistrust: the Lacks family didn't have the knowledge, skill or contacts to do the research that Skloot did, and her persistence in transparently sharing her findings with the family slowly brought them around.Unfortunately, I was reading this primarily as a science book, and in that context it only earns three stars: ""liked it"". Although this is non-fiction, I've also tagged it as ""chick-lit"" because the larger story is really a melodramatic one that I suspect really appeals to the Oprah crowd. So, if you enjoyed Steel Magnolias but also enjoy the domain of science non-fiction, this might be a sweet read.      •       •       •       •       •       •       •Update, summer 2013—The New York Times reports that the family of Henrietta Lacks is now formally involved in the research into their ancestor's cell line, which is satisfactory at least due to the privacy considerations about their own genetics, as well as ameliorating the unsettling sense of injustice at their complete disassociation from the research. The case served as an extreme example in the debate over research and medical use of tissue harvested for other purposes.

275,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7364359-sunil,5,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks was on pretty much every Top Ten Books of 2010 list. It is the story of Henrietta Lacks, a black woman in the fifties who had cervical cancer. A doctor at Johns Hopkins took her cells without asking, and those cells, dubbed HeLa, never died. And they single-handedly (single-cellularly?) changed the face of science and medicine as we know it. This is not hyperbole, and Skloot makes it clear through the many, many examples of research in which HeLa cells were instrumental. Vaccines, new therapies, new understanding of cancer itself, new insights into DNA, and so on. Without these cells—which I have worked with myself—I cannot imagine where we would be today.While Skloot makes sure we understand the importance of the cells, her focus is on Henrietta Lacks, the woman from whom those cells were taken. Yes, taken. These cells were taken from her, they were grown, they were sold, and she and her family received nothing. It is one hell of an irony that Henrietta's cells revolutionized modern medicine, but her children can't afford health insurance. But this is not an angry, condemning book. Skloot—a science writer who explains the science and scientific discoveries with ease—is more interested in the human element. Who was Henrietta? Where did she grow up? Who knew her? What do her children know about her? Well, it took them a couple decades, but they did find out that the cells of their mother were still floating around all over the world, and they weren't too pleased.The book is divided into three sections: Birth, which mainly concerns the life of Henrietta Lacks; Death, which mainly concerns the scientific and medical revolution her cells caused; and Immortality, which continues that thread and introduces bioethics into the mix but mainly focuses on Skloot's interactions with the Lacks family as she does research for the book. To my surprise, despite my desire to know more about Henrietta—the reason I read the book—and my fascination with all the science, my favorite part of the book, the part when I was most engaged, was the last hundred pages, as Skloot forms a relationship with Deborah Lacks, Henrietta's daughter, and, together, they find out what they can about her mother. Perhaps because this is when Skloot is telling a very personal story, it feels so much more real and intimate. Skloot has a real knack for storytelling, however, and she's given very good material by, you know, the facts. So much of what she's describing is probably public knowledge but to someone who's unfamiliar with all the details, man, are you in for some fucking surprises.It's a book that touches on faith, science, racism, bioethics, life, death, medicine, family, and many other things in an incredibly readable, well-researched fashion. It's a story that needed to be told, and it's a marvelous accomplishment."
276,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4628619-judgyk,5,"In general, I prefer fiction to nonfiction. That isn’t a knock on nonfiction at all – I prefer reading as a means of escape, and often nonfiction doesn’t offer enough of a break from reality for me, what with it being based on reality and all. Plus, I find a lot of nonfiction to be rather dry. Such it is. Not all, but a good chunk of it.The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is not at all dry. It was fascinating and I couldn’t put it down. Ripped right through the thing, hardly waiting to see what happened next. Basically, Rebecca Skloot took a biology class at a community college. In the midst of learning about cells, her professor mentioned that the HeLa line of immortal cells, which have been used for countless bits of life-saving research, came from a woman named Henrietta Lacks. Skloot got curious, and spent ten years of her life learning about Henrietta’s life, and the ongoing life of the HeLa cells.The book alternates between Henrietta’s life – growing up on a tobacco plantation, marriage, kids, and ultimately her cancer, the story of HeLa – how the cells were harvested, how they grew, and where they went and what they did for science, and Skloot’s story of tracking down and meeting Henrietta’s family. Henrietta never knew that any of her cancer cells were taken, and never gave permission for them to be taken. Her family learned of it years later, long after the HeLa line had been passed scientist-to-scientist around the world and had been mass-produced in labs for huge profits. None of that matters, of course. Doctors don’t need permission, don’t need to tell patients, and patients (and their families) retain no ownership in such cells.All three stories are engaging and woven together in a way that makes sense. Skloot explains much of the science without dumbing it down or talking over readers’ heads. That is a true gift.My only gripe was that Skloot spent too much time patting herself on the back. Other white folks tried to talk to the Lacks family but she got through because she really had their best interests. The Lackses were very skeptical but she was so awesome that they warmed up to her and love her now. Nobody ever explained just what the cells did to the Lackses but Rebecca showed up and she told them all the things and made it all better because she is JUST THAT GOOD. Eyeroll. But I guess that’s part of what happens when you’re telling a story that you’ve invested 10 years of your life in, and your involvement is part of the story. Can’t be too annoyed.Highly recommend this one. It was fantastic."
277,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,4,"WARNING: Reading this book may incite anger in the reader regarding racism, medical ethics and poverty.HeLa cells were first cultured in 1951. Nearly 60 years later The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks debuted and became a best seller. In between, there was a complex Lacks family history, a fascination with chicken heart immortality, and some very real groundbreaking science. Henrietta Lacks died of cancer in 1951, shortly after the tissue was removed from her body without her knowledge or permission and neither she nor her family benefited financially from the discoveries made possible by her cells. This fascinating book covers it all: the historic, the oddity, the racism and the science. For Rebecca Skloot the book is the culmination of a dream since she was a teenager about uncovering the story of the HeLa cells, both the star and the workhorse of cellular biology and laboratory experimentation. Just so there will be no confusion, the author begins with the assertion “This is a work of nonfiction. No names have been changed, no characters invented, no events fabricated.“ That is not to say that the story is easy to believe. But this is a well written, accessible and compelling book that is filled with lessons learned and unlearned.Much to be said about this book. And you will be happy to know that 9009 reviewers have collectively said all of it more than several times! So I will not add to it! I will gladly join the four star people and say that I am glad that my daughter in law Susan sent me a copy of this book. Would that the racism and poverty that are illuminated here could be eliminated from the world. It makes me angry that our system heaps so much adversity on so many people. HeLa cells have not been the panacea for the ills of society and it is ironic that the family of a woman who is the source of so much good has suffered so much. "
278,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4592109-lori-l-she-treads-softly,5,"In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Rebecca Skloot has written an intelligent, moving nonfiction narrative that tells the story of the Lacks family and the HeLa cells.Henrietta Lacks (1920-1951) was a poor African American woman who died from cancer in 1951 at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Without her consent, cells were taken from her cancerous cervical tumor at the free ""colored"" ward. These cells were given to a researcher who cultured them and created an immortal cell line used for medical research. The cell lines, called HeLa cells, have not only helped in vital medical research they have also made billions of dollars for the medical research industry.Henrietta's family, however, knew nothing about this cell line and once they learned about the ""immortal"" and living cell line twenty years after Henrietta's death, they had a multitude of misunderstandings, misgivings, and apprehensions concerning what this meant. They also wondered why there was no compensation provided to the family for these unique cells that were taken from Henrietta. It is an ironic fact that while the HeLa cells have been credited with a myriad of medical advancements, Henrietta's descendents cannot afford health insurance. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a biography about the woman from whom this cell line originated but it also is about her family, racism, class, medical research and medical ethics. The narrative alternates between the personal story of the Lacks family and the scientific history of the HeLa cells. Scientific advancement and discovery is shown along side the darker side of unethical medical practices. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks has won several awards, including the 2010 Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize for Nonfiction, the 2010 Welcome Trust Book Prize, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s Award for Excellence in Science Writing, the 2011 Audie Award for Best Non-Fiction Audiobook, and a Medical Journalists’ Association Open Book Award. Very Highly Recommended - one of the best; http://shetreadssoftly.blogspot.com/"
279,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/265156-yoonmee,2,"I'm somewhat torn on this book. I feel like there should be two reviews. The first review would say that this book does a great job exposing what happened to Henrietta Lacks, gives a good, brief history of how African Americans have been treated by medical professionals and the racism involved, gives some interesting and thought-provoking background on cell and tissue studies -- what our rights are, what they're not, etc.The second review would say that I'm not entirely sure what to make of Skloot. Yes, she tells a story that needs to be told, but sometimes her methods annoyed me. There were many questions going on in my head while reading this: Is Skloots taking advantage of the Lacks family, in particular Deborah Lacks, for her own gain? How does she differ from other white people who took advantage of the Lacks family? Does setting up a scholarship foundation for them negate all the time she spent harassing them? I mean, good grief, at one point she mentions how she would call Deborah to leave messages on her voice mail every few days for about ten months in an effort to convince Deborah to speak with her. Maybe Skloot gets points for persistence, but, in my book, she gets negative points for harassing someone who obviously didn't want to speak to her. I know journalists can be pretty pushy at times, but I just felt like Skloots crossed some lines by driving past Lacks family houses over and over, repeatedly calling them (not just a few times but every few days for almost a year!). She even admits that some of the brothers were eventually like, ""Alright, stop calling us! We'll talk to you!"" I don't know about you, but she seems kinda obnoxious.Her descriptions of the Lacks family sometimes border on compassionate and sometimes border on condescending. She often comes across as extremely patronizing when describing Deborah, which bothered me a lot. I'll just stop right there. Two stars because Skloot annoyed me with her obnoxious stalker-like behavior and her condescending tone towards the Lacks family."

Admittedly part of the problem is my preference for fiction novels. It was a bit difficult for me to connect to the ""characters"" involved, particularly the narrator. She's a scientist and a reporter, and I appreciate her intense research and her desire to share the facts, but her style made the story rather dry at times. I felt like I was hit over the head with the irony of mostly white scientists making money off a black woman's cells when her family couldn't afford their own health care. This is a tragic situation and should definitely be explored, but at times the book seemed a bit preachy to me.I'm glad I decided to finish the book because it did improve as it progressed. I enjoyed the scientific and spiritual aspects of the story--why did the HeLa cells survive outside Henrietta Lacks' body when no other cells could? The rationale behind the development of institutional review boards to monitor research ethics was eye-opening. And I chuckled hearing about ""Sir Lord Doctor"", the swindler ""attorney"" who tried to get hold of the family's medical records.I'll have to read some glowing reviews by other Goodreads readers, which undoubtedly will shed some light on my understanding of the story. For now I give it 3 stars."
281,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59633249-debsd,3,"This is a fascinating tale which is relevant to all of our lives. However although I enjoyed the book, I found myself bristling sometimes at the author's continual insertion of herself into the story of Henrietta and other Lacks family members. There is too much about how she first heard about Henrietta Lacks, about how she became intrigued, about how she explored the story, about how she convinced various people to talk to her...there is too much about the framework of how the book came about, which makes for occasionally tedious reading. There is often a self-congratulatory one about much of this, as well as something of a white saviour complex.That said, while I wish there had been less of the above, this is still an incredibly interesting, important story.I think I'll leave the final words to Henrietta's daughter, because she hits the nail on the head:When I go to the doctor for my checkups I always say my mother was HeLa. They get all excited, tell me stuff like how her cells helped make my blood pressure medicines and antidepression pills and how all this important stuff in science happen cause of her. But they don’t never explain more than just sayin, Yeah, your mother was on the moon, she been in nuclear bombs and made that polio vaccine. I really don’t know how she did all that, but I guess I’m glad she did, cause that mean she helpin lots of people. I think she would like that. But I always have thought it was strange, if our mother cells done so much for medicine, how come her family can’t afford to see no doctors? Don’t make no sense."
282,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10008363-salema,4,"I picked this book from a community bookshelf in my building. And all because as a science kid, Henrietta Lacks is a known name. But her story isn't.And for that reason, I am so very glad that Rebecca Skloot had taken it upon herself to introduce the person from whom these cells originated. Over the years in my scientific career, I have used hundreds and thousands of passages of HeLa cells, and never stopped to think twice about much else regarding its origin. Mostly because these days, with research, there are so many regulations as to how you go about procuring biological samples; I was unaware that Henrietta Lacks was never asked for her permission. Neither her nor her family have ever been recompensed from the profits companies are making from the sales of the cell line. HeLa cell lines have been used to produce recombinant proteins like insulin, for the creation of vaccines, they have been used in cancer, diabetes, and in all manners of research. These cell lines have also been sent up to the space. You would wonder why? Why her cells? Because it was the only immortalized cell line at the time. Every other cell line would lose viability after a few passages. But not HeLa. And that makes it one of the most valuable tools in the research industry. It was shocking to me to know that Henrietta Lacks' family did not know of all the scientific strides being made until one day someone asked them if they were proud of their mom. This book will have you understand and see how different parties were differently motivated and their feelings about the use of HeLa."
283,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/143168-diane,4,"This is a book that I want everyone I know to read. Not only because I 'really liked it' according the definition of a 4-star rating, but because I want everyone to know about Henrietta Lacks and all she has done for likely every human being born after 1951 and I want everyone to know about the author, Rebecca Skloot, who did such a wonderful job telling the story of Henrietta and her Henrietta's family.I learned ALOT from this book about what it was like to be poor, uneducated, and uninformed in the early 1950's and how things have changed since then. Some parts of this book contained scientific and medical information, yet the way the author wrote about it, I never felt bored or that it was written above my comprehension. That in itself was an accomplishment, I thought, for the author. But it goes far beyond that. Ms. Skloot became intrigued by Henrietta Lacks' contribution to the world of science and she tirelessly researched and patiently gained the trust of Henrietta's family, which was not easy to do. The family felt betrayed and only wanted their mother/wife/grandmother to be recognized and known to the world. The author truly had their best interests at heart and wanted the same thing. This book is a personal journey into the lives of an extremely modest family told through a woman who was able to give them all a voice. I hope that many people read the story of this unsung heroine, Ms. Henrietta Lacks. "
284,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,4,"Part medical history, part cellular biology, and part human interest story, this book raises awareness of the short life of Henrietta Lacks, a black woman with aggressive cancer of the cervix who died in 1951, and how her cancerous cells were preserved, grown, and used to advance medical research. The author explores ethical questions of informed consent and potential uses and abuses of tissue samples. She also shows the impact on the family. As with any book in which the author plays a significant role in the story, there are both benefits and drawbacks. On the plus side, she provides first hand reporting of and insight into the family members’ points of view. On the minus side, her presence occasionally detracts from the compelling storyline, while she digresses into family members hanging up on her or driving around the countryside looking for them. Skloot raises tough questions around such issues as tissue ownership rights, patents for biological material and who should profit from them, family and patient privacy concerns regarding the scientific use of genetic material. Overall, I thought the author did a good job of walking a fine line between the scientific community and the family, attempting to tell both sides in an impartial manner, while allowing the reader to form his or her own opinions. This book certainly provides plentiful “food-for-thought.” Recommended to those interested in medical research, biology, and biographies of remarkable people. "
285,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2734171-adam-clay,2,"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells three stories: the life of Henrietta Lacks and how cells from her terminal cervical cancer were harvested without her knowledge to create the immortal HeLa line of cells; her family's, particularly her daughter Deborah's, history after her death and their reaction to HeLa; and the author's efforts to track down Henrietta's story and her complicated relationship with Henrietta's family. Not all of these stories are equally compelling. Henrietta's story, and the story of her cells, is fascinating and touches on issues spanning from race to class to scientific ethics that still have an impact today. Unfortunately, the majority of the book is devoted to the author's interactions with Deborah, an erratic and paranoid woman who wears out her welcome long before she runs out of pages. Partly to blame is the book's structure; the author elected to interweave her quest to extract information from Henrietta's family with the information she ultimately gleaned from them. This drains her interactions with the family of any tension, as we already know how things turn out, and forces the author to repeat a lot of information: first when she presents it and later when she discovers it. Overall, the book is a fascinating piece of scientific journalism married unsuccessfully to a memoir and character sketch badly in need of trimming."
286,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/854699-brian,5,"You've probably never heard of Henrietta Lacks. I certainly hadn't but after reading this book, like myself, you probably will wish you did. Henrietta's life was short and not very vivid. She was a kind person, and a mother of 5. But at the age of 30, she came down with cervical cancer and gave the doctors of John Hopkins some of her cells. She soon passed away after receiving some awful sounding radiation therapy, and after the cancer spread. Here's the twist: her cells live on to this day. Nicknamed ""HeLa,"" her cells are used in research in any disease imaginable, mainly because unlike most people's cells, they have the unique ability to continue to multiply once leaving the body. The issues....Henrietta didn't know she was giving her cells up for that purpose at the time, which was 1951. IN addition, while her cells are producing millions of dollars for the medical community as they are sold, her living family lives in poverty, and were unaware their mother still existed in some form until many years later. This book is tackled by Skloot and is written so wonderfully. Medical terminology is clearly explained, and she even includes a cast of characters so you don't get the many names mixed up. By the end of this book, I was severely affected by this story, and i highly recommed this book to ANYONE, it is truly an excellent read!"
287,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22083484-barb,5,"If a doctor has ever removed a mole, an appendix, your tonsils a gallbladder or other organic substances from you, these bits and pieces may not have been immediately incinerated as you believed, but added to millions of other tissue samples already saved for medical research. You're ok with that, right? The world could benefit from a cure for cancer, say. But how would you feel if your pieces were sold around the globe, making profit for unknown persons without your consent or knowledge, while many in your family died early deaths due to a lack of affordable comprehensive health care. Rebecca Skloot shines a light on this issue in The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, a non-fiction book that reads like a novel. Actually, more like two novels: 1. The unlikely case of Henrietta Lacks, whose cancerous cervical cells have been living, reproducing and advancing medical science for many decades and 2. Skloot's 10-year story about the ""making of the book"" and her relationship with the Lacks family, particularly Henrietta's daughter, Rebecca, a lovable character no-one could have concocted. The settings-Johns Hopkins Hospital, the former Crownsville Hospital for the Negro Insane and several tiny Virginia towns became the focus of fascinating subplots as well. "
288,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"What a book! I don't know what took me so long to read The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. Part history, part science, it is an unforgettable story about science and American racial history.HeLa cell line is the first human cell line that grow in culture indefinitely. It was originally taken from a black American woman called Henrietta Lacks who was diagnosed with and died of cervical cancer. HeLa cells have helped scientists all over the world to make crucial scientific discoveries from polio vaccination, cancer research, to IVF, gene editing and many many more.This book took the author 10 years to finish. Chapters iterate between the life of Henrietta Lacks and her family, and HeLa's contribution in scientific research. I am sympathetic to the family, who felt wronged. Their mother's cells were taken without consent. No one notified the family until 25 years later when a scientist wanted their blood to do more research. The financial gain from the cell line did not benefit the family at all. It's a complicated situation. Racial divide and injustice caused and reinforced by misunderstanding and distrust. It's a shock to me that even to this day, no law governs how human tissues should be used."

O no, This is not a book for me! The next morning I woke up and felt a pain and immediately thought ""do I have cancer?"" Yes I am a bit of a hypochondriac, I admit it. lol.Anyways, I did find it very interesting cause I had the worst biology teacher ever (or maybe it was me come to think of it, worst pupil?) and do not know much about that subject.After reading half I did have a bit of a How shall I call it, not really wanting to read more cause I did not really like the way the family of Henriette acted in the book but I am glad I read on. I've learned a lot and even though it appears these people seemingly always shout, I see the good in them and understand now better how hard it was for them to find out.The questions at the end of the book are intriguing and I am planning to google more about tissue donation, the law about that , Hela cells and the likes. So after all I am not regretting having bought this book. "

The history of HeLa and Henrietta Lacks is one that should never be forgotten, but sadly almost every scientist knows about HeLa, but very few know who Henrietta Lacks was. Her story should be more widely known than what it is today, she deserves that credit. HeLa truly revolutionized the world of science and medicine, but at what cost? Where do we draw the lines for right or wrong? It’s a book that inspires so many questions about ethics and morals, and some of them don’t have an easy answer or solution. But what is clear is this: without Henrietta Lacks and HeLa, we wouldn’t have the medical care and cures we have today and she deserves to be remembered as a human being, and not just for her remarkable cells.

291,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2127114-suzanne-moore,5,"I was most surprised to learn that HeLa cells went to the moon! It astonishes me how far researchers go to discover what can be learned and accomplished. It is amazing that a microscopic piece of an abnormal growth can do so much. How ironic that a cell which multiplied so rapidly and killed a woman, is used to save the lives of millions of people. I don't really have a scientific mind and prior to reading this book never gave a second thought about the process of medicinal breakthroughs. I have developed a new respect for cancer cell research.Henrietta's story was filled with sadness and hardship … handed down from one generation to the next. My heart broke for her daughter Elsie and the terrible treatment she received at the asylum she was sent to when her mother fell sick. The surviving Lacks children felt cheated and incomplete without their mother. But when Rebecca Skloot brought to light the story behind HeLa cells, her family gained some sense of dignity despite the suffering they all endured."
292,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3082173-charlene-intriago,5,"Amazing book based on subject matter and very well written. The author spent many years researching and countless hours interviewing. She has given us the incredible story of Henrietta Lacks and heartbreaking story of her family. She has also touched on issues within the medical community, scientific research, big pharma, government oversite (or lack thereof), and asks the questions ""who owns our cells, who can take them, and who can profit from them"". I loved the way the author heads each chapter with a timeline so we know where we are in history and I could relate to it because it happened within my lifetime. Since this all started back in 1951, I can see where people would think race was an issue and it was. However, I believe it's also a case of the educated versus the uneducated. It's a tragic story, but so much good has come from what happened. Based on what I've read, almost everyone has benefited from Henrietta Lacks. "
293,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1991298-ana,3,"Both informative and captivating, this surprising nonfiction book reads like a really catchy novel and you have to remind yourself from time to time that it’s all too real as it is tragic. Skloot’s writing brings Henrietta Lacks and her family to life, from her ancestors to her children, the way it was told to her, whether some of the facts were verified or not.My only objection is that Skloot seems to subtly make herself some sort of hero figure in this book, where her growing friendship with Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, portrayed in the second half, sidelines the story of the HeLa cells, the science and the ethics behind it. It takes a rather voyeuristic turn for the sake of a little more drama added to an already heartbreaking story. It was quite uncomfortable to read and not particularly the place of a journalist to constantly highlight how she got certain aspects of the story."
294,1400052173,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31611904-idyll,5,"This is an absolute must-read about the evolution of medical ethics over the last 75 years, told through the story of one family. The cells of Henrietta Lacks did so much more than help advance medical science, it helped us find humanity when it lost its way, and negotiate 'virtues' in a market-driven society. Now we speak about mixing commercialization with conscience where once the two did not jell very well. Rebecca Skloot's unrelenting pursuit of Lacks' story is both inspiring and sobering. She makes us peel back the layers of scientific advancement all the way down to the humans lodged in the pip that holds the material for the next generation. She pricks it with compunction and makes them burst out into the world that they helped create, so that we may change it by accepting that the spirit of science is us, is them, is Henrietta Lacks. "

This is nonfiction but it's so well crafted it reads like fiction. I found the science aspect fascinating and the social aspects heartbreaking. The book brings up the interesting question of whether one has the right to weigh in on how their removed tissues are used or whether the removed tissues become the 'property' of the doctors and hospitals that remove them. I read (listened to...) this both as a medical professional but also a daughter, which allowed me to consider it from both angles. I found it thoroughly engrossing."

It's about a woman who's cells are responsible for much of our medicines and medical knowledge of today. I guess the topic is bioethics. Her background and the life of her family after her death are given. There's so much moral conflict surround their situation and no clear cut answers for these situations going forward. The author does a great job of showing all sides of the matter. Very interesting and thought provoking. I liked learning about the people involved, putting the human elements into the equation. "

How outrageous. Many thanks to this biology student who never lost her curiosity, and in becoming a medical journalist, followed the trail of a woman whose cells, according to her daughter, refused to be left in ignorant silence.

It is so full of interesting ideas, tragedy, and moral murk that I hope we get a good turn out. I feel so badly for the Lacks family and the way that they were taken advantage of time and again. And it kind of delivers home the incredible hubris of some in the scientific establishment, but also the power of discovery and the ways that technology has led to fantastic leaps in understanding.7/2010SUCH A GOOD BOOK!

This book had me alternating between absolute highs, where the author captured some truly tender moments with the family, and lows where she exposed unethical medical practices. I'm glad this story got told. It's important one, and a sad one. I know this book will stay with me for a long time. I will recommend it to everyone I know."
