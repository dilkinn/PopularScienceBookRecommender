0,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita,4,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is a force to reckon with. But he is not Carl Sagan. While Sagan must have smiled down kindly on your meek acknowledgement of ignorance regarding, say, black holes, Tyson will have most probably given you the stink eye or aimed a sarcastic jibe at your apathy, before proceeding to explain why black holes still remain a topic of much speculation in the community of astrophysicists worldwide.Tyson does not pull any punches in this collection of essays while slamming the news media, who more often than not, come off as ill-informed hacks doing a shoddy job of reporting facts in the field of space science, forever (stupidly) claiming how scientists are baffled by so-and-so new developments. 
""Scientists cannot claim to be on the research frontier unless one thing or another baffles them. Bafflement drives discovery.""
Or snidely commenting on the Hollywood exercise of producing multi-million dollar sci-fi films which badly butcher the scientific aspects of such ventures by inserting factually incorrect observations in scenes and dialogues. (there's a brilliant anecdote concerning James Cameron's 'Titanic' in this regard and the Contact film gets an honorable mention for its adherence to proper science if one overlooks a minor gaffe)
""I am glad that, in the end, the humans win. We conquer the 'Independence Day' aliens by having a Macintosh laptop computer upload a software virus to the mothership. [] The entire defense system for the alien mothership must have been powered by the same release of Apple Computer's system software as the laptop computer that delivered the virus.""
Or criticizing the mad dash for extending the frontiers of space science during the Cold war years, when the spirit of scientific inquiry was sidelined in favor of a dangerous game of political one-upmanship, a kind of puerile assertion of 'our scientists are better than yours'. Or openly chastising revered names from ancient Greece like Aristotle whose inaccurate assumptions about the unchanging nature of stars and the geocentric universe helped the Catholic Church in propagating falsities for centuries with impunity. (He doesn't even spare Newton for God's Higgs Boson's sake who, unable to satisfactorily explain the ordered behavior of the solar system despite the many often conflicting gravitational forces at work, had cited God's need to step in to correct things in his famed 'Principia')While Sagan may have adopted a more benign, less aggressive tone in course of addressing issues of religious dogma being at loggerheads with scientific reasoning and aversion to science and mathematics among the general populace, NDT takes the approach of pure, unadulterated logic and demolishes one popular misconception after another (for e.g.:-the North Star is not the most brilliant star in the night sky or how everything that goes up doesn't come down) with a brute force which I am certain will not sit well with some sensitive readers who are easily offended. Being born in a country whose space research organization head performs pujas and makes ritualistic offerings prior to launching a 'Mission to Mars', I can't say I fault NDT's acerbic tone or his distaste for those who are hell-bent on unifying science and religion without even realizing that finding common ground between both is akin to attempting to exceed the velocity of light. But if NDT lacks Sagan's sage-like demeanour and his rich, authorial voice (Sagan's prose is much more refined no doubt), his excellent sense of humor almost compensates for their absence - 
""The good thing about the laws of physics is that they require no law enforcement agencies to maintain them, although I once owned a nerdy T-shirt that loudly proclaimed, ""OBEY GRAVITY.""

""The only people who still call hurricanes 'acts of God' are the people who write insurance forms.""
(and Michele Bachmann, just saying)And occasionally there's a sop thrown in for the literary-minded (particularly the postmodernist fiction lover) - ""The physicist Murray Gell-Mann, who in 1964 proposed the existence of quarks, and who at the time thought the quark family had only three members, drew the name from a characteristically elusive line in James Joyce's Finnegans Wake: 'Three quarks for Muster Mark!'""
The more frivolous aspects of the essays aside, among the astrophysics-related topics NDT centers his discussions around, the ones which were relatively new to me are the concepts of hypernovae, gamma ray bursts, dark matter and dark energy, the uncertainty surrounding the string theory and the probability of the annihilation of Earth through ill-fated, cosmic encounters with errant asteroids, the unavoidable, impending collision of our galaxy with the Andromeda galaxy which is the nearest one heading towards us at a speed of more than 100 kilometers per second.The Andromeda GalaxySince this is a collection of 42 essays which were published in the 'Natural History' magazine, some repetition of concepts and names creeps in occasionally but that merely helps you refresh memories of what you just read a few pages back, not exactly a shortcoming I am keen to quibble over. 4 stars, because Tyson seems a little too bitter about artists who exercise 'artistic license' to distort certain astronomical facts in their paintings. Besides I am certain there is a lot of 5-star-worthy goodness in the rest of NDT's works left for me to discover in the future."
1,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"This is a very fun read for all you science nerds... not only being clear and humorous but wide-ranging and careful to build up a number of those necessary building blocks of knowledge but doing it precisely in order to slam you with the good stuff later.Like how you'd DIE IN A BLACK HOLE... :)To belabor the obvious by the title. :)Seriously, this book gives us a ton of great ways to die and not just by black hole. I really appreciated that. :)I'd characterize this book as an easy to intermediate stage science book that's very far from being dull and it has a minimum of equations. I'm sure everyone has heard of thermodynamics and E=MC squared and Drake's equation, after all, but what really thrilled me about this was the truly wide array of subjects and Tyson's conversational tone.You can tell he is still a very, very good science teacher. :)I can almost hear him say, ""Let's throw out the crap, folks, let's dive right into the good stuff."" And he does, ranging from the Big Bang to the Heat Death, kinds of possible life on planets, the building blocks we need to understand science, including a great ""stick"" analogy for understanding the universe without computers, and he even gets into a bit of politics and religion because let's face it: it's a hot discussion item. But thankfully, it's only there as an afterthought.I wanted science and I got science, exploring the planets, the sun, even quasars, and especially Black Holes. That's the yummy stuff, after all.  10/10 Black Holes agree! Nom nom nom nom nom. I totally recommend this for both laymen and the intelligently curious and for anyone else who just likes a bit of the good (science) life. It really, really helps that Tyson's a great writer and clear as glass. The light passes right through it without slowing down at all! Can you believe it?"
2,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70078-chloe,4,"Within my skull, where all of those vital pieces of data surrounding science are supposed to be stored, there is instead a vast beaker-shaped void of ignorance. In high school, while we were supposed to be studying the musculature of the formaldehyde-soaked amphibians pinned ignominiously to their coffinesque metal trays, I was far more interested in studying the effects of adding fire to small green buds. During my brief time wandering the hallways of the University world, I was able to do away with my prerequisite requirement by taking an “Arts of Science” course tailor-made for those more interested in empathy than entropy and, while I did manage to get a crocodile on my report card, all I took away from that class was an abiding hatred for hippies. The long and the short of all this is that I didn’t know a quasar from a neutron or a brown dwarf from a red giant (though Red Dwarf was a magnificent television series).As a devout lover of science fiction and hi-tech gadgetry of all sorts, this was a matter of not a little shame for me. To resolve this I decided that it was time for me to fill in some of the (immense) gaps in my education the best way I know how- via book. Yet how to avoid having my eyes glaze over the moment someone started explaining cell structures or complex wave fields? Fortunately, as it often does, my television provided a solution when Stephen Colbert took a visit to the American Museum of Natural Historys Hayden Planetarium and spoke with its Director, Neil deGrasse Tyson. Tyson, while just as geeky as you would expect from an astrophysicist, is phenomenally skilled at taking incredibly complex scientific theories and translating them into a Common English that even Stephen Colbert is able to understand. My fate was sealed. This man was the ideal author to ease myself into the brave new world of stellar science.Death by Black Hole is a collection of essays the Tyson penned for Natural History magazine over the course of several years. Each essay addresses a different topic, running the gamut from the birth of the universe, the history of astronomical discoveries, humankind’s fixation on the red hills of Mars and the life-bringing water that may lay frozen away, all the way to the Pluto Wars (it’s amazing just how contentious Pluto’s status as planet is). Of course there’s some overlap between the chapters and some facts get repeated but, rather than bugging me, I found it to be a good refresher of what had come before that helped solidify my basic understanding of the concepts at hand. Most interesting to me, policy junkie that I am, is the closing essay in which Tyson writes about the plague of scientific ignorance sweeping the country. After almost brutally doing away with that Bible-in-textbook-clothing anachronism that is “intelligent design,” he makes great points about America’s waning prestige in scientific research and the future costs, both economic and academic, that we will have to pay due to ceding our intellectual priority to advance knowledge. I’m not much interested in sustaining American supremacy in any field, but I can always get behind an argument for strengthening education.What I most enjoyed was the excitement that Tyson has for his field. He doesn’t get bogged down in the minutiae of atomic weights and the like, but thrills at the possibilities of quantum mechanics and takes an almost excessive amount of joy in ruminating over the possible ways that people can be killed in space from the atom-splitting nullification of crossing a black hole’s event horizon to the persistent fear of a species-leveling asteroid striking Earth. Tyson is a man possessed of a childlike sense of wonder at the mysteries of the universe that sees the current limits of our scientific understanding not as having reached the final frontiers of science but as hurdles to be vaulted over in our quest to know. His enthusiasm is quite contagious and I challenge any reader to emerge from this book without being excited about science."
3,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"I have often lamented the passing of my favorite popular scientist, Carl Sagan, by talking about how necessary he is right now. We are at a point in our history where scientific illiteracy is growing, where people are not only ignorant of how science works, but are proud of their ignorance. What we need is someone who can reach the majority of Americans who are not especially scientifically literate - the people whose automatic reaction to science is to think, ""That's just too hard for me to deal with.""Enter Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist and the director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. He's appeared on countless television programs, including The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, to talk about the current state of astronomy and astrophysics. He's an engaging and entertaining man, who claims that Pluto was ""asking for"" its demotion, who seems to take perverse pleasure in describing all the terrible ways the universe could take us out. He knows that we're in a precarious position, here on Earth, and he revels in it rather than worrying about it. Whereas Sagan seemed to come from the point of view that the universe was a place of infinite wonder, where one could look anywhere and be awed and humbled, Tyson's attitude is more of the universe as an infinite theme park - a place where you could see your electrons stripped from your body, watch gas clouds larger than our own solar system collide and ignite, or see planets crumple under cosmic bombardment. Tyson's universe is an adventure, as big as it gets.This book is a collection of essays that Tyson wrote for Natural History magazine over a ten year period, on a variety of subjects related to science and scientific inquiry. In many ways, it's similar to every other pop science book out there - and there are so very many of them - but it is his perspective and his voice that makes this one stand out from the crowd.He's grouped his essays into seven sections, on topics ranging from the difficulties inherent in actually knowing anything about the universe to the understanding of how life went from little mindless bacteria to we clever Homo sapiens to the intersection of science and religion. Most of it is accessible to the average non-scientist, though he does get a little technical at points. But he understands that, and he tries to compensate for for the fact that, by and large, the public is intimidated by ""real science."" In the essay entitled, ""Over the Rainbow,"" he discusses this particular challenge by using spectroscopy as an example.In spectroscopy, astrophysicists look at the spectrum of a star, hunting for telltale dark lines that indicate the physical properties of stars. It's like looking at a rainbow with bits blackened out of it, as though the CIA had somehow gotten to it first. Those black lines contain all the vital information about the star's composition and, more importantly, speed. Very little can be gleaned by just looking at the star, as it turns out. He notes five levels of abstraction, starting from the star itself:Level 0: A starLevel 1: Picture of a starLevel 2: Light from the picture of a starLevel 3: Spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.Level 4: Patterns of lines lacing the spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.Level 5: Shifts in the patterns of lines in the spectrum from the light from the picture of a star.These descending levels of abstraction can apply to any branch of science, not just astrophysics. The challenge, as he notes, is getting people past level 1, which is easy to understand but is not the level at which true science is done. It is up to educators, he says, to help make people comfortable with looking at real science, and not just pretty pictures.Indeed, there are several sections of the book dedicated to the intersection between science and the public. He talks about how easily we are baffled by numbers (why are below-ground floors not labeled -1, -2, -3 etc?) and how casually we disregard actual scientific facts. He brings up some of his favorite moments in bad movie science, and how he single-handedly saved Titanic from ignominious astronomical shame. At least, on its DVD re-release. He addresses the historically shifting centers of science in human history, how things like NASA are truly a global endeavor. Without the discoveries made through history by people all over the planet - from England to Greece to Baghdad - there would be no NASA, nor any science that we recognize. And to assume that the United States will always be the center of scientific discovery is to willfully ignore history.And, of course, there's a section dedicated to the conflict between religion and science, a never-ending battle that has existed since science began. Tyson believes that there can be no common ground between the two - science relies on facts, religion relies on faith. This is not to say that one is better than the other, any more than, say, a hammer is better than a screwdriver. It's just that you can't use them interchangeably. And he points out that becoming a scientist doesn't require you to give up your faith. There have been, and still are, countless scientists who are believers in the Divine. It's just that most of them know enough not to confuse science and spirituality. The place where they meet, historically, is on the boundary of ignorance. Isaac Newton, having figured out gravity, couldn't quite work out how you could have a multiple-body system like our solar system without the whole thing falling into chaos. His conclusion - God must, from time to time, step in to keep things on the right path. Having done that, Newton went on to do other things, and it wasn't until the next century that Pierre-Simon laPlace decided that he wasn't satisfied with Newton's ""Insert God Here"" argument, and did the math for himself.In other words, God is a marker on the boundaries of ignorance, and the best of us are tempted to let Him answer the questions that we can't. To do so, however, impedes the path of science and stops progress in its tracks. What if Newton had said, ""No, I'm going to figure this damn thing out."" Would we be a century ahead in our technology by now? Maybe, maybe not. What if the Catholic Church had listened when Galileo said, ""The Bible tells you how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go."" Might more progress have been made? So many great thinkers have come up to the boundaries of their knowledge and, humbled by what they do not know, chose to allow The God of the Gaps reassure them.But that's the whole point of science, and it's what this book, and others like it, are trying to instill in people. The unknown is not horrible, it is not terrifying, and it's not a place to just stop. It's a place of awe and wonder and bafflement and opportunity. To say, ""I don't understand it - it must be God"" is short-changing ourselves and our heirs out of even greater knowledge of the universe."
4,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392197-jocelyn,5,"I don't think I can properly explain how much I love this book, but I'll try.Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries is a collection of essays Tyson wrote for Natural History, a magazine dedicated to -- you guessed it -- natural history (basically, science) between 1995-2005.What I like about it:- Tyson writes in a way that's easily accessible for anyone even without a science background. His analogies are easy to understand and they're fun. Like, ""Oh, Neil deGrasse Tyson, you."" Also, he tries to explain complex terms or theories so that you can finish the book and be a pseudo-astrophysicist. Now you can go to dinner parties and impress people with your knowledge about quarks and black holes and radio waves.- Tyson's writing is jovial and light-hearted. He frequently cracks jokes to lighten the mood -- you don't want to be bored. (Of course, I am a huge physics nerd and he could drone on and on about string theory and it could never bore me.) At one point, he jokes about red shirts. Red shirts, people! This guy's a winner.- Tyson takes the time to highlight two ways science (broadly) and astro-/physics (specifically) relate to both theology and culture. The Science and Culture section of the book was interesting, because what he describes is true: there is a misunderstanding between what scientists are doing and what the public thinks the scientists are doing. His little asides (rants) are fun, too.- This was a very informative book for just being a collection of 5-10 page essays. If you're new to astrophysics, the universe and particles, this stuff is like gold -- I don't think I've seen/heard any of the phenomena explained in a clearer way. If you're not new to any of this, then you probably shouldn't be reading this because you've probably already read it. Unless you really like it.Issues for some people, but weren't issues for me:- I understand that some people may go, ""Ugh, why does everything that has to do with science bring up religion and God!"" Tyson does dedicate a whole section of the book to (omg) 3 essays dealing with religion's place in science. He does so tactfully and tastefully. I'm not a religious person, but I don't think he would have offended anyone. And besides, religion and science have been at each others' throats since the dawn of both. If a popular astrophysicist didn't bring it up, someone would have asked why he didn't bring it up.- There's some repetition going on because, if you've read the preface and my review you'll know, this is a collection of essays from a magazine. There's bound to be some repetition because non-sciencey readers need to be reminded that Planck is considered the father of quantum mechanics and that Einstein's theory of relativity is a furthering of Newton's theory of gravity. Honestly, the repetition isn't enough where you would roll your eyes and mutter, ""Redundant.""- Some people may not be okay with Tyson's little rants. In one part he complains about the scientific ignorance going on in Hollywood skylines. Some readers may just want him to stop complaining and shut up already, but he has a right to his discontent. When you're a professional in your field, things that are obviously wrong annoy you more than those that don't belong to your field. You should see how irritated my family gets when I point out the inconsistencies movies have in regards to language and sociolinguistic situations. His annoyance is justified.Basically, what this all boils down to is this:How can you not like a man who dresses in a waistcoat with suns and stars on it?How can you not like a man whose reaction to Newton became a meme?Seriously, though, this book is awesome."
5,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309472-maria,3,"I have one last section to go (Religion and Science), but my main points won't be affected by it.Death By Black Hole provides, especially in the first couple of sections, a really good outline of various problems that astrophysicists are confronted with, and it definitely made me think of the scientific process in a new way. So that was pretty cool. But on the whole, my reaction was rather meh - kind of disappointing when the book really isn't bad. My main complaint about the book isn't actually the book's fault. It's just way below my level, and I found myself frequently bored. I think the best audience for the book is someone who's never had an astronomy class, and is maybe familiar with basic physics and chemistry. I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I read it in high school. I did learn a handful of new things, and sometimes Tyson's explanations helped some points I was fuzzy on click into place, but on the whole, I would have preferred the book to be much more detailed.My second problem is that, as Tyson says in the preface, the book is composed of various essays that he wrote for a magazine over the years, and that they were only slightly edited for continuity when he was preparing the book. Big mistake. While this divided the book into bite-sized, easy to process pieces, it also made it a helluva lot repetitive. Several phenomena were explained two, or even three times throughout the book. It should really have been edited a lot more aggressively.But on the whole, I think this is a really good pick for a layperson who doesn't know much about astronomy and isn't interested in involved explanations of the physical and chemical side of things. Neil deGrasse Tyson is one eloquent guy, and writes with an infectious passion for his subject. "
6,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"As a scientist, at first I was rather bored by this book. I was not learning anything new, and not gaining new insights into astronomy.But, as I read further, it just hit me--this book is tremendously entertaining! If you are a layman, and looking for a unique viewpoint, you could do a lot worse than this book. And, believe it or not, you will be entertained!In addition, Tyson puts several aspects of astronomy and astrophysics into a unique perspective. He describes all the ways that the universe is trying to kill us--storms, viruses, meteors, comets, climate change, volcanoes, and so on. But many of these lethal phenomena could be responsible for life existing on Earth, in the first place!I really did appreciate the arguments put forward against the idea of ""Intelligent Design."" Just because some areas in cosmology are not understood, does not mean that one is required to invoke God as a cause. Science always works on the frontier of knowledge, and if we were always to state that God is responsible for things we do not yet understand, then we would be working on the frontier of ignorance. Tyson does a much better job than I can, in explaining this concept. Highly recommended!"
7,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,4,"Neil is without doubt one of the greatest scientific communicators alive. He is erudite and hilarious with no apparent effort and can always bring the 'wow'.I enjoy his podcast and have probably watched near all videos on youtube that feature him. This is the first time that I have tried his written work and I am very pleased with the results.This work is a collection of editorial pieces that Neil writes for a periodical. They are intended to be short, punchy scientific stories and not form an ongoing dialogue.In this respect Neil did a brilliant job. I dipped in and out of this book over the last couple of weeks and it was simple to pick up again after each break. I read it while doing experiments in the lab, and I read it while on the toilet.What let the collection down (just the tiniest smidgen) was that some material was covered twice. Fine for an ongoing column and understandable for a collection, but still, a little work could have been taken to cull and back reference sections.Don't get me wrong, I adored this book. And anyone who has not discovered love for Neil needs to read it immediately. You'll definitely connect with him if you are sceptical, scientific or just a spotter of bullshit.This book left me wanting more. I want some long form stories, woven into a larger narrative. I have 'The Pluto Files' on my shelf. Maybe it won't be long before I open it."
8,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1085121-stephanie-extremely-stable-genius,3,"Blinded by scienceEinstein, Io, comet tails Information glutI consider myself an intelligent person. I also find science fascinating. I'm just not sure what happen between me and Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries.....Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for a science-y book. Maybe I over estimated my intelligence. Both are quite possible. The whole time I was listening to this, it was like listening to Charlie Browns teacher. whaa wha whaa wha whaa Galileo, wha wha E=mc2, whaa whaa whaa Gravity sucks.I would get some really good, crunchy tidbit and be riveted.....and then the mind would drift to something like ""I wonder if I fed the cats, and CRAP I forgot to start the dishwasher""........then I would drift back to the science stuff.It just didn't hold my attention."
9,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37690097-ahmed-r-rashwan,4,"So I have a thing for Black Holes, so what?! You knew that already! You didn't? Well now you do.I have had an obsession with Black Holes for as long as I can remember. It was perhaps one of the first phenomena of the big umbrella of Astronomy and Cosmology that I was introduced to and I immediately fell in love with; I mean what is there not to love. An equal or even grander obsession is awarded of course to the author of this brilliant book.Of course, as with almost all scientific books, the title is pretty elusive. Yes, there was talk of Black Holes, a lot of talk, but there was a slew of other cosmological subjects too! But, of course, you will hear absolutely no complaints from me. As my favourite astronomer, I am inspired by Neil deGrasse Tyson much in the same way he was probably inspired by Carl Sagan.There is probably no other human beings on this planet that have invested more to the field of astronomy like Sagan and Tyson have. I, of course, do not mean this in a scientific sense but a commercial one. Sagan and Tyson are to Astronomy what Bill Nye is to Science.So for all intends and purposes, this review is in fact a form of praising for Neil deGrasse Tyson and his meaning to me as a person rather than a review of the actual book. There are simply some people out there who's literary work is completely overshadowed by their contributions to the subject upon which they write about, so I will dismiss the small quantity of repetitiveness inherent in all scientific books (especially ones comprising of several essays).They tell you never to meet your heroes, that it is somehow inevitable to be disappointed by such an interaction; that the perfect image you have most definitely built of your heroes is most certainly to fall short of reality. But while I cannot claim to have met Neil deGrasse Tyson, I have at least had a closer glimpse to his personal opinions and thoughts. I shied away from this book for the longest time specifically for fear of being disappointed by the literary work of a person I probably hold the highest esteem of amongst all people.I don't even recall when or how I was first ""introduced"" to Neil but what followed was an obsession that has lasted years, till this day. I have probably watched his 'Cosmos' show, inspired by Carl Sagan's Cosmos up to at least 5 times. Neil is funny, witty, intelligent and very very charismatic. If it wasn't for him, there would have definitely been so many different aspects of astronomy that I wouldn't have particularly grabbed. His style of ""story-telling"" transports you back to a time when anything interested you, when your explorer genes were yet to be suppressed; just like you were a little kid again. So it comes as no surprise that I read the entire book imagining Neil was narrating it to me, for I had completely memorised his pattern of speech and voice, and it is equally not surprising that I would love any work, literary or otherwise that Neil produces.I ask nothing more of men of science, to be able to pass down the passion in the way that Neil has been very successful in doing is the calling for all of scientists, regardless of their field of study."
10,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96756984-yesenia-juarez,5,"This book was much harder than Astrophysics for people in a hurry! I’m glad I have the paperback edition as well because I most definitely will be re-reading this! However, still wonderful and I always enjoy Neil Degrasse Tyson’s sense of humor even though most of the puns went over my head. "
11,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1306562-josh,1,"For me this book was merely okay. I've read quite a bit of these types of books, physics for the layperson, and this book was probably my least favorite.I don't like the overall tone of the book. Tyson makes a point to belittle the human race as much as possible and he comes across as pessimistic. By no means do I think humans are the pinnacle of perfection, but I think we're doing pretty well.The content of the book was all over the place and only briefly touched on black holes and other cosmic quandaries. In fact the titular cosmological event, though an ""entire"" chapter, was hardly described while long tangents about minor events in historical figures' lives were expounded in detail.I don't recommend this book to any but those that are cursorily interested in cosmology. I recommend Hawking, Brian Greene or Amir Aczel."
12,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14386596-christopher,4,"There isn't anything particularly advanced in this book, though as it is a collection of essays, perhaps that is expected. It's easy to get into as a result, and Tyson has a good style that stays entertaining while being informative. "
13,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1536431-leslie,4,"If the lovely fact that our sun will probably burn out in 4 billion years and our beloved Earth will turn into a huge ball of black rock because of it (until it's vaporized that is) bothers you, keeps you up in the night, this book might not be for you. If you're worried about an asteroid hitting somewhere between Hawaii and California in 2039 and Idaho becoming ocean front property (hmm, maybe an improvement?), then this book might not be for you. If you're worried about what might happen to you if you inadvertently get a little, tinsy bit too close to a black hole of death! (even your atoms get pulled apart) then again, I might not read this book. Because, if you thought your ulcer was healing and you could eat salsa with your chips again. Think again! A collection of essays about a myriad of cosmic topics from Natural History magazine written by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson (you've probably seen him on PBS, and no he's not the night sky guy with the weird voice), this book entertains. Frightens. Enlightens. And inevitably makes you feel much, much smarter for reading it. But believe me, sometimes this knowledge is a scary, scary thing! In fact, now I'd like to take some of it back. Oh, brain atrophy!Except for a few about half way through that made my eyes start to glaze over, I found most of these essays really interesting and readable. Tyson is obviously one of those well known science professionals who is actually interested in, and good at, teaching (believe it or not!) instead of just doing research and publishing. So yes, they do exist..Way, oh way back in the dark ages when I was in college I took a series of physics classes from an astronaut named Don Lind. He was a cocky ass who said stuff like, if you ever get a chance to fly in space.. . I wanted to slap him...anyway, I remember learning about prisms and color and how our brain interprets it, and thinking that was the coolest thing! I remember telling my twelve year old sister about it, about how a prism works and why we are able to see that myriad of colors without moving our eyes (look it up, it's really cool!).

According to her numbers, that leaves 0.0000004 planets with intelligent life on them, which is a figure somewhat lower than “millions.” No doubt that “one in a million” sounds better on screen than “one in ten,” but you can’t fake math. The book did have it's flaws, some repetitions and some dull moments , but just a few.If you like the subject….. read this book. "

Neil goes over some really interesting concepts, but they aren't what I would say for advanced readers. Much like his work on Cosmos, the concepts are simple but entertaining and informative. This is a book you could give to beginners who are just dipping their toes into astronomy, physics and earth space sciences. Like always, it's written in a warmer tone than say, Dawkins or Hitchens, and is even more accessible than Hawking although his works are written for the every day person as well. I wouldn't say this is for kids, but kids who are ""advanced"" in reading and sciences would get a kick out of this. I'd love to meet this guy one day. Him, Bill Nye, Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking sparked my love of science in my high school years, and it became an obsession in my adulthood. Thanks, guys. "

to deny or erase the rich, colorful history of scientists and other thinkers who have invoked divinity in their work would be intellectually dishonest. surely there's an appropriate place for intelligent design to live in the academic landscape. how about the history of religion? how about philosophy or psychology? the one place it doesn't belong is the science classroom.if you're not swayed by academic arguments, consider the financial consequences. allow intelligent design into science textbooks, lecture halls, and laboratories, and the cost to the frontier of scientific discovery - the frontier that drives the economies of the future - would be incalculable. i don't want students who could make the next major breakthrough in renewable energy sources or space travel to have been taught that anything they don't understand, and that nobody yet understands, is divinely constructed and therefore beyond their intellectual capacity. the day that happens, americans will just sit in awe of what we don't understand, while we watch the rest of the world boldly go where no mortal has gone before.

19,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879178-kathy,3,"A great title for a book, that alone made me want to read it. Of course, this is the type of book I will almost always pick up from the library. It is a collection of essays on science for the magazine Natural History. It covers a wide range of topics, usually relating to physics, from particle physics to astrophysics. I love this stuff and I only wish I retained enough math to be able to read more technical discussions than these rather general essays.The essays are informative and entertaining. A lot has changed in the 17 years since I took my particle physics class at BYU, so I am always interested to learn more. Not only does he describe what is happening in science, he describes the edges very well. By edges I mean the places where scientists are not sure what is happening and are actively searching for answers. That is always the most interesting part of any science. The problem today is that to get to that edge, you have to take years of schooling to understand what they are looking for. Once the edge could be explored in your home lab or a field (if you were Benjamin Franklin) now you need millions of dollars and a space telescope.The book is a bit repetitive, though that often happens with collections of essays because each one had to be self contained and couldn't refer to last month's issue. There has been a bit of editing to smooth out the sequencing and to make it an easier read.While I enjoyed all the essays, I took exception to the last one, entitled, The Perimeter of Ignorance. Here is the author's basic premise, Writing in centuries past, many scientists felt compelled to wax poetic about cosmic mysteries and God's handiwork. Perhaps one should not be surprised at this: most scientists back then, as well as many scientists today, identify themselves as spiritually devout. But a careful reading of older texts, particularly those concerned with the universe itself, shows that the authors invoke divinity only when they reach the boundaries of their understanding. They appeal to a higher power only when staring at the ocean of their own ignorance. They call on God only from the lonely and precarious edge of incomprehension. Where they feel certain about their explanations, however, God hardly gets a mention.He goes on from this hypothesis to give some quotes from Newton and other scientists, who do indeed see an explanation for the unexplainable in the presence of God. He then links this tendency to the current vogue for intelligent design. That also follows, more or less. I have my own issues with intelligent design, at least how it is being explained and used in the public sphere, but I won't go into all that here. The problem I have is that the author considers an appeal to deity as an admission of failure and the mental equivalent of throwing up your hands and saying, ""Heck if I know, only God could figure that out, I will just go find something easier to study, like Paris Hilton."" He says, in talking about intelligent design and the dangers of it, I don't want students who could make the next major breakthrough in renewable energy sources or space travel to have been taught that anything they don't understand, and that nobody yet understands, is divinely constructed and therefore beyond their intellectual capacity.Since when is saying something is divinely designed the same as saying we are not capable of understanding it? As a devout person, but one who would have been a scientist, if not for a few chance decisions and a problem with basic arithmetic, I find everything divinely inspired, even those things we do understand. Too many people equate religion with ignorance, without considering the fact that the intelligent people who believe, must have a valid reason for doing so. And similarly, there are many ignorant people who have no religion. I cringe whenever a particularly proud, ignorant and Christian person is on the news saying something stupid because that just reinforces this ignorance=religion stereotype. I'm here to say intelligence=true religion. Believing in ignorance is just superstition whatever belief it may be. The more you understand your own beliefs, the more you want to learn. Our brains are designed to increase in knowledge, anything that does that helps all of us, no matter what the information may be."
20,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,3,"DEATH BY BLACK HOLE AND OTHER COSMIC QUANDARIES BY NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: An astrophysicist for the American Museum of Natural History, director of the world famous Hayden Planetarium, and columnist for Natural History magazine, Neil DeGrasse Tyson brings to the non-scientific world the ideal book for those fascinated with space, the cosmos, black holes, and all the questions and wonders therein. Death by Black Hole is the perfect book for the reader who wants answers to questions about the universe in a simple and clearly defined way so that even if they know next to nothing about science and it’s jargon, Tyson makes it easily understandable.While I was hoping for something a little more in depth in the style of Brian Greene’s The Fabric of the Cosmos or Lee Smolin’s The Trouble With Physics, Death by Black Hole nevertheless provides quick and simple answers to many questions everyday readers without a science background have about physics, the universe, space, and most matters dealing with the cosmos. The book is a selection of his columns in Natural History that are organized in a somewhat textbook fashion. Tyson starts with the idea of science and nature in its basic form, how humanity views Earth, the solar system, the universe. Along with this discussion, Tyson also gives minor history lessons on the development of different ideas in physics and astronomy, what people came up with what big ideas and how the progression led to the development of the big theories of our current time with string theory and relativity. Going on from here, Death by Black Hole address the crucial steps that led to the formation of the universe and its development over the many billions and billions of years, again explaining how it is that scientists know what they do and what instruments were used, as well as the history of who invented and used said instruments.It is then that Tyson finally turns to the subject matter of the title of the book in the section “When the Universe Turns Bad: All the Ways the Cosmos Wants to Kill Us.” Here he addresses the complex and still relatively unknown subjects of chaos theory, dark matter (which constitutes over 90% of all matter in the universe, while we still know next to nothing about it), and finally black holes. Tyson takes the reader on a hypothetical journey with what would happen if one were to be sucked into a black hole and how as they approached the event horizon, they would become stretched until the elasticity point of their skin was surpassed and the body would be torn into thousands then millions of little pieces.With many questions now answered, in the next section Tyson discusses how science is viewed by the media, Hollywood, and people around the world in general. The final section addresses the concept of science and religion, again taking the reader on a historic journey through the development of first religion, then science, and the struggle that has ensued for centuries. It is the perfect end to a book on science, as Tyson lectures the importance of supporting fact and reality in a time when there are many who believe more in faith, even when all the evidence is to the contrary.For more book reviews, and author interviews, go to BookBanter."
21,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558652-emma-sea,3,"My main dissatisfaction with this book is that it's a series of collected magazine columns. This does seem a bit like criticising an apple because it's not a banana, however I think Tyson would have be been better advised to hire an editor to whip this into an actual book, rather than just reprint the original short essays. For example, in chapter 25 Tyson critiques the concept of the ""Goldilocks Zone"", discussing the myriad ways life could flourish in environments entirely dissimilar to our own e.g. in seas of liquid ammonia or methane. But then in the following chapter Tyson contends that life will only originate on a planet with a temperature that allows liquid water i.e. in the Goldilocks Zone. Originally these essays would have been published months or years apart, but juxtaposed like this it is a frustrating read, to say the least.The other problem with short essays is that things just start to get interesting and it's over. In chapter 21 Tyson briefly mentions technetium; an element with a half-life of only 2 million years, but which is nevertheless found in red giant stars. ""In other words, the star cannot have been born with the stuff, for if it were there would be none left by now. There is also no known mechanism to create technetium in a star's core and have it dredge itself up to the surface where it is observed, which has led to exotic theories that have yet to achieve consensus in the astrophysics community""But you know, those diverse and exotic theories are exactly what I'd like to hear about! That was the most interesting part of the book for me, and it just gets left lying gasping on the floor.Also, sadly, the book is aimed at someone who has done little or no prior science reading; a far broader generalist audience that I hoped for. I 100% agree with Maria's review, when she says this would be a good high-school-level book. If you don't generally read pop-science, but would like to learn more about how our universe works, I definitely recommend this book. Tyson is a great writer: engaging and able to explain complex ideas simply, with a dash of humour.For me it's a 2.5, rounded up."
22,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2593734-nicholas-armstrong,2,"I can already see the masses of Tyson fans charging ahead just to light me aflame for having the audicity to doubt a word he says, but so I must. To be fair, I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. I saw him speak at USC, I've watched his lectures and his interviews, and I think he has done more for popularizing science than anyone else. But none of that a writer makes. This is especially true of sarcastic and sardonic wit. Being funny in text is what I would rate as the most challenging things to accomplish (some comics may agree) because it loses so much of the presence, tone, and body language that makes something funny. Tyson is a legitimately funny person, I promise this, but aside from the knowledge that he wrote this, none of that translates well. I could guess that this is because much of his humor is in his intonations, pauses, and timing, something any classclown can tell you about. But not any classclown can write a best-selling comedic novel, nor can just any astro-physicist write a truly comic novel, or at least one which transfers that genius.What I'm getting at is that this book is dry. It seeks to inform, but it does so in a way that is just a little bit uninteresting and just a little bit reminscent of my astronomy courses. Interesting stuff, but the delivery was just all wrong.This wasn't assisted by the fact that the structuring of the book is terrible. To be fair, Tyson admits at the outset that this is little more than a collection of essays slapped back to back and tidied up a bit to try and make them fit, but that is exactly how they read. The transitions are generally poor and always jarring. The sentences don't blend together so much as float like an oily film, and trying to read too many consectutive pieces put together makes me feel as if my brain were a poorly done game of tetris - too many holes and not enough matching lines.But hey, I'm for anything that gets people reading, and I'm especially for anything that gets people reading about the world and about science. It goes without saying that I'm far happier this book is out there and so widely read than never having been published. I just prattle on because I'm a snot-nose with too many standards."
23,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5495893-leana-m,5,Well written and great stuff for the universe geek (or anyone with the slightest interest and curiosity for learning). NDT adds some fun with his quirks and humor. Allow me to indulge in a little pun here- And it ends with a bang. ;) 
24,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6071693-dale-jr,4,"Neil deGrasse Tyson has become a bit of an inspiration and scientific hero to me. He's a man who strongly pushes forth to erase scientific ignorance and champions the exploration of our world and the universe to further human greatness.His lectures are intensely interesting and full of scientific knowledge, yet easy to follow by anyone willing to listen and apply their minds. He boils down some of the most complex theories and scientific facts so that they're easily understood. His writing is no different.I've been diving further and further into astrophysics and varying theories in related fields (string and multiverse theory is, simply put, awesome). This journey has made me quite familiar with Tyson and I figured it was about time to pick up one of his texts.Death by Black Hole is a collection of essays and lectures spanning the entire field of astrophysics and cosmology. From the Big Bang, to the life cycles of stars. From the speed of light to the mind-boggling power of black holes. There's even a section where Tyson describes the three biggest ways our world will come to an end. And it has nothing to do with ancient Mayan prophecy or the second coming.When scientifically investigating the natural world the only thing worse than a blind believer is a seeing denier.Since it is a collection of various lectures and essays, some information is repeated here and there, but it does not detract from the wealth of knowledge contained between the covers. I learned a lot. Retained most of it in one reading due to Tyson's way of writing and explaining. This is a book full of information, yet you never feel like your reading something as dry as a text book. Tyson makes you want to keep reading. He injects humor along with serious scientific education.I'm glad that his book lived up to my expectations of him and I will be sure to pick up his others. Quite frankly, this was the best non-fiction book I've read this year. Wonderfully executed and easily devoured. I feel both filled with new knowledge, and humbled by the amount I, and the rest of my human brothers and sisters, do not know yet.But as Tyson lays out in his book, it's not wrong to be ignorant of something as long as you are continuing to try and figure it out.Science is a philosophy of discovery. Intelligent design is a philosophy of ignorance. You cannot build a program of discovery on the assumption that nobody is smart enough to figure out the answer to the problem. Once upon a time, people identified the god Neptune as the source of storms at sea. Today we call these storms hurricanes. We know when and where they start. We know what drives them. We know what mitigates their destructive power. And anyone who has studied global warming can tell you what makes them worse. The only people who still call hurricanes ""acts of God"" are the people who write insurance forms."

His humor and straightforwardness were some of the best things about the History Channel documentary, The Universe. And his lectures on YouTube are always extremely inventive, interesting, and entertaining. So when I saw this book on the shelf at my local bookstore, I had to buy it.I wasn't disappointed.Ever since I was a child, I've enjoyed learning about the universe. I'll never be an astrophysicist, but it always fascinates me to learn about all that's out there (and all that may be out there that we have yet to discover). Of course, the language of the cosmos is complicated: nebulae, pulsars, quasars, supernovas, black holes, event horizons, dark matter, antimatter, etc., etc.That's where Dr. Tyson comes in. He has an uncanny ability to take something that is unfailingly complex to the 'average' person such as myself and explain it in a way that I can understand. And he does so with unsurpassed humor, wit, and even the slightest bit of self-deprecation.In the end, he says, the universe is out to kill us. In many, many ways. And even though there is a lot we still don't understand about the universe and how it began and where it's going, that doesn't mean we stop looking. There is always more to learn, there is always more to discover, and if the essays in his book are any indication, it is all utterly fascinating.The last part of the book deals with science and religion. Dr. Tyson claims that being a scientist doesn't necessarily preclude belief in God. However, he staunchly claims that God has no business in scientific discovery, that simply crediting God with creating all the things that science can't currently explain opens the door to the cessation of scientific discovery. He quotes Galileo, who said, ""I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with senses, reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.""If the science vs. God debate makes you uncomfortable, have no fear--it's a very small part of the book, tucked in at the very end after all the terrific science essays.I highly recommend this book, even if you're only slightly interested in the universe.

26,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2751053-bakari,5,"Astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson‘s Death By Black Hole is definitely an engaging read, especially for these modern times. Though many pages and chapters about the particulars of matter, energy, space, and time—the physics of the universe—were very difficult for my scientifically illiterate mind to comprehend, I read nearly ever page for nuggets of understanding. Tyson is a excellent writer because he knows his subject matter. Just think how different our Bible reading population would be if Tyson had wrote the Book of Genesis. His “in the beginning“ would have probably talked about the discoveries and meaning of supernovas, as the “primary source for the origin and relative mix of heavy elements in the universe.” He would have verses about Newton’s laws of motion and early twentieth century theories about quantum mechanics. His creation story would not be described in a mere seven days; his story would talk about billions of years—more time than most of us can imagine. But of course, the Bible was written in an era which lacked the scientific discoveries that Tyson writes about. But, but...this is what makes Death By Black Hole, and other books similar to it, so important. Reading a book like this provides us more knowledge about the universe and who we are as homo sapiens than Biblical writers could ever imagine. We simply need the education, patience, and study to learn what has been discovered. Though we are not, as Tyson writes in his essay, “Fear of Numbers,” “wired for logical thinking,” the brain, as he goes on to say, is “a marvelously flexible organ.” And in my view it’s time that more and more of us start using our brain to its greatest potential. Believing and praying to gods and reading horoscopes are no longer sufficient for our survival as a species. We can do much, much better than that.Perhaps a few months from now, I’ll read another of Tyson‘s books, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution, and view the PBS companion special as I do. It will be much like viewing the Carl Sagan’s Cosmos back in my college days. "
27,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4826452-evan-wondrasek,5,"Death by Black Hole is one of the most interesting non-fiction science books I've ever read. It's a collection of essays published by Neil deGrasse Tyson over the last 10+ years, and provides great, down-to-earth explanations of amazing astrophysics phenomena. This isn't a book about farfetched scenarios as its title implies - only a single chapter was actually about ""death by black hole"" - but the rest of the book presented a thorough and highly scientific explanation of the universe as we know it.Being that this book wasn't written as one cohesive text (it's a summary of essays as I mentioned), there is some informational overlap between the chapters. You'll be introduced to people like Galileo, Keppler, and Huygens more than once. I didn't mind at all, and I thought the overlap helped me solidify information.My favorite part of this book the crazy facts about celestial scale it presented. For example, the book states that a photon of light takes something like 500 seconds to go from the Sun's surface to the surface of earth; conversely, that same photon took upwards of 100,000 years to go from the Sun's core to the Sun's surface. Read the book and you'll learn why :)"
28,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3110398-sean,4,"I feel that the reason that people do not understand science in the US today is because we have a foolish tradition of thinking that the only way to ""know"" physics is through the terse formalism of mathematics. Math is a tool to do science, as much as a microscope or a superconducting supercollider. The disservice we do as scientists are when we are unable to communicate the concepts about our physical world to the population at large because we tangle ourselves up in mathematical formalism.Neil DeGrasse Tyson will never have that criticism hurled against him.It is in the tradition of Sagan, Gribbin and Hawking that Tyson writes and his essays are pure delight, discussing the concepts of physics as though he was having a casual coffee talk. It makes science fun. Yes your brain will come alive, but for a basic understanding of our physical world, this book should be read and I can't wait to read another by him.I even learned that laser spectroscopists and chemists label the same energy transitions differently. Awesome."
29,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4983144-colleen,4,"This is a great introduction into the world of astrophysics for the lay person. It's funny and engaging in a way you couldn't imagine a book about astrophysics being (without reading this book). How did it all begin and where are we going are just some of the cosmic quandaries that are tackled. It even has a whole section on how many ways the planet and its life could end! Fun stuff for a nerd like me. Plus, it touches on many other science/culture conundrums that are great food for thought. It was a tiny redundant, owing to the fact that these are all previously written essays collected for purpose of the book. But, I actually liked the redundancy. It allowed more time for the heavy science behind astrophysics to sink in, and I became more familiar with the scientists that propelled our cosmic knowledge forward. Overall, it was a great read. It was a refreshing break from the day-to-day politics and tedium that can make our lives feel very small. From the advantage of science, it truly put our Earthly lives into a cosmic perspective."

He does spend a bit of time on the requisite bemoaning of popular innumeracy and scientific ignorance (fact: the sun is not yellow, and the time between sunrise and sunset is longer than 12 hours during either spring or autumn equinox), but most of the time he maintains a good sense of humor.Which he should, because modern astronomy has so many mind-bogglingly weird things to tell us that it's not as if he has to be stern or bombastic to have something interesting to say. Really, modern astrophysics has mind-bendingly counterintuitive things to tell us about space, time, the nature of the universe, and our place in it, and I know of no religion (orthodox or fringe) which is able to come close. These are people who speak earnestly and sanely with one another about whether or not there are 11 spatial dimensions, whether or not black holes can destroy information, and how the universe after 1/100th of a second differed from the universe after one millionth of a second. If he did not leaven this with earthly humor, it would seem to surreal to think on for long.“As a child, I knew that at night, with the lights out, infrared vision would discover monsters hiding in the bedroom closet only if they were warm-blooded. But everybody knows that your average bedroom monster is reptilian and cold-blooded. Infrared vision would thus miss a bedroom monster completely because it would simply blend in with the walls and door.”This also gives one a hint of what kind of a child deGrasse Tyson was.DeGrasse Tyson is as fun to read as he is to listen to.

33,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2084139-bryce-holt,3,"Gah, I suffered from the worst malady a reader can have while making my way through the audio version of this - disenchantment. I've read too many other books on the subject, and while I praise deGrasse Tyson as both a teacher and a storyteller of the cosmos, I did not feel this collection of essays compared to the more robust information you get from the likes of Brian Greene, one of deGrasse Tyson's contemporaries. One of the author's instincts, I believe, is to over-inform on the unnecessary and quip on the most interesting, and in so doing, he loses not only his base...but in fact negates a base readership altogether. Don't discount it based on my opinion...it's good and if you haven't read much on the cosmos, this is a fair-to-decent launching point. That said, I didn't feel this broke any new barriers...perhaps just rehashed a few that I was already acquainted with. Anyway, this is one of those few 3-ratings I'd suggest, but ""Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene or ""The Theory of Everything"" by Hawking would always come recommended before it. "
34,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53373701-shoti,2,"I liked less this book than the other one I have read from Tyson, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution. This book is, in essence, a collection of articles which Tyson published in the National History magazine. There is nothing wrong with that concept by itself. At the same time, I do not think he managed to organize his essays into a coherent whole. Chapters or some parts of them are often repetitive, there is no logical story line, the author juggles too many topics – some of them are quite interesting while others are closer to a pop-culture-like depiction of astronomy. Finally, I normally enjoy when an acclaimed scientist seasons up his/her heavy stuff with a great dose of humor- there are plenty of great examples. In the case of this book though I felt that Tyson desperately tried to appear as the funniest astronomer of all times but his efforts often appeared more artificial than genuine."
35,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63058444-joshua,5,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is a wonderful writer, public speaker, and ceaseless defender of the necessity for science as something relevant in our culture and every essay in this book is a love letter to science. Each chapter, each essay explores a different avenue either of late scientific discoveries, personalities of famous scientists, or the role of science in popular culture. Even if you know nothing of science what's amazing about this book is the way Tyson makes the most esoteric or obscure ideas and concepts seem like something the layman could have a working understanding of. That, to me, is why the reader should read this book. Science is about human initiative and discovery, and what good is it if the culture that benefits from such science can't even understand it. Tyson makes quarks, astronomy, aliens, and even the ultimate death of the universe approachable and relevant. Wonderful book."
36,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82440-mike,2,"I really didn't like this book. I think my main problem is with the structure of the book, which just seemed to be a loose collection of loosely organized essays. The essays are not continuous and switch abruptly from one topic to another. I felt like the author just copied and pasted random past essays to create this book. As a result, I had a difficult time maintaining my interest in this book. It took me almost a month to force myself to finish, and that's only because when I got to less than 100 pages I was motivated to finish to just be able to move on.The only reason this book is getting two stars instead of one is because some of the individual essays were interesting on their own."

I felt I wanted a redo because a lot of what Hawking said went over my head. I was hoping deGrasse would be a better and he did deliver. He has the ability to break down complex science jargon for those who do not have a science background to understand. I commend him that ability because it must at times be frustrating.  Death by Black Hole was a really decent read and I did learn quite a bit from. I would recommend this book to others to read.

However, I did end up learning a lot because Dr. Tyson talks about a wide variety of topics. Additionally, he gives a plethora of interesting pieces of information that are perhaps unknown to many people (many depend on his own calculations).Moreover, being a collection of articles he had written did not affect the flow the book; I think the book was superbly edited."
40,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264081-melydia,4,"A collection of essays by one of the best science popularizers of our time. It's not just about black holes; it's about a lot of different science topics, including astronomy, skepticism, and history of science. It's all very informative and accessible, and each essay is short enough that it's not overwhelming. Recommended.A note on the audio: Dion Graham is a fantastic narrator, but I really wish Tyson had read his own book. Ever since watching Cosmos I've wanted him to read me bedtime stories about the marvels of the universe."

Theories about how life began on earth, the beginning and end of time, and the inevitable demise of planet earth are all covered in this book! The first few chapters are a little slow- but they are building a frame of reference to help those of us that aren't astrophysicists! "

It has a lot of unique textures that the author included to get the story he was telling about the universe and all that was done to get this far out. Little by little, or a piece by piece. I think people who are into Astronomy should read this because this has a lot of facts that were introduced to me that I would of knew about. I am one of those people who know everything about Astronomy, but I can't tell a lot from all that is happening and what has happened."

49,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30391210-jeremy-borden,5,"Death by Black Hole and Other Cosmic Quandaries, by Neil deGrasse Tyson, is a thrilling journey through the cosmos, from the tiniest of subatomic particles to the largest supermassive black holes. Although this book is primarily a fact-dispensing narrative, a cohesive storyline is not lost. Beginning with a discussion of knowledge itself, Tyson progresses to a description of the cosmos itself, the vast array of phenomena, the universal laws of physics, and how science has come to know and understand these things. He finishes the book with a conversation about the role of science in the modern world and how science interacts with culture and even with religion. Tyson does a great job of making very complex scenarios and processes understandable and easy to grasp. Even when he reaches a topic that could become boring, his humor and wit keep it interesting and entertaining. For example, Tyson explains that the universal laws of physics must remain constant wherever one travels. When Tyson ordered hot cocoa with whipped cream and the waiter asserted the whipped cream had sunk to the bottom, Tyson had an interesting response: “Since whipped cream has a very low density and floats on all liquids that humans consume, I offered the waiter two possible explanations: either somebody forgot to add the whipped cream to my hot cocoa or the universal laws of physics were different in his restaurant” (37). This passage, along with others, show just how engaged the author can keep his readers. Along with his humor, Tyson expresses his awe for the material he discusses. He is clearly humbled by the enormity of the universe and the extraordinary means by which so many pieces of the universe formed: “Yes, not only humans but also every other organism in the cosmos, as well as the planets or moons on which they thrive, would not exist but for the wreckage of spent stars. So you’re made of detritus. Get over it. Or better yet, celebrate it. After all, what nobler thought can one cherish than that the universe lives within us all?” (222). Overall, this book warrants little complaint. The author’s humor is wonderful and his excitement for his subject matter is admirable and contagious. The mysteries of the cosmos are explained in a way that makes it difficult not to feel a sense of awe and wonder. Some sections manage to get a little dense, but as long as the reader is interested in the material, these sections remain engaging. Lovers of science in general would enjoy this book. Furthermore, anyone interested in learning about the universe, space, and their phenomena should pick up this book since these topics are presented and explored. Realistically, anyone looking to expand his or her knowledge or looking for a good read could enjoy this book also because it is designed for a curious intellect. However, someone with little to no interest in the universe or cosmology should probably avoid this book as the subject matter could become boring. The section about science and religion is quite intriguing, but it may spark debate with some readers. Tyson provides his own opinions about religion and its relationship with science, expressing a relatively agnostic viewpoint about the divine. Readers with strong religious opinions may find this section to be controversial and as such, they may want to avoid this book or at least skip this section. Still for someone interested in the universe, regardless of religious belief, Tyson’s excellent book will not disappoint. Anyone who wonders about science and discovery should definitely read this tale of the cosmos. Personally, this book, in a way, satisfied my curiosity about the universe, and in a way, only served to spark more curiosity. I learned so much from reading this book, but it inspired me to learn more. My interest in the wonders of the universe was solidified. This was the first of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s books that I have read, but I assure you, he has gained an avid reader. "
50,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7404593-keith-moser,5,"I love Neil deGrasse Tyson. From his old Daily Show interviews to his recent Cosmos series, he's always seemed like a super cool, super intelligent guy. I bought Death by Black Hole back in early 2013, and it sat on my shelf ever since. I decided to finally pick it up and read it, and it wasn't as daunting as I had feared.Tyson is great at writing for the average man. Nothing in this book made me feel like I needed a PhD to grasp the concept. Everything was interesting.I have two complaints, but obviously nothing enough to drop it from 5 stars. First, I really wish there had been some diagrams. There were plenty of things that I've seen before and some things I haven't that I wish would have been included. I know all about Lagrange points but I would have liked to see them next to his description of them. I have no clue what art piece he's describing that has tree shadows falling in non-parallel lines, and I would have loved to see that. I can't remember any specific examples, but there were at least a dozen times I wanted a diagram.Also, the book is slightly worse because it seems (according to the back cover) that it's a collection of monthly ""Universe"" essays. You can tell that the book was edited because it constantly refers to other sections or adds ""as has been discussed,"" but honestly some of the repetitions were just so frequent it was annoying. Still, the range of topics, the depth of each one, and the overall writing was great. I think perhaps, this book would best be read one chapter every other week or every month to let the knowledge sink in, and keep the repetitions at bay."
51,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1551331-chris-white,5,"Absolutely wonderful, Tyson's boundless passion for science and astronomy come through in every sentence and while I'm rarely bored learning about the cosmos no one brings it to life quite like him.Getting the balance right on a book about science written to be accessible to a wide range of readers is a challenge, presumable even for such experienced educators but I found that it rarely was overly technical to the point that I lost a handle about what he was talking about nor did it feel too shallow to be interesting or consistently teach me new things throughout. One thing that really stood out to me was how often he went into detail about the history of science from speculation of the neolithic people through to what we know now; bringing the process and the practices of science into a broader context and giving us insight into how much we've learned and how much we undoubtably still have yet to discover. I particularly enjoyed his insights into the clashes of worldviews, theologies and politics and what roles they've played in science throughout our history. It underscores the need for an open mind and the importance of rejecting anti-science ideas in a time when it is so often derided and besieged.All of which is not to say that this wasn't a book about our universe first and foremost — it is — from discussions of gravity to the nature of light, the smallest of particles to the possibilities of a multiverse you will find science and reason throughout. And yes, death by black hole, galaxies colliding, extinction events and ultimately the seemingly inevitable fact that one day far from now even our universe will die as the last light goes dark, you'll get plenty of insight into how it could all end for us.Death by Black Hole never failed to leave me in wonderment over our existence and how much we still have yet to learn."
52,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1995871-jake,5,"“The remarkable feature of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them.”That is one of many gems I underlined during my reading of Death by Black Hole. Each of Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson’s articles covers some aspect of the universe and our place within it. I’ve gotten in the habit of keeping a book like this next to my reading chair at all times. Over the last year, I read this collection of essays nice and slow, a chapter here and there. Not all prose needs to be edge of your seat to be worthwhile.Despite the ominous title, this book is not an unrelenting tirade about how the sky is falling, or rather being sucked into singular oblivion. Nor is it an all-out attack on traditional/prevailing beliefs. Death by Black Hole is actually full of wit and humor, irony and candidness. Dr. Tyson has an engaging conversational style, and he never misses a chance to tie science into everyday experience. Plus, I get the sense that his research humbles him as much as he hopes it will humble others.You need not agree with everything Tyson asserts. And you’d do well not to make his the only voice you put currency in. As he says in the chapter titled Life in the Universe, “Ordinarily, there is no riskier step that a scientist (or anyone) can take than to make sweeping generalizations from just one example.”Philosophical implications aside, Death by Black Hole is a great way to get to know the universe you live in better. Anyone who wants to be a good citizen needs to be conversant in science. If for no other reason than scientists--like all policy makers--need to be questioned constantly by the people who fund them. "
53,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8083390-a,4,"A general and very interesting look at how our fascinating universe works. My only frame of reference for this type of work is Stephen Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Grand Design"", which attempt to delve fairly deeply into the subject it discusses while still staying outside of the mathematics behind it all. Neil deGrasse Tyson may seem less substantial, but it is largely because he prefers to stick to what has been and what is with regard to the universe. With regard to black holes, whenever we travel into them it is characteristic of deGrasse Tyson's viewpoint that we die. A few brief questions center on what may happen out of the other side, but that is the type of speculation which delves so far outside of the consensus that I don't believe Tyson is very interested in dwelling on it. Don't worry - Tyson ignores the fact that we'd die at any number of points along the journey into the black hole to explore a treasure trove of fascinating details. The scientific consensus provides so many fascinating points to consider about the way our universe works that there is plenty here to enjoy, or refresh on if you've read other pop. science works."
54,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,4,"It took me over two months to read this book, but I think reading this book slowly is the perfect way to enjoy it. When I realized I wasn't going to finish it in time for book club, I slowed down and started reading a chapter a night before going to bed. The chapters are just the right length - 4 to 5 pages - so you aren't overwhelmed with information, and then you have a whole day to mull it over (and the information is very mullable) before you tackle the next topic. I could feel myself getting smarter!*Neil de Grasse Tyson has a real gift for making complicated astrophysics accessible. The topics he chooses are fascinating, especially the section about the many ways the universe is out to get us (you did note the title, didn't you?). His final three chapters about religion and science are bound to ruffle a few feathers, but don't avoid this book on their account. * Results may vary. These statements have not been reviewed by Neil deGrasse Tyson or anyone that is REALLY smart."

And certainly the universe is full of things that can kill the fuck out of us. But the universe is incredibly interesting beyond the obvious negatives of cosmic death.Tyson really breaks apart concepts too complicated for me to explain into little chunks, allowing access for non-astrophysicists. I found his approach witty, interesting, and generally fun.This book is a 5 star book without reservation. You finish the book feeling as if you just sat through the physics class you were too terrified to take in college, but, instead of some professor who is out to give you Fs, your grandfather taught it.I would compare this book with Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", which also attacks the ivy-walled tradition in some science, making it accessible to us liberal arts majors."
56,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2680722-miranda-richards,5,"It's not just about black holes, or even just space! I think the best way to describe this is as a Cosmos-type book. There's a lot of history of science in it, as well as descriptions of the universe. It's diverse in what it covers, and yet it all is well bound up with science. If you liked Cosmos, give Death by Black Hole a read.Neil deGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist and is currently the director of the Hayden Planetarium and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. You may have seen him on any number of television shows, such as History Channel's ""The Universe,"" ""The Colbert Report"" and PBS's ""Nova Science Now,"" the latter of which he hosts. He is probably the leading science communicator of the day since Carl Sagan's death. I listened to the Blackstone audiobook version from Audible.com, narrated by Dion Graham, who really managed to capture Dr. Tyson's style."

It's a series of essays on many different astronomical subjects that strike the fancy and border science fiction. Astronomy borders science fiction anyway in many cases, so there's even more ground for such forays than ""normal"".From what death by black hole would be like, as the title implies, to the zero-gravitational bowls of our cosmic neighbourhood, to an essay on light-pollution and another one on hollywood astonomy goofs, to the foundations of science, physics and astronomy themselves and their own problematics, to, to, to, and, and and! These are from the top of my head and I read the book more than 2 years ago.Neil deGrasse Tyson seems to be a talented populariser of his field, like Carl Sagan I believe, and I'd like to read more from him. I even want to read DBBH again first chance! If you like astronomy, or want to like astronomy more than you do now, look no further."
58,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13835306-paul-pickell,4," This is a great down-to-Earth book for the lay astrophysicist. Personally, I felt that Tyson accomplished exactly what he set out to do in this prose: provide an accessible understanding of the cosmos at large. In general, the book is a very easy read. Some parts required a deeper understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum or black hole physics, but Tyson is a very accomplished explainer-of-things otherwise, particularly for his field of expertise: star creation and galaxy evolution. Many topics are repeated thoroughly throughout the some 40 chapters, sometimes nearly word-for-word. Tyson is unabashedly an Americanist in his view of science. I leave a star absent because of his no-holds-barred attitude toward ""ancients"" and non-""civilizations"", providing little recognition of the possibility that other humans could have come to similar conclusions throughout history that needn't lived in the ""Northern"" or ""Western hemispheres"". Tyson's work is colonizing, in this way."

The author's enthusiasm for all things cosmic comes shining through in this book. As a person that has a passing interest in black holes, quasar and other stuff like that. This book provides a great crash course in all things spacey. I now feel a little bit smarter but I am also now in awe of the scientist t past and present that seek to unravel the secrets of our universe. The book is cut up nicely into sections dealing with individual subjects. I did find it a tad annoying that the authors amusing explanations of certain things repeated throughout the book. This to me tarnished this otherwise great read. I particularly liked how he pulled apart common misconceptions like the sun rises in the east and set in the west. Overall this is science delivered in a way us commoners can understand without dumbing it down too much. As for the title I for one am not in favour of meeting my end this way."
60,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2498218-branimir,3,"I have mixed feelings about this book.First, this is not a single work, but a collection of essays. Which is sometimes nice. I enjoyed that because I could read a few essays, make a pause, and continue without a fear of forgetting what was written before. Essays are well-written. They offer nice glimpses into astronomy.And they were, to me, mostly boring.The reason is that I am not the target audience for this book. I am a physicist and have loved astronomy since I was a kid. Therefore, I knew most of the stuff this book writes about.To cut the long story short, I would recommend this book to three types of people:1. astronomy enthusiasts, but not very advanced ones2. scientists who would like to popularize science, because one can see how to write a nice article for general population3. anyone else interested in science and astronomy, but with no formal astronomy/physics background."

If you've ever enjoyed his narration/hosting on Nova, this book will certainly please you. An excellent read for anyone interested in popular science and cutting-edge development."

Well written and quite amusing at times. At the end he has an essay about the relation of science to religion and gives the standard opinion that the two have nothing to do with one another. He does quote some survey findings that while 90% of Americans say they are religious, 60% of mathematicians say they are and just 30% of physicists. I recall a survey conducted by Scientific American of Nobel Laureates who responded 5% were religious. "

One can easily enjoy the learning experience that is this book, even if they do not enjoy nonfiction, guided by interesting analogies (It is raining and you are bored, so of course you stick a big test tube out the window to collect water) and the perfect level of sassiness expected from Tyson.

Yet he is a great teacher. I am not a novice in scientific readings about the cosmos but deGrasse Tyson succeeds to teach me many other aspects and concepts I didn't know.And by the way it has been decided: I need a telescope.

But, because it was a collection of previously published essays from a magazine, each chapter and section ended up being fairly repetitive of other sections.

I suspect there are better introductory works to astrophysics."

The book is also based on articles printed over time and many of his stories and illustrations are repeated in different chapters, i.e., it is somewhat repetitious.

101,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65940767-mridula-venkatesh,5,"“Not only do we live among the stars, the stars live within us.” ― Neil deGrasse Tyson, Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries Upon watching a Netflix documentary titled “Black Hole Apocalypse” and being sufficiently mind-blown, I immediately picked up Neil deGrasse Tyson’s brilliant collection of essays and devoured it. Needless to say, I absolutely love the way he writes. This book covers a plethora of cosmic quandaries – from how it all began, to how Hollywood filmmakers just don’t get their night skies right, to how you could die while being sucked into a black hole, - with some cultural references, dry humor and enjoyable witticisms sprinkled along to make the read immensely enjoyable.The entire book is divided into seven sections, with essays packed with tidbits of interesting cosmological information - from how celestial objects can be held in orbit by the Five Points of Lagrange, to how the romance between antiparticles and particles matter in the creation of the universe, as delineated in the essay titled Antimatter Matters. This essay explains with wonderful simplicity and sharp clarity, how a pair of high energy gamma rays interact to form an electron-positron pair, thereby creating matter (and anti-matter) from pure energy, as captured by Einstein’s famous energy-mass conversion equation.The section “The Meaning of Life” is easily my most favorite. It described with brilliance that we are all stardust. The essays in this section threw light on supernovae - how they are the primary source of all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in the universe and that the resulting gas clouds from these explosions, are rich in atoms of hydrogen, helium, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen, which can then combine in myriad ways to form the first molecules in space and consequently, the next generation of stars. Also, in the essay titled “Goldilocks and the Three Planets”, in his typical humorous fashion Neil deGrasse Tyson extends Goldilocks’ “just-right” principle to the “just-right” distance from the sun for a planet to be habitable. He went on to explain how the habitable zone in a solar system, simply needs enough energy to liquefy water. And so, it is quite possible that Europa, one of Jupiter’s moons, being constantly heated up by the tidal forces of Jupiter’s gravitational field, is one of the most alluring places in the solar system for the possibility of life!In the end, it is perhaps the closing section of the book that stayed with me the most. With equal part derision and equal part humor, Neil deGrasse Tyson delves into how Science and God collide in understanding the universe. From lambasting Aristotle’s earth-centered universe, to gently chiding Newton for invoking God to explain how the universe didn’t crash in on itself despite the conflicting gravitational systems at work, he also goes all out to decimate commonly held public misconceptions – such as what goes up does NOT necessarily have to come down and that the north star is NOT the brightest star in the night sky.Since this is a collection of essays – it is only natural that some of the topics get repeated and you are introduced to Huygens, Galileo, Copernicus, Kepler and others, more than once. However, I was thankful for these redundancies because it refreshed my memory and reinforced concepts. For a lay-person who is curious about the universe and interested to know more about it, this book is a wonderful place to start. It is not only hugely informative but also thoroughly charming and absolutely delightful, because truth be told, only Neil deGrasse Tyson has the ability to make something as complex as particle physics, chaos theory and black holes to be an unputdownable entertainer."
102,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5721922-kasey,2,"This book did inform me of new (or old) concepts that scientists are currently facing and the interesting dilemmas they pose. The book also was explained in a way that someone like me, not an actual scientist, just someone who enjoys science, can understand. The problem was that in order to get to the science, I had to dig through unnecessary commentary and ranting. The ranting. More than anything I felt this was an excuse for the author to rant. And in order to understand why he was ranting, I had to go learn the topics he was ranting on. So technically scientific information was conveyed (yay!) but it was taxing. It may have been easier to read a textbook.I may have left this book at three stars, except for the last section of the book. The idea of religion and where, how, or if it fits in with science is always going to come up and how we as humans respond to that always intrigues me. This book however, left me not only unimpressed, but edging closer to insult then disbelief as I started to wonder why he wrote what he did, his context, what bias does he have, what biases am I bringing in view of this?I spent some time thinking on it, and I believe some issues need to be addressed.-I commend you for mentioning that there has been a resurgence of scientists who claim to be religious. It is growing trend. Whether for the moment or because scientists feel more comfortable admitting their religious views, we shall see.-My biggest problem is that you have assumed that once religious scientists find something they do not understand, they just give up and say ""God must handle that"" or ""this is the domain of God."" At one time this may have been the case, however in modern times, I have found this to be the farthest thing from what a religious scientist thinks. If anything it is more along the lines of, ""we have no idea how this works. Can you believe it? Some being made it that way and it is fascinating."" Usually from there more research is done to try to understand how this 'being' or 'god' was able to create something so intricate that we can't even understand it.-I do bring a bias, I am religious, and I love science. I also talk with others who have more expertise than me in the scientific domains but also share similar religious beliefs. Using the Christian God as an example, every time one of us learns more about a new topic it only adds to our wonder and awe of God. If we find something we cannot explain, we don't stop looking. We allow ourselves a moment to be amazed that as intelligent as we are, there is someone bigger than us, and we humble ourselves. Then we continue our search for understanding. The more that science, nature, the universe is understood, the more of God's character we understand. Our goal is to know God, see what he's done, and like children, maybe we can copy him.-As you were frequent to do, here's a story that might hep explain: ""A father gives his son a pocket watch and tells him that he made it for him to tell time. The son understands that and knows how to use it. Then one day the son notices that the watch has engravings on it. Then he realizes that if left in the sun it becomes warm. He makes note of other little things and becomes curious. As children often do, he breaks it open. Inside are all sorts of metal bits clicks and turning. The son is amazed, so many tiny pieces all working together. The son keeps investigating and discovers a spring, something he's familiar with. But now he questions how a spring can be used to tell time. And what everything else is for. More investigation occurs. On and on it goes until the son eventually understands how all the pieces work together. It started with what he observed on the outside, then he had to keep digging, some parts he didn't have a name for yet, it looked like chaos to him, but he kept playing with it until he understood it."" That could be a story about how a boy figures out how to build a pocket watch, a useful skill, but not the point. He was trying to figure it out because his father gave it to him. His father made it. He was astounded by what his father did. That is the perspective that religion can offer.-That is the view that many, if not most religious scientists have. So it leaves me wondering where are you getting your data? How old is it? Are you trying to write sensationalist articles? As a scientist, I feel that you should have more integrity than what was displayed in your book.-You have also noted that the universe is full of things of chaos that a person of religion cannot intelligently explain. It must either be ""God's doing,"" or ""there's no place in science for religion.""-I believe you have limited yourself. Perhaps what you view as chaos is just part of a larger machine or system we do not yet understand. Like when the little boy first sees all the inner workings of a watch. That looks pretty close to chaos. Religious people can accept the fact that not everything is understandable or knowable right now, not that we stop looking. We understand that sometimes we as individuals and humans as a whole must wait. That is okay. So we continue looking. ""Chaos"" to us is just something we do not yet understand, but you've made a bold statement saying there is no explanation for it and I worry for the day you may be proven wrong, and another author rants about you and your ""misguided theories."" -Finally, you mention religious texts as sources for how the world or the universe works and since they don't give an explanation, they don't really do much. Here's a secret, religious texts don't explain how the universe works. It is not their purpose. You don't open your car's instruction manual to figure out how to fix your microwave or to get lost in poetry. Every type of writing has a purpose. The Christian Bible's main purpose is to tell us who God is, what he's done, and what he wants us to do. (yes there are many more topics in the Bible but the biggest themes). There isn't a need for God to say ""By the way 63.3 light-years away is a galaxy where..."" (not a quote, and I have no idea what's that far away). But in the context of the book's purpose...it would be weird, and wouldn't make sense. You seem to have an energy and a passion for research, perhaps next time you could apply it where people meet science because in the domain of research, multiple points of view are critical, and to summarily dismiss them all seems to be highly arrogant. The fact of the matter is, we are ALL still learning."
103,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52152494-catalin-negru,4,"Target audience: Mainly common people fascinated, interested or even curious about astronomy and how the Universe work.About the author: According to Wikipedia, Neil deGrasse Tyson is an American astrophysicist, cosmologist, author, and science communicator. Since 1996, he has been the Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Rose Center for Earth and Space in New York City. The center is part of the American Museum of Natural History, where Tyson founded the Department of Astrophysics in 1997 and has been a research associate in the department since 2003. Tyson's research has focused on observations in cosmology, stellar evolution, galactic astronomy, bulges, and stellar formation. He has held numerous positions at institutions including the University of Maryland, Princeton University, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Hayden Planetarium.Structure of the book: The book has 384 pages, divided in a Prologue and seven sections; the sections are subsequently divided into 42 smaller parts (chapters) totally.Overview:Even if you never heard or seen Neil deGrasse Tyson speaking, when you start reading the book you immediately realize that he is very intelligent. Why? For the simple fact that he has the gift of making complicated things look simple, accessible to anyone. It is one thing to be an expert in your field, and a totally different thing to be able to explain your field to people who have no idea about it. In this aspect Neil deGrasse Tyson excels. His style is relaxed and anything but dry, while his enthusiasm for the subject bleeds on the page.Despite its name, the book is not only or even mainly about black holes, how we understand them or how they affect us in the future. “Death by black hole” is in fact the name of the 33th chapter, not even of the first chapter or of a section; as if the author chose a random title of a chapter and put it as a general title. The book is not even only about astronomy astrophysics, but about science; the path it had to take to come to this point of exploring black holes and many other wonders of the Universe, and also about the many challenges science has to face in our human world (human ignorance in particular). Because this is what black holes are: true wonders. And the Universe has many, many wonders waiting for us to discover them; we only have to be willing to search for them.“Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries” is a collection of small essays that deGrasse Tyson has written for various newspapers, magazines, and internet blogs. Together, these essays constitute science advocacy by exploring the importance of and important issues in astrophysics as well as general discoveries in science. Any fan of popular science will find at least one of the essays worth reading. It is a must-read for anyone that looks up at the night sky and asks questions. If you are a science fan and you have an initial understanding of physics, then you will get the full experience intended by Tyson; if you are a stranger to science, this book will be like a beautiful trip into a magic realm.Neil deGrasse Tyson has inherited Carl Sagan’s unofficial Science Ambassadorship to the People. And, from this position, “Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries” is one of his statements in favor of science. Even though we use smartphones and have satellites in orbit, science still is plagued with misconceptions and thus it needs as many charismatic spokespersons as possible to promote the field in an interesting and insightful way, without ignoring the realities of how it all really works.The book takes the readers through the cosmos, for their beginning and to their ultimate end, to enthrall and inform his audience. Tyson goes into exceptional detail of the physics behind our universe, but manages to remove all the technical jargon that would leave most confused and frustrated; therefore allowing readers to become better educated in an area of convoluted theories and fundamental dilemmas, such as quantum mechanics and where it should fit in the “Theory of Everything”, first conceived by Stephen Hawking.One of the most interesting parts was the connection to how social problems impact the study of astrophysics; especially when religion comes into play. Tyson reminds us that religion and science do not make a good team. Never. On the contrary, history proved this aspect over and over again and today it is no different from yesterday. Giordano Bruno, Isaac Newton, Galileo Galilei – there are many examples in the history of the Western civilization of how religion slowed or even reversed scientific progress and the development of knowledge. However, probably the most important and clear lesson in this matter is the fate and evolution of the Islamic civilization. It was the most advanced in the 10th century and we have so many things in science today due to the Islamic/Arabic civilization, but, due to rise of religious fundamentalism, it came to be today the main producer of terrorism.Bottom line, if you want a few laughs, and if you want to learn about astrophysics, astronomy, “regular” physics, and all the other amazing things that happen in our cosmos, then this the book to read.Quote:  Believe me, if the Bible had ever been shown to be a rich source of scientific answers and understanding, we would be mining it daily for cosmic discovery. Yet my vocabulary of scientific inspiration strongly overlaps with that of religious enthusiasts. I, like others, am humbled in the presence of the objects and phenomena of our universe. And I go misty with admiration for its splendor. Strong points: The book is very rich in details and very easy to follow. And that is a big plus. In addition, as always, Neil deGrasse Tyson has a very simple and direct approach to present science both in an informative and humorous way. It makes reading this book a delight. If you only seen Tyson talking or keeping speeches live or on the Internet, then the book have the same pleasant and entertaining tone. It is a pleasure to listen to and to read his material.Weak points: I personally enjoyed the book, but the disjointed essay format might not be appealing to some people. One can also see Tyson as an opinionated person. Moreover, the information is sometimes repetitive and I find it a little too lengthy. In my opinion the real value of the book is 4,5 stars. But, because I can’t give it 4,5 stars, I think it is fair to rate it negatively at 4 stars._______________★★★ Follow us on Goodreads★★★ Visit our website www.reasonandreligion.org"
104,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70636414-daniel-chapin,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed Death By Black Hole. Tyson made a very interesting, informative, and most importantly fun to read book. This book may as well have the exact same review as my review of a Short History of Nearly Everything. They are books of the same concept, and I really liked them both. They are scientific books that attract a more significant deal of interest than your stereotypical mind-numbing textbook. As Samadrita said,""Tyson will have most probably given you the stink eye or aimed a sarcastic jibe at your apathy, before proceeding to explain why black holes still remain a topic of much speculation in the community of astrophysicist worldwide"". He makes the highly scientific and otherwise inconceivably challenging to comprehend topics, fun to learn about and much easier to absorb and remember. When given an article to read or a sum of information to digest and do my best to comprehend, I typically do not enjoy doing so. This makes homework significantly more challenging to enjoy. I believe that if I were given a chapter of this book to read every day or two and write a little summary for science class, I would genuinely enjoy science homework(assuming such an endeavor is possible to accomplish). One other thing, the book was not only fun but easy to read. As Bradley said,""This is a very fun read for all you science nerds."" Once you start reading the book, you will be suddenly pulled into lots and lots of incredibly interesting information. Once you get pulled into this book, you will find yourself finding the ""science nerd"" side of you. The book is so fascinating that you will have fun reading it. Once you start to have fun reading it, it becomes stupendously easy to understand. When you find it easy to read, you will find yourself encouraged to continue reading, continuing to have fun, and feeding this cycle consisting of enjoyment and text with very high clarity. It was a really intriguing experience finding myself in this loop. I will for sure continue to read books similar to this one. This book is an excellent read for, yes science nerds, but also individuals who are not conclusive on their interest of science and the intricacies it holds. Don't be discouraged by the number of complex thoughts found in this book. It just makes the read that much more satisfying once you conquer the subjects in this heap of information."
105,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59151570-bede-millner,4,"An EXTREMELY interesting book. But if I’m to be honest, I didn’t understand all of it haha. And if I could sum it up using one term, it would be “mind-f#%king”.However, all credit to de Grasse Tyson who somehow manages to write about such complex topics in a way that is in fact for the most part digestible and comprehensible.Despite this, there are some theories and scientific discoveries he details that I simply cannot fathom! For example, that after literally one second of the Big Bang our universe was the size the Milky Way is currently. a) How the f#%k can that be possible!? And b) How the f#%k can anyone possibly know that with any degree of confidence??? I’ll just have to accept that my astrophysics brain is still very immature...I must point out that as this is actually a collection of essays (that were written weeks/months/years apart), there is a noticeable amount of repetition between chapters. Which can be annoying, but is generally acknowledged and dealt with by Tyson and the book flows surprisingly well considering.I would absolutely recommend this book, however warn prospective readers that it’s quite intense, and can be a hard slog at times. But is without doubt eye-opening and enlightening."
106,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18860680-tim-sneath,3,"Loved the subject matter, and all credit to NdGT for his popularization of astrophysics; but this work betrayed too strongly its origins as a series of magazine articles. Despite the efforts during the editing phase to structure and order the chapters into a logical flow, the book was riddled with repeated concepts and even anecdotes, sometimes even contradicting each other. In one chapter, he rails against those who assume extraterrestrial life will be wildly different to life on earth, since the same physical concepts apply; just a couple of chapters later, he describes an argument with a biologist who was skeptical that a Martian meteorite showed evidence of life because his frame of reference was too biased towards earth-like biology. And his reference to the same metaphors in multiple chapters (e.g. the ""Goldilocks"" habitable zone) reminded me a little of a forgetful uncle who is retelling the same story that he's shared at every past Thanksgiving dinner for the last decade!So - a good book to read a chapter at a time, filling in a spare moment here or there - but not a great choice to pursue from cover to cover."
107,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12191930-julie,3,"In a book about the cosmos, I had expectations of being astounded and filled with wonder. Meeting my expectations, however, is not the author’s responsibility. The book did provide me with new knowledge and understanding. Tyson writes in an enthusiastic style tinged with humor.The last chapter was most interesting to me as a Christian. He claims that believers in intelligent design embrace a “philosophy of ignorance” in which anything not understood is considered “divinely constructed and beyond their intellectual capacity.” I’ve sat on a pew in the middle of the Bible Belt all my life and have never heard a Christian resign themselves to ignorance about the physical world on this basis."
108,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/208540-alicia,5,"This is a more comprehensive version of astrophysics for people in a hurry. I appreciated the greater detail and philosophical ramblings as well as the layout of the narrative. It was sadly not read in the audiobook version by Neil, but Dion Graham did do a great job. I love it when he goes off on tangents about how Hollywood directors botching the depiction of celestial happenings. I tend to have a hard time while watching movies because the practicality and reality of the scenes being portrayed as well. "
109,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42840551-wes-calloway,5,"Tyson knocks it out of the parkI didn't think anyone was dumber than me when it came to astrophysics. While I am still in the woods when it comes to understanding the cosmos, I gained a high amount of knowledge from this book. I will keep it handy as a reference. Highly recommended read for anyone interested in science."

For me that discussion tied a lot of concepts together in my mind for the first time."
115,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1442431-chad-bearden,4,"When I was in middle school, I deduced, based on my love of dinosaurs, that I would grow up to be a scientist. I received good grades in science, so it seemed plausible. When I got to high school, my dear friend, Rachel, pointed out to me in the school library a copy of Stephen Hawkings' ""A Brief History of Time"". At that point, I shifted from paleontology to astrophysics. I even went to far as to send off to the University of Michigan about their physics program.Then I started taking trig and calculus and my rocky relationship with the manipulation of numbers convinced me that literature was my thing.And yet, despite casting away science as a potential profession, I've always harbored a love for understanding how things work. I try to read any science books I can, delving into things as complex as my limited brain can manage. I once read ""Paradox Lost"" by Phillip Wallace and realized that I should take closer note of the difficulty of what I was trying to read lest I fall in waay over my head. I'm sure that to any undergraduate physics student, there wasn't anything too mind-bending in that volume, but I should repeat: literature is my thing.So in more recent years, I've been happy reading the more lay-friendly science writers. Carl Sagan, Robert Weinberg, James Gleick, and such. All of these men are geniouses in their own right, but they have an unusual knack for getting around all the hard math and esoteric (to me) equations and presenting the practically inpenetratable world of complex physics to people like me: readers who have a passable working knowledge of physical principles and a creative enough mind to almost picture something even when you don't fully understand it.Enter into that fold the recently ubiquitous astrophysicist, Neil Degrasse Tyson. Tyson is basically the Carl Sagan of our generation. If you're not in the know, Carl Sagan made it his life's mission to bring science to the masses. He was its cheerleader shouting through the megaphone that was his many popular books and the accessable PBS mini-series, Cosmos. In the last several years, Tyson has taken up that mantle and would do Sagan proud.In addition to being the director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York, and hosting Nova Science Now (also on PBS!), and appearing a handful of times on shows like ""The Daily Show"" and ""The Colbert Report"", he has also been writing physics-related essays for 'Natural History' magazine. This book, ""Death By Black Hole"" brings together 42 of those essays.The collection is a pretty solid one, and even the weaker essays (tongue-in-cheek though it may have been, did we really need an essay about the scientific inaccuracies in Hollywood movies?) are filled with enough of Tyson's wit so that you're not bored by the content for too long.And then there are the really good essays. Tyson is at his best when he's telling you, not about the inner workings of quantum particals, but about the process of science. One essay outlines how one might go on to discover the circumference of the Earth and invent geometry using only a stick. Another steps you through all the ways in which scientifically proven reality differs greatly from with is immediately observable.There are a handful of essays that describe all the ways the universe wants to kill you, a few that get down to the nitty-gritty of how the universe evolved, and a few about the immense scale of the universe (in the direction of both the big and the small).And interspesed throughout the essays are those magical moments (the whole reason I read popular physics writings) where a chill runs down my spine as I realize that the universe is something huge and beyond anyone's capacity to understand. Where the vastness and pure unknowable quality of everything becomes almost crushingly oppressive. I almost become afraid. There WAS a moment when the Big Bang occured, and SOMETHING was there before that, and I, nor any other person alive is likely to know what THAT was. Billions of years from now the universe will end, and no one will be alive to see what THAT is like. When I come across those moments, I feel empty in the pit of my stomach and have to put the book down for a moment. Everything we do as humans suddenly seems hollow and pointless (harkening back to that brilliant 'Pale Blue Dot' photograph taken by Voyager 1 at the behest of Carl Sagan).It stuns and impresses me that today's astrophysicists, in spite of all the despair, have the wherewithall to keep trying to figure everything out anyway.But I digress. Neil Degrasse Tyson is a fun and enthusiastic guy, a smart guy, and a down-to-earth guy, and this essay collection captures all of that. He really is the perfect modern day vessle to carry on what Carl Sagan started thirty years ago."

This led me to wonder several times if I had misplaced my bookmark or if the book was intended to be read linearly. I love Neil's enthusiasm for the subject, but some of his pop culture critiques seem more nitpicky than actual misconceptions."

118,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4369018-lee,3,"Neil deGrasse Tyson is a great scientist and writer, and a champion of public engagement and equal opportunities in the sciences (just watch this clip if you don't believe me). Death by Black Hole is a mildly edited selection of his weekly articles from the magazine Natural History. The original articles appeared between 1995 and 2005 and cover a range of topics, although cosmology is their primary focus, what with Neil deGrasse Tyson being, you know, a cosmologist.Even if you already know quite a lot about space and Physics there's plenty to learn within the collection, or at least re-learn in interesting ways. My own qualifications in the field extend to an A-level in Physics and, more importantly, being a former member of the erstwhile Boston Astronomers Society as a ten-year-old Lee. Yet even with that prodigious pedigree I had things to learn. Like the fact that Uranus was originally called George (I challenge you not to be amused by the notion of the solar system's eight planets being Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and George). Also: the reason clockwise is the direction that it is is because the first clocks were sundials, and they were invented in the Northern hemisphere. Since in this hemisphere the sun travels from east to west across the south of the sky the shadow moves clockwise around the sundial and this direction was inherited by those new-fangled clocks upon their invention centuries later. And then of course there was the revelation that quarks were named after a line in 
Finnegans Wake
: “Three quarks for Muster Mark!” corrsponding with the three flavours of quark that were initially proposed. This was perhaps the greatest surprise in the book, since I had no idea that anyone had read Finnegans Wake. (Although it turns out this etymology might be somewhat inaccurate. The term “quark” for the subatomic particle was apparently chosen on a whim by Murray Gell-Mann, who wasn't sure whether to pronounce it so as to rhyme with Spark or with Spork. He eventually chose the former because he saw the line in Finnegans Wake and figured that James Joyce had meant his “quark” to rhyme with Mark.)As mentioned earlier, the collection is made up of mildly edited versions of some of Neil deGrasse Tyson's weekly articles. And therein lies the only real problem with the book – it would really have benefitted from some more substantial editing. Given that the magazine articles are spread over eleven years it makes sense that in them certain topics are repeated. Expecting the reader of the February 2003 issue of Natural History to have both read and memorised every article from 1995 onwards would be folly. But expecting the reader of page 203 in a medium-sized paperback to have read and remembered all the previous pages is not such a stretch. Sure, certain ideas are worth repeating to hammer them home, but after a while you're not banging home ideas any more, you're just hitting wood. As it were. The section on where elements come from (spoiler: the answer is space) is particularly guilty of this. Half of every article in the section is devoted either to the explanation of how all the elements up to iron are crafted in stars, or else how complex molecules form in the vast dust clouds of space. I've not heard anyone say ""we are all made of stars"" so much since I listened to that Moby track. The only concession to this is the occasional use of the phrase “as we saw earlier” or sometimes “as we will see later”.This criticism is a criticism borne from love, though. Neil deGrasse Tyson writes really well and with eleven years worth of articles to choose from there were presumably essays that he could have included that he didn't include, on topics that end up not being mentioned. So when you read yet another article about where the heavier elements come from you have to wonder where these other essays argon.Argon! Geddit? Okay, what about: when you read yet another article about where the heavier elements come from you have to wonder what other essays Neil wrote, and why he chose to barium.Barium! Bury ’em! Geddit? Ah, forget it."
119,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5683214-luke-langley,3,"'Death by Black Hole' addresses a wide array of questions regarding the study of the cosmos, its origin, laws, and demise. Tyson does a great job of presenting the wonders of astronomy to the average reader discussing difficult issues as quantum physics and as easy as misconceptions of science in popular films. He discusses the history, advancement, principles, and personalities of astrophysics in an engaging way. My only problem I have with this book and with the approach Tyson takes to science is that he has a complete disregard for the contribution of the Catholic Church towards science, he holds mislead ideas on the crusades and inquisition, and most importantly believes that science and religion are inherently opposed to one another. He discusses these issues in the concluding chapter of the book as it is present in his TV series ""Cosmos"". He ridicules blind faith, and rightly so, but he himself has blind animosity towards religion. Quotes for better or worse:“When scientifically investigating the natural world, the only thing worse than a blind believer is a seeing denier.” “So you're made of detritus [from exploded stars]. Get over it. Or better yet, celebrate it. After all, what nobler thought can one cherish than that the universe lives within us all?” “Scientific inquiry shouldn't stop just because a reasonable explanation has apparently been found.” “The remarkable feature of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them. After the laws of physics, everything else is opinion.” “Not only do we live among the stars, the stars live within us.” “When scientifically investigating the natural world, the only thing worse than a blind believer is a seeing denier.” “So you're made of detritus [from exploded stars]. Get over it. Or better yet, celebrate it. After all, what nobler thought can one cherish than that the universe lives within us all?” “As a child, I was aware that, at night, infrared vision would reveal monsters hiding in the bedroom closet only if they were warm-blooded. But everybody knows that your average bedroom monster is reptilian and cold-blooded.” “Scientific inquiry shouldn't stop just because a reasonable explanation has apparently been found.” “The remarkable feature of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them. After the laws of physics, everything else is opinion.” ""While the Copernican principle comes with no guarantees that it will forever guide us to cosmic truths, it's worked quite well so far: not only is Earth not in the center of the solar system, but the solar system is not in the center of the Milky Way galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy is not in the center of the universe, and it may come to pass that our universe is just one of many that comprise a multiverse. And in case you're one of those people who thinks that the edge may be a special place, we are not at the edge of anything either.” “Allow intelligent design into science textbooks, lecture halls, and laboratories, and the cost to the frontier of scientific discovery—the frontier that drives the economies of the future—would be incalculable. I don't want students who could make the next major breakthrough in renewable energy sources or space travel to have been taught that anything they don't understand, and that nobody yet understands, is divinely constructed and therefore beyond their intellectual capacity. The day that happens, Americans will just sit in awe of what we don't understand, while we watch the rest of the world boldly go where no mortal has gone before.” “Science is a philosophy of discovery. Intelligent design is a philosophy of ignorance.You cannot build a program of discovery on the assumption that nobody is smart enough to figure out the answer to a problem.” “Let there be no doubt that as they are currently practiced, there is no common ground between science and religion.” “Some morning while your eating breakfast and you need something new to think about, though, you might want to ponder the fact that you see your kids across the table not as they are but as they once were, about three nanoseconds ago.” "
120,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell,4,"Despite the title, this is not a book of cosmic quandaries or fantastic ways to die. Dangerous cosmic things make up one slim section. The title is a trick, meant to sucker you into reading about physics, and Tyson’s book is one of the best on that subject I’ve ever read. A good friend said he was the next in the Carl Sagan line; how Sagan made physics a bit more approachable, then Hawking expanded what was known and articulated it better, and now Tyson comes even closer to explaining in plain language what is barely comprehendable to the human mind. If Hawking’s A Brief History of Time was an attempt, and The Universe in a Nutshell was a simplification for novices, Tyson’s book is perhaps the easiest to understand introduction to the mechanics of the universe on the market. His tone is conversational and he grounds almost all information in human experience, including one section where he displays how many features of the earth can be determined by a stick and string in your backyard (these include distance from the sun, orbit and the curvature of the planet). Sections here on the earth, the solar system, stars, dark matter, astronomy, the big bang, Newtonian physics, the building blocks of life and more are excellent starters for study in the sciences; not the whole story, but fine introductions for laymen and brush-ups for students. The book is a good gift for kids headed to college, as preparation for the onslaught of equations and abstract theories they’re going to battle.In addition to the competence of his language, Tyson is amongst the most enthusiastic proponents of science in our culture. It is a great pleasure to hear him talk about the mysteries and answers we have with our cosmos, and that translates to the page. He is always on the border of babbling with fascination at how much and how little we know about the way the universe works. It may be contagious. Sometimes it’s adorable, like when he spends a section complaining that extraterrestrials in science fiction, like E.T., are too humanoid. It’s actual nerd rage.Sometimes that enthusiasm gets in his way. One section argues that we are afraid of negative numbers and decimals, ignoring pragmatic explanations for why they aren’t used (car lots often promise cash back instead of direct discounts because of internal rebate programs; betting odds are given in the form of “seven to two” instead of “one to three point five” because they take fewer numbers and less time to say). His nitpicking is funny when you see his own flaws: in one section he explains that the earth can’t really die (it isn’t alive; we are, and can ruin earth for ourselves), but then makes the same mistake in repeatedly saying that the universe will die (and it can’t, but all the stars can go out, making life much less sustainable). He misuses words like evolution to describe the development of the universe. Evolution has to do with change over generations, where Tyson argues that the laws of the universe are and have almost always been pretty constant. By his description astral bodies did not evolve, but matter went through a few processes, then set – stars are not constantly spawning new generations of stars with heritable and beneficial traits, and according to Tyson, this one generation of stars will go out and that’ll be it. But we know why does these things; they’re easy to articulate to a wide audience. So perhaps he should lay off the car salesmen, though I agree with him on Hollywood aliens.Despite him getting carried away, and outright disagreeing with some of his premises, Death By Black Hole is a heck of a science book. People who want to appreciate the sciences more but weren’t gripped by topics in school should give it a try."
121,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1080484-teji,4,"Centennial Book Club: 11/5/12: LynnThought-provoking.This book was compiled, with some mild editing to make everything hang together as a book, from a series of essays that Tyson wrote for Natural History magazine. This results in a book that covers myriad astrophysical topics. Tyson (as you know if you have seen him in any one of his many television appearances—media darling on all things astrophysical that he is) has a true passion for astrophysics and a desire to make his beloved field accessible and understandable to more people. As a result, he takes the time to break down the why and how behind the science and he uses lots of humor, analogies, and everyday language (well, as much as possible given we are talking about quantum mechanics and astrophysics) in his explanations. I particularly liked how he integrated the discoveries and theories of important historical scientist to show the progression of science in general; for me, this helped to connect many of the dots. His explanation also helped me to have an aha! moment about the theory of relativity (that not only can matter create light but that light can create matter) that I supposed I had always known on some level (seems obvious, at least the way he writes about it) but don’t think I had ever fully consciously thought about. I also enjoyed the random references to the “science” techno-babble of Star Trek. I also found the part about the birth, care and feeding, and death of black holes very interesting, but I was surprised that this came so late in the book—given the title.Quotes:""When thought of as an ensemble of experimental tools, our senses enjoy an astonishing acuity and range of sensitivity...note that what we gain in breadth we lose in precision: we register the world's stimuli in logarithmic rather than linear increments..."" p25-26""The honing of our senses from birth through childhood allows us, as adults, to pass judgment on events and phenomena in our lives, declaring whether they ""make sense"". Problem is, hardly any scientific discoveries of the past century flowed from the direct application of our five senses. They flowed instead from the direct application of sense-transcendent mathematics and hardware. This simple fact is entirely responsible for why, to the average person, relativity, particle physics, and 10-dimensional string theory make no sense..."" p29“A paradox of galactic engines is that their black holes must eat to radiate…To feed a healthy quasar requires that its black hole eat up to ten stars every year” p271“It is possible, then, for a black hole to eat so much that its event horizon grows so large that its tidal forces are no longer sufficient to shred a star…the star gets eaten whole as it plunges past the event horizon…” p273“Black holes are regions of space where gravity is so high that the fabric of space and time have curved back on itself).” p283“If one star in a binary system becomes a black hole, then the black hole does not get to eat until late in the companion star’s life, when it swells to become a red giant. If the red giant grows large enough, then it will ultimately get flayed, as the black hole peels and eats the star, layer by layer. But for a star that just happens to wander into the neighborhood, tidal forces will initially stretch it, but eventually, differential rotation will shear the star into a friction-heated disk of highly luminous gas.” p287"
122,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7724604-lenny-ankireddi,4,"Being an admirer of the author and having followed his work and talks through various other media, it wasn't very hard for me to choose to read this book which is the first one by Neil DeGrasse Tyson that I chose to pick up. Being also a vehement aficionado of Physics in general, the content of the book was exceptionally gratifying not only in that it touched upon a very wide range of physical phenomena but also the work done, the successes and failures encountered and the illustrious names involved in the forwarding of such scientific progress. If a book is judged by its title, as it is wisely often advised it should not be, this book is likely to get a very skewed first impression as the reader forms a picture of what the book might be about. I would advise the reader to focus on the subtitle ""And other cosmic quandaries"" and take note that these other quandaries outnumber the discussions around black holes and their life-relieving antics several hundreds of times over. Dr. Tyson covers a very wide range of topics ranging from the very small to the very large entities, perceptible or otherwise in the universe, the nature of the scientific method, the field of astronomy or astrophysics, the four fundamental forces, the work done by the greatest names in Physics, the components of the electromagnetic spectrum and several other wonders of the cosmos. The book is certainly not a treatise on the appetites of black holes.A couple of things I did notice about the book is that it is not organized in any very progressive fashion. It is not written as a series of chapters, each picking up on the ideas discussed in the former and building up to the concepts emerging thereupon. Neither is it a chronologically organized timeline of progressive developments in Physics that illuminates our continuous accumulation of a compendium of knowledge about the cosmos over time. It reads more like a loose collection and collation of essays that the author has penned around various concepts, all related only by their general alignment to the discussion of physical phenomena observed in the cosmos. This causes some ideas often to be repeated a few times over, not that they are insufferable or do not bear repeating but just that it gives you this feeling of deja vu with reading something you are certain you have just read not so long ago. Some of the ideas he presents, I was quite familiar with from following the StarTalk podcast or having watching Neil Tyson's videos online. Note however, that this organization of the book makes it a very good candidate for picking it up at any time and reading one random chapter anywhere to complete satisfaction.In effect, I did not learn so much more from reading the book as I would have expected but this is likely because I was already introduced to a lot of the concepts discussed through other media and through other authors as well. That said, Dr. Tyson does have a very unique approach with laying out concepts and explaining things in lay terms. That and the fact that I felt that ""a brief history of nearly everything related to the universe and astronomy"" would have been an equally fitting title for the book make it not only very personally appealing to me but also something I would recommend everyone to read at least once. Not just to gain knowledge and dispel ignorance but to gain a strong respect for the scientific method and the path laid to it by all the great names that came yet."
123,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072527-nicholas,4,"Don't be fooled by the title! If your'e really interested in cosmic catastrophes I'd highly recommend Phil Plait's Death from the Skies!: These Are the Ways the World Will End.... If you've never watched PBS's Nova or had the chance to hear Tyson speak, you don't know what you're missing. Tyson is easily this generation's Carl Sagan and is far and away the best science enthusiast and communicator out there. His interviews exude a childlike wonder and excitement with basic physical principles that can make even the most burnt-out science major rediscover why they chose to become a scientist. Evidence?http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=...Quirky, straightforward and witty, Death by Black Hole is probably the book I'd most recommend to any one of my friends who needed a basic introduction to the world of science. The book is a collection of essays written for the monthly magazine Natural History, collected and organized into several broader thematic sections and edited for continuity. Everything from the philosophy of science to the relationship between science and culture and religion is covered. If that doesn't sound appetizing or particularly fun reading, be heartened! There's plenty of science and the book is filled with essays on cosmic expansion, dark matter, the color and sound of the universe, the way it will all end, and yes, black holes too. Each chapter felt like a mini-lesson on important physical principles cast in an interesting narrative that requires no more investment of time than a few minutes here and there. You can also float around without any ill effects whatsoever. I think reading cover to cover made me realize the episodic and essay-like structure of the original pieces though, as there tends to be a lot of overlap. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though. I know my own memory is inherently faulty and rather than have to hunt backwards for a page number for some previously referenced principle or constant, Tyson neatly and quickly reminds you before moving on. Far and away the best chapters are in the first section which has a thorough discussion of what we know, how do we know it, how we perceive the universe, and the possible limits of what we can know. Philosophical topics to be sure, but presented in Tyson's witty, down-to-earth style, they're eminently accessible and entertaining as well as seriously thought-provoking. He has a great beginning discussion on how contemporary society has lost its ability to grasp (and thus interest in) current scientific findings due to the highly technical nature and specialization required to run the experiments. To restore the wonder of experimentation and discovery he then proceeds to brilliantly catalogue the various ways one could use a stick to discover amazing facts about our planet and solar system.If you've never given a popsci book a chance because they all looked either too technical or too dull, this is the place to start. You couldn't ask for a better guide to the universe than Tyson."
124,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7881163-andrew,3,"Overall, this book is good, but not great. The author gives a layman's overview of a diverse set of topics in this collection of essays. He presents them in a usually clear, occassionally humorous manner. The essays are quick reads, offering insights into astrophysics and corrections to common scientific misconceptions (e.g. that the sun rises due east and sets due west on two days a year, not everyday as some assume.) To these ends the author is largely successful.Taking a leaf out of Chapter 39 ""Hollywood Nights"", where the author waxes on his pet peeve of hollywood blunders of scientific representation, I will now criticize my own pet peeve. The author is a good writer, a witty speaker, and no doubt a good scientist. He is not a great historian though. He unfortunately totes out the continuously exaggerated ""martyr for science"" image of Galileo. While not entirely surprising, the problem is that the author seems to know the truth: that Galileo was not punished for his scientific ideas as for his manner of presentation. The author notes that Galileo was ""a pompus jerk about it"" in presenting his heliocentric findings, and that this lead to his house arrest. Despite knowing this, the author cannot follow the connection that it was Galileo's decision to be pompous that lead to his imprisonment, not his theories. As someone who appears to be punctilious in his attention to facts, it is unfortunate that the author has developed such a blind spot and that he must cite the Galileo trial as evidence of the rule that science and faith are opposed. In fact, the paucity of examples can only lead one to the logical conclusion that it is the exception to the rule.The final chapter makes clear why the author cannot make that connection: ""Let there be no doubt that as thy are currently practiced, there is no common ground between science and religion."" The author sees the two as nearly incompatible, and not so subtly reveals his belief that religion undercuts science. In this he is partially correct: misguided Christians, like evangelicals that wholeheartedly embrace intelligent design, can and are responsible for closing minds. However, it is unfair to categorize all Christians in this manner. Citing St. Thomas Aquinas in his 1879 Aeterni Patris, Pope Leo XIII noted that the teachings of the faith are God's revelation of the truth. The true faith, therefore, cannot be opposed to good science because truth is the object of both. If the faith and science seem to oppose each other, then we either misunderstand what God revealed to us in faith or we have made mistakes in our scientific research. The author is correct that are minds should not be closed to scientific inquiry due to our faith. However, he would do well to consult the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas to learn that the two are not diametrically opposed. Open minds on both sides is the beginning towards achieving that understanding."

126,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4809982-bryan-neuschwander,3,"I enjoyed the non-scientific riffs best, like the lesson “humans are emotionally fragile, perennially gullible, hopelessly ignorant masters of an insignificantly small speck in the cosmos” at the end of the third essay (47). Likewise, the last essays, dealing with science and God, tended to “induce emotional fervor” though I don’t believe “knowing the beginning bestows upon you some form of fellowship with, or perhaps governance over, all that comes later” (345). While the “universe always was” may be a “legitimate answer” or at least an alternative answer to the question of a prime mover, it doesn’t seem to be an answer provided by critical scientific inquiry, nor the discussion of the 300 or so pages leading up to the assertion. And while it’s possible to present the interface of science and religious belief as “holy war,” we should at least recognize that the purported “warfare” for science was often championed by folks of profound religious beliefs. Of course, belief, “scientific” or otherwise, doesn’t make a person right. Reality determines that. Which must be discovered—by people—presumably on both sides of the God equation. Might it be that the current “hostage negotiation” model of the interface of science and religion needs revision in light of the complexity of human motivations? Might the “irreconcilable approaches to knowing” (347) presented by faith and science be more complementary than previously thought?Tyson’s pragmatism has a certain appeal, “I simply go with what works” (352). However, it may simply be not that simple. It seems to me that Tyson is right to dismiss the “God of the gaps” approach that simply invokes God for every unknown, but that still leaves unresolved the question of God, which is question of reality, not mere personal belief or scientific conviction. If God exists, it might be reasonable to believe his existence with tools other than science—it seems the tools of science that purportedly give evidence “to the fact that we occupy not a well-mannered clockwork universe, but a destructive, violent, and hostile zoo” are simply not the right tools for falling in love with the zookeeper, so to speak (358). At any rate, neither zookeeper nor clockmaker seem appropriate metaphors for the occasion.The idea that “science is a philosophy of discovery” is beautiful. May it be so. But it may not be that “intelligent design is a philosophy of ignorance” (361). If intelligent design amounts to throwing up our hands when something is too complicated to figure out and assigning it arbitrarily to the action of a higher power, then Tyson is right to dismiss it. However, if like forensic investigators we examine the alibi of quantum fluctuation and the “seething foam of tangled space-time,” we might reasonably doubt this Milky Way to have been an accident (46). Have a nice day."

Ever sharp, humorous, but always at the leading edge and quick to assess, apply, and expound on the latest scientific theory, deGrasse Tyson caused a bit of a firestorm back in 2006 when he had Pluto reclassified in the Hayden Planetarium’s planetary walkway and maps as a “dwarf planet”; a decision that was later backed by the members of the International Astronomical Union in light of findings and discoveries made of objects orbiting the Sun far beyond Pluto’s range and within the beginnings of the Oort Cloud.Death By Black Hole is a lively and wonderfully blended tapestry of a number of columns written by deGrasse Tyson for the Museum’s 
Natural History
 magazine that have been slightly updated and with minor revisions woven together to present a highly readable, insightful and enjoyable book. Not only does the author manage to clearly and concisely explain many of the phenomena in the universe, he also manages to draw in the history of how these phenomena were discovered over the years. Perhaps more than any other writings in popular science I’ve come across, de Grasse Tyson manages to really illustrate and explain what it would truly be like to be completely consumed, even down to the atomic level, by a black hole. Never one to shy away from standing soundly on the ground of verified and observable scientific fact and reasoning, deGrasse Tyson does not mince words when it comes to stating on where, rather why public schools in the United States should not discuss or teach “Intelligent Design”, and where scientists, even himself, have been incorrect fall short in fully understanding and applying scientific theory. One of my favorite sections of this book deals with deGrasse Tyson’s own catalog of egregious astronomical and scientific errors in major Hollywood pictures, ranging from the obvious, Walt Disney’s 1979 release “The Black Hole”, to the more popular and iconic; James Cameron’s Academy Award winning drama “Titanic”. For those curious on the nature and current scientific thinking on the make-up of our universe, any reader would be hard pressed to find a more accessible and entertaining book on the subject."

129,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3198996-eric-bingham,3,"I just finished this book and I'm really having trouble deciding what to rate it. If I had it to do over, I would still read the book (it was very interesting,) but I would skip the last section. I came into this book with a strong background in science, but almost no background in the field of astrophysics. I felt like some of the book was very ""user friendly"" while other parts were difficult for me to follow. I definitely learned a lot about the universe. I also learned a lot about Neil deGrasse Tyson (the author.) He kept some parts of the book light and funny by inserting his personality into the book, but at times his personality came of as being quite smug, and it was a little abrasive. He definitely has a very high opinion of himself. Having said that, I was all set to give this book a 4 star rating, but the last 60 pages of his book were mostly just random unconnected ranting about all types of things. It was like he thought, ""OK, I'm done with my book, now what soapbox items can I throw in at the very end?"" His last section was especially abrasive as he asserts his certainty that God does not exist. After implying that scientists who include religion in their books are doing so to try to make more money, he himself spends the final section of his book, (which was great up to this point) ranting about religion. He goes off about how ignorant people are who believe in intelligent design, and the way he defines intelligent design does make it sound like an ignorant idea. He poses intelligent design as an idea that is strictly contrary to science by saying, ""I don't want students who could make the next major breakthrough in renewable energy sources or space travel to have been taught that anything they don't understand, and that nobody yet understands, is divinely constructed, and therefor beyond their intellectual capacity."" My views on intelligent creation hold no such ideology. I just happen to believe that God is, among other things, a scientist. Why wouldn't he then use science and physical laws to create all things, and why wouldn't he want us to learn as much as we can about those laws? Which brings me back to where I started. This is a great book, but I would recommend just stopping one section short of the end."
130,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4675628-priscilla,5,"Most of this book was too basic for me, information-wise. But it was such a pleasant, fun read - high-quality writing, good information, good stories, and an easy read (I don't think anyone, however unfamiliar with the subject, would have trouble getting through this book). My only complaint was that the chapters in which deGrasse Tyson allows himself to rant a little bit can be slightly annoying. I'm certainly on the side of intellectual snobbery, generally, and look at things like sloppy research, bad or nonexistent fact use, intelligent design (doesn't merit capital letters as it's supposed to have), and other such targets with disdain, but I still felt like deGrasse Tyson's railing against things like a mathematically unsupportable, piss-poor restating of the Drake equation (in ""Contact"") was just silly. What else could he possibly expect? There's a whole different bar for simplifying (dumbing down) for popular culture (for the average consumer) than there is for making science accessible. It's true that the necessity of making oneself stupider in order to speak to the vast majority of people may be more of a cause than a symptom, and so is unsupportable behavior, but it's also simply the way things are. I (and I'd say deGrasse Tyson is in this camp, too), personally, am not willing to be inaccurate and ignorant for the sake of being readable/accessible, but I recognize (with rolling eyebrows) the consequences of that refusal and the necessity of such poor, anti-intellectual practices when producing something for a broad audience. (One of which, of course, is that probably all of twelve people will ever read me.)(I don't like it - I think it's pathetic, frankly, that things work that way - but I get why it happens.) So I agree with Tyson's rants, but without some kind of self-conscious awareness (in the text - he likely has that awareness but doesn't express it in this book)(I've seen him speak - he's certainly not an ""in the box""/clueless high-science kind of person) of WHY that sort of thing happens, his ranting makes him come off as someone who's too far into his own subject, who's ""too smart"" to have a realistic idea of how things actually work out there in the ""real"" world.I definitely want to read more of deGrasse Tyson's books."
131,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5241251-andrew,5,"I firmly believe that the various scientific disciplines need to find spokespersons that are able to describe the findings of science and the work of scientists to the general public in ways that are both accessible and entertaining. Science has produced very few of these in modern times. Carl Sagan was good at this, and the scientific community looked down on him for it. Hopefully, they won’t treat Neil DeGrasse Tyson the same way, because he is a terrific spokesman for the interests of science.This book is a collection of essays about science (largely focusing on astronomy and astrophysics, which are the areas of Tyson’s expertise), previously published, but collected here into a single volume. Because these essays were originally published separately, there is a little repetition in the content (especially in his descriptions of how the heavier elements were formed), but this might not be quite as jarring if the reader only reads a few essays at a time or skips around, rather than reading the book straight through, as I did.Tyson does a terrific job of explaining how science works to describe the universe, and how our understanding has improved incrementally through the centuries. He also is really good at explaining our current understanding of the universe and how it came to be as it is. His description of the formation of matter and the evolution of stars are highly accessible, explaining the complex realities of modern physics in terms that should be readily understood by anyone who is truly interested. In addition, Tyson’s clearly has a sense of humor, as evidenced by the jokes (some better than others) scattered throughout these essays.This book is an excellent introduction for anyone that wants to get a better understanding about what science currently has to say about how the universe was formed, and what science predicts about its future. As such, it can only help people better understand news articles about future breakthroughs in these areas. If only other scientific disciplines could find equally articulate experts to describe their work. "
132,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4671166-matthew-peck,3,"3 1/2 stars. I was a tad disappointed to find out that 'Death By Black Hole' was a compilation of monthly magazine columns, rather than a book focusing primarily on black holes. But this book serves as a splendid primer on the current understanding of astrophysics (as of 2007), written in the extremely likeable tones of America's most popular scientist. Tyson's essays are grouped into sections, starting off with a brief history of humanity's astronomical knowledge from Copernicus onward, and ending with a powerful, razor-sharp piece about science and religion (the final paragraph is chilling). There are also some hilarious rants about egregious science-blunders in a range of Hollywood films - a cocktail party chat between NDT and James Cameron resulted in an accurate night sky being digitally inserted into TITANIC's remastered DVD release - and a couple of chapters about the frustrations of the complexity of research vs. media coverage & public perception, chapters which should be required reading for those people that think that our predominant theories are just dreamed up on a whim, instead of being backed by centuries of hard-won knowledge and tedious data-gathering and -testing.The biggest and most cohesive chunk of the book is dedicated to Tyson's explanation of star life cycles and galactic origins. This, of course, includes the beautifully named essay of the title, which introduces the term 'spaghettification' into the physics lexicon. Its compilation format means that there's some inevitable repetition, and some subjects that are explained too hurriedly: the prizewinning piece 'In The Beginning', for example, though describing the particle physics of the Big Bang across three pages is pretty admirable. I'd still recommend Brian Greene's 'The Fabric Of The Cosmos' as the best in-depth popular explanation of everything cosmological, but 'Death By Black Hole' has more than enough enthusiasm, clarity, and mind-expanding factoids if you're looking for a more compact read. And Neil deGrasse Tyson is pretty much a national treasure, lame scientist-puns and all."
133,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1029949-jesi,5,"The beginning of the book starts with a very thought-provoking Prologue with the purpose of making you rethink everything you've thought about science and what the human race knows about it. As someone who loves science and researches it as a hobby, I already knew the things he said, but I loved the way he said it. I wasn't bored at reading something I knew about, because I could tell already that he'd have interesting things to say whether or not I already knew them. I'd learn something for sure.He makes sciences fun, understandable and relate-able to everyday life. I was very excited that he was able to do this without dumbing it down. He made references to brilliant physicists, astronomers, revolutionaries... and talked a bit about Quantum Physics and string theory all in the prologue!Ch. 1 was entertaining for me, because it shot down humans' ego in stating that we are not an intelligent species, or if we are, it's due to our ability to connect ideas and most importantly, see things beyond our 5 given senses. THAT'S what makes us smart. Like our ability to know that the tree was falling in the forest even though nobody was around to hear it (which he cleverly retaliates). Another point that I had known was a question that dumbfounds many, for some reason, when it shouldn't. What he DID say that struck me was that we as a human race just may never know the meaning of the universe. I have to believe that we can, but he says that we may know it more than monkeys would, but an even more intelligent species out in the universe would think of US as the simple-minded monkeys, and they know the answers to all our questions (and have their own that we couldn't even fathom to think of).I am already captivated by the book! It's an easy/interesting read that makes me feel great to read it! And I hate reading... lol. I am currently reading the book however, so I can't say more, but I can say I feel more hyped about reading this than ever, and I don't think it'll be a disappointment at all!"
134,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2515864-amanda,2,"Was going through some old high school papers and found a review for this book written on the back. Funny thing it was written on the back of some catcher in the rye papers. Here's the review anyways, since I'm throwing it out.'Right now at this moment, I've read 30-40 pages fo Death by Black Hole and I'm completely taking it out of the boundaries of astrophysicists. I have never been indulged in physics or most sciences, but I'm connecting this and that together to make up my mind. if eel like this book is like a manuel, believe this or believe that. Believe that we were evolutionized or that something created us. All of this, everything we know from this day on is ideas. We do not know what happened before the Big Bang and we may know what created it. How does he know where the universe was created or how? People can say that Einstein was a genous, or that Stephen Hawings knows all about these ideas. These interlcks of science may be some peoples lives and could be what someone loves to study, but the other half of the world, beyond the mathematics, the discoveries, experiments, we will never stop learning...(took some monlogue out)...Someone can invest their life on theorem after theorem, but sometimes that doesn't constitute to living. (Some theory I had that investing is pointless. Feels like sometimes we waste our 'life' worrying too much. Kinda hate that I thought this but kinda wondering what's the point at all..) Yes, science will make us live longer, and it will further explain our existence. But the entire world will not always care about this, sometimes what matter is what we do with the other half of our lives..."" Then I kinda trailed off to all this jibber-jabber. Thing is I never really constituted to the idea of a black hole. I was only focused on what the hell I thought mattered. I may try to read more science-type books in the future, even try to rent this out and finish the whole thing. Scariest thing, a black hole. It's utter blackness, things go in and nothing comes out. Scary to even think, where we will be in the next few years. "
135,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18634880-nick,3,"Hoo boy. NDT is considered irreproachable in certain corners of the internet, and there are certainly worse people to deify, but...he's kind of not an excellent writer?All right, so Death by Black Hole, rather than being one unified work like I expected, is actually an anthology of essays Tyson wrote for magazines or whatever. That isn't a problem per se; some of the books I've enjoyed the most have been collections like this. It becomes a problem when Tyson tries to make it seem like a unified whole by editing in an ""as discussed earlier"" here or an ""as we will see"" there. Since there's a lot of overlap between the essays, it gets jarring after a while. The book would have been much better served by minimizing this overlap or just leaving the essays as they were.That said, the man's fame is well-deserved, since he does a great job of making abstract concepts accessible. I think that as a physics major I'm somewhat more familiar with the material than the target audience, which might be why I found Tyson condescending at times, or even thought about stylistic problems in the first place. For example, Death by Black Hole has a throughline of scientific persecution, which I think is common to Tyson's works. It rears its head throughout (in the titular chapter, he mentions for some reason that Inquisition torturers would have loved using a black hole) and is even the subject of the last few chapters. He is a scientist in the United States, and kind of the public face of science therein, so this is mostly understandable; but he comes off (in my opinion) as being defensive or accusatory more than correcting misconceptions."
136,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6857911-ryan,4,"While no one can replace Carl Sagan, Tyson might be the nearest thing the 2010s have to him, a friendly advocate of the sciences who knows how to explain abstract topics in everyday language without dumbing them down or dissipating their inherent wonder. I enjoyed his series on NOVA, so I decided to pick up this book after I noticed it on sale at audible.No regrets. If you want an introduction or a refresher course on the basics of astronomy and astrophysics, this series of essays on various topics should fill in the gaps nicely. Tyson covers topics such as the mechanics of the solar system, the formation of the Earth and planets, the Big Bang and the origins of the universe, and the essential concepts of 20th century physics (quantum theory, relativity, subatomic particles, forces, string theory). Much of the ground Tyson treads will be familiar to those who watched Dr. Sagan's classic Cosmos series in the early 1980s, but a lot of discoveries have been made since then, so the update is worthwhile. Like Sagan, Tyson makes no bones about the fact that he sees science, not religion/superstition/mysticism, as the only reliable tool for understanding how the universe actually works. As he points out, no religious text has yet proved useful for predicting physical phenomena -- in fact, The Bible significantly misstates the value of Pi. (However, he's much less obnoxious about it than Dawkins.)Tyson also spends some time nitpicking on the scientific errors in several Hollywood blockbusters. Yes, he's that guy -- the one that you stopped inviting to Doctor Who night.If I have a complaint about this book, it's that its provenance as a collection of articles is pretty obvious. Things that were stated as assumptions or background information in one chapter will be repeated again a few chapters later. The editor could have done a better job integrating everything. And it's probably not a book I'd recommend to more knowledgeable readers; most of the information here, though presented in an appealing, accessible way, is basic."
137,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19578583-chip-hunter,4,"Fun and witty, but often quite cynical, Neil DeGrasse Tyson takes the reader through the history, to the present, and into the future of the field of astrophysics. His ability to simplify complicated concepts for the average reader makes this book ideal for those (like me) with lots of curiosity, but limited backgrounds in physics and mathematics. Tyson makes the Universe out to be a thrilling and dynamic place, full of mystery, but also predictable and understandable. His portrayal of the remaining gaps in our knowledge about how the Universe works, how it began, and how it will end, may inspire future scientists. His belief in the power of science is unmatched, and his disdain for the ignorant is immense.This book is about a lot more than just black holes, although those enigmatic structures obviously interest him greatly, and are discussed at length in various parts of this book. Much of DEATH BY BLACK HOLE details the development of the scientific method, physics, and astronomy, providing a strong foundation for understanding and appreciation of the history of science in general and astrophysics in particular. Another significant chunk of the book deals with the lack of scientific literacy and bad-science myths that our culture nurtures. Tyson enjoys poking fun at misconceptions, mistakes, and willing ignorance, and does so in a cynical and biting way. He shows no mercy for catholic priests or film directors. While much of this is funny and enjoyable, there are times that Tyson gets a bit overly-cynical and negative about American culture as well as other scientific fields. His view that astrophysics represents the supreme science is obvious and extremely arrogant, as many of his jests come off as variations of ""I'm so smart, you're so dumb.""As far as being educational though, this book should please any non-astrophysicist reader. Full of well-described detail bringing our Universe into sharp focus, while highlighting the great Unknowns, this book succeeds brilliantly in its goals. Highly recommended for all!"
138,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/835023-vincent-wood,4,"It is no secret that I am a fan of astronomy. In college, I needed to take a science elective and knew I would be bored in a freshman level astronomy class so I ended up taking a junior level astrophysics class instead. So naturally I would be attracted to a book like this.The author has done what other authors in his field or in similar fields have done in the past such as Carl Sagan with Cosmos or Stephen Hawking with A Brief History of Time and put what is known in current physics, astrophysics and other sciences into terms that the average person could understand and appreciate.Much of what the author stated I have heard before from other sources and much of the information was completely new to me or went into more depth. He also confirmed a fear of mine that someday some marketer may succeed in using the Moon as an advertising billboard. It will not happen in my lifetime, or at least I pray it does not happen in my lifetime. But I do wonder how many lifetimes from mine it will happen in. I am sure someday, some genius with enough money will succeed in doing so and it will be a sad when when it happens.The author also seems to love to use the word ""Indeed"". It is almost as if he says it billions and billions of times.I did find his essay regarding his difficulty in suspending disbelief during certain movies that have some aspect pertaining to his expertise difficult amusing. Just like I am sure many police officers have difficulty suspending disbelief during a cop movie or software developers find difficulty suspending disbelief when computers are involved. I do admit it is something I often find difficulty doing as well and often judge a movie on how well it succeeded in keeping me entertained rather than obsessing over the minor, insignificant details of the plot.All in all, I did enjoy this book and recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning more about the universe we have unwittingly found ourselves inhabiting."
139,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50613658-cristofer,4,"Death by Blackhole, written by Neil deGrasse Tyson, is not just any book. This book contains a great group of subjects, which is very interesting; now keep in mind that the title of this book is not related to the primary subject of this work, which, by itself, and as stated in the book's description—and in the first pages, is just a collection of previously published articles made to fit into a book. The book has a variety of historical and scientific data, as well as the occasional joke that reminds us of the unique style Neil deGrasse Tyson has—yes, if you've seen him talking on one of his many speeches, you'll see a huge similarity in the way he writes, you'll also find several of his very interesting ""oh, and by the way."" It serves as a good reminders that we are not just reading that tedious book, but a very interesting one, written by someone who, in my humble opinion, does know how to approach the reader. I have only two complains about this book—which in now way diminish its educational or recreational value: the name of the title, as I stated above, can be very misleading; it may make you think that the book is only related to one subject, but it is clearly not, and what you may think to be the main subject is only on of the few last to be discussed. The second one may be the very same complain that many people have, and it is that the book is a collection of articles made to fit into a book. However, this is not altogether bad, in fact, it may help the reader by reminding him about a previously stated fact about history or science itself. This comes to be very handy, and this, as far as I am concerned, is also a good thing. With all honesty—and I am not implying that I've not been honest so far, this is a book that is very worth reading. If you're the kind of person who likes to several things about the cosmos, about history of science, and natural curiosities, this may be a good book for you."
140,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21158516-ron-joniak,4,"This was a pretty damn good book. When I started to read this book I had the expectation that it would be your basic 'popular' science non-fiction book that would be very easy to read and spread some cool facts, but overall be way under the level of scientific reading that I am on. However, Tyson talks about a wide range of physics here while not going over the top into string theory or quantum gravity. His essays were spectacular to read as they were quite fun and proved to be addictive for me. Overall, this is a great read if you want to read at a level that is above completely general but not technical. Highly enjoyable."
141,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7206839-jenny,3,"I enjoyed this collection of essays by Tyson. They're all brief yet informative and entertaining. Some of the topics are a little less interesting than others, and if you've read other popular books on astrophysics, the information is nothing new, but Tyson's humor and readable prose are refreshing. My only problem with the book is Tyson's ""them"" and ""us"" attitude regarding his chosen career path. We all know he's an astrophysicist, but he presents his ideas to ""us"" as if he's the smartest person in the room, no second guessing necessary. I found it insulting at times, especially when reading the last section, ""Science and God: When Ways of Knowing Collide."" I knew from the beginning (pun intended) that Tyson wasn't a Christian, and I read the book anyway. I don't need him to believe the way that I do in order to learn from him. But respect would be nice. It bothered me that he presented all Christians as ignorant believers in a ""god of the gaps"" and in ""intelligent design"" without considering the possibility that not all Christians believe in God just to explain the unexplainable. He excludes the possibility of true faith, not based in lack of knowledge or wisdom or intelligence but based in the genuine experience of Someone greater than oneself. For a scientist to focus on one way of believing and critique it as the only way seems pretty incongruous to me. Aside from all of that, the book is fun and enlightening. I recommend it to people that love science and are looking for an accessible book on astrophysics to increase their knowledge."
142,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9166177-siim,5,"After hurriedly going through his other book (you know which one) this was a pleasing extension. (It's 4x as long.) It is a collection of his essays/articles on astrophysics and why you should be interested in it. But it reads quite like a complete work on the matter, from the Big Bang to the ultimate asteroid collision or other Earth-shattering event that's bound to happen at some point (in the span of some millions of years).Recommended when you like Astrophysics for People in a Hurry."
143,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63549034-ryan-dash,3,"Many of the articles here suffer from having an uninteresting topic or having a good point that is followed by avalanches of boring details. Others were good, telling the history behind scientific discoveries and explaining them in a lucid and occasionally humorous way. Overall, it was about half good and half less good."
144,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3625579-craig-a-k-a-meatstack,3,"As a collection of essays, based off of a column Neil deGrasse Tyson wrote for a magazine, this book been subject to some excellent editing, And it's interesting to be able to identify that.In the past couple months I've read several of these type books - where an author or publisher puts their columns for a magazine to ""double duty"" and publish it as a book form. This has been the best done thusfar, manipulating the content to reference back and forth to other sections. It's not perfect, however.As an example, you learn what the event horizon of a black hole is no less than 3 times. The first minutes of the universe are explained at least twice, and although this is helpful if you are reading the book in sections, over a long period of time, it's tedious if you are reading this cover-to-cover.Additionally, Dr. Tyson suffers some of the same problems as his peers. On one hand he admits that science does not know everything, and that anything may change at a moment, then - and in the same article - explains that the speed of light is set in stone, and cannot be altered. Those faults aside, this book as renewed my childhood interest in the cosmos, and find myself researching planetariums so I can introduce my son to the same wonders and awe that this strange universe provides to us. I hope this book would do the same for you."

I figured it is about time I write a review for it, yet I find myself struggling to come up with the right words to describe how I feel.First I should mention that I love space. Despite this and the fact that I am actually a fairly intelligent human being, I have found that most books written about space, and physic in general, are written at such a high reading proficiency and are jargon heavy to the point that it is more chore to read than anything.Neil DeGrasse Tyson brings his trademark humor to this novel as well as making it genuinely enjoyable to read. For being a non-fiction book, it certainly did not read like one. Regardless of whether you are a newbie when it comes to space or a seasoned fan, Death by Black Hole is consciously written with an easy almost conservational style that draws the reader in. I personally feel that it opens a lot of doors to those who want to learn but may have difficulty with the language.I recommend Death by Black Hole to everyone. Literally everyone."
147,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31454169-cody,5,"I love Neil deGrasse Tyson, and the only thing I love more than a book he wrote, is an audiobook he narrates! I enjoyed the tour of science Tyson brings the reader through and through; there are so many things I never understood or thought about before my reading of this book. Of course, there is the quandary of death by black hole, but there is also so much more. I feel a different sense of unity for the electromagnetic spectrum, and the relation of science to my life in general. One can glean an assortment of entertaining facts from the author (all of which are provided in his witty, realistic yet hyperbolic sense of humor) which I imagine would go over well at a cocktail party. This was my first read from Neil deGrasse Tyson, and if you asked 'would you read more of his books?' I would say yes. It's a great read from a wonderful popular science writer, who also has the entertainment factor to boot."
148,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59332841-scott-millsap,4,"I really enjoyed this book and I think Tyson has a true natural talent for communicating the completities of advanced science to the masses. This should be required reading for all advanced science classes.The book has many great quotes, but one that hit hard with me was regarding how the USA has been for years neglecting our investments in advanced scientific research. We forget that the engine of the economy is innovation and only by staying on the cutting edge of scientific research can our economy benefit. When we concede the scientific frontier to others, we also concede the turbo of economic growth.Consider that in the 1990's, the USA was slated to build the worlds largest particle excellerator in Texas, but Congress pulled the $11 Billion funding, instead conceeding the project to the EU and giving up our opportunity to build that knowledge and feel the ripple effects in the economy."
149,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59569326-zoe-b,0,"The amazing astrophysicist and author, Neil Degrasse Tyson, wrote this book to explain many of the questions one may have about the vast amount of space that surrounds us. Whether he is talking about possibilities of extraterrestrial life, statistics on finding a planet that could support life, black holes, or anything that does with the area all around us, he does it in such a way that I think anyone could at least somewhat understand. While he explains it, he adds comparisons to different scientific movies/novels. For example, he used the robot, V'ger (which ended up just being Voyager 6) from the franchise Star Trek to make an entire chapter about what's unreasonable about what the robots on shows and books like that. This book can make you feel pretty stupid if you do not know what is being talked about. You may like this book if you like books like 2001: A Space Odyssey."
150,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54239396-nate-even,3,"First 2/3 of the book tended to be a little over my head (having no real background in science), Last 1/3 of the book I really liked."
151,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13476472-jared-bird,3,"This is my second book of this type that I've read from Tyson, and I should have expected that it would be consistent with the other. While enjoy Tyson's insight and humor, his knowledge sometimes seems too vast for me to follow and understand at times- that's no fault of his and more due to my lack of understanding of astrophysics. He does a good job of explaining certain principles of astrophysics as simply as he can, but as soon as we get beyond your typical backyard science, I started to lose it. Not to mention, given that this book is a collection of articles, I couldn't help but notice how many times the same information is repeated (e.g. Earths water coming from comets, the likelihood of life on Jupiter's moons, the process of the Sun going supernova, etc.) So overall the book is good, but you have to be even more into science than me to endure it all. "
152,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15918824-nicholas-lefevre,3,"My principal complaints about this book are a bit unfair. First, it is a hodgepodge not leading the reader through increasing levels of understanding. I should have expected that because it is a collection of essays he wrote over time. Still, Tyson could have done a better job of organizing the material and writing supplemental material to the the pieces together.My second problem was that it is below my level. Each chapter begins from scratch and doesn't go far beyond scratching the surface. It's effectively a primer on the history of astrophysics combined with Tyson's opinions, mostly more societal than scientific.In the positive side, the book is easy to understand and covers a wide swath. This would be decent start for someone wanting an introduction to the history of astrophysics."
153,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75618360-tien-manh,4,"Whirlwind tour through matter, energy, space and time. The author describes our universe from its conception (Big Bang), to its death (Cold Death), and everything in between: subatomic particles, anti-matter annihilating matter, tidal forces, spectra of light, life in the universe, black holes gobbling up stars, colliding galaxies, and even God.I liked how the author frames physics discoveries in a historical frame when possible. He also doesn't hesitate to include his own ""beefs"" against non-science, religion and...movies inaccurately portraying astrophysics, making for the occasional comical read. The book was clearly written for non-physicists, although I am probably too stupid and find myself not understanding a lot of concepts even in this dumbed down text. Doesn't stop it from being great though."
154,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7780386-adam-hegg,4,"Like watching a foreign film with subtitles and convincing myself I can now speak French because I forget that I am reading the film, this book makes me feel like I understand astrophysics. In actually I understand astrophysics as well as most houseplants but, man, did I love reading Dr. Tyson's explanations of how the universe works. I spent most of my time reading this book and his matter-of-fact detailing of why things are and thinking ""how can this possibly be"". I love this feeling because it truly sets my ego on its butt and reminds me that I do not in fact know everything (I tend to read self-congratulatory books that either affirm what I already think or are very familiar). I truly loved this book and will read more if I can find more."
155,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5743825-hazem-jokhadar,5,"A must read for all those astro-fan-boys. I can't describe in words how much I loved being put in a total state of awe, almost every time I turned the page to be faced with a new fascinating realization about the world we live in. I learned a lot from this book. Over all, the topics are tackled from every possible aspect to deliver one huge meaningful concept, that most of the time, leaves you exercising falling more and more in love with this book. What I also like about the book, that it gathers other known, written work of great minds in the field of physics between its covers. Few of the topics I didn't enjoy was possibly due to my lack of fully grasp what the writer has to say, or simply I couldn't quite agree with his opinion.About last chapter, it's complicated."
156,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59212545-eesha,4,"I chose to read this book because I'm interested in astronomy, and I loved it. I especially liked how the author used humor to draw readers in and simplify topics that might be complicated so the average person could understand them. Some of the concepts were a little confusing and his detailed descriptions and analogies really helped to break them down. His enthusiasm for astronomy also shows, and it could easily lead readers who aren't normally passionate about astronomy to get interested in it. Some parts at the start of the book seemed a little slow though, just because I wanted to learn more about the actual astronomy of it and he was describing a lot of background information. Overall, I think he did a fantastic job compiling an informative novel with a fun, casual writing style. "
157,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24882380-brandon,5,"A very interesting entry into astrophysics and the galaxy by one of sciences most passionate individuals. Had this of been written like a text book I do not think that I would have been interested in what Niel deGrasse Tyson had to say in his writings nor do I think that I would have been able to so easily understand many of the concepts and theories that he lays out in this book. If you would like to get a better understanding of the world, the planets, the stars, the universe, and the galaxy this is a great book to begin with! It answered many questions that I had about the universe while at the same time opening up many more questions that I look forward to reading about in other books. "
158,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6251716-space,2,"Boy, that Neil deGrasse Tyson is one arrogant dude, is he not? I listened to this audiobook, narrated by Dion Graham, and it just rang through so strong. In some parts, it's all I could think about. The science seems sound, but he acts like he's part of something a little bigger than he really is.I learned a lot from this, as I enjoy a good trip into the sciences. Much as I'm able to understand them I do enjoy reading a lot about the cosmos. I wouldn't say I heard anything revolutionary in here, and he seemed to repeat himself a lot, but it was okay. He reuses the same joke a few times, too. Sigh.Anyway, it wasn't bad for a boring drive, but I wouldn't recommend it. There are far better science books out there by scientists not so intent to toot their own horns."
159,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,5,"As usual, i always enjoy the mind opening style from Tyson. I took time to read this book in a digesting way, drinking a good cup of red wine. Totally worth it!i have watched numerous lectures, discussions, science debates of Tyson on youtube. He is one of the great scientists who shaped my mind. Reading his books made me feel like i am heading toward the right direction. Thanks to my previous training from his videos, this book turned out to be much much easier for me to read. Since it's popular science, he used very understandable language to guide readers to the world of wonder, astrophysics.If you have been his fan, surely this won't be unfamiliar style for you, if not yet, this book could absolutely open your mind. "
160,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34019657-jorge,3,"Couple of problems with the book: although Tyson is an awesome sci-commer, the fact that this is a collection of essays can be well perceived as some stories/jokes/details are a bit repeated in more than one article. Besides, the range of difficulties that the articles comprise is kind of wide, something that might be a bit confusing for the public. Aside from that, he demonstrates once again that he is a really competent, clever and funny communicator of science, making the awe feeling about it more than contagious.Still, he losses one further star due to being ocassionally chauvinistic (the Cold War is over, really) and usually a bit obnoxious. And because nobody fuckin' dares to mess with ""Contact"" if I'm here. Not even you, NdGT."
161,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12528557-adam,3,"While I generally love NDT's science writing style and his soothing narrator voice on Cosmos, this book was a little disappointing in that the vast majority of the content was aimed at the general public (i.e. about a sixth - ninth grade science level). What he does talk about and explain, he does well. But I felt ready for him to move on to more interesting advanced concepts and he never did. Well-written though, for sure.Also I pretty much just skimmed the last two essays as I am sick to death of the Science VS Religion debate. I live in Arkansas and hear it enough as it is; don't need to read about it too."
162,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15028756-wes,4,"I am a huge fan of NdeGT, astrophysics, and science writing in general. Beyond that, I personally feel that humanity is blessed to have such a gifted science communicator and am happy to check out anything he is a part of.In general, I would say that I didn't gather anything new from the book per se. I feel as though much of the material is covered in the Cosmos mini series, as well as many, many, other science books and televisions programs. That being said, I still enjoyed the book, and I still enjoyed ingesting the information again. Great for science newbies, science fans, deGrasse Tyson fans, and the intellectually curious."
163,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6974552-kent,4,"This is a really nice collection of Neil's essays on cosmology that range from the universe's beginnings, possible endings, intelligent designs, and history of discoveries. They are easy to grasp concepts, but they can help open your mind to so many new things. So much can and does come from physics and the study of the universe and I feel that most people don't really appreciate it enough. In our current age of ""alternate facts"" and narrow-minded views, I think it is so important that scientists like Tyson speak and share their knowledge with the world in hopes that others will take heed and do the same. "
164,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7366849-jennifer-brown,5,"This book was an absolute delight to read; challenging, engrossing, and incredibly eye-opening. Neil really does merge the scientific with the poetic -- this doesn't happen in *every* essay, but more often than not he pairs these cosmic quandaries with elements that mirror our own thirst for knowledge within other disciplines. I'm not a science-y person, and I'd say this book definitely features a fair amount of jargon, BUUUT that's the NICE part about it; he explains everything thoroughly, and I feel like I now understand both the concepts I'd forgotten from elementary science classes and things I never learned. "
165,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82800217-josh-houlding,4,"I found out about this book after reading Mr. Tyson's more recent release, Astrophysics for People in a Hurry, and decided to check it out. I was thoroughly interested and engaged most of the time, although it did occasionally get bogged down in unnecessary detail. Fortunately this didn't happen too often and I was able to fully absorb the content. This book's complexity of writing is one of its greatest strengths, it is insightful and intellectually stimulating without going too far over your head, which I really appreciate. If you enjoy books relating to space, Astrophysics or just science in general, this should definitely be on your reading list!"
166,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126973-meghan,4,"A very interesting and in-depth read. It is a group of essays that were turned into a book. This means that there is a bit of repetition but, since the topics are complex, the repetition is sometimes useful. I wanted to absorb and fully understand all of the information so this took quite a while to read. It was not a book to pick up for some light pre-bedtime reading. But, deGrasse Tyson has a very engaging writing style and he knows that his audience is not made up of his peers (others with advance degrees in astrophysics) but us ""common folk"" who want to know more about the universe we live in. "
167,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54243570-andrew-deem,4,"Very interesting read, with lots of good information about the universe. Tyson has some good points to make that often come with very effective passive-aggressive humor that pokes and jabs at the uneducated in various ways. My biggest complaint is that I was craving a good summation or conclusion of this work at the end. Instead, he finishes the book with a rant about creationists which is a valid rant but makes one wonder if that was the takeaway from his book. Sagan ended Cosmos in such an elegant way that I suppose it is selfish to ask the same of Tyson. Regardless, still a good read."
168,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30944287-jamaal-forbador,4,"This book is certainly an interesting one. It is jam-packed with all different kinds of facts and cool observations. Everyone knows Tyson is great at communicating ideas, but he definitely blew it out of the water with this one. Everything from the movement of planetary objects to antimatter he kept me thoroughly intrigued throughout the whole thing, and this is definitely one of my top books. I would highly recommend if anyone is interested in space that they read this book, as they would love it."
169,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42669310-jonathan-gnagy,4,"An interesting book, for sure. Being a collection of essays, there was a fair amount of repetition, but in classic Neil deGrasse Tyson style, difficult concepts were made accessible through fun and interesting analogies and explanations. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in space and astrophysics that hasn't done a lot of reading on the topic yet. For those that have read similar books, much of the content has been covered in much more depth other places (though usually in less clear terms). This book is a great way to spark more interest in science and physics."
170,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65651320-ecdybeck,4,"Niel Degrasse Tyson stakes his claim among the great science communicators of our time.Some specific ideas that captured my fascination include that photons take eight minutes to get from the surface of the sun to the earth but take 10 million years to diffuse through the Sun.Also, the idea of LaGrange points, nemesis earth, and the Trojan asteroids behind Jupiter are fascinsting.Finally, he presents the interesting trivia that clocks move clockwise because that's how shadows move around a sundial in the northern hemisphere."

Wouldn't really recommend it to anyone without technical education or even at least some interest in astrophysics. Don't get me wrong - it's not deeply scientific - in case you are actual *astrophysicist* there won't be much you would learn from this book. But hey, it's a popular science, right? Good narration, couple of anecdotes and punchy attitude. What's not to like?The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it might be to nerdy for some folks. As for me, I enjoyed it immensely. "
173,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20007668-isha,5,I can not express how much I loved this book! Neil deGrasse Tyson is no doubt exceptional at communicating science to non-scientiests and this book is a great example of that. I already knew a lot of what was in the book and also a few things obviously have been updated (we found water in mars!) but overall because of his humorous informative style I learned a lot and kept entertained! Highly recommend this book to science and space geeks! Sidenote: if Neil deGrasse Tyson was my highschool science teacher (or someone like him) maybe my path would be been in science haha

It's full with so much of the amazing facts of reality. It's a book I would read again. You could say my introduction to science was with Neil Tyson's ""Astrophysics for people in a hurry"" which increased my appetite for wonder. ""Death by a Black Hole"" was the perfect thing to deepen my knowledge of science. It is full with incredible facts and history of the science discoveries, the endeavours people have gone through to better understand the world we live in."

As with any collection, quality varies, but I definitely learned a bit. The essays are loosely grouped by broad topic in a logical way, but it's not the same as reading a regular nonfiction book. I recommend reading them only a few at a time and spreading out the experience."
177,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19648321-joseph-lawrence,2,"I picked up this book because Tyson's smooth, undaunted style appeals to me and because apocolyptic nonfiction seemed edgy. The book is more scientifically verbose than I first predicted. This is good for anyone with a fascination for how we got to now, especially in terms of debunking common myths about scientists of the past. People such as Sir Isaac Newton, Galileo and Heroditus are given as examples of the past to explain the present and to project into the future. "

The essays cover complex topics in an easy-to-read style, and tidbits are repeated throughout the progression so you keep getting a little review.

This really shouldn't have taken me so long to read but LIFE happened so...yeah. I loved this book and I'm sure lots of others do to! :) "

The chapters are informative and witty - as always coming from Neil deGrasse Tyson - but since the book is composed from separate articles, there are repetitions and sometimes you wish to get more information than the 10 pages each chapter offers you. If you are looking for an easy start to astrophysics, I would recommend ""Origins"" of the same author."

I particularly enjoyed the stuff about the ways the world (and the universe) could end, as I've always had a morbid curiosity in that sort of thing.

I also enjoy when he is the narrator of the audiobook, lending his sense of humor and voice inflection to otherwise dry material.

He not only astounds us with his grasp of cosmic data, but also finds ways of making it entertaining.

229,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17518284-arghya,4,This is a nicely written book. I am thoroughly enjoying it.
230,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33537178-mark-bryant,4,"I can honestly say there were not many facts in this book that were new to me. But then again, I am deeply into science and consider myself scientifically literate. Also, much of what went into this book also went into the show Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey which Doctor Tyson hosted. If you've watched that show, you know much, but not all, of what this book contains.But this book isn't about science, at least not in the way most commonly assumed: a dissertation of facts and figures clinically delivered in monotonous bullet lists. That is not Doctor Tyson's style. Yes, he expounds on facts about the known universe, and hypothesizes on what we suspect but haven't quite proven. Still, that isn't the purpose of this book. Doctor Tyson uses these facts to illustrate for the reader the incredible benefits the human species enjoys because of science, and those who have pursued the answers to mankind's most perplexing questions. Who are we? Why do we exist? What is our place in this universe? How does it all work? He wants people to understand these are not unknowable answers. As self-aware intelligent creatures with an inborn curiosity unparalleled by any other species on this planet (that we know of ;-) ,) we have it within ourselves to answer all these questions - and do it with repeatable, verifiable experimentation that leaves no doubt what the truth is.But knowing a fact and understanding an answer are two completely different things. I can know Doctor Albert Einstein proved the amount of energy that exists in a single atom is equivalent to its mass multiplied by 299,792,458 meters per second squared. That's the fact. But what does that fact mean to me personally? How does it affect my daily life? How have a benefited from it? To know that I must understand how Doctor Einstein's work has been put into use. Would it surprise you to know the Global Positioning System (GPS) in your smart phone relies on Doctor Einstein's equation to work? Seriously, those satellites orbit the Earth at a considerable velocity. And if you know how, you can reorganize Doctor Einstein's famous equation to describe the effect velocity has on time. Look at that equation spelled out above again. It ends in meters per second. We can mathematically isolate the time variable. When we fill on the other's, it'll give us a result in time units, and by comparing results from different initial conditions (in this case by varying velocity) we can see how velocity effects time. You'll find the faster you go, the slower time proceeds. We call this time dilation and Doctor Einstein expounded on it in his formulas of Special Relativity.Since GPS is an extremely precision oriented system, if it did not account for the tiny shifts in time the orbiting satellites experience, it could never tell you where on the face of this immense planet (relative to our terrestrial measurement systems) you are. And since Google is the great equalizer in all things knowledge, 7200 nanoseconds is the time dilation with resepct to Earth a GPS satellite undergoes while in orbit. Click on this link - https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid... - to see the full results of the five second Google search I did to find the answer.But here's the even more important message Doctor Tyson conveys in this book. Think about how the satellites came to be? Don't worry about the specifics, just consider the question in general. Think of all the questions we as a species had to answer to make GPS possible. It would have never happened without the entire space program. The entire space program relied on the invention of the flight in its several varieties, and that in turn depended on the discovery of the mathematical principles underlying the effects of gravity which Sir Isaac Newton first described in his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica published in 1687. Oh, and the science of Fluid Dynamics to which Sir Newton contributed a lot, but a whole lot of other people were involved with nailing down. Sir Newton's scientific work was inspired by many other men and enabled by the likes of Galileo Galilei and Nicolaus Copernicus. Their work in turn was inspired by others - and so on, and so forth. And that just deals with the getting into orbit sequence. There are many other sciences involved, like computers. Think of all the science necessary to invent the GPS we all take for granted today. It's awe-inspiring. And we did it. We humans. Many of us working together and over millennia. We did it with our minds, and our innate curiosity to know more.That is one message Doctor Tyson conveys in this book. Science is the foundation of our existence. Regardless of what men like Sir Newton had to put in the titles of their books (philosophy is the word they used instead of truth, so as to not get themselves in trouble with religion, the power brokers of divine justice coming out of the Middle Ages - think inquisition,) these are truths of the universe, codified and replicable. You can take every one of Sir Newton's equations and prove them yourself. It's a bit more tricky when it comes to Doctor Einstein's equations, but ordinary people like you and I can do it. That is the nature of science, and that is what Doctor Tyson wants everyone to understand. We have all benefited from science in more ways than we are aware. Doctor Tyson makes you aware of the debt we owe to science. He would not use the word debt, but I would. Since the first man figured out how to create tools from rocks, and more importantly how to repeat the process and show others how to do it, we have owed our lives to science. Even if the debt is never collected, we do owe our continued existence to those whose curiosity lead us to better times.I would be remiss if I didn't also point out there is something else Doctor Tyson wants his readers to understand. Something more sinister. He want's us to understand there are those who would hold us back. Who would see us live in an age of unenlightened ignorance rather than relinquish their unsubstantiated beliefs. Beliefs which science, on occasion, has shown to be, well... wrong. This is not the fault of scientists. Intelligent human beings should not have to deny a truth that is made self-evident through observation, testing and retesting. But there are those who will insist we do, and they harm us all in ways overt and subvert. As an example of this sort of harmful thinking, Doctor Tyson tells the story of Supernova 1054 (now the Crab Nebula.) Here is what he had to say about it in the book,""When scientifically investigating the natural world, the only thing worse than a blind believer is a seeing denier. In A.D. 1054, a star in the constellation Taurus abruptly increased in brightness by a factor of a million. The Chinese astronomers wrote about it. Middle Eastern astronomers wrote about it. Native Americans of what is now the southwestern United States made rock engravings of it. The star became bright enough to be plainly visible in the daytime for weeks, yet we have no record of anybody in all of Europe recording the event. (The bright new star in the sky was actually a supernova explosion that occurred in space some 7,000 years earlier but its light had only just reached Earth.) True, Europe was in the Dark Ages, so we cannot expect that acute data-taking skills were common, but cosmic events that were ""allowed"" to happen were routinely recorded. For example, 12 years later, in 1066, what ultimately became known as Halley's comet was seen and duly depicted - complete with agape onlookers - in a section of the famous Bayeux tapestry, circa 1100. An exception indeed. The Bible says the stars don’t change. Aristotle said the stars don’t change. The Church, with its unmatched authority, declares the stars don’t change. The population then falls victim to a collective delusion that was stronger than its members’ own powers of observation.""This is but one example of the many Doctor Tyson has researched and presents to the reader so they can understand how such behavior adversely affects us all. True, not recording Supernova 1054 because the Church forbade it did not have much of a direct impact on the lives of those living in Europe at the time. However, the mindset that allows for such suppression of information can be deadly. That mindset 400 years later directly caused millions of deaths from Bubonic plague. It was the same mindset that associated cats with witches, agents of the devil, and the spread of Bubonic plague, which was obviously the work of the devil. With no other substantiation other than that, the Church determined cats must be involved with the spread of Bubonic plague. Therefore the cats had to go. All over Europe priests encouraged their followers to eradicate the one creature that might have helped bring an end to the real plague spreaders: flees from rats. How many people died because of this unsubstantiated belief? According to medieval historian Philip Daileader up to 200 million people died in Europe. That's 50% of the population of the time. Germ theory was not formulated and tested for another 600 years, but had the cats not been slaughtered perhaps the rats would not have bred out of control spreading the Black Death throughout Europe like wildfire through a parched forest.Doctor Tyson wants his reader to understand there is a better way to think about the universe: analytically, fact based, derived from verifiable observations. This book is a 384 page exploration of how that sort of thinking happens, and how we have all benefited from the fact it happens. But since no review would be complete without looking at the cons of a book, there is one thing that really, really annoyed me by the end of the book. Doctor Tyson seems to be in love with the word indeed. He uses it 49 times in the course of the book, including the paragraph quoted above. That's once every 7.8367346938775510204081632653061 pages. Please Doctor Tyson, broaden your adverbial horizons and mix it up a little. Indeed is a nicely succinct, if somewhat archaic, adverb. Indeed, there are no other single words in the English language that convey the same meaning. But there are alternative phrases. Here are some suggestions Google gives: ""as expected,"" ""to be sure,"" ""in fact,"" ""in point of fact,"" ""as a matter of fact,"" ""in truth,"" ""actually,"" ""as it happens,"" ""if truth be told,"" and ""admittedly"". If I had to listen to that single word one more time, indeed, I think I would have gone mad! Nevertheless, I give Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries by Neil deGrasse Tyson a solid B+ as a book, and a wholehearted A+ as an attempt to help us understand what he feels helps us as a species, and what holds us back. If you're a die-hard denier, skip this book. It'll just make you feel dumb. Otherwise, give it a read. What have you got to lose other than ignorance?"
231,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,4,"Well... generally speaking... this was a very good book, probably better than the other books of Dr. Tyson's I've read lately. This is an anthology of Dr. Tyson's popular articles tailored to hang together and updated to reflect current knowledge... that is... knowledge to the point of publishing (2007). He leaves out the discovery of gravitational waves which was recent (2016). It has some flaws in logic, but over all it is a good read. OK. Now the flaws. Please note that while I am focusing on the flaws, the vast majority of the book is excellent. However, these few things irked me. Here we go.1. It is a little more technically rigorous than Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution, or Astrophysics for People in a Hurry. For me, that is a good thing, but for others it is not. 2. Dr. Tyson contradicts himself or at least fails to call attention to what seems to be a contradiction. He explained that life on Earth might have come from Mars. This is generally called panspermia, the idea that life was seeded on Earth from somewhere else. It is a reasonable idea in theory, but requires some proof. Whenever scientists have sought proof where it should have existed they have come up empty. The closest they have come to ""proof"" was a Mars meteorite they found in Antarctica in 1984. Later analysis in 1996 suggested that is might contain fossilized bacteria. Dr. Tyson was debated on this subject, and when he was confronted with the idea that the bacteria had no cell structure responded that it didn't have to be just like Earth life. Well... it does if we are all descended from Martians as he had suggested earlier in the book.3. In another contradiction he describes how ridiculous it would be that life (such as a virus) might exist in a cloud of dust in space. Yet, in his later TV show, ""Cosmos"" he suggested that life on Earth came from Earth passing through a cloud of dust that seeded life on Earth. I suspect Dr. Tyson did not write that episode and failed to contradict the writers or has changed his mind. (It is such a ridiculous idea that I suspect he was forced to say it as part of his contract, but I don't know. Like ""Hey, we already have all these cool graphics. It will cost us a fortune to do something else! You gotta do it!"") I forgive him, but it irked me.4. It is clear that while Dr. Tyson is an expert in his field, he is not an expert in all fields. I notice that he makes a joking remark whenever he wants to gloss over an area he doesn't understand or which he understands perfectly well, but doesn't want the reader to focus upon. This happens a lot when he discusses the origin of life because if he explained the problem properly most people would think ""G-d did it"". To be charitable, he might have thought that addressing the issue too directly would take take him on a tangent better addressed elsewhere. 4. He finishes up with a warning of the ""god of the gaps"" fallacy. I am sympathetic. Many a philosopher has reached the end of his intellect and said, ""Well... G-d made it that way."" That sort of thinking is not thinking at all. I support Dr. Tyson in his complaint about that, but his complaint is too broad. He sweeps away as irrelevant The Anthropic Cosmological Principle. It is completely relevant. Scientists do it everyday though they don't realize it. They should realize it. I recommend it. Note: the ""multiple universes"" argument that scientists are making nowadays is a slightly different type of ""god of the gaps"" argument. That doesn't make it wrong, but it stops the thinking process. Let that be a warning to you. Keep thinking! If you want to see a ""multiple universes"" argument go bad in fiction, read Michael Crichton's Timeline. Crichton's characters suggest that they don't travel in time. They jump between universes. The question then is ""How do you get back if there is no 'time machine' in the other universe?"" (view spoiler)[Well... someone in another universe figures that out and sends them back to us in this universe. (hide spoiler)] It only makes sense in multiple universes and it stops the thinking process in this universe.Despite my criticisms I'd read this book again and recommend it to others with the caveats above."
232,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62574705-john,3,"I was a little torn about the rating I wanted to give this. I found myself pulled along by my fascination with the material. There were many concepts that I have read about before but didn't yet fully understand until Dr. Tyson's amazing way with words put them into a form that was more clear.It is chock full of wonderful explanations of important concepts in astronomy and astrophysics. My favorites were ""Stick-in-the-mud Science,"" in which he details how much information you can glean simply by thrusting an upright stick into the ground and watching the shadows the Sun casts on it, and ""Our Radio Bubble,"" where he discusses how humanity's radio and television broadcasts could be intercepted by life out in the cosmos. But my main problem was with Dr. Tyson's high-handedness. I have great admiration for his intellectual gift, his passion, his inborn curiosity about the universe, but in way too many places here, he comes across as downright condescending and belittling. It mainly begins in the ""Science and Culture"" section, where he details several understandable frustrations with how people, and Americans in particular, seem willfully ignorant about science, or complacent in struggles that science could alleviate with their support. Dr. Tyson's beef with Hollywood is well-known, and that is given a chapter all its own. Perhaps the most egregious, though, was when he discussed science and God, and specifically intelligent design. This particular part of the book will, of course, stroke the feathers of many readers, from self-assured academics down to the smug Internet atheist (the latter being the more likely to read this review). But to anyone who really understands intelligent design, it reads as it is, a gross mischaracterization. Dr. Tyson's argument basically boils down to this: intelligent design intellectually hampers scientists because it assumes that anything we don't understand is beyond our capacity to understand and therefore not worth exploring.I do not know a single proponent of intelligent design who believes that, and all it really is is a straw-man based on a bad misunderstanding of what ID truly is. All it means is that the universe has a supernatural force or creator behind it, which science itself of course cannot measure, but is certainly not inconsistent with science. I personally tend to favor ID; I believe the wonders of the cosmos are there because some intelligence designed the processes behind them. If Dr. Tyson is correct, then I care little about, for example, trying to unify quantum mechanics with the laws of gravity, because I invoke my convenient ""God of the Gaps"" to explain it- God makes it work, and that's good enough for me.This is a wildly dishonest position to take. I will gladly posit that scientists and people of every stripe who subscribe to ID are every bit as curious and enthusiastic about new discoveries as Dr. Tyson is. It certainly didn't hamper Isaac Newton- whose quotes, by the way, Dr. Tyson misinterprets in this book to make it seem as though he too were invoking ""God of the gaps."" ID assumes an intelligence is behind the universe- but HOW that intelligence constructed the universe is every bit as driving a curiosity as the completely naturalistic and secular view Dr. Tyson takes.So there's MY rant, after reading through all of Dr. Tyson's. This book certainly accomplishes what it sets out to do- it wonderfully explains many ""cosmic quandaries."" Just get ready for some rants and smugness- he lays it on pretty thick. "
233,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10808157-walter-hall,2,"I wanted to like this book. I love reading popular science books. Up to the point where I read this book, Neil DeGrasse Tyson had seemed interesting and amusing when I saw him being interviewed. I should note that this isn't really an original book, but instead a collection of previously published essays, but that didn't bother me either, as I have enjoyed several of those.But then, as I read the book, I kept coming across errors or, if I'm being more generous in some cases, over-simplifications or badly written or confusing passages. You can say that a lot of them don't matter (like saying that that the names of the days of the week come from the seven ""planetes"" (wonderers) that the Greek knew about. Except that in English, it is more complicated than that. Sunday is obviously from the Sun. Monday is from the Moon. Tuesday is from Tyr, a Norse god. Wednesday is from Woden, a Norse God. Thursday is from Thor, as Norse god. Friday is from Frieda, a Norse godess. Saturday is from Saturn. So, three out of seven.Or when his ""proof"" that you should avoid gamma rays is The Hulk: (""Gamma rays are the sort of radiation you should avoid. Want proof? Just remember how the comic strip character 'The Hulk' became big, green, and ugly."") That is proof?Another frustrating thing to me is his frequent correction of misunderstandings, where he is taking something literally that is not meant to be taken as literal, and then basking in his intelligence as he corrects those who are misunderstanding the world. Like saying ""those who say 'What goes up must come down!' are misinformed"" because the escape velocity of the Earth is 11 km/sec. Or ""A compass points north"" (because it points south too, dummies!). Or ""days get longer in the summer and shorter in the winter"" (because summer doesn't officially start until the longest day of year, and really, I think that this is a cheat, since most people say ""days are longer is summer"", not get longer). Or ""the sun rises in the east and sets in the west"" (because it is only exactly east and west twice a year). It is as if someone so smart doesn't understand that people speak in conversational shorthand. These statements are all true in the sense in which people use them in everyday conversation.An example of the writing problems are sentences like ""Isaac Newton passed white light through a prism to produce the now-familiar spectrum of seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, which he personally named. (Feel free to call them Roy G. Biv.)"" I don't know how else to read that but that he is saying that Newton either named these seven colors or that he named violet, which is ridiculous. It turns out that he means that Newton decided that the spectrum was made up of these seven colors (because of 7 musical notes and 7 days of the week) and the first to apply the Latin word spectrum to that range of colors. Or when he repeats the easily disproven notion that most dust is made up of human skin.Or that he thinks Al Magest is Arabic for ""The Greatest"" (Akbar is ""greatest"" in Arabic).Or the sentence ""At this time in the life of a cloud, astrophysicists can only gesticulate what happens next."" I don't think that word means what you think it means.The biggest problems come when he writes about history or religion, which he plainly knows very little about. It becomes clear late in the book what the problem is. He has apparently been taught that the ""Conflict Thesis"" (i.e. that religion and science are in conflict, always have been, and always will be) is the correct interpretation the world. More about why that is wrong in a minute, but first, lets look at his misunderstandings of history.First, somewhat ironically if you actually know the history, his recounting that Board of Longitude's sought for a chronometer to determine longitude. Actually the scientists on the board hated Harrison's chronometer and avoided giving him the prize money that he had earned, because they wanted a scientific method of determining the measurement, not a device from a simple mechanic. So here we have a scientist praising scientists for seeking for something that they didn't look for and didn't want, because he believes that scientist are seekers after truth, so they must be motivated out of goodness, when the opposite was what really happened.Or that Galileo's observations in support of the heliocentric model ""shook Christendom"" (in case you don't know, it wasn't the extremely religious clergy who disliked heliocentrism, it was the Aristotelians scholars - it wasn't the fact that the theory contradicted the Bible, it was that it contradicted Aristotle). The church didn't really care about what he was doing, because Christianity isn't based on astronomical facts. Galileo was allowed to teach heliocentrism to his students and the first book he wrote on the subject was widely praised. It was only later when he got involved in religion and insulting the pope, and when he insulted those who pointed out the scientific problems* with the theory that he got into trouble.Or when he says ""The Bible says the stars don't change"" despite the most famous star (the Bethlehem star) in the Bible is famous because a) it was a new star and b) it ""went on before them"" (i.e. it moved and the wise men followed it). I'd be interested to see what he is talking about. I looked up every verse in the Bible that mentions stars and couldn't find one verse about them not moving.He says that we have ""no record of anybody in all of Europe recording"" the 1054 supernova, because the Church denied that such things could happen (i.e. new stars). First, the claim that no European recorded the event is disputed. But even if it is so, other supernovae in the Middle Ages where recorded in Europe, so what this one being missed says about the Christianity and the Church isn't clear. He wants it to prove that Christianity was holding back science. That seems more than a bit of a stretch. Plus, he says that ""Middle Eastern astronomers"" wrote about, but the only citation that I can find is to one Nestorian Christian doctor who blamed a plague on the event.Tyson clearly believes that the Conflict Thesis is correct. He quotes approvingly from Andrew D. White's book ""A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom"" (1896). The problem is that no serious historian of science thinks that White's book is good history or that the Conflict Thesis is correct. For example, White's book is the primary source of the belief that people believed in a flat Earth before Columbus. He included as many stories, dubious or not, in the book as he could find it helped promote his ideology. Needless to say, if you only look for evidence that proves you are right and don't care if the evidence is true, you will find plenty of evidence to support you. Stephen Jay Gould perhaps best explained when he noted ""White's and Draper's [the other great instigator of the thesis] accounts of the actual interaction between science and religion in Western history do not differ greatly. Both tell a tale of bright progress continually sparked by science. And both develop and use the same myths to support their narrative"". It is frankly bizarre that a person of his intellect is still relying on a book more than 100 years old for his information.I have to say reading this book, with its many errors and biases has soured me on Tyson. And when I see him opening his series Cosmos with the Giorano Bruno story as if he was burned at the stake for his scientific inquiries, it is clear that nothing since this book was written has changed. *The biggest problem with the theory, at that time, was that there was no measurable parallax with the stars. This meant that the stars would have had to be unbelievably far away (for the understanding of the universe at that time). It wasn't until the 19th Century that measurements were precise enough to overcome this problem."
234,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533949-kimball,3,"3.5 stars. A good book. Some of it was way over my head, as expected. As far as the title is concerned he only talked about it a little bit at the end. But I was very content when he mentioned his disgust of that stupid philosophical thought experiment about a tree falling in the woods and if no one hears it does it make a sound. So dumb. There is no philosophy in that. It's just ego-centric. Why would a tree not make sound just because you weren't there to hear it. Oh OK, every time I look away from grass it turns blue. Yep. We can go on for years making up stupid stuff like that and it will serve zero purpose at all. But I digress. Let's get back to deGrasse. See what I did there?The earth is a pear shape.I've never heard of an ether wave before.On Venus with the 900 degree air temperature, you could cook a 16"" pepperoni pizza by holding it outside for 7 seconds.Yeah why is matter favored over anti-matter in our universe? I've wondered that since reading Angels & Demons.I still don't get how someone can communicate via mathematics. Math isn't even fun.1 Kings 7:23 is a rough estimate of pi.An unopened can of diet pepsi floats in water and a can of regular pepsi sinks? I'm gunna have to try that one out.Stars color come in red, white, and blue. The hottest stars are blue. America is the best. So is George Bush because he actually loves America. Our sun is white.The color of the universe is a light shade of beige. That's wild how they can attempt to figure that out.Flights don't have a 13th row and buildings don't have a 13th floor? I didn't know that.Our modern Gregorian type calendar came as a request from the Roman Catholic Church to keep Easter in the Spring. When they were correcting the Julian calendar they lopped off 10 days just like that. So everyone's birthdays and ages were forgotten and altered since then.Interesting, those things in life that are magnificent and wonderful are usually evidence that there is Intelligent Design but Tyson suggests looking at the imperfect flawed things as evidence that there is intelligent design (like eating drinking and breathing through the same hole in your head increases you're likelihood to choke, or the appendix.) I like that."
235,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36524004-nazrul-buang,3,"Just finished reading 'Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries' (2006) by Neil deGrasse Tyson. I've heard of the author many times through his media appearances and talk shows about astrophysics, and was keen to know more about his books. I decided to pick up this one for a start.Astrophysics is difficult, and many would concur. It's not just difficult because it's physics; it's because it's the study of physics on a very vast field that humans don't intuitively understand: the stars, the universe and beyond. But Neil deGrasse Tyson has been lauded as an individual who puts an interesting spin on the topic and making it easier for the general audience to understand, including myself. I'm quite a fan of his talks on general science, and astrophysics is a very foreign topic in my reading list, so I was raring to go.I tried, and it didn't go so well. Death by Black Hole is supposedly for the general audience, but it certainly doesn't read like one. Most of the contents are hard to fathom, dealing a lot of physical terms and references that only readers with a scientific background can appreciate. The universe, though constantly being researched, is a huge enigma and astrophysics is the science towards understanding it. Tyson tried to make it understandable, yet to no avail and it was difficult for me appreciate his understanding. The only parts where I begin to appreciate his writing are sections 6 and 7, where he discusses topics such as how astrophysics is misrepresented in Hollywood, the significance of religion and God in astrophysics, and the existent ignorance of the scientific community.The reason I chose this book among Tyson's other books is because it's before his latest one, 'Astrophysics for People in a Hurry'. My intention was to read this book, but before that I wanted to know more about Tyson's earlier works first. Although Death by Black Hole was hard for me to appreciate, it has piqued my interest in picking up his latest book which is geared towards busy people (hence, should be more understandable). Needless to say, I'm still interested to read up his work and I'll go straight for Astrophysics for People in a Hurry next."
236,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5395453-stephen-morrissey,4,"deGrasse Tyson delivers another rollicking romp through the universe in all of its quirks (and quarks) in his ""Death by Black Hole."" In discussing antimatter, black holes, quasars, and the dangerous traits of our universe (including long-distant threats such as the burning out of our sun and the collision of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies), Tyson offers brief chapters that touch upon the latest science has to offer in explaining, or not explaining, such phenomenon.Fans of astrophysics and science generally will find much to enjoy in these pages. Tyson occasionally gets into the weeds on certain matters, but as far as science-oriented books, the average reader should be able to understand the major concepts. In addition, Tyson's titular summary of the experiences of falling into a black hole, with all of the miseries of being torn apart particle-by-particle by the tidal forces of such black hole) provides graphic evidence of the universe's mysteries that, though solvable in mathematics, lay for us beyond the bounds of our senses and experience.Tyson concludes the book with a ringing call to forsake the teaching of intelligent design in schools. Whatever one thinks about God's place in the universe, intelligent design incentives young men and women to consider gaps in our knowledge the cause of an omnipotent God. If we cannot explain what came before the Big Bang, says intelligent design, why bother investigating, for it must be God? Instead, Tyson urges us to test such boundaries and not to rely upon the intellectually-lazy conception of things beyond our reach. Endless investigation is the calling card of science - it will not provide spiritual answers, but it will provide answers that seem extraordinary, that may even fundamentally change how we see our universe, and our place in it."
237,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"Death by Black Hole is a collection of essays written for Natural History magazine by Neil deGrasse Tyson. As with Carl Sagan before him, Tyson is a great expositor, explaining the mysteries of science to the layperson.The book is organized by subject. There are seven large sections. These cover a wide range of material in each subject, from universal constants to how we are able to deduce what we know about the world. Take what we know about stars and the night sky. Most of what we know about stars comes from a technique called Spectroscopy. We can tell what a star is composed of by taking a picture of it and analyzing the spectral lines left behind. This, in turn, can tell us how old the star is and other information like that.A large amount of information is lost to us due to the fact that we can not naturally detect it. From the entire electromagnetic field, we can only see a small fraction of available frequencies of light. We miss out on a lot of events due to this small fact. Humans are inclined to be biased and not see what is in their field of vision even with all of this. We are enslaved by our senses, with other creatures and machines having to augment our abilities. Telescopes allow us to see further, but even with that, the atmosphere obstructs ground-based observations. That is why Space Telescopes like the Hubble was developed.While Tyson’s expertise lies in astrophysics, he had received a great amount of aid from other scientists to write and fact check these essays. The essays are all from the period of time between 1995 and 2005 so some of the information is slightly out of date. However, all of it is fascinating and excellent information. There isn’t really much else to say about it at all."
238,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85706759-priya-rainelle,4,"This book is what every science enthusiast or endlessly curious reader enjoys! From start to finish, Neil DeGrasse Tyson packs his writing with theories, hypotheses, funny anecdotes, and dad jokes about the beginning and end(?) of the universe - plus everything in between. On the outset, this book starts out very slow. The beginning chapters read like a textbook with super technical vocabulary that even a person with a rich academic background in science (like myself) found difficult to push through. I put this book down in favor of others on several occasions... inching forward in between lighter reads. And then the fun begins! We start getting into the good stuff. Well, it’s all good actually; but I mean the topics that make for fun chatter between nerd friends, or the conversations that might come up if you’ve been indulging in some mind-altering vice. Black holes, aliens, space travel, extinction... ooooh yea baby! My imagination was running wild. DeGrasse does a great job in being matter of fact without trespassing or putting down religious beliefs in spaces where the two tend to come into conflict. Still, I was pleasantly surprised by how affirming this read was, particularly towards the end. I actually felt quite humbled, inspired, and empowered by the discussions around the end of times. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves science and is, accordingly, fascinated by the universe and all its wonders. I’d also recommend it to anyone in search of meaning in life, or the meaning of life. You’ll be surprised at how many tangents the mind will take you on, as you go on an intellectual journey of sorts while reading the book. Keep going, just as the universe does! "
239,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33725323-emma-zucati,4,"This book was a collection of essays that Tyson had published in a scientific journal that he then slightly edited so they flowed a bit more. Standalone, the essays were incredible. They were well thought out and insightful with enough humor occasionally to carry you through them. The collection of essays overall focused on how we will never truly be done learning about the universe. Additionally, the book used the scientific method to establish claims about the universe and how things got discovered as well as disproved. It was interesting to hear stories about people reinventing what the universe means. Most concepts were explained in a way that anyone could understand but some were explained with more intense assumptions about the reader’s knowledge enough that I, a student in a college level astronomy class, couldn’t quite wrap my head around. That was probably the major problem with this book. Another issue that came up was the repetitiveness of the essays. Some of the essays had very similar concepts so Tyson explained a concept in one essay and then explained it again in one a few chapters later. 	Honestly, each essay was amazing. And that was the root of the issue. I’m the kind of person that reads for two hours straight. This book doesn’t allow for that. It would be most enjoyed an essay a day with a highlighter in hand able to take notes. That’s because a lot of Tyson’s essays are related to his lectures “My Favorite Universe”. Transferring lectures into essays into a collection of essays into a book makes sense to me. Therefore, I saw this book as good, even if my initial reaction wasn’t necessarily that positive."
240,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23673998-dan-perry,3,"I liked the book. Each chapter is its own cosmological phenomenon, idea or event. So its very ""snackable"" as people say these days. A lot of it really had me thinking for hours about science and had me asking a lot of questions and wanting to know more. He also did a good job of answering questions that are provoked from reading it. So why 3 stars? Neil DeGrass Tyson seems elitist, idealistic, and judgemental throughput the book. He likes to pepper the book with science fiction nit picks, movie critiques, culture critiques, political ideologies and theological ideologies. I felt like he wanted to a)show how smart he is (which should be implied since he's a freaken astrophysicist and ironically makes him appear to lack social intelligence) and b) feels like you're being pushed into indoctrination. When you read other space authors, you get the same level of intrigue without the commentary. This is characteristic on NDGT and I should have expected this since he's become a meme for his tweets. I honestly don't look down on the author for this, I think it's more of a sign of out times. I just see politics get so combative and vitrolic that clearly fighting fire with fire is only making things worse. The last chapters deal with religion and science.I feel like those chapters will do nothing to change the minds of the people he is politically opposed to, while alientating them to not wanting to read the book. I think this review would be much more flattering if it didn't end on this note. Possibly instead the book could invigorate interest in the scientific process by using it's intrinisic utility, and ability to spark wonder in people."
241,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93581578-first-name,5,"Death by Black Hole and Other Cosmic Quandaries is really good if you're interested in astrophysics. If not, then reading it is like trying to read a dictionary in a language you don't understand. I’m interested in astrophysics/physics so I would rate this book 10/10. One of the things that I really like about this book is that you don't need a deep understanding of astrophysics (though you may need to read things multiple times to understand, and need a quiet environment). I think it's really cool the way Neil DeGrasse Tyson managed to piece together a book out of essays and make it flow. Though because of that, he leaves you hanging on ideas that he briefly talked about and that can be annoying. Death by Black Hole is a book that sees funny side on real things. It's also funny because it talks about things like being killed by a black hole which will probably not happen to any of us. Another one is things that won't happen for five billions of years, like the Andromeda galaxy crashing into our galaxy. Where a Sun could rip Earth away from our Sun. Leading to earth drifting in space for a while. Another possibility is that Earth would be captured by the other Sun. That could lead to the temperature not being right so all the water would evaporate or freeze. Death by Black Hole contains lots of knowledge that is cool to know like the writing above this sentence."
242,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63434432-katie-renwick,1,"Maybe Neil degrasse Tyson just isn't for me... this seemed like a lazy copy paste job of his astrophysics for people in a hurry book. I'm really interested in black holes and there was maybe one chapter on it.Even worse, he continues to belittle the human race which is fine but I can get that from anyone. I don't need an astrophysicist to tell me how dumb people are. Once again he throws religion into it, trying to stir up some controversy I suppose but if people were interested in the Catholic church's transgressions over history we can get this in many other books including some third grade textbooks I recall.... overall I didn't learn much which was disappointing. Tyson calls religious people smug in this book but this book had smug all over it with very little to back it up. He continues to drive a wedge between religion and science which isn't good for advancing knowledge or understanding, two things we desperately need these days. That was really disappointing. The creator of the big bang theory was religious. You can have faith and also be skeptical.Can you stick to astrophysics please, insightful facts that aren't common knowledge? I expect more from someone of his caliber but after reading two of his books he's beginning to seem more like a hack.I expected a lot better from him but unfortunately I got nothing."
243,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25076827-vigneshwaar-srinivasan,4,"3.5/5 - To start off, this rating is not 4 or higher only because there aren't a lot of new things to be learned if you've already seen Cosmos and/or followed NDT on the internet.Even so, this is a perfect collection of essays for a newbie in the astro-nomy/philosophy/physics/chemistry/biology arena.From the nucleosynthesis of elements in the raging furnace of the stars to the dark depths of interstellar space, this book has it all and then some. One of the main inferences I gathered from it is the importance, or rather requirement, to be a generalized specialist (Being a specialist over a series of complementary topics as opposed to being an expert in just one or two areas). To interpret the cosmos, one must not only need a strong background in physics but also a lot of knowledge in the fields of biology, chemistry, geology and even palaeontology! Overall, this is a fantastic book for someone whose love affair with the stars is just beginning to take flight. Tyson's writing style is such that even veterans would be entertained by this ode to the cosmos.Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to the terrace to gaze in awe at the majestic burning balls of gas that light up our night sky from trillions(yes, trillions) of kilometres away. "
244,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19124904-charles-sheard,4,"Graceful, confident, yet with an underlying humor, Tyson's writing is a pleasure to read. My only minor issues with the book are just those which you expect reading a collection of essays from across the years: too much overlap between subject matter, or the re-telling/re-use of specific examples, historical events or concepts to make the same or similar points too often. Also, Tyson mentions near the end that during the Q&A after all of his speaking engagements, the questions inevitably turn to the same ""sexy astrophysical subjects such as black holes, quasars and the big bang."" Yet I found this collection to be similarly focused on such subjects, and wished sometimes for less emphasis on the big picture sexy subjects, and more on practical applications of astrophysics, recommendations for areas of research and exploration, roadmaps for where the scientific community should be aiming in the near future. I wanted a little less of the forest, and a little more of the trees. Nevertheless, the value of having a Tyson to speak to us is something we should not take for granted."
245,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5880900-karin-walters,3,"This was an interesting read (or listen to, in my case since I had the audiobook) and maybe filled me with more knowledge about astrophysics and the universe. Mostly I was following what was going on, but if there was a concept that I either couldn't follow because it was over my head (or I would argue, that I didn't care about?) then I'd skip it. I was sharing some of the fun facts with my husband and he was like ""yeah, Neil deGrasse Tyson used to be a lot more patient but now he's a little condescending."" Almost immediately after this conversation, I got to the part where Neil lost his marbles about how films get the cosmos wrong about very minor things (well, some more than others). Obviously not minor to him. That section was a little silly to me, but I guess it's part of his charm?I'm rating this 3 stars because although I enjoyed it just fine, now that I'm finished, I couldn't really tell you anything I listened to. If I were to summarize this right now, I couldn't give any concrete examples of what I found interesting, minus what I just referenced in the previous paragraph. Did I just shut my mind off, even though it's a science book?"
246,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7156080-tatiana,3,"4 stars for being exceptionally tangible and interesting, but 2 stars for being exceptionally pretentious and repetitive. *Sighs* I guess we'll settle on three stars.The preface of this book states that, ""Each chapter first appeared, in one form or another, on the pages of Natural History magazine...and span the 11-year period of 1995 through 2005."" That would partly explain the repetition, except it also notes that the chapters have been ""mildly edited for continuity and to reflect emergent trends in science."" Then why weren't they edited for excessive redundancy?! I can get behind repetition being used as a tool to grasp exotic concepts, but there were multiple occasions where 3 chapters in a row felt like deja vu, and I had to wonder that if my best attempts to turn the pages one at a time were fruitless, and I was actually just reading the same chapter over and over again.Tyson also has a tendency towards arrogance that cropped up far too many times for my tastes. I've heard from online anecdotes that this is really just an act - like Bill Nye's goofy television persona - and Tyson's really more likable than he comes across, but even if that's true, it doesn't make it less frustrating.Still, Tyson reigns as one of the most comprehensible scientists of our time, with a knack for making astrophysics intelligible for the rest of us pea-brains."
247,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91468685-yazeed-shamieh,4,"I became interested in reading a book by Neil deGrasse Tyson after watching his Hot Ones interview, where he provided an insightful analysis of various scientific and cultural elements. After seeing a book of his at the used bookstore, I knew I had to pick it up.Death by Black Hole is a collection of many essays and articles written by Tyson for Natural History magazine. The essays go through numerous scientific topics, mostly concerning astrophysics and the discoveries of our universe.Tyson has a great way of making science relatable and understandable to all people. While some of the chapters were difficult to get through and required some Googling to stay on track, the book itself was extremely interesting and made me appreciate the scientific field more than ever. Any exploration of space and the universe is amazing to me; it's terrifying how small we are and how little we know about what we have discovered. Anything by Tyson is a sure way of experiencing our relative insignificance, and our significance at the same time."
248,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3402914-emily,4,"Very interesting. It's a collection of articles/essays by Neil deGrasse Tyson, so it can be somewhat repetitive since they weren't originally written to be read one after another. Some concepts/explanations get repeated because he used them in multiple articles. Also, entire passages were lifted from this for his new book, ""Astrophysics for People in a Hurry"". So it still wasn't the deep dive that I was looking for on some of the more interesting topics in astrophysics. But some of the repetition was nice, as it helped hammer in some concepts to make them easier to remember. Also, this goes more into thermodynamics and basic physics and math more than his new book does. Still very palatable for a layperson, though I did have to pause the audiobook in my car a few times when I knew I was too distracted mentally to be able to follow what he was talking about. You definitely have to pay attention, but that's not a bad thing."
249,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34176685-edward-keag,4,"A good book by one of the most popular celebrity scientists.Having read A Brief History of Time this book feels like an updated version, a version brought into the 21st century.Numerous contemporary theories are discussed, with a nice historical background of how we got to where we are with each particular strand of astrophysics. Although this may sound daunting, it is done in a very ""evryeryman"" style, just as ABHoT was.Although I enjoyed the book, I just couldn't give it 5 stars as I felt that Tyson's writing style at times slipped from the informal, friendly teacher, to the slightly annoying lecturer who spins off at a tangent every so often. Pages and pages dedicated to poor sci-fi in films and common mis-conceptions that people have take away from the pleasure of the pure science based writing that precedes it.All in all a really good read that I would recommend to anyone thinking that they have left it long enough to read ABHoT."
250,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8131206-letti,2,"I am really sorry to say this, but I did not like this book. At all. I felt the author looked down on so many things. I found his approach especially pompous and narrow-minded. If he does not agree with something, he does not hesitate to ridicule it. And even though I am a huge fan of NASA and I am amazed by their achievements, I do not think that the USA is the centre of the universe in terms of science. All nations have had their fair share of pioneering work. But, hey, who am I to judge? Unfortunately, Neil never asks himself this question.I cannot deny I have found some crumbles of exciting information in this book, but all in all it was not explanatory . It brings up truly gripping topics with very little explanation if any at all. Just my two cents, guys. If you are into black holes, quasars and stuff, give it a try. It seems the majority of readers were rather moved by the book."
251,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40832094-v-ctor-lvarez,5,"This is the book I wish I've read sooner. It's slightly more elabordate than, say, Astrophysics for People in a Hurry. Death by Blackhole a collection of essays conveniently sorted by section/topic not date and because of that they can feel a little repetitive. There's even a reference to nine planet while the text all around keeps calling Pluto a large comet. I can get behind that idea of a fancy comet.I'm intrigued by the idea of ""spaghettification,"" while you might die in a matter of seconds as a string of atoms, a galaxy far away might witness your death for all eternity. Yeah, that last part wasn't included."

I would not recommend this book for leisure reading or for the faint hearted as it talks in great detail about the different behaviors and phenomenon of the cosmos. My. Tyson has a good way to explain things by dumbing it down enough that a person without an astrophysics degree can understand and follow. That being said, the book is lengthy because to really absorb the material, you need to read slow. There is a shorter version of the book which is like a quick read summary of this book and I would recommend that book if what you want is to just get an idea of the concepts without being bogged down by the details of it"

I've been doing a lot of reading and research in cosmology lately, and have been digging into black holes and it dawned on me quickly that this book is a general piece for the average layman -- and there's nothing wrong with this! However, I guess I was aiming for something a little meatier and if I had thought it over for just a minute, I should have known this wouldn't be the place to go, so that's on me. Nonetheless, for those not well versed in cosmology, it's a pretty good, even entertaining, book and as such, certainly recommended."
254,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86349665-collin,5,"This book explores the far reaches of the universe, and events that only few can even comprehend. You are brought to the surfaces of planets that would rip you apart in nanoseconds. Places that would vaporize you or freeze every molecule of your body in an instant. You learn the basic principles of gravity and other cosmic forces. You also learn about how the movies portray of space is not quite what it seems. All this is simplified by Neil DeGrasse Tyson into as simple a form as water boiling in a pot. This book is for older teens and adults that are interested in what happens if you die by a black hole."
255,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86446832-helena-kung,5,"In my opinion, this was a very good book for a lot of reasons. I think that Neil deGrasse Tyson has very clear explanations in his book and he adds to it by making sarcastic comments. I also like how he acknowledges that humans have been very self-centered when in reality, Earth is very insignificant in the universe. It is important to mention this because a lot of people are still very self-centered. I also liked that this book talked about a lot of topics related to space along with black holes. Something that I found helpful was that facts mentioned in previous sections would often appear later in the book. This helps the readers remember details from earlier in the book."

I'm not sure if this was the right book for me to choose. Most of this book went way over my head. This isn't Neil deGrasse Tyson's fault, someone who's more science minded and truly interested in going deeper into astrophysics would love this book of essays I'm sure. For someone like me however, it delved a little too deep for me to understand much less be interesting. Overall this book is well written, occasionally humorous, very informative, and at times aggravating."
257,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51981516-aj,4,"This isn't really a book. It's a collection of independent short articles or essays. The author made an effort to put them together in an appropriate order, and to give them some tiny traces of cohesion. But that doesn't make a book.The biggest problem? It's too repetitive. In a book you don't usually have to read the same passage over and over in different chapters. But this wasn't planned as a book, it's a collection of essays thay were originally published as independent articles in a journal... so, their topics overlap plenty of times.Despite that, I'd still recommend it. Quite pedagogical and informative, in Mr. Tyson's own entertaining way."

And I liked how each chapter was like a whole new article. But NDT is not a good explainer. I just kind of read along nodding my head and googling stuff when I could. Well the coronavirus struck and had to return it a few chapters early. Hopefully that’s a funny sentence to read several years from now (yeesh). Anyways saw a joe rogan clip about what was before the Big Bang with Brian Greene and HE sounds like he could explain astrophysics to me with simple metaphors, so will look for some books from him."

Attributing the wonder of the cosmos, or any of our natural world to God or ""intelligent design "" isn't just throwing our hands up in the air and saying we've hit our limit of knowledge. It does not stifle (for me) the search for explanation and knowledge like Tyson claims. The continued search for knowledge and understanding and pushing the boundaries of that understanding is exactly what God calls us to do and brings us closer to God."

He has a strong command of facts and is very articulate, but it's mainly his passion and wonder that are so captivating. That and his irascible character: he slags Aristotle for getting gravity wrong (this was an epiphany for me, even though heavy things tend to fall faster, it is very easy to see that a heavy and a light rock fall at essentially the same rate) and Jodie Foster for being math illiterate and going to Yale (instead of Harvard/epic snark).

'Death by Black Hole', I picked as in fact first book from him, and I feel he does good work in his writings too. This is book is chapters his lectures that have been compiled and re-written in a way to get astronomy to public. Tyson's expertise and knowledge are larger area of science is very evident in this book, and has been written with good sense of humor as well.Reasonably good book if you are looking for some generic knowledge in astronomy."
262,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48637147-emma-jane,4,"I’ll start off my clarifying that this book can not contain spoilers, unless you consider science to be a story and wish to have it unfold the way fictitious ones do. However, this is not only infinitely unattainable, but is also in stark contrast to the realities of the process of learning- which is unpredictable and random. This is why I believe I reserve the right to “spoil” any part of this book.DeGrasse Tyson's ""Death by Black Hole"" provides some of the many realities of our functioning universe, as well as insights on how humankind has interpreted and observed it. Through astrophysical definitions and perspectives, this book adulterates the common fog of understanding most people have regarding astrophysics. This book is easily digestible and has themes that will captivate readers, regardless of their knowledge in science. The insights on the concepts are simple enough to get the gist of but has just the right amount of complexity to leave readers with questions. Without any expectations on understanding everything about astrophysics, the book will satisfy any minor quests for knowledge and give more serious learners a platform for future studies. The only struggle that I couldn’t find a solution for in my reading experience was the way the information was expressed. It was shared in a textbook manner; too much information and too little connections. At times it seemed incomprehensible, lengthy and overwhelmingly full of information. I don’t think that there’s anything wrong with this, it’s simply a challenge that I faced and I realistic parallel to the struggles of astrophysicists.Overall I would recommend this book because it provides a thorough and captivating basis of astrophysics and a new perspective of the influence our overlooked academic revelations have on everyday life. "
263,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95429562-melanie,4,"I readily enjoyed this book. Neil is very passionate about science. He explained basic biology, chemistry, and physics in an understandable manner, and he has funny way of presenting his thoughts. I watch a lot of Nova and Nature and have seen Neil, of course his passion is Astro physics which becomes clear as you read this book. I felt like I was back in university with a great professor!If you love science, are inquisitive about our world and the other planets in our solar system, and worlds beyond ours, this book is a must read!"
264,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62532961-mehul-jangir,3,"A brilliant read with articles on a variety of topics. I especially loved the part where Tyson debunks common statements and proves how they're false, from stuff as basic as believing that the Moon only comes out during nighttime, to the statement that days progressively get longer during the Summer. A fascinating read, in all respects. However, with that being said, I found a lot of the content repetitive and the book to be a bit slow to read, not on par with books lik The Black Hole War and Astrophysics For People in a Hurry. This didn't stop it from being any more fascinating though."
265,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29887302-anurag-kataria,3,"Hugely disappointed in this book, not because of the content but the editing done on it. Not only does this book not follow any structure, some topics are repeated several times. There are no diagrams in the entire book which makes simple stuff seem unnecessarily complicated. NDT’s passion for his field and nuggets of humour made me hit the end but would recommend anyone who has read his other books to give a pass on this one. "
266,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/242173-serena,5,"You'd think you've heard these stories before, but the number of times my mind was blown was too many to count. I'm grateful for ambassadors like NdT, who can string together history, scientific theories, and humor to connect you to the esoteric. The chapters are bite sized such that you don't feel overwhelmed, but provide enough information such that you want to research each topic just a bit more."
267,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1604002-jenny,2,I really tried but have to give up on this one. I wanted to increase my understanding of the subject but struggled following Neil DeGrasse Tyson’s “simplified” astrophysicist. I think part of the reason is that it is a collection of essays so jumped around quite a bit making it confusing more times than not. The intellect these scientists have to try to solve these massively complex problems is truly amazing. Maybe I’ll try something by Carl Sagan once my brain recovers.
268,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27678334-eric,3,"Not for the hard scientist as he gets rather flippant with some of his essays on the points he is making on the cosmos. The well rounded reader is advised to be cautious, as well, as Tyson injects his humorous quips to keep up interest; and the subject is, I think, exciting enough in its own right to keep up reader interest. Those complaints aside, the work is a varied look at biology, physics, cosmology, and even spirituality with an eye towards the stars."
269,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16830785-sudip-das,5,"It is undoubtedly, one of the most impressive work of Dr. Tyson where he tried to explain the various complexities and wonders of the universe. The way he narrated the convolution of the astrophysical terms in a very simple manner is highly appreciable. This book is recommended for amateurs like me who prefer to understand the creative and destructive nature of our universe, but with a simplistic narration. "
270,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5983706-andrew,4,"This is a collection of essays from the famed astrophysicist, Neil DeGrasse Tyson and it lives up to his lively manner on TV. Tyson does a good job in bringing what can be complex topics down to a level that the layman can grasp and understand. The section on the ways that the universe is trying to kill you was particularly good and often tongue-in-cheek. A good read for anybody that enjoys science or astronomy."
271,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104260283-victoria-ladouceur,4,"I’ve loved all books by Neil deGrasse Tyson that I’ve read and this one is no exception! This novel covers a broad spectrum of astronomical topics, similar to his book Astrophysics for People in a Hurry, but Death by Black Hole goes into quite a bit more detail. Certainly an educational ready but Tyson also adds a personal touch with sarcastic remarks and short rants that seem to have bothered him for quite some time. "
272,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48107805-jayaprakash-telangana,5,"The secrets that unfold in these pages of ‘matter, energy, space & time’ their behavior, relationship with the Cosmo’s & especially US... ‘the stardust’ is ‘mind boggling’. “... the boundary between what is known and unknown in the Cosmos”. ‘Knowing where you came from is no less important than knowing where you are going”The last chapter ‘Perimeter of Ignorance’ is a must read. The Universe wants to kill us all. Science is a philosophy of discovery. "
273,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87452160-basheer-a-al-gailany,4,"This book has an enormous amount of pop cosmo facts, but the only problem is that it is very superficial.I know it is intended for the general population but for example, it would be more interesting if a simple explanation of how scientists figure out stuff about our universe was shown, like how do we know the stages of the early Universe?Even if this means that the book will be a little bigger, but I think it would have been worth it."
274,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107911335-jacob-colborn,0,"An excellent exploration into many various topics involving space, physics, and other scientific disciplines and how they apply to our lives and society as a whole. The author has a coherent way of specifying their arguments making the read quite enjoyable. The book, as a whole, can be thought of as unorganized; with some chapters beginning where the previous chapters should have continued, but each section holds as its own independent expression. "
275,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5118726-mattila,3,"A collection of essays by NdGT. It was OK but not anything new or amazing. Fun refresher about why the cosmos are so amazing, how we learned what we know, and how many gaps in our knowledge exist. A few pop-science asides on religion and science in school and society. If you listen to StarTalk or know much about astronomy, you can skip this one."
276,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5624190-nancy-groves,3,"I enjoyed this book of essays, written with Tyson's customary wit and aptitude for explaining complex subjects to those without a strong science background. But I doubt I'll remember much if anything I read! Still, no regrets, and many instances when, at least momentarily, I gained some insight into the workings of the universe."

278,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24091952-george,3,"I thought this was a really interesting book. It did seem a bit complicated and I felt that some of it went over my head. However, I really enjoy thinking and reading about space and the cosmic quandaries that fascinate us all. And of course I heard Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's voice in my head as I read this book, it felt like I was listening to an audio book!"
279,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20111112-berry-muhl,4,"Another themed entry by Tyson, collecting previous entries into a loosely-linked set. Some of these previously appeared in the collection Origins, although they've been somewhat extended to fit into the new theme.Highly recommended for folks into astrophysics, although if you're as into the subject as I am, you're not likely to find much new here."
280,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9892457-lisa,4,"This is a nice, occasionally humorous, overview of the cosmos. He does spend a fair amount of time chastisting people for not understanding basic scientific principles, almost to the point where he's whining, but most of the book is well written and nicely broken up into small essays. It took me a long time to finish this one though. "
281,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5756337-greg-stoll,3,"This was kind of interesting, and the ""lots of short chapters"" format works well. But I've come to the realization that I'm not a huge fan of Tyson's writing. To me, it comes off as kind of condescending and pretentious - not in a big way, but enough to be irritating. Am I the only one that feels this way?"
282,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4740264-chris,4,"I liked this. However, it had two main problems: (1) Tyson insists on occasionally using language that feels patronising, such as ""super duper"" to emphasize how big something is and (2) in the last several chapters the tone changes and it feels like he's preaching. I enjoyed it thoroughly outside of those two issues."
283,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50399022-stephanie,5,"Great information about the cosmos but left off on a slight depressing note about intelligent design in America and the grasp of ingorance. All of the amazing things we have are because people asked questions and sought answers. The realization that there is a movement that hinders seeking answers by filling in with a ""god of the gaps"" is what will hold back society if we let it"
284,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64719476-john-shelton,2,"Books by popularizers of science have a tendency for smugness and this one takes the cake. Tyson incessantly bashes strawman distortions of philosophy and religion as useless and, honestly, the book didn’t make up for these defects with content. For a much better book in this vein, try “Physics of the Impossible.”"
285,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17213643-jennah-margaret,4,"I really enjoyed Death by Black Hole - there's an art to making astrophysics approachable and engaging and Neil deGrasse Tyson does it so well. Also, I listened to this on audio and he has a fantastic reading voice. If you're just a little bit curious about what we know and don't know about our cosmos and all the exciting things we will discover - pick this up. "
286,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21939006-todd-wood,4,"Another good read by Neil deGrasse Tyson! Given that it is a collection of essays written over the years, the book is a little bit more scattered than Origins/Astrophysics for people in a hurry. That being said, he is a great writer with a knack of making complex ideas and concepts seem approachable and interesting, so still worth a read. "
287,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68989896-nicole-miller,3,"Liked it up until the last chapter. Throughout the book, he pokes fun at anyone that thinks different from himself. It is written with an air of superiority, even towards other scientists/astrophysicists & especially towards people who believe in a God. I tried getting past that & just concentrating on the science, but it was difficult. "
288,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32005999-lee-belbin,4,"This is a very well-written book with a wealth of interesting information about cosmology (the evolution of the universe), philosophy (e.g., the role of 'god') and homespun common sense. This is certainly the best book I have read that explains the history of understanding of our universe (and our little part in it)."
289,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28766289-michael-truscott,4,I really enjoyed this book. I really appreciate the writer’s enthusiasm for astrophysics and his sense of humor. There were a number of concepts that I learned about. My only complaint is deGrasse’s disdain for people of faith. But as a regular listener of Star Talk I knew what I was getting into. Totally recommend this book.
290,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78577261-marco-rizk,4,"Its a compilation of every lectures, interview or seminar done by Neil deGrasse Tyson and some more.Parts of the book will seem familiar like the same arguments you heard on youtube just written. Yet its full of new intriguing information about the universe.The last two sections about people, culture and God seemed dull to me and I lost interest "
291,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88985331-sarah-rigg,3,"While I did enjoy the hard science essays, they took some time to digest and were a little slow going. I really enjoyed the pieces about ""science and culture"" best. I especially enjoyed the way he tears apart scientific goofs in the movies and scientific misunderstandings in pop culture generally. He injects a lot of humor into his writing which helps make it very accessible."
292,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24689727-ariel-sebbag,5,"Easy, fun readingTyson is a master communicator, who is never boring nor too technical. This is a book that allows anyone to grasp the current state of physics and astronomy sciences.As an engineer, I’ve missed the technical tidbits, but I know I’ll be a minority. Definitely recommended!"
293,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56884271-brian-kirk,5,"Neil deGrasse Tyson does a great job of simplifying the math and science. I found this book to very educational and interesting. The book gives us the history of space science from the formation of planets, our solar system and stars. I have read a book by Stephen Hawking and I found this book easier to read."
294,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1481306-lisa,3,"Well, this satisfied my nerdy impulses for a while! This is NOT something to read or listen to while doing household chores. It needs your full attention. My favorite essay was the one about the astronomical bloopers in popular movies. Now I want to go rewatch them, or watch for the first time, in the case of Titanic!"
295,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3871172-kirsty,4,"With this being a collection of over 40 essays, there were definitely some I didn't care for. On the whole though I enjoyed listening to this collection on audiobook, and it's a book I can see myself rereading. It is a good mix of history of physics and science, and speculation on the future of astrophysics and the universe."
296,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4454085-mike,4,"I love Tyson's writing style: He can describe very complicated phenomena in a straightforward, sometimes humorous, manner. The topics in this book are very interesting to me. My only complaint is that, as someone who reads a lot, it's relatively slow going because you have to pay more attention to the narrative than usual. So, this book took a little longer to read but it was worth it."
297,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108408908-cooper-b,5,"Death by Black Hole is a great book. It doesn’t over complicate what it is explaining, and each explanation is easy to retain. The book was the most enjoyable around half way into the book.I really loved his book and can’t wait to read more of them. He is an amazing writer, everything he writes is fun to read and easy to retain."
298,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109719196-joseph-hood,4,"A great book that gets off to a slow start. Those with prior knowledge or education in (basic) astrophysics may struggle with the first several chapters, as they cover some introductory level concepts and theories. However, Tyson takes on much more complex topics later in the book that are absolutely mind-boggling. And his writing is clever and compelling throughout. "
299,039335038X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26043392-travis,4,"As someone with degrees in Science, I didn't come across anything super advanced in this book. It is comprised of a collection of essays from Natural History from 1995-2005. Tyson has a good style that is accessible by both laymen and others with advanced scientific knowledge. He keeps a somewhat dry subject entertaining and informative."
