0,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"In my bookshop are lots of books like, 'First 100 Words' and ""ABC with pictures"", you know those sort of books. We talk to our babies in 'motherese' and we point to things and name them, but we do not teach our babies grammar. We say things like 'look at those puppies there, they are much smaller than these ones here'. We don't explain when to use words like 'those' or 'these' or 'there' and 'here' and where we put them in a sentence. We don't need to, Pinker says, Chomsky said, that grammar is built-in. That no matter what language a child learns, they will use the words grammatically without any instruction. And if a child learns wildly different languages as say Welsh, Spanish and English (there are many people who grow up speaking these particular three in Patagonia) they will use the correct grammar as well as words without any difficulty at all.__________Notes on reading: What I've learned so far: that it takes only one generation to turn a pidgin into a creole (language). Immigrant workers in Hawaii, Japanese, Filipinos, Chinese, Koreans even Portuguese and Europeans spoke to each other in pidgin. Pidgin is a collection of words without any grammar. It's a bit like what most of us who are not linguistically-gifted speak when we travel. We mix the few words we know of the local language with English and (if British) shouted loudly and repetitively until the 'native' gets it. The children of the immigrant workers were looked after together when their parents were in the fields and they, just like that, because of the instinct for language, for grammar, turned the pidgin into a creole, a language that could express anything and everything. Children never speak pidgin, their brains impose structure on words and they learn from each other. Sadly, the window for language acquisition closes as puberty approaches. After that it is only talented individuals who can acquire a foreign language with perfect grammar and accent. Jamaican, which Jamaicans continually put down as the patois of the poor people', not proper 'standard English' is in fact a proper language with its own grammar, although a majority of the words are derived from English and Akan, Pinker says he's not 100% behind Chomsky's theories. He's pretty close though. I got bored with the chapters on Chomsky's language trees, I'm more interested in how we produce language than the structure of it. Great book, a difficult and academic read (at least to me) and boring in bits too but none of that takes away from opening up a new skein of thought for me, and I enjoy that more than anything else from a book."

2,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1198255-madeleine,4,"I have this incredible mental block about reviewing nonfiction. My formal linguistics experience is limited to exactly one History of the English Language class as a college junior (and it remains one of the most fascinating, satisfying and illuminating classroom experiences I've ever had, university-level or otherwise), which was about when I realized that the study of language was up there with the school paper and my creative-writing courses in terms of the all-over fulfillment I found in it. It helped that I had an enthusiastic professor whose wealth of knowledge and general zeal turned my disappointment in the English department's lack of additional linguistic offerings into a fervent hunt for extracurricular reading material regarding the topic, though I can't help but feel that my self-guided tour through the field isn't yielding the same benefits I'd've received from exploring the same terrain with an expert leading the way. Hence my concern that I'll sound like I'm trying to pretend that I know what I'm talking about on some deeper level when my background in the roots of language is far more recreational than academic. All's I can say for sure is that The Language Instinct was great fun, beautifully written and an absolute whirlwind of information that covers a dizzying array of unexpected but thought-provokingly relevant subjects.Oh, and that Steven Pinker has the most admirably disheveled hair since Georges Perec. Their locks are not to be trifled with, nor, clearly, are their minds. The last language-centric book I read argued in favor of a point that had been laughed into noncredibility for years thanks to the implied racism it still carried from the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis days, which is that the world actually looks different based on one's view of the world based on his or her culture and language (Through the Language Glass, written by Guy Deutscher and published in 2010 -- and which I must admit to having read long enough ago that I have shamefully forgotten many of its finer details but do recall as having made a rather convincing argument, as it delved into stuff such as how a language can reflect a culture's attitude toward its women) -- an hypothesis that Pinker decried within the first 50 pages of this 1994 bestseller as ""wrong, all wrong,"" as it is his view that ""discussions that assume that language determines thought carry on only by a collective suspension of disbelief."" My copy of The Language Instinct includes Pinker's chapter-by-chapter asides about updates in the many areas he explored in a book he published more than two decades ago, including the neo-Whorfism that has sprung up in recent years, a revival that allowed works such as Through the Language Glass to be taken more seriously because the misguided blinders and red herrings of the linguistic avenue of contemplation have finally fallen away and its points can be made in such a way to sidestep the unfortunate pitfalls of the past.Seeing the inverse of an argument made just as successfully as my initial exposure to it was what sucked me in for good with this book. The overlapping of an argument's two sides and seeing familiar names, familiar backgrounds, familiar failings and completely different conclusions were all strangely rewarding payoffs for my own curious, solitary explorations. And that spark of recognition just kept cropping up in myriad forms as I read on and on (and on and on, as it took me, like, two months to finish this -- absolutely no fault of Pinker's, but rather that of my compulsion to juggle two and three books at once and work's nasty habit of reducing my reading time in two-week cycles). While the biology and neurobiology and child development and abnormal psych were all a bit of alien territory for me, Pinker presented them all in such accessible ways that my tactile-learner self was picking up everything he was putting down. Which made the friendlier faces I'd seen before all the more inviting: The progression of Old English to Middle English to Modern English was like having tea (or mead) with an old friend, reading about the Great Vowel Shift was like reminiscing with an old lover and wondering if maybe the stars are finally aligned in our favor, the uncanny commonalities between seemingly unrelated tongues was a kiddie ball pit wrapped in a trampoline for my brain, and the pages and chapters of grammatical theory? Be still, my pedantic heart! I didn't even mind, as a happily neurotic proofreader, when Pinker started asserting that maybe the Grammar Mavens have their priorities all wrong, that even nontraditional dialects have their merits, that ""whom"" ought to go the way of ""ye"" and its other equally antiquated brethren, that it's okay to hang on to the rules of usage for clarity's sake rather than browbeating those poor folks who don't work themselves into paroxysms of glee at the very notion of sentence diagrams over their truly nitpicky transgressions. I had no idea the lengths and detail necessary in asserting that something so mind-bogglingly complex but is so universally taken for granted -- that is, human speech -- is a deep-seated biological impulse, hard-wired into our brains to the point that we are all, in fact, baby geniuses when it comes to sussing out most of the nuances of our diabolically tricky native languages by the age of three. I had no well-formed opinion on the matter of language as a learned habit versus a communicative imperative instilled in us via evolution before coming into this but did Pinker ever reel me in, hold my attention and make me want to delve deeper into his research, theories and positions regarding the language instinct. Bearing witness to the impressive lengths he goes to to cover all his ground from every angle is reward enough for hearing him out for nearly 500 pages, because Pinker's dedication to the language instinct is evident enough in the miles of homework he did to make his point with armfuls of wide-ranging detail and chapter upon chapter of some truly compelling writing."
3,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1445709-tyas,5,"A friend, a diplomat’s daughter, when asked how she had managed to master Dutch when she went to a school in Suriname, shrugged.“I don’t know. I remember being so confused during the first day, not understanding a single word. But not so long after that, I was able to speak in Dutch. I just spoke, I don’t know how.”That had happened years ago, when she was still very young. We have always wondered how come children are able to learn language easily, while many, if not most adults, find the task of learning a new language bewildering, bordering with the impossible. Plus, children are not just great imitators. If they were, we would only be repeating things our parents had told us when we were small. But we don’t. We don’t just mimic our parents’ words. Something in our neural circuitry does more than just copying; it analyses grammar, it finds for pattern, it composes new combination of words... frighteningly complex processes that, so far, cannot even be matched by the most advanced of AI. C3PO is still a long way to go.The ability of learning language is one of the many subjects covered by the book The Language Instinct, written by Steven Pinker, a psycholinguist in Harvard. (No, he’s not some crazy linguist who enjoys slaying people.)Language is probably the hallmark of human race. We boast our ability to communicate in words, a feature of our culture that no other living forms have. But Pinker shows us that far from being a cultural invention, language is actually an instinct. And because it is, then despite the doubts of the likes of Chomsky, it must be built gradually in the lineages one of which led to us thanks to natural selection. Aiming towards the goal of convincing us about that main point of language being an instinct, Pinker wove an abundance of evidence into this clear, mostly easy-to-swallow book. I said most, because to be frank at times I was lost among a wealth of linguistic terms that I had to crawl through, trying to just grab the general point of some parts.Nevertheless, I like Pinker’s book for dissecting language thoroughly. My favourite part is of course about the language mavens – people who think they have the task to safeguard the purity of language and grammar. Pinker showed us that many instances of ‘ungrammatical’ words or sentences according to those mavens, are actually grammatical according to how our brain works. Very enlightening, especially for someone like me who has for quite some time lost her faith in the tyranny of KBBI and EYD of the Indonesian language. (Our own language mavens, for instance, would waste their sweat telling us that the correct spelling for ‘lembab’ is ‘lembap’, though you understand that both mean the same anyway, and that you may not speak of ‘jam delapan’, but ‘pukul delapan’ instead.)But hey, if this sounds like telling us to ditch our dictionaries and standard spellings and pronunciation altogether, what am I doing, writing something in what, I hope, is a neat piece of review, instead 0f sumth1n l1k3 d33s? (You might even notice that I even care to hit the spacebar twice after a period, but only once after a comma.)Well, when I talk with my sister and brother, or with my bestfriends, sometimes we use words and phrases only we understand. (I wager none of you know what an ‘exedol’ is.) Sometimes we don’t even have to finish our sentences. Our experience together has created specific words and phrases and shaped the language that we use when we communicate with each other. But, when I write something, keeping a general reader in mind, I must be careful to use words and phrases most, if not all, readers would understand, presenting my thought clearly, preventing misunderstanding or confusion (except if that is exactly my intention, but Joyce I am not). Hence my writing style – but trust me, in verbal communication, I might sound very, very different.Language is far more interesting than filling up blanks on a question sheet with the right form of verbs, and Steven Pinker has a way of revealing to us how amazing our language and our brain are."
4,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86946-jessica,4,"I had The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language out of the library for the entire summer. I finally finished it by actively reading it on the train for a couple of weeks. It's interesting, don't get me wrong, it's just LONG and has enough dull/confusing stretches that I couldn't bring myself to read it in my free time - it was pretty much a train-only book.The book's underlying claim is that all human beings are born with something Pinker calls a Universal Grammar, which causes us to acquire language instinctively. Whether we are born into an English or Kinyarwandan or sign-language community affects only the details of our language acquisition - we are wired to understand the way language works.He makes many good points, and I learned a lot from reading this book, but something underlying the text was somewhat disturbing to me (and it's not just the way he seems to revere Noam Chomsky as a god, quoting him earnestly and often, and almost overemphasizing the one point where he disagrees with Chomsky as if to say, ""Look, all you people who think I'm just digesting Chomsky for the masses - I DO have my own thoughts! So there!""). It's that Pinker is 100% an objectivist, believing that our language and culture don't really affect the underlying processes in our minds and that human beings are ultimately the same, whereas I can't see the world without some degree of relativity slipping in, thinking that we are all very very similar and are justified in acting as if we are all the same, but that there are subtle differences that we may not entirely be able to overcome. I think lanugage, at least to a small degree, does affect the way we think and process the world, even if the differences are mostly ones we can see past or work around when talking with others from a different language background.(I laughed every time I turned the book over and saw the quote on the back from William F. Buckley, Jr.: ""Steven Pinker is, I think, engagingly wrong in some of his conclusions, but the operative word here is engagingly. He reminds us of the pleasures of reading about language, provided people like him are at the wheel."")A few details I really enjoyed about this book: Case studies and quotes from people with various neurological disorders affecting their language abilities. The detail to which Pinker addressed sign languages, showing how language acquisition follows the same steps whether it is spoken or gestured (deaf babies ""babble"" with their hands at the same age that hearing babies babble with their mouths). The linguistics primers, which had me making phoneme sounds and sticking my finger in my mouth to see how my tongue and lips were arranged (while on the train!). Reasons why the ""language mavens"" (people who bemoan the decline of English) are often wrong. This is definitely a worthwhile read if you're interested in linguistics but haven't studied much on the topic yet. There's a lot of value in this book, even though some passages do get overwhelmingly dry or pedantic (pages of sentence diagramming scattered throughout the book, for example). I wouldn't recommend it to a casual reader, since I kind of had to will myself to finish reading the book, but I do think I learned a lot for sticking it out. "
5,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew,0,"Steven Pinker and I should be natural enemies. He's a representative of what I consider to be the smarmy, science-precludes-all-else school of hung-up modernist reductionists, while I fly the flag of what he considers to be the wishy-washy, Nietzsche-damaged academic Left. And yet it's difficult for me not to have some respect for his project.When he's not making potshots at relativism(s), he is generally quite lucid and charming, and throughout writes with a clear, approachable logic. By cogitating on the structure of Creole languages and the speech patterns of aphasics, he makes a very, very strong case for a universal grammar. While there are suggestions that certain features of universal aren't present in some languages, it seems to be a reasonable hypothesis. I will say, as an arch-empiricist and an arch-skeptic, that there's a very strong chance that grammatical structures quite likely have a social rather than a strictly evolutionary basis, but the idea is certainly thought-provoking. And, importantly for us moody relativists, he has convinced me (in a way that Peter Singer totally didn't) of the democratic potential of the notion of innate human nature. I do feel that he utilizes a certain circular logic. In Pinker's view, morphemes fit into the framework of syntax, and therefore language is innate. What is a morpheme? Something that fits into the framework of syntax. Also, he largely relies on generalizations rather than universals.Oh, and he claims signifiers are arbitrary, even in the case of onomatopoeia. And yet he tries to claim that certain signifiers are non-arbitrary because we evolved in certain ways. This is just a glaring example that implies, to me, that Pinker used his data to fit his conclusion. Bad science booohissss.But while these problems call into question his work and method, it's still a work I have the utmost respect for, and that everyone interested in language, whether liquored-up French deconstructionist or icy positivist, needs to read."
6,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Previously, I had read Steven Pinker's ""The Stuff of Thought"", which is also an excellent book. I enjoyed that book, so I next read this one--and I'm glad I did. ""The Language Instinct"" is an absolutely fascinating book! The author presents some very convincing arguments, that the acquisition of language is an instinct that has evolved over many generations, through natural selection. Steven Pinker is right on the money, when it comes to his analysis of evolution. Every chapter is compelling, and each chapter investigates language from a different perspective. In both this book, and in ""The Stuff of Thought"", Pinker investigates why so many seemingly irregular word usages are not irregular at all. Often we instinctively use words and phrases that seem illogical, just because ""it sounds right."" Pinker shows the logic underlying the usage--and each time, I just have to say, ""oh-my-gosh--of course!""  "
7,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1107219-jimmy,5,"In The Descent of Man, Charles Darwin wrote, “Man has an instinctive tendency to speak, as we see in the babble of our young children; while no child has an instinctive tendency to bake, brew, or write.” The experimental psychologist, Steven Pinker, took this quote as the inspiration for his book on – what he considers – the idea that there exists an innate language instinct to be found across all cultures. Elaborating on the canonical linguistic ideas of Noam Chomsky, particularly in regard to Chomsky’s Universal Grammar, Pinker presents the lay reader with numerous examples of how language acquisition, grammatical comprehension, and the tendency to speak, are all aspects of an innate linguistic tendency that human beings share, regardless of cultural background or specific language.Though Pinker generally agrees with Chomsky’s work on Universal Grammar, The Language Instinct focuses primarily on the idea that thoughts create language, a mental process that Pinker refers to as “mentalese”. This theoretical linguistic perspective is diametric to that of the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis, which suggests that language determines thought, and that the particular culture one belongs to is unique, in turn greatly affecting the way that a person communicates, utilizes language, and ultimately, perceives the world around them. In Chapter one, entitled “An Instinct to Acquire an Art”, Pinker covers the two opposing linguistic schools, and talks about Chomsky and his research on Universal grammar. Pinker begins his polemic on Whorfian claims about language coloring in human perspective by discussing Chomsky’s skepticism, concerning not merely the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis, but the “Standard Social Science Model” (SSCM) in general. Pinker, siding with Chomsky, feels that, not only is the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis wrong, but the basic intellectual stance that “the human psyche is molded by the surrounding culture”, is a dramatic misconception inspired by the SSCM. However, as we see later in the book, Pinker will part ways with Chomsky, ideologically. Though they both feel that grammar is a discrete combinatorial system; and is also a soundly structured tool with words and rules that human beings have an innate tendency to acquire, Chomsky is apprehensive about whether or not this language instinct, or gene, is part of the process of evolutionary adaptation. Pinker feels that the language instinct is similar to the human eye in that it has the appearance of design. In other words, the eye, for human beings, is a tool engineered with a very specific purpose. It has the appearance of design, and elements of an engineered tool, just like a camera, or an engine. The significant point that Pinker does take from Chomsky’s work is his claim that “the same symbol-manipulating machinery, without exception, underlies the world’s languages.” A chapter by chapter synopsis of a book of such layered complexity would become tedious after chapter 5. Everything from Broca’s Aphasia (which can cause language impairment), to x-bar theory (a theoretical version of phrase structure proposed by Chomsky that compares common grammatical rules and structures across different languages), artificial intelligence, prescriptive vs. descriptive grammar, and language organs and grammar genes, is covered in this erudite defense of Universal Grammar. These examples are useful to Pinker because they assist him in elucidating his rational stance on a language of thought. Logic-heavy gems such as, “And if there can be two thoughts corresponding to one word, thoughts can’t be words”, are peppered throughout the book. When he talks about x-bar theory, he explains how, “A part of speech, then, is not a kind of meaning: it is a kind of token that obeys certain formal rules, like a chess piece or a poker chip.” Pinker’s strongest arguments for a Universal Grammar or a language of thought, primarily concern phrase structure within sentences. Chomsky laid much of the ground on syntactic structures in his linguistic work in the 1960’s. But Pinker sees grammar as a technical aspect of language that “offers a clear refutation of the empiricist doctrine that there is nothing in the mind that was not first in the senses.” So, again, the book is covering a lot of linguistic ground concerning academic debates about what language essentially is, but for Pinker, an unabashed devotee of Darwin, The Language Instinct is also about how language is an innate tendency that undergoes evolutionary adaptive processes. He disagrees with the Whorfians and cultural relativists in the sense that he sees grammatical comprehension and language acquisition as innate tendencies. It’s not that he disagrees with the claim that culture can occasionally influence how people speak, or the way a language sounds. Pinker simply believes that there is a common capacity for speech and language utilization across all cultures, and it’s not that different. Again, he refers to the apparent design of language toward the end of chapter 10, entitled “Language Organs and Grammar Genes”, when he reflects, “I would expect the basic design of language, from x-bar syntax to phonological rules and vocabulary structure to be uniform across the species; how else could children learn to talk and adults understand one another.”  In the academic arena of linguistics, this debate between people arguing that language is an innate instinct and those that feel that language influences thought is slightly less prominent than it was in the past. In example, one of the strongest claims supporting the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis is that the speakers of the Piraha tribe of South America were incapable of using recursion (inserting embedded clauses within sentences ad infinitum) in their language. In 2004, Peter Gordon conducted an experiment consisting of various counting exercises in order to determine whether or not the Piraha were capable of counting exact cardinalities. He concluded that the Piraha had numbers for one, few, and many, but were incapable of remembering large exact numbers. Gordon’s experimental design was relatively crude, and he merely concluded that the Piraha couldn’t count that well under the conditions of the experiment. Since then, the linguist Andrew Nevins, along with his colleagues concluded that Piraha does allow for some recursive embedding using verb suffixes and conversions of nouns to verbs. It is also possible to conjoin propositions within a sentence, such as “We ate a lot of the fish, but there was some fish that we did not eat."" The debunking of linguistic myths such as the apparent absence of recursion in the Piraha language, are concrete proof that Pinker is on to something profound when he suggests an underlying linguistic design in human nature. One might argue that, throughout The Language Instinct, Pinker attempts to insert too many anecdotes from technical linguistics as well as from popular culture. The Language Instinct was one of Pinker’s first popular science books. This onslaught of information is understandable as he is a trained experimental psychologist trying to make technical linguistic explanations understandable to a lay audience. He does so with flying colors. There is also his Darwinist bent, along with the genetic approach to language research, which many traditional linguists (especially academic Whorfians, clearly) might find a little too reductionist. What stands out in this wonderfully informative book is Pinker’s basic, non-threatening theoretical stance that language is part of an adaptive process in nature. There may be notable superficial distinctions across different languages, but the basic structure of language and its apparent design is something that is utilized across all cultures, regardless of location, history, or linguistic origin. For Pinker, culture is not to be devalued or overlooked, but when lost in the cacophonous babel of world languages he opines, “I imagine seeing through the rhythms to the structures underneath, and sense that we all have the same minds.” "
8,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"A highly interesting book about how language came about in the human mind. It gets quite technical at times, but that's an added bonus for anyone who is truly interested in the subject."
9,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,2,"Interesting for its discussion of language and language acquisition. But: too many people take Pinker's word as gospel, when in fact his theories are quite controversial. This book also bears a lot of responsibility for the rise of pop EvPsych. Evolutionary psychology is a field that has a few worthwhile observations mixed with an awful lot of BS used to justify all sorts of learned behavior. So, read this book with a very large grain of salt."
10,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,1,"Pinker is as much of a twit as his hair suggests: The Language Instinct is a miserable pile of unsupported and unsupportable conclusions, straw man attacks, hypocrisy leap-frogging into doublethink, shoddy reasoning, knee-jerk contrarianism, indeliberate obtusity, and gut-feeling argumentation. Pinker tries to synthesize the ideas of people smarter than he is (Chomsky, mostly), and many of these are perfectly fine the way they were originally formulated; they no longer are after Pinker is through defending them, because he understands neither the ideas nor any arguments in their favour.As an example, do you remember the argument Dawkins once made, possibly in The Blind Watchmaker, about how very small changes can accumulate and turn into very significant results in a relatively small amount of time? He used a hypothetical population of mice that grew in average size by one percent every generation, and showed that within a few thousand generations — a mere couple of millennia! — those mice would be the size of elephants. Pinker tries to use this same story to show that small *selection pressures* can have significant results quickly:> ``Imagine a mouse that was subject to a miniscule selection pressure for increased size—say, one percent reproductive advantage for offspring that were one percent bigger. Some arithmetic shows that the mouse's descendants would evolve to the size of an elephant in a few thousand generations, an evolutionary eyeblink.''Which is obviously fractally incoherent, as he would have realised if he'd understood Dawkins's argument instead of just trying to repeat it to try to get a good review by him for the back cover (which he got), or even just tried to do said arithmetic. The sad part is that what he set out to argue is actually true; his bungled argument just undermined it.This is par for the course (there are more egregious examples, but this one stuck because it's Dawkins), and Pinker repeatedly fucks over his main thesis — that language is instinctive, which was as uncontroversial in 1994, when the book was written, as it is now — in the same way. Worse than that, though, he then tries to pretend that arguments in favour of this thesis mean that language is *nothing but* instinctive and, incidentally, uniquely human, and that ``therefore'' everything from linguistic prescriptivism to animal language to Sapir-Whorf to being interested in etymology is completely and utterly wrong-headed and obviously moronic, which he tries to back up by attacking caricatures of these things or, not infrequently, the character of the people involved.Anyway, other people have apparently done thorough jobs of taking apart The Language Instict, so I won't waste any more time on it. Not everything he says is wrong (stopped clocks and all that), and it's a lot like Penrose's The Emperor's New Mind in that some of the digressions are interesting enough, but the signal-to-noise ratio is so pathetically low that the book as a whole isn't worth your time. Read Chomsky instead; Pinker would claim he's saying the same things he is anyway, which demonstrates just how confused he is.Maybe it's just because TLI is his first book. Elsewhere in my to-read stack is his most recent one, The Stuff of Thought; we'll see how it compares. I'm not holding my breath. Ultimately, the problem isn't that he was new to writing, because he wasn't; it's that he's a psychologist, and not a real scientist."
11,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7552897-sebastian,4,"A good portion of this book can be summed up in the relatively simple graph that was making the rounds on Twitter a while back: https://twitter.com/robdrummond/statu.... However, Pinker is a good enough writer that reading about the issue in book-length format rarely feels boring, as he throws about a plethora of interesting examples and anecdotes to illustrate the point. What’s more, the book skips around quite a bit, covering just about every aspect of general linguistics I could think of that actually interests me – how language works, how it was created, how the brain produces it, how various internal and external processes shape it, etc.I do have objections, of course, one of them being that for a book that very loudly proclaims to be about language in general, it retains a strong English-leaning slant – there is quite some talk, for instance, about how English spelling is an optimal system of representing speech vocalizations on paper, which comes off as a really weird claim to someone reared in a writing system with a phonetic alphabet/script (Serbian Cyrillic, and to an extent, Serbo-Croatian Latin).The segment on Chomsky and the structure of deep grammar/mentalese also suffers quite a bit in audiobook format. The narrator really makes an effort, but some of the structures described, while probably quite clear at a mere glance at a hand-drawn diagram, become an impenetrable forest of P(NP)VPs when read out loud.On the other hand, the majority of the objections I saw here, glancing through the comments, boil down to either “boo-hoo, I disagree with his views, therefore this is a bad book” or “Pinker’s presentation is simplistic cherry-picking of straw-man arguments”. Well, one may disagree with what he’s saying, but Pinker does mention very specific sources and research his arguments lean on, and my humble academic experience with some of the opposition to his views leaves me inclined towards aligning with the theories presented herein. As for simplistic? Probably, but this is not a university textbook, so I don’t see the problem. He does what he meant to do, present an overall state of play in linguistics at the time of writing for a more-or-less lay audience. My edition also has a neat addendum at the end, where he looks back after more than a decade has passed, and discusses some of the changes and reactions to the contents of the book."
12,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"When it comes to something I don't know much about, I'm pretty easily swayed by other people's arguments. Like, I finished this book feeling it was pretty intelligent and interesting, and then I read some criticisms and reviews and heck, I don't know what to think. Still, I did find it interesting, and while the book looks deceptively slim for how long it took me to get through it, Pinker expresses his arguments clearly, with examples and sourcing, etc. His basic argument is that we're hardwired for language. That, as with our sight, hearing, etc, we have a 'language sense'; if properly stimulated during the critical period, our brains quickly figure out how to parse language (at least, the language spoken around us when we are at that age, even if that language is sign language). We don't need to hear every word or possible sentence structure (couldn't possibly) to pick up on the rules of grammar and apply them, when speaking and when listening. This only refers to the critical period; a child will learn grammar instinctively on being exposed to a language, but an adult must learn it by rote, in the same way as you have to learn to process visual input during the critical period for that, or you'll never have the same visual acuity as someone who did.Thus far, I think I'm going along with him. I do have questions of a sort of chicken and the egg nature: which came first, the brain's Universal Grammar module, or language that necessitated it? I'm inclined to think that the structures that we now use to understand language were used for something else earlier in our evolution, and became co-opted into our communications array (so to speak) over time. Our brains formed language, and then the language formed our brains...All in all, I don't know whether Pinker's right, but I found his work convincing. Having read a couple of other books on language, including Guy Deutscher's 
Through the Language Glass
, and applying what I know from those too, I find it hard to disagree with Pinker even where I want to, for example about relativism."
13,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2432122-joseph,1,"Given the current divide in linguistics between the Functional/Cognitive theoretical approach to language and the formalist, generative approach which Pinker supports and has largely popularized with this book, The Language Instinct is an intellectually irresponsible endeavor. He frames linguistic nativism as a non-negotiable fact when actually, there is a fierce debate within linguistics which is moving away from ideas of those like Steven Pinker and Noam Chomsky. The opposing school of thought argues that although the cognitive underpinnings of language are innate (having developed in evolutionary time), language itself is more like a new machine made out of old parts, which develops in social interaction and cannot be localized in any set of genes or related to any ""instinct."" Fraught with error, Pinker's pseudo-science is based on an approach that seeks not to fully understand the nature of real language as it exists, as it evolves over time, and as it is acquired by young children - but to rehash a pre-supposed view of language that was developed by ""linguists"" philosophizing as they sat in their armchairs in the 50s and 60s, fundamentally concerned with abstracting language into mathematical elegance rather than recognizing it for the complex system that it is. I highly recommend anyone who found themselves nodding at every turn as they read this book to read Tomasello's response ""Language is not an Instinct"" (to be found in full just by doing a google search). And I quote, ""At heart, Chomskyan nativism is a philosophical endeavor to discern by means of logic what is uniquely and innately human. Cognitive and Functional approaches are scientific endeavors aimed at understanding how people learn and use natural languages."" Couldn't have said it better myself.One star for effort, Pinky-Poo."

15,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1828815-anthony-buckley,5,"I had always supposed that linguists could not write clearly. Rather like psychiatrists who were mad, sociologists who couldn’t get on with people, and social anthropologists who were permanent outsiders, linguists, I supposed, devoted their adulthood overcoming their childhood difficulties with language. Here, however, I discover my prejudices overturned. Considering the inherent complexity of his topic, Steven Pinker’s book on language is witty, lucid and intelligible. Pinker’s theme is that people are born with an inherent capacity – an instinct – that enables them to construct language. In much the same way as they are programmed to learn, at appropriate ages, to walk, to tell jokes and to have sex, so people have an innate ability to learn to speak correctly. Around this central idea – derived from Chomsky’s studies of syntax – Pinker hangs a summary of some of the most important recent ideas in linguistics. The book therefore doubles as a textbook for a first year linguistics student and a good general introduction for a mildly interested beginner (for somebody like me). It is also a polemical book, for Pinker is not afraid to ride hobby horses and proclaim his own vision of the one true linguistics. He delves into the mysteries of Chomskyan deep structure, explaining that the grammar of particular languages are constructed from the inbuilt language-structure that is common to every person and every language. He defies the linguistic relativism associated with the names of Sapir and Whorf. He explains how people and animals think without having a language. He tells the story of deaf children in Nicaragua who were thrown together with older children who knew bits and pieces of sign language from a variety of sources, but who, from these bits and pieces, were able to construct a sign language as coherent as any other. He casts doubt on the supposed ability of monkeys and whales to speak human languages. He explores the biology that explains – or might explain – the instinct for speaking. He opposes those who fight endless wars against the split infinitive, the greengrocer's apostrophe and the final participle, claiming that their own version of English is the only correct one. And he does much more. The book is, in short, informative and intelligent. It is also a lot of fun. I see that a more recent book by Pinker has been nominated for the Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction. Having just read this one, I am not at all surprised. "
16,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5130906-mikael-lind,4,"First of all, I am not a big fan of Steven Pinker. I found How the mind works erroneous on many accounts. That said, The Language Instinct is despite its uncompromising MIT cognitivist stance a fun and interesting read. To me, even the title reveals a general error; i.e. How the Mind Creates Language. The mind does not create language; human beings create language in an inter-subjective way. (Compare: brains do not think (except as metaphorical speech, not suitable for scientific writing) people think.) So be on your guard and do not accept mr. Pinker's arguments without reflecting upon them. This book is full of interesting facts and stories, but I would recommend anyone to pick up a copy of Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations after having read Pinker in order to get a glance of the complicated reality outside the cognitivist nimbus cloud."

20,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8235372-may,5,"I just finished reading the most challenging non-fiction leisure book I have ever read: Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct. It was a close call, but I'm relieved that I powered through.Before I dive into my review, I'd like to clarify that I found it challenging not because my knowledge of linguistics prior to reading this book was terribly basic, but rather because there is so much information packed into The Language Instinct. That is, however, its greatest merit - and the reason why my mind was being blown after every chapter.In The Language Instinct, Pinker argues that humans' ability to acquire language is not dependant on education or imitation. Rather, it's instinctual. It's ""wired into our brains by evolution.""According to Pinker, ""evolution did not make a ladder. It made a bush."" That is to say, Pinker disagrees with Darwin's theory that we evolved from Monkeys.That's why computers will never be able to learn language the way a child could, and also why apes will never be able to speak English or Learn American Sign Language. Indeed, Pinker's research shows that those who claimed that laboratory apes' gestures resembled sign language were actually overanalyzing what they observed.Of course, there are many Darwinists out there who would shake their heads at such a thought (Pinker, however, is pretty convincing). All it would take, however, is the discovery of an evolved trait for an aesthetic, and not pragmatic, purpose, to defy the theory of natural selection.Anyway - because Pinker is trying to prove that language is an instinct, he begins at the roots of language acquisition. There is a lot of research on children. Such research is especially interesting when Pinker discusses 'creoles,' mother tongues that are developed as a result of several languages meshed together. The possibility of such 'meshing' suggests that an universal grammar underlies all language.The existence of a ""universal grammar,"" however, would not wholly verify that language is an instinct. After all, we have words for 'water' not because our DNA dictates it but because we need to refer to water. Neither is there a 'grammar gene - an American-born Chinese can just as easily learn English as his or her American peers. So, it seems that ""complexity in the mind is not caused by learning; learning is caused by complexity in the mind.""The Language Instinct is also in many ways a defense of language. Pinker argues that there is no reason to look down upon primitive dialects because primitive cultures have complex language systems and, after all, a language is also a dialect - just one with ""an army and a navy.""In his chapter on language mavens, a.k.a grammar nazis, Pinker also explains why certain grammatical errors are perhaps even preferable. For example, language mavens will argue that ""Who did you see"" should be ""Whom did you see"" or at least ""Which person did you see"" according to the rules of grammar. Yet can you imagine, Pinker asks, saying something like ""Whom did you sound like?"" Moreover, the final option (""which person"") restricts the 'who' from being an animal or multiple people.The Language Instinct is an enlightening read that leaves reader with a deeper understanding, and growing curiosity, of language. Pinker writes in a clear and sometimes almost conversational way that renders a PhD-worthy subject into one that general audiences can grasp. Of course, certain sections are utterly perplexing and almost impossible to retain. Above all, however, Pinker convincingly presents the thesis that language - contrary to what many believe - is instinctual.As he says, ""this is news."" If language is innate, much more could be; such a revelation would revolutionize the way we consider education, study the human brain and even assess the validity of Darwin's theory of evolution!!Factoids:- We are told that a noun is the most important part of a sentence because it is the doer; however, a noun cannot operate without verb. So, the verb is the boss of a sentence- Mentalese: the hypothetical ""language of thought, or representation of concepts and propositions in the brain in which ideas, including the meanings of words and sentences, are couched.- Listeme: an element of language that must be memorized because its sound or meaning does not conform to some general rule. All word roots, irregular forms and idioms are listemes. - When your tongue is high and at front of your mouth, you'll produce high-frequency sounds (e.g. e in teeny); when your tongue is low and at the back of your mouth, you'll produce low-frequency sounds (e.g. a in large). Now, this is especially fascinating when we consider words such as frobbing, twiddling and tweaking. To frob is to move a dial or switch by drastically adjusting its range; to twiddle is to adjust the switch by a smaller margin; to tweak is to adjust the switch by only a litte. Interestingly, it's always the word with the high front vowel that goes first in expressions such as ping-pong and chit-chat. Hip-hop, flip-flop, the list goes on... - English is an isolating language, meaning that you must say ""to go"" to indicate the act of going somewhere - two units are used to express one definition. The french aller, however, does the deed in one word. "
21,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11962530-krish,5,"Main takeaways:- Language is an innate skill possessed by humans and not acquired artificially through teaching like writing, programming, etc.- Although innate, the skill can be automatically learnt only during the critical period of up to 6 years of age. Beyond this age, it has to be artificially acquired like a second language.- Just one generation of children brought up by adults who speak a ""pidgin"" (a language lacking grammar and consisting of mere words from a number of different languages) is enough to create a ""creole"" (a grammatically rich language which borrows the pidgin vocabulary)- All languages share a Universal Grammar (which is the part of language learning that's probably innate in humans). Each language follows the super-rules of this grammar but has its own values for the variable parameters depending on various cultural and environmental factors. - Rules of grammar are only useful as long as they help resolve ambiguity and enable effective communication among humans. Rules like ""don't end a sentence with a preposition"" and ""use whom instead of who"" are bookishly enforced and serve no practical purpose.- ""English spelling could be better than it is. But it is already much better than people think it is. That is because writing systems do not aim to represent the actual sounds of talking, which we do not hear, but the abstract units of language underlying them, which we do hear."""
22,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24011982-cynda,3,"I so so so wanted to like this book. I took one linguistics class and did a number of rhetoric classes so I thought that I would find this book accessible. I did not. I recognize the Chomsky language trees. I did see why the trees were so important to discuss top and bottom sentences and to prove how all humans are hardwired for language so that babies simply learn if their family speaks top or bottom sentences and SVO or some other construction. Yet all human languaget is obviously human. I get that. I wonder why Pinker wrote such a detailed argument, so detailed that my attention derailed, and I cannot read one more page of this book.So why 3 stars when I seem to hate this book? I do not hate the book. I am frustrated by the details. I plan to retern to this book at a later date and to read one chapter at a time and then put the book away for a month and then repeat the process until I complete the book.

25,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/472694-e,3,"Pinker is entertaining as he explains the basic tenets of language development for laypeople or beginning students of linguistics. He argues that humans do indeed have an instinct for language - for grammar, to be specific - unparalleled in other species, as one-of-a-kind as the elephant's trunk. This instinct driven by nature prevails over environmental or nuturing factors, though one can't take that argument too literally. Obviously, whether a baby speaks English or Zulu is determined by the family and community, but many so-called ""mistakes"" children make in grammar are proof of the brain's perseverance in calculating sentences correctly. My main disagreement with Pinker's argument relates to the beloved pasttime of descriptive linguists to bash ""the language mavens"" - i.e., teachers and writers who criticize certain styles of speech and writing. He is right that language is man-made; it is always changing and always will change. Every big change creates a dialect and no dialect is ""wrong"" or ""right."" Linguists can certainly contribute to socio-political progress in proving that Southern dialect, Ebonics, and the Queen's English are all grammatically consistent and equally rife with potential for creative expression. However, to argue that all languages change and therefore no one should care one way or another what is spoken where or when is dangerously libertine, for it ignores the significance of social subtlety and the value of skilled oratory and writing. If one uses a youth dialect variant at a job interview or a conference with the word ""like"" inserted before every adjective, verb, and noun, ""it will kill the pathos,"" as a professor of mine once said. Likewise, if one uses the Queen's English at a rave, you will be kindly asked to remove the pole from thine ass, and rightly so. Both linguists and writers should recognize that no language is ultimately superior to the other, but that social constructs do dictate what sort of language will be received well in what sort of context and to dismiss these rules is indeed to demonstrate social and aesthetic ignorance and/or arrogance. (See EATS SHOOTS AND LEAVES by Lynne Truss for more on that.)Some professors have dismissed Pinker's book as pop science, whereas others are of course excited about his giving the subject popular appeal. I've taken courses on linguistics, but I'm not a linguist, so I found it to be neither patronizing nor elite."

His premise is that much of what we consider to be learned in our early years as children,through practice with language, is actually pre hardwired in our brains as in an almost universal understanding of syntax that can get laid out in a number of different languages in a number of different ways. That the ways humans have developed to think of the world is inherent in our understanding of this language. I don't know if he made enough ""hard"" or solid arguments for me to buy into this completely. I don't know if he answered fully my objections to his argument. One being that could humans not have been able to pick up on patterns locally in their environment instead of this having to be factored in? The only really good counterargument to this would have been his description of deaf children and their own ""invented"" signs when not taught this initially. I would have like to have heard more of this but was still very impressed overall with the author and what he was trying to accomplish with this work and would definitely pick up another book of his.

31,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell,1,"This review could be long or short. I wasn't sure if I wanted to waste the time, but it's a long book and there are some seriously interesting and seriously stupid things in it. It centers on the issue of language as learned or as instinct, which can be so fine an issue that most people really won’t care. For the short: it's very nice to see so much research on language presented and Pinker does a good job of explaining the often oversimplified theory that there is a genetic basis for understanding language (parts are probably split between your genetic code, but there is no one gene that controls all of it). But there is also some will-meltingly stupid material, like arguments that we can't have standards in our language because we can't judge whale songs and programming a useful speaking device wouldn't include commands like ""don't split infinitives"" because a screwdriver doesn't split infinitives. As he tries to illuminate how the brain creates language, the book is pretty interesting. As he tries to enforce his values, like that we shouldn't have any aesthetic consideration, he's worthless.Okay. That's the short one. Here’s a longer one.Pinker's central argument does nothing for me. That argument is that we have an instinct for creating language. You can construct sentences without thinking about the structure, and even when you babble you have a sense of when to pause for verbal grammar. Think of kids picking up swearing just by hearing it – they aren’t instructed in how to use it, but figure it out logically and intuitively. Since I already believe in this instinct and it seems pretty obvious that we do have it, an argument that it exists isn't impressive, though it was nice of him to collect so many anecdotes and studies that illustrate it to be the case. The best parts of the book are studies that show how versatile people are with language, like children picking up Pidgin or nonsense and converting them, within one generation, into grammatically sound modes of communication.The whole matter is kind of a bunk argument. Either our brains have an instinct for picking up and creating language, or we created languages that our brains are capable of picking up and using. If you think about it on those terms for so much as a minute, you'll get how silly the debate is. At best, both are partially true: we generate and imitate modes of expression that our brains can use readily. From the creation standpoint, why wouldn't we make something that's pretty close to what our brains can handle with unconscious ease? And from the instinct standpoint, why wouldn't we have instincts of some strength or other for the things that are created from inside our heads?Do we think about language or use it unconsciously? It’s obvious that we do both, though we wing it more than we plot it. It’s not an either/or problem, and that Pinker misses this almost entirely is sad. Parents help teach their children and foster language, from obvious examples like imparting the names for things and spelling of words, to what’s been found in recent scientific studies (not in this book) examining mastery of language in children who come from households with differing amounts of speech. Every day you probably struggle for words and consciously choose what to say at least some of the time – you know there is a conscious component to speech. There is unconscious and conscious education that he simply disregards because he's arguing for this instinct. Pinker choosing a side here feels like he's doing it for attention, and it's not as though this is the only time (in this book or academia in general) where it feels like his decision was unnecessary to the pursuit of truth.His side-arguments can get annoying. Sometimes he seems downright condescending on the intelligence of children and the deaf, and often he seems to skim rather than analyze evidence when it suits his arguments. For instance in the case of a Simon, a deaf boy whose deaf parents had improper signing that he did not pick up, Pinker makes serious assumptions about what he must have done with no evidence or even interviews with the boy in question to verify the conclusions. It’s not even anecdotal at that point; it’s conjecture, which does not belong next to the real research on Simon’s case. Conjecture is essential in analysis, but not like this, and not in making the ironclad decisions about the way minds work as Pinker does.By far his silliest argument is in favor of descriptivism over prescriptivism. Descriptivism is the school that describes how people speak; prescriptivism deals with how people ought to. Here, like in the bunk argument over using a language consciously or unconsciously, most intelligent people understand that language functions best when we mediate between the descriptive and prescriptive influences, changing the rules to better suit some things, but sticking to them for others. Being a scientist who observes, Pinker is interested in descriptivism as it shows the most about how we are inclined to speak and act in language. But being foolishly inclined to polar positions, he argues that we ought to only follows descriptivism and does it in downright stupid ways, like saying that we don't need a speaking machine is programmed to ""not split infinitives"" because screwdrivers already don't split infinitives. That’s moronic and if his opposition made a similar rhetorical move he would never allow it. His conclusions are that whatever we “get” by the language instinct should make up all the prescriptive rules, and that whatever we don’t make should constitute the rest. You know, in the way that we eat whatever tastes good, think whatever we like regardless of objective evidence and live in total anarchy without any government. Okay, those three examples are stupidity on my own part, but that’s what this pure-descriptive argument deserves. It comes from his oversimplified approach to language cognition, at first pretending that people don’t think or act in their education of language, and now proceeding that we shouldn’t think about how we’re going to use it or apply intentional value. That he quotes a Shakespearian character in defense his of anti-prescriptive campaign when that author taught writing seals the deal.Now before Pinker's fans get angry over the rating alone, if you hold your mouse button over the stars you see that each correlates to a statement. One star means ""I didn't like it,"" and for the fascinating research in the book, Pinker became too annoying and questionable at too many points for me to like his book. So it gets one star because, you see, they have prescribed meaning and are not just whatever you want them to be."

34,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185000-jon-stout,4,"In this very entertaining book, Steven Pinker has given a kind of overview and popularization of contemporary linguistics, as developed by Noam Chomsky. He argues that there is a language instinct, developed through evolution, which shapes how any human being acquires language. This is in opposition to the idea that we are blank slates, perhaps very intelligent blank slates, who learn everything from our environment and our culture. The Chomskyan idea is that all human languages have certain basic structures, such as noun phases and verb phrases, which small children seem to understand even as they acquire their native language. These structures are innate, according to Chomsky and Pinker, and are part of an instinct or natural capability for language which results from evolution.Pinker engages in a wide-ranging discussion of language which covers everything from phonetics, the inventory of raw sounds that are available to the human larynx, to language mavens, the self-described experts on language who want to be the arbiters of good grammar. I found the whole discussion fascinating, and I am trying to internalize the basics of Chomsky’s approach, so that I can go on to read some more technical linguistics.A couple of issues engaged me. One was the debate between a prescriptive approach to language and a descriptive approach, between those who argue that there is a grammatically correct way to speak (the way we ought to speak), and those who say that linguistics only describes how people actually use language. Pinker inveighs against the prescriptivists, saying that even small children have an instinct to use appropriate grammatical structures. He makes fun of the shibboleths of grammarians, such as not splitting infinitives, offering in each case an argument as to why the supposedly ungrammatical phrase exhibits an inherent grammatical sense.I’m not sure the boundary between prescriptive and descriptive approaches is so clear. If I am learning Spanish, say, then I want to know the rules for when to use the subjunctive. Those rules are normative, prescriptive, for me, even if there is some logic to whatever mistakes I make. Pinker could say that the rules are normative only in a hypothetical sense, that they are contingent on my wanting to speak like a native. But of course I do want to speak any acquired language, or my own language, as well and as effectively as possible. So, for practical purposes, grammar can be prescriptive as well as descriptive.Another bone of contention actually occurs between Pinker and Chomsky. Pinker argues that our language instinct is based on evolution. Chomsky has said that scientific factors other than evolution may have determined how we acquire language. To explain Chomsky, Pinker offers the example of a fish jumping out of the water and diving back in. Evolution may have developed the capacity to jump out of the water, but gravity determines that the fish will return to water. A linguistic example might be that acoustics, more than evolution, may have determined the inventory of sounds available to use in language. Pinker seems puzzled by Chomsky’s point, and specifically disagrees with it.My take is that there may be logical constraints on how language is acquired. Logic is a kind of science, like mathematics, but different from the empirical sciences. The grammatical structure of languages may have something in common with the logical structure of arguments. Perhaps there is no logical alternative to sentences containing a noun phrase and a verb phrase. If that is the case, then to that extent the constraint on language is logical and not evolutionary, although of course the two work hand in hand. I will have to read more to discover if my interpretation of Chomsky is plausible."
35,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1637858-dave-maddock,4,"Wow, a fair number of angry 1-star reviews of this book here on Goodreads. I suspect these are anti-Chomskyites or bitter social scientists who didn't like Pinker's criticism of relativism in the final chapter. Or possibly, johnny-come-latelys who are carrying over their critique from his later book, The Blank Slate. As a pop-sci overview of modern linguistics (ie. the whole point of the book), this is excellent.Some random thoughts on criticism: Within the field Pinker certainly has staked out his own position as a defender of many of Chomsky's ideas (Chomsky the brilliant linguist, not Chomsky the idiot leftist tool), but the only reason to whine about that and give 1-star is if you aspire to be the ideologue you claim Pinker is. After all, these ideas are fundamental to the field and this is a very well-written book. As it happens, I agree with Pinker's views but to prove I don't review along party lines like one of these jackass whiners, check out my review of The Mismeasure of Man where I take heat for defending Gould despite not swallowing his relativism wholesale. (Incidentally, Pinker criticizes Gould several times herein.) I think Pinker does an admirable job trying to transcend false dichotomies like nature vs. nurture, which is why it annoys me so to see such ignorant reviews criticizing him for doing the opposite."
36,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3719712-kevin,3,"Yes, this book has grammar trees breaking sentences down like you did in school. No, it doesn't hurt that much.Pinker shattered for me the conventional wisdom (for which he partially blames the Newspeak essay at the end of 1984) that language determines thought—""Mentalese"" is real. His tour of Chomsky's universal grammar and how the world's languages all share a similar underlying structure kept me rapt with the particular deconstructionist fever I sometimes get when programming. My assumptions about how much languages around the world differ also got exploded.The last third drags a bit when we go on a tour through both English's aphoneticism(?) and it's all its local dialects' various disregard for ""the rules,"" all to prove a point he hammers home over and over—that people use grammar with a higher degree of precision than most people give them credit for. He also leans a bit on the fact that engineers hadn't even imagined how computers might succeed in a real way at things like image recognition and generalized problem solving as evidence that the brain must have some very specific machinery to do so—a more difficult link to accept in the age of Google's burgeoning omniscience.There's also a clear lack of biological evidence for the kinds of structures we inherit genetically that he's positing play specific roles in parsing and constructing grammatical sentences, but that's not the fault of the science author talking about the bleeding edge of research—now I'm curious what more we've learned in the 20 years since!"
37,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215202-mark,3,"A book that tells you all that you might want to know about how humans are able to communicate with language. Pinker praises the work of Chomsky and tries to show that the fundamentals of language are built into the human mind, an instinct that is refined by our natural surroundings. He gives many examples of a fundamental grammar that all humans speaking whatever language have, which they use to organize sentences in their own language even if the sentence structures of two different languages are very unlike on another. He uses Darwin’s theory to show how language has evolved. Part of the book explains how sounds are made, while another explains as much as we know about how the brain forms sentences. One of his most interesting chapters shows that experts in a language that lay down the rules of grammar are no more experts than 5 year olds who converse with each other because language itself is ever changing. Many “rules” are no more relevant than if we kept the rules of old English. In fact he shows how these “experts” make rules that are counterintuitive to the language instinct. Overall the book is a bit technical at points particularly with his endless diagrams of sentence structure in the first half of the book, but Pinker does a very good job of explaining the intricacies of language to the masses."
38,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"(Based on the highly abridged audiobook.) Pinker's lively popularization of Chomskyan linguistics and cutting edge cognitive science elucidates the best available evidence for a ""universal grammar"" of the mind. (It is useful to remember, however, that this book was written in the 1990s.)Pinker's attempts at psycholinguistic theory are often quite amateurish and crude, since he clearly doesn't have in-depth knowledge of the field. His computational model of the mind, as well as his belief in the ""language of thinking"" (what he calls ""mentalese""), are somewhat mechanistic and lacking in data. But the overall project is a vital one, and the ease with which Pinker employs quotations from popular culture and Shakespeare to spice up his survey of the sciences is very ""edutaining."" The importance of making science fun is overlooked by many thinkers, who think that dry facts should do the talking. But how can we hope to convince people if we cannot even keep them awake? When a brilliant mind manages to synthesize decades of research, and make the reader enjoy the process of learning, the result is nothing short of mesmerizing."
39,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies,4,"Very interesting, as with previous Steven Pinker books I have enjoyed, the author displays his admirable ability to gather together a lot of research/information in a wide range of areas into a coherent explanation - here supporting an innate human instinct to acquire and use language. Full of illustrative examples, apparently fair and balanced, well-constructed arguments here provide a convincing case without feeling biased or unjustly critical of counter arguments.My only criticism would be that I would have been convinced by a book half the length of this. It wasn’t necessarily over-long or difficult to get through, it just felt in places that certain aspects (the algebra and logic of linguistics especially) were examined in more depth than was necessary. Perhaps I needed less explanation and fewer examples than some readers, perhaps the author just wanted to speak at length about aspects he found particularly interesting, it detracted slightly from my enjoyment. Nevertheless I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this to anyone interested in the field. "

With each book we read, each conversation we have similar events take place. It is a process that most of us take for granted but try, for a moment, to imagine a world in which language didn't exist. What would we have lost?Steven Pinker is a genius, alongside Noam Chomsky and Stephen Hawking. His literary style is dense and required much concentration to penetrate but once I had resolved this conflict I was entranced and captivated by the world he showed me. Did a scientific explanation of language acquisition remove the wonder? No, it made it more intense and even more precious."

Not exactly light reading, though Pinker's dry humor makes it fun. His basic premise is that language is an evolutionary adaptation of humans to communicate information, just like wings are an adaptation of birds to fly, or gills for a fish to breathe underwater. For that I think he makes the case well. He's also very much anti-cultural relativism (one of my favorite quotes is: ""I hate relativism. I hate relativism more than anything else except perhaps fiberglass power boats."") I suspect he's exaggerating the point to make a point, but that makes it a much richer topic for debate, yes? If you love words, from how they feel in your mouth to the deep structures of grammar, you'll enjoy this book."

But I enjoyed the tone of the book, the methodical way the author explained his ideas, supporting them with examples and citations. He's also made Chomsky far more palatable than when we learned about his theory in class. "

I remember enjoying it a lot and finding the material utterly fascinating. When I was in college I wrote a major paper for a graduate seminar that was a review of the research into communication and language development in primates up to that time. When I read this book I truly enjoyed catching up with 20-some years of research and thinking on the topic of language acquisition. "

"
45,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33437121-tony,2,"Bit late to the discussion. The only question left to ask is one I’m not really qualified to answer: how well has the book aged over a decade and a half of psycho- and comparative linguistics? I’m not a linguist, but I know enough basic biology to sort the wheat from the chaff in a popular science book. Omit the chapters titled Grammar Organs and Language Genes, The Big Bang, and Mind Design. The general reader has probably forgotten more high school biology than these chapters rightfully explain. Besides, talk of a “language or a grammar gene” written before the important work in comparative molecular evolution of FOXP2 (read: Evo-Devo, Deep Homology and FoxP2: implications for the evolution of speech and language) and genomics in general is simply uninformative. Aside from that Pinker fails in his endeavor to wed evolutionary biology to a theory of a Universal Grammar. Instead, he summarizes a few basic concepts throughout these chapters—comically disparaging Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin as mere paleontologist and a geneticist in the process—and assumes the reader will make the logical leap to a grammar gene. Another tired chapter on the state-of-the-science of voice recognition machines can be summed when Pinker asks ""So why is it that a nation that can put a man on the moon cannot build a computer that can take dictation?"" As Tecumseh Fitch has it ""... discussion of the evolution of language often involve more speculation than data."" Symptoms of an unhealthy science. The Language Instinct draws two conclusions: language is unique to our lineage and there exists something called a universal grammar. It must be somewhat unusual that though Pinker’s ideas in this book are “deeply influenced” by Chomsky, Pinker is far better known to undergraduates, graduates and the general public (Richard Dawkins and WD Hamiilton are another example, I guess). The notion being Chomsky’s academic writing is unapproachable. That’s not to say readers won't encounter hurdles to understanding in this book. Pinker’s attempts at levity via popular culture quotes are as distracting as they are entertaining. His examples of grammar and syntax, which bulk up what should have been a slimmer text, are often so excessive and repetitive I’d lose the thread. One of these threads is that seemingly arbitrary regularities that occur in the English language (“John and I” over “Me and John”) are actually innate mechanisms instead of a transient cultural trend. Alternatively, he makes a convincing argument against a Pleistocene Ur-language. The good news, however, is that the author of a book on linguistics writes clearly and succinctly. The bad news is that Pinker does arrogant too well. The natural inclination to posturing in a non-fiction book is that it invites a death by a thousand cuts approach to a critique. For such a thick book (now with four throwaway chapters!), we are rewarded with intuitive arguments driven more by anecdote than data. This predicates explanatory imprecision and conceptual wrong-headedness. A chapter in the midst of all this, The Language Mavens, lively and satisfying, seems to foretaste Pinker’s 2014 book “Sense of Style: The Thinking Person’s Guide to Writing in the 21st Century.” As unreceptive as I am to Pinker’s posturing and condescension—all virtues for an anti-prescriptivist manifesto!—I now must read that book. "
46,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10769886-michael-noes,4,"I came for the science, but stayed for the linguistics jokes.In this book Steven Pinker challenged two related assumptions that I’d previously made about language: firstly, that the mechanics of one’s particular language must have a significant effect on their perception and understanding of the world around them (after all, we think and perceive largely in the context of our language, right?), and secondly, that without exposure to language we would “think” and “perceive” in some way that is quite different than what we could now imagine. Building on the work of Chomsky, Pinker argues against these notions, attempting to demonstrate that the languages we speak are more similar to each other, and innately reflective of our inner mental workings, than we might have realized. In other words, our brains determine our language (and not the other way around) because we are wired to develop in our thought and communication patterns in a certain way.Pinker explores the overlap shared by fields fascinating on their own (linguistics, neuroscience, psychology, human development), at times supporting his points with a microscope (down to the interactions between synapses) and at times using broad observations about the history of language’s usefulness for us as a species. A charming and informative book for anyone who does not find it a bore to think about thinking, read about reading, or talk about talking."
47,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,3,"This book is very similar to many others in the genre, such as John McWhorter’s The Tower of Babel, Guy Deutcher’s The Unfolding of Language, and Bill Bryson’s The Mother Tongue, all of which I’ve rated very high. But Pinker gets more credit for being one of the earliest in the genre, and he goes into more depth about the neuroscience behind language. In fact, this book covers an exhaustive range of topics, from Chomskyan linguistics, language processing, artificial intelligence, neurobiology, psychology, evolution, philosophy, politics, and prescriptive grammar. His expertise in all these topics is impressive, and he makes a very persuasive overall argument – that the human mind has built-in modules for specific language-related functions, rather than being born with general purpose hardware that is programmed by its environment. However, this book just didn’t hook me the same way John McWhorter did. He covers so many topics so quickly that it’s hard to get into it. He does give entertaining examples, and style is swift and humorous, but he fell just short of satisfying me. I guess it’s like having a cup of coffee with one cube of sugar, after getting used to coffee with two cubes. It feels like a tease. Some of the topics he covers deserve a whole book, and in fact, he does have books about those topics – How the Mind Works, The Blank Slate, The Stuff of Thought, Words and Rules, and others. I will definitely be reading them."
48,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/342436-chris-friend,4,"This one was recommended to me by Ben, and he was spot-on in thinking that I would find it both interesting and enlightening. I cracked open the book thinking that it was going to be just another discussion of linguistics, but it ended up dealing a heckuvalot more with neurology and human behavior, drawing particular attention to the interesting tendencies that we humans have built-in for the construction, use, and comprehension of spoken language.The author seems quite fair in his broad-based approach to dealing with a wide variety of subject areas and approaches -- it was impressive how often sign language was used as a reference. (Side note: I found it particularly surprising to hear a linguist give so much credit to the design, style, and mentality of ASL. Taking a couple courses in the language in college, I was vaguely aware of the specificity of its grammar, but I had no idea it literally impacted the human brain the same way audible speech does.)In contrast to the Ramachandran book I recently read (and despised), this text found a great balance between examples, scientific terminology, and illustrations/explanations/examples in layman's terms. It was both approachable and informative, something I'm not accustomed to finding in a nonfiction book.Definitely worth looking into. Chad's getting it next -- this is right up his alley."
49,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5892502-katya-epstein,4,"Probably the best book I have read on the topic. For starters, Pinker's writing is a pleasure to read: It's clear, clever, and affable. He writes the way he talks; he doesn't seem to feel the need to use fancy words just because he's writing a book (e.g. from the glossary entry for stem: ""The main portion of a word, the one that prefixes and suffixes are stuck onto."" He avoids that (inexplicable) academic affectation of pretending that the author and the reader don't exist (i.e., avoiding the first and second person).And he covers more than just language itself: This book is also a not-bad introduction to evolution, genetics, the brain, and cognitive psychology. Lots of interesting stuff here.That said, I was not completely convinced by all of his explanations (I still don't understand ""trace"") and arguments (I'm not convinced that the ability to read and write is not hard-wired to some extent in some people). And it was published in 1994: A lot has been learned since then about how the brain works, so some of his info might be out of date. Also the index leaves a lot to be desired."
50,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Pinker breaks through the superficiality of language to touch on something deep inside all of us.He gives a language lesson that isn't boring at all.I have been reminded in my daily life of many observations made in the book.The thesis of the book is simple and well defended throughout:Human language is an instinct.Vague aspects of human language, like communication and symbolism are common in the animal kingdom.But each different human language is a quirky, fanciful creation.And the drive to generate these languages is instinctual.To my glee, Pinker demonstrates stupidity of ""linguistic determinism"".He also defends the sensibility of English spelling, and legitimacy of Ebonics grammar.He does a bit of underhanded trash-talking to so-called ""language mavens"".It's nice to clear up linguistic mistakes, but he might have gone a little too far by naming names and levying insults.But if I were him, I'd probably be frustrated, too.Most importantly for me, I found myself trusting Pinker for his constant practice of backing up his claims with solid evidence, usually in the form of multiple language examples or simple try-it-yourself language experiments."

(It's a sort of semi-parody of the first sentence of the book).Let me tell you this. When a bunch of reviews say that a book is funny, it turns out I never laugh. I did not laugh reading Don Quixote, Catch-22, or even Mark Twain's stuff. So, you can say I am a humorless jerk. And, it just so happens that the first book I actually laugh out loud at is a book about linguistics, of all things.And, just because a book is a popular science book does not mean you're going to find some 14-year old reading this book. Yet, somehow, I'm 14, I somewhat like science, and I read (and really loved) this book. I must admit that language is  definitely  something we're all fascinated by, yet we can never get satisfactory answers for our questions about language. After all, this is science we're talking about, and science can never really end because the things nature has dreamed up of are so complex, yet so purposeful."

First of all, it is way too long and technical to qualify for the usual pop science non fiction. Steven Pinker would definitely benefit from the good editor (unless this was deliberately done to provide hefty volume for more money). There are very few groundbreaking theories or ideas here, just the repetition on and on of the same ones. The author likes to introduce certain idea, then provide evidence based on different (almost all anecdotal) examples: babies, deaf people, people with injuries and other diseases of the brain. And this pattern is repeated throughout the book. Also, that is most frustrating, numerous grammatical rules and structures are explained ad nauseam to illustrate whatever theory he is trying to push. You feel that author tries to literally hammer his ideas into it with all the available force of boring grammar rules. I forgot to mention that this is an excellent sleeping aid!

I was looking mainly for the information about how the language evolved and how it is still evolving - and there's plenty of that in the book, too. I really enjoyed it. It is well written and entertaining, but it is also quite often unnecessarily long, at least for a pop-science book. I get the point after a few examples, and I was getting tired with reading through dozens of long passages, all presenting the very same mechanisms and all proving the very same points.

Highly recommended.3 Jan 2015 update: After speaking with a person who has done a lot of work in computational linguistics (thanks Bob) and examining some of the central claims in this books more carefully, I must admit that I am no longer persuaded by Pinker's arguments.

I get that some nuance must be subtracted when technical information is summarized so that outsiders can understand it. But he so frequently speaks in black-and-white terms that I find it difficult to trust his analyses. Sometimes he almost sounds like he's giving a pitch, like he's trying to sell science because he's worried it will disappear otherwise. The book certainly has panache, but in the end I think it would have been more convincing if Pinker were not so allergic to words like ""perhaps,"" ""almost,"" ""sometimes,"" and ""on the other hand.""

It was a bit dated in places, but I think all that really suffered was the pop culture references and examples. The theory and research examples held up.I enjoyed how the author gave examples and explained theories that were broader than language to put his language thesis in context. I did not particularly enjoy how the author gave 15 examples for each type of phrasing he was referencing. I get it after one or two. I was listening to an audiobook version, so instead of skimming the text after he started in on the repetitions, I listened, feeling silly when my family walked in to a recording of a guy just saying random sentences.Though the book was first published in ~94, the version I listened to had an update that acknowledged the passage of time and updated affected chapters."

All human beings possess an instinct to acquire, use and comprehend language. We do so by employing our innate combinatorial cognitive system - the same system that lets us navigate through the world.Pinker takes the reader on a reading mission through grammar, morphology, phonetics, language pathologies, language & thought, anthropology, biology & evolution, and much much more. At times, it may stray a bit too far from the main point - our language instinct - but these paths lead to interesting topics that I would not have considered, had I not read this book.I rate it 5 out of 5 stars thanks to its vocabulary, insightful explanations and ways of conveying information about language and cognition, and its scope - covering a wide range of interesting topics."

An added bonus is that I'm starting to suspect a lot of the material for the linguistics course I'm taking this semester seems to have been lifted directly from this book...It's a fun read.

Some parts of this book were a little thick to get through (and my BA is in Linguistics). I remember it being more accessible the first time I read it and I wonder if I somehow got my hands on an expanded edition (I read it on my Kindle this time so it would be hard to tell if it's thicker than the edition I read before).Still a great book, though.

Although for the life of me, I can't remember what they were now. Maybe that Eskimos don't really have 1,000 words for snow?

86,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32043273-ellery,1,"This book was absolutely insufferable but before I get into it let me first be up front that I only read closely chapters 1-6, read quite quickly chapters 7-8, and then skimmed through chapters 9-13. After you read this review, you'll understand why I had no choice but to skim through the second half.As a language lover, a teacher of English and Chinese, and a speaker of English, Chinese, and German, it's been on my reading list for a long time. I finally got around to reading it and after reading just a few chapters I was astounded that this is a best seller. Pinker continually makes enormous claims that aren't adequately backed up. Continually, he bounces around from one assertion to the next without any coherency. His overall writing style comes off as pseudo-academic, to be frank. Pinker constantly mentions Chomsky in virtually every single chapter. Ironically, Chomsky doesn't think much of Pinker. If you listen to his interviews on Youtube, Chomsky has some somewhat strongly worded things to say. He describes him as ""intelligent,"" ""a friend,"" ""who has done serious work in psycholinguistics and cognitive science,"" but beyond that, Chomsky just contrasts what can be made of the gobbledygook Pinker produces with others who have done ""serious work."" That's a real damning review from Chomsky. However, the main reason I couldn't seriously closely read the second half of the book was because of inaccuracies; I feared I would be learning incorrect information. He mentions the Chinese language several times in the first half dozen chapters, and a majority of the time is just flat out wrong. He writes, ""English speakers correctly guess that in Chinese ch'ing means light and ch'ung means heavy."" Not using pinyin aside, that's just flat out not true. Depending on not only the tone but also the character, the meaning of the utterance can change completely. It gets worse. A couple chapters later, he writes, ""In some ways, a morphemic writing system has served the Chinese well, despite the inherent disadvantage that readers are at a loss when they face a new or rare word."" Readers are hardly ""at a loss"" because characters are made up of different radicals that can tip one off to the meaning. But Pinker doesn't know that because he hasn't actually learned any Chinese. (In fact, he hasn't learned any foreign languages.) He goes on, ""and many documents that are thousands of years old are readable by modern speakers."" This is absolutely shocking because it is in no way true. Texts from thousands of years ago are nothing like modern Chinese. Classical Chinese is not understandable to modern speakers of Chinese. They have to learn it just like how native speakers of English would have to learn Old English if they wanted to understand it. It is for all intents and purposes a completely different language even if there are a few remnants of Classic Chinese in modern Chinese. It is amazing to have such an enormous oversight in a best seller and from someone so famous. This is the main reason I had to stop reading the book closely and just skim the rest. I can't really take seriously anything else he says in the book given these massive oversights about Chinese. Naturally, my fear is if he's so flat our wrong about almost everything he says about Chinese, how am I to believe other claims he's making about things I'm not educated about?To return to what I was saying about style, I should mention there's also no important context to the mentions of Chinese in those chapters. He bounces around randomly writing about different examples and never ties in the important pieces to really say anything interesting. I keep asking myself ""But why should I care about this?"" Sometimes chapters would end and it just seemed like he got bored and stopped writing there randomly. I assure you this is not because of my own lack of intelligence, although I am sure Pinker fans would be quick to make that claim. Rather I think it's because Pinker is a stylist. He's a master at seeming brilliant, when in reality, it's mostly hogwash presented as valuable insight.I will admit that there is a possibility that I am also simply not interested in the math and science of language. I am much more interested in how it is acquired, how we can learn it better and more quickly as adults, problems in the FL classroom, TPRS and Krashen's comprehensible input theory, and other topics. Musings about random linguistic related topics that really just make your eyes roll isn't something I'm interested in reading. So I do take responsibility for what I like and the style of writing and presentation I personally care for. That is indeed subjective. I could see how this style of writing would appeal to others. That said, the inaccuracies are too numerous and so you can't really recommend this book to anyone.I have to warn people considering reading this book. It is essentially pop science littered with false information. But don't take my word for it. Just trust Chomsky. He did, after all, imply that Pinker's books are not ""serious work."""
87,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"I think this took me long enough.In my defense, I'm kind of stupid.So he's convinced me that humans have a language instinct. And it's not arrogant, it's just objective observation in the same way that one might observe that bees have an instinct for understanding waggle dances.I also like all the take downs of prescriptive grammarians who think knowing about splitting infinitives and ending sentences in prepositions makes them better than everyone else, because I'm petty and insecure, so I can't wait until my brother corrects me for saying ""everyone got their dinner,"" and when he says ""his or her dinner,"" asking him to correct, ""I served everyone dinner before you even seated them.""My one teensy-weensy niggle, and it's more in the spirit of science - when someone lifts their hypothesis up, anyone and everyone is duty-bound to take shots at it - is that while I agree he showed humans have a language instinct, I feel like he also claimed no other animals do. And his discussion of that is that we look at chimpanzees and bonobos, expecting to find similarities in everything, even though our most recent common ancestor is maybe ~7mya. He compares it to elephants with their incredibly talented noses looking tirelessly for similar rudimentary talents in tapirs or whatever extant animal elephants are most closely related to.What's the problem? Nobody said that because the most closely related living animal doesn't have it, you're unique. Alex, that damned bird, understood a thing or two, and his most recent common ancestor with us lived in the Triassic or late Permian. I'll grant it's nothing like our complexity, but noun plus verb = grammar. And adjectives tied to nouns are noun phrases. What that animal was doing revealed something going on in his mind that could map sound labels to meaning in groups. That's language. Or proto-language. Or something. I mean, he was constructing original combinations to get what was inside his brain into somebody else's!So debunking Koko (I yield to Pinker, because I honestly don't know enough about Koko's signing to know if the many skeptics or the many believers were right) doesn't disprove non-human language. Granted, it's easy to take the non-falsifiable position that ""nobody has shown non-human language doesn't exist,"" so I will take the slightly more falsifiable position that at least some birds can apply abstract labels to meaning in noun and verb combinations. That crosses the threshold for language, IMO.And I think it makes sense, evolutionarily, since bird calls apparently accomplish a lot in a bird's life. Species identification, individual identification, tribal identification, alarms, etc.Omigod. Dinosaurs can talk."
88,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34358091-fred-gr-n,5,"Having a master's degree in linguistics, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what linguistics is about, while keeping in mind that this is of course not exactly a linguistics textbook since the author is taking a stance. Unlike a linguistics textbook, though, it is incredibly pleasant to read. I really enjoyed the way in which Pinker takes you on a ride through all the most important and the most interesting questions of the field. I think it's an excellent book to promote linguistics and it makes you realise - or reminds you of - how incredible language is even though we tend to take it for granted. I'm also grateful for this book's contribution to dispelling widespread myths about language like strong Whorfianism, absurd prescriptive rules or the incoherent views of ""language mavens"". Thank you Steven Pinker for stepping in! If you really wanted to study linguistics on your own, though, you'd have to go for a proper introductory textbook. Also, if you're looking for a scholarly book about innatist theories of language, this book is not for you. It is more of a fun (but serious) introduction to linguistics through an innatist lens.One of the most common criticisms I've heard of is that Pinker is presenting his views as ""fact"" when they are in fact quite controversial. I don't agree... Most of what appears in this book is what you'd learn in a linguistics 101 class and it is not Pinker's responsibility to make sure his readers are competent enough to notice that he is sometimes taking a stance and sometimes just explaining the state of the art. In the former case he's using arguments and in the latter just stating facts and I think the difference is clear. This book is called ""the language instinct"" so, yes, it argues that language... is an instinct. There are countless references for each chapter at the end of the book. If you want to further investigate the question, just go for it. You may criticise Pinker's theory (many linguists have) but claiming he is ""presenting controversial views as facts"" is, in my opinion, an unwarranted accusation."
89,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70100482-zo,4,"Informative and entertaining. Can get a little repetitive or tedious at times, especially on minutia of linguistic/anatomical information, but also has some sections that are great for stimulating thought about the nature of the human mind & language. The book didn't probe the philosophical complexities of the relationship between cognition/language and the origins of language as deeply as I'd hoped, but I'm unsure if that's the books defect or due to a correct assessment of what has real epistemic grounding. I am very curious to hear about criticisms of the book and how the science has changed/updated since its publishing. Instead of the more philosophical approach the book abounds in fun/quirky details about various aspects of language usage. I particularly enjoyed the section commenting on typical ""grammar Nazi"" tirades. My favorite sections were probably speculating on the origins of language and some of the information on the developmental psychology of language learning. Would like to learn more about how the ""modularity"" of language contributes to its relation to cognition, and how it could fit in with an account of consciousness like Carruther's (this is where I think more ""deep"" questions arise). "
90,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17876442-brandy-cross,4,"There's not much to say here except that quite a bit of it is technical, you have to like or at least agree with some of Chomsky's work, and have some ability to look at ideas with an open mind and consciously recognize that an idea can be great but also not necessarily the full picture. Whether or not you (or I) agree with the stated hypothesis is another question entirely, but it doesn't much impact the fact that this is enjoyable and interesting to read. The Language Instinct is a passionate romp through the fields of cognitive science, evolutionary psychology, genetics, behavior, and language. It's fun to read because the author loves what he's writing about and he's done his research and highlighted it where it supports his hypothesis. The language is excellent, the research is wonderful, the approach is neither over-complex nor oversimplified, and Pinker remains that excited little boy with an idea, desperate to get it all out on paper in that charismatic way that only very excited people with an idea can do. If you discount the fact that I see Pinker's hypothesis as one-side of an argument, and far from the complete picture, this is an excellent book. "
91,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18061078-emma,5,"This was a great book overall and cleared up a lot of questions for me, especially about the objective differences between language and general learning or general communication. My main complaint was that he seemed to be totally uninterested in analogous traits and only cared about homology in language. That's like someone who studies flight only caring about insect wings and having no interest in vertebrate wings even though they show that some vertebrates are under selection pressures that favor flight and that they developed an ability similar to insect flight but with vertebrate limbs and physiology. And personally I'm almost more interested in analogous linguistic features. If some non-primate or non-mammal lineage has linguistic capabilities, who cares if it didn't evolve from the third convolution in the Sylvian fissure in the left hemisphere?? A non-homologous source of language would be MORE interesting than a homologous one, not less! "
92,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54757979-krocht-ehlundovi,5,"Thanks to my colleague, I got to this book. I did not know anything about language and biological processes before, and now I got an interesting insight. I cannot say I understood everything - well, even in Slovak language I would have problems, it is already ling time I left school desks. But why not to explore unknown areas, why not to learn something new. ""To learn"" hence I got a new perspective. On the other side, the content challenged my mind, my thinking, and my imagination - I was running all concepts and mechanisms in my mind, and that was fascinating. I had no idea that we can look at the language in this way. It is shocking and enriching in the same time. I have still problems to voice what I have got, I will need more of these works to get a clearer picture of what is going on with language. Still, I really enjoy it. I must buy the book to be able to check some parts and views. It is a completely new universe, and the awesome one. I am grateful that I have such people around me who always show me something new and that they keep my mind alert and busy. "
93,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30664790-karnok,1,"Interesting but also immensely frustrating.This is one of the most frustrating books I've ever read (listened to, technically).On the plus side, it reminded me of how deeply interesting language is and how closely it's connected to thoughts, consciousness and even the nature of reality itself. I was surprised to gradually realise how many theories I myself have already formed over the years without having ever explicitly stated them or even been aware. And yet, even with the many insights I feel I've stumbled upon over the years, language has always remained mysterious to me, just out of reach. In that sense, this book was very good at prodding in interesting new directions.But at every turn, this book seems to go in the shallowest direction possible. It introduces an idea which gets my mind racing in multiple directions, connecting things, getting excited, having mini-Eureka moments. But then Pinker focuses on one trivial point and explains it again and again. He then moves on without going further. For example, is language a direct reflection of thoughts? Surely it's trivial to see that people can think in not just words but emotions, images, sounds, smells, mathematics (numbers and structures), music and so on. And similarly, much communication is non-verbal. We wouldn't have the word ""indescribable"" (ironically an adjective) unless there were things we simply can't put into words. And yet, language CAN describe so many things, it offers us accuracy. But Pinker spends time debunking the extreme idea that thoughts and language are somehow ""one and the same"" without going into any depth about the subtle connections between thoughts and language of which there are many.For a linguist, Steven Pinker doesn't use language all that effectively. He often resorts to phrases like ""everybody knows"", ""nobody knows"" and other generalisations. Notice how I used the word ""often"" - he probably would have used ""always"" (and left out the word ""probably"" just then). This failure to be precise is very annoying. He uses blanket statements when he means usually, that sort of thing.He also makes statements like, ""children learn X at the age of 6"", rather than saying ""around the age of 6"". He says something like ""children learn a word every 2 hours"" without clarifying ""on average"". Nor does he go into any detail. Kids don't learn one word at a time. Nor does a new word go from being brand new to fully known within 2 hours. Rather, kids will have hundreds of words floating around in their brain, all at various stages of understanding.They may hear a word 53 times over 4 weeks before first using it themselves. Other words they may pick up quite directly in a single day, like with colours or parts of the body. But even these words will not instantly become confidently known but take time to settle in. They may learn what ""knee"" means only to mostly forget it and have to relearn it a few months later. This book goes into few if any of these subtle details, treating things as black and white at every turn.Pinker makes a number of what I consider to be absurd claims which I criticise here: https://thewingedmessenger.wordpress....The book is full of interesting questions and ideas followed by paragraphs upon paragraphs explaining one aspect without going into any depth on any other aspect. It reminds me of a Rossini quote about Wagner - that he has great moments but terrible quarters of an hour.For example, Pinker brings up language's relationship to thought. My imagination was captured and many questions sprung to my mind. Does language help the thinking process? What clues can we get about a person's mind and intelligence from their use of language? In what ways did human thought processes and habits help shape the development of language? Pinker asks and answers none of these questions. Instead, he devotes much space to proving that language is not IDENTICAL to thought. Facepalm.Okay, they're not the exact same. Fine. But in what ways do they affect each-other and intertwine? Pinker is too busy showing (in a very inefficient manner) why they're not literally the exact same thing. That, in essence, is the story of this book. Fascinating questions boiled down to simplified explanations of ONE ASPECT.He also uses confusing examples in many places. To illustrate a point, he gives example sentences. But some of the sentences are ambiguous or refer to unfamiliar objects or contain other phenomena quite aside from the point he's getting at. Keep it clear and simple! One concept at a time! Some of his lists also go way longer than necessary. Again, he makes vague, general points rather than getting into the details. He'll say that sentences can be ambiguous. But there's little analysis of the types of ambiguity which can arise and whether they're due to words with multiple meanings, the ways sentences can be broken down in multiple ways or other interesting reasons. They just seem to get lumped together so that I'd learn more by simply analysing language myself.He also seems to not fully understand evolution, suggesting that evolution somehow favours youth. That may appear to be true, but evolution involves no conscious design. And there's no reason to deliberately make older people obsolete. I think he confuses the habits of people which can result in degradation of the mind and body with some kind of evolutionary effect. Old people can still learn. That they often don't doesn't prove that it's impossible, nor that it's an effect of evolution.This was a very disappointing and maddeningly frustrating book."

The flow of ideas is smooth, sure, but you need them laid out to you. I needed the audiobook. And while i don't recommend it for a bedtime read, listen to it while doing chores that don't require your full attention.The book itself is a dive into the specific aspects of Language, and different languages especially English, and the idea of a mental language, a universal one that holds the ground for a role of genetics -beside upbringing- in the development of language-speaking homo sapiens.The later parts discuss hypotheses and educated guesses on the route through which language emerged, evolutionarily speaking, and evidence supporting or refuting different points of view."
96,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5781446-anthony,3,"Relying upon his background in linguistics and cognitive science while richly borrowing from anthropology, history, and biological sciences Steven Pinker provides a compelling argument that humanity's unique ability to communicate through spoken language is not a learned trait but rather an innate human instinct. Although a baby cannot begin speaking as soon as it born, unlike a foal's ability to begin walking as soon at is drops from its mother's womb, the human infant's inability to speak at birth is not due to the need to learn how to speak, but more dependent upon to the fact that the infant's brain is still developing the neural connections necessary to control vocal cords, focus auditory ability and develop the articulatory capacity to give sounds to meaning.Now, understandably what I may have just described to you might align with your definition of learning but the distinction is that although it is true that humans do learn the specific sounds attributed to specific words used within the cultural language that surrounds them, the process of speaking through verbal language to communicate one's relationship to the environment surrounding the self is an innately human instinct. Infants and children must be taught how to read and write, but the act of communicating through verbal speech is not a learned attribute. Different cultures approach infants differently: some speak to them in ""baby-language"" of goo-goo/gah-gah, while others speak to them as though they are adults, and don't even speak to their babies until the babies begin speaking back to them. Despite these different approaches, all cultures will develop young children capable of speaking with their elder peers regardless of the way in which they were ""taught"" how to speak.This theory is further supported by neurological sciences that have identified areas of the brain, such as Brocca's area, that have been demonstrated to be central to the capacity to speak and understand speech. Chimpanzees do have similarly shaped areas of their brains, however when chimps or gorillas are ""taught"" to use sign language, completely distinct areas of the brain are involved, and the similarly appearing Brocca's area do not seem to be involved in the chimp's ""communication"" with sign language. Pinker explains this distinction with one of the best quotes that describes brain function that I have read in a while:""The Brain is a special kind of organ, the organ of computation, and unlike any organ that moves stuff around in the physical world such as the hip or the heart, the brain does not need its functional parts to have nice cohesive shapes."" (322)The human brain is wired for speech unlike its closest relative the chimpanzee. Humans have an innate drive to communicate regardless of their cultural upbringing because language is just as innate to the human condition as is seeing with the eye or smelling with the nose.I must acknowledge that my review above paints the picture that The Language Instinct leans heavily upon the biological sciences and human development to argue its point, however this skewed perspective is my error only because the chapters that focused on these sciences were the ones that most convinced me because I have a background in biology and health sciences.Pinker's book is very well rounded in his approach and he uses cognitive sciences and linguistics to develop most of his arguments. There was an entire chapter devoted to grammar and an entire chapter devoted to words and Pinker relies heavily on Noam Chomsky for some of his cognitive science/linguistic approach to language. I've never read Chomsky and I'll admit that during these earlier chapters of Pinker's book I found myself skimming through several of the sentence diagrams that Pinker used to outline his point. Although I skimmed through these sections I didn't feel that I was missing much because Pinker's argument was clear: despite the diversity of approximately 6,000 distinct human languages present on the Earth, all languages work in much the same way to communicate actions nouns present in the environment.One highly interesting concept unveiled in the chapter entitled Mentalese is that although written language is very structured and organized, verbal conversation is rarely as articulate as we would like to believe. Much of spoken conversation is filled with silences, rephrasing, and nonsense. However, despite the broken communication observed in verbal communication, humans are often able to understand each other and can even guess what one another is trying to communicate before the thought is completely translated to verbal speech because:""When it comes to communicating a thought to someone else, attention spans are short, and mouths are slow."" (72)This book was handed to me by a friend almost 8 years ago and has been sitting on my shelf as one of those books I always told myself that I would put off until later and likely never read. It is my shame that I put off reading The Language Instinct for so long because I have found it to be a very insightful and educational read, well worth my time and easy to digest."

As a linguist, he uses astutely rare vernacular which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just makes it extremely difficult to read for a lay person (non academic) like myself. I get it, reading challenging material is healthy for the brain, but when I had to look up every second word in the dictionary, it distracts me massively from being able to think about the message of the book, which alone is highly intellectually challenging.Hence I didn't make it past page 70.I even downloaded the audio book in my determination to read it, but the audiobook is a waste of time and there's huge emphasis on grammatical demonstrations that have to be read to make sense, not narrated."

It's fascinating as are its implications and for that I am very happy to have read the book.

I loved Pinker 's take on the ""language mavens,"" the supposed guardians of ""correct"" English."
100,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/167566-neil-white,4,"Steven Pinker sounds like an affable fellow with awesome hair, and after reading this, I'd love to have a few beers with him and talk about language and cognition. You know, like you do. I had heard a lot about this book, mostly positive, but other than it being about language I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I guess I should have just read the title, because that's exactly what this book is about - language instinct.Pinker's central thesis is that language (vocabulary, grammary, sentence structure, syntax, etc) is a uniquely human instinct, like monarch butterfly navigation or sea turtle spawning. It less a learned skill as a hardwired genetic trait. That's not to say we're born knowing language, but as Pinker demonstrates through his research on children speaking a multitude of languages, there is an innate grammar that isn't, and can't be taught, something that children ""figure out"" without the assistance of mom or dad. This isn't something I had ever readily considered - I (like most people, I assume) just pretty much assumed we were born, and then start to learn language. But Pinker makes a compelling case that while monkeys have tails, elephants have trunks, and whales have sonar, humans have language. It is our unique instinct for survival in our unique place on the food chain.The entirety of the book is not spent directly on Pinker's thesis, though. He seems to take a certain delight in shattering commonly held beliefs about language, and I must admit he's pretty good at it. For example, thanks to mainstream media most people, myself included, assume that scientists taught sign language to apes. Simply not true, says Pinker and many others. Yes, these research apes can 'sign' and communicate, but as Jane Goodall has documented, they do this among each other in the wild, and as many 'speakers' of ASL have asserted, what those apes are doing may be communication, but it is not ASL, or any kind of real sign language with grammar and syntax, and is incapable of expressing deep or complicated ideas.I also must admit I took particular joy in reading the ""Language Mavens"" chapter, and other sections, where Pinker systematically demolishes the idea held by the self-appointed vanguard of ""refined langauge"" like William Saffire, that poor or ""wrong"" vernacular is ""destroying the English language."" What difference does it make, asserts Pinker, if a speaker says ""I don't have any"" or ""I don't got no""? The former may be ""correct"" and the latter ""incorrect"", but you know what the speaker means by either one. Moreover, in some languages a modifier like 'any' would require agreement with a verb, so ""I don't got no"" would technically be correct. He goes on to bash other so-called rules like beginning a sentence with ""but"" or ending a sentence with a preposition as complete and utter nonsense, and I'm inclined to agree. He points to Black English Vernacular (BEV, or as it has been commonly referred to in the media, ""Ebonics"") as a classic example of ""incorrect"" speaking that still follows rules of subject/verb and case agreement. It's absolutely a language, even if some people can't stand to hear it spoken. He and I do agree that there is still room for being a stickler when it comes to written language, a very different animal - a speaker doesn't need to differentiate between ""there"", ""they're"" and ""their"", context does that for him, but a writer needs to know the difference.This was an interesting read, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in language and cognitive science. Pinker is one of the best I've come across at balancing real scientific knowledge and insight with clear, engaging prose that won't turn off newcomers to the subject. This is a great thing, because it's surprising how well this book has held up to nearly 20 years of research since it was originally written. He's written several other books since both on language and cognitive psychology, and I'm curious to read more."

Therefore, TLI was necessary reading (as also was How The Mind Works, also by Pinker). Particularly interesting is Pinker's acknowledgement of Universal Grammar - the key concept of TLI. Equally interesting is Pinker's view of music as a ""technology"" and not an adaptation (in evolutionary terms); consequently, he asserts that music is not a language. Other scientists disagree. It seems to come down to how one defines ""language."" That issue will most likely be discussed in my thesis."
102,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42712856-kaushik,5,"Few books have given me the sense of satisfaction as profound as this one. I admit that not the whole book was a breeze to read. There are certain chapters which require you to discipline yourself to read through, but considering that the subject matter itself is so academic I really have to admire the authors ability to have made it so approachable even to a layman. Majority of the chapters in the book are an absolute treat to read - especially the first four and the last three. Pinker does an excellent job at keeping the reader engaged and at the same time put forward some really interesting propositions. This book is dense with information and you will walk away as a much more knowledgeable person at the end of it than you were when you started, and this is something you can hardly say for most of the books out there. More than anything the book tries to explains the complexities of language generation in our mind, puts forth extremely interesting theories backed by studies, and introduces us to cognitive psychology and linguistics in one fell swoop. It mainly tries to put forth the idea that language is in fact an innate Instinct that humans possess and have developed as part of evolution - much like breathing. There are certain segments that I absolutely loved. Note able among those would be how Pinker debunks popular linguistic myths like the Hopi having no concept of time, the staggering number of words that Eskimos have for snow and so many more - and he does it with such nonchalance. I especially loved the theory that tries to explain why the left part of our brain controls the right part of our body and vice versa. Invertebrates don't show this assymetry, so the closest theory that comes to explaining this is that, some organism which existed at the mid stage between invertebrates and vertebrates, rotated it's head by 180 degrees! The fact that the placement of primary nueral connections and the heart coincides with this change is something staggering! The theory itself is not proven, and it doesn't explain why anyone would ever do a 180 degree turn, but as a mental exercise that is something really interesting.It talks about how children are grammar geniuses and how our ability to learn a new languages dimishes as we grow through adulthood - and why (again this is another explanation I loved - it is simply a cost benefit that evolution figured out, certain skills are more valuable when young, and can be enhanced in childhood at the cost of its continued reduction over time into old age; this is true for most human traits), it explains how all languages in the world are similar after all, and how a persons ability to think complex thoughts is in no way governed by what language he speaks - something a lot of us seem to misunderstand. The book is filled with such explanations, questions, counter questions and insights. This book will make you ever more hungry for knowledge and that is why I would highly recommend it."
103,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7483415-rob,5,"An erudite but sharply-written (read, eminently readable) look at the nexus of language forms and neural responses, along with a nicely acidic putdown of self-styled language experts who pontificate - often wrongly - about usage. It was written in 1994 and apparently served as a highly influential state-of-the-discipline on publication. Certainly I have seen more than one book quoting Pinker's arguments regarding the innate 'grammar gene' (a term so often misused in the media since that time) which children are born with. Despite this, even today so-called 'common sense' tends to repeat the opposite line - that the little tykes simply copy examples from their surroundings. Now that I have an almost 3 year old tyke, right in the language learning 'sweet spot', I can vouch for the argument given here, because she 'invents' logical, regular verb forms for irregular verbs which she certainly never heard before and her placement of whole phrases is unerringly accurate, with only the occasional kiddy vowels or tripped-over syllables to let you know the speaker's age for sure.The success of Pinker's work lies in hauling us directly into this nexus between different fields without dumbing-down or sensationalising. He attacks often (and often wittily) but also, like a good scientist, proffers his own assumptions and caveats for scrutiny. Nothing is set in stone but the alternatives to Pinker's arguments come to seem increasingly implausible. For example, those who throw their hands up at the tortuous path of the language instinct's evolution and run back to creationism just need to run their own logic by themselves: if there was a 'divine' intervention, then why was language not fully formed from the outset? Why did language take so long to get where it has got and why did it have to take the tortuous route it took with all the different versions and hot wired foibles? It is most clearly not the work of a master plan. It is more plausibly a super skill gained partly by chance and partly by necessity, developed in ways that have a common thread (or grammar) in many different parts of the world, homogenised in some by history and divided in others by geology or serendipity. The Earth is more or less the same: a lucky position vis-a-vis the Sun, a climate that allowed life as we know it to sing its particular song.Throughout this book there's a thrill in feeling informed, in attacking the 'supercilious pundits' (and some are very much so) with weapons bigger than their own and in boning up on some neuroscience to focus on the underlying mechanics of this language instinct.

Pinker takes that itch and thoroughly scratches it. He covers lots of ground, such as how languages evolve, how language acquisition happens, how language and thought relate, and the fundamental properties of all language.He answers many questions I’ve wondered about forever. For example, do we think in language? No, of course not, otherwise how could languages evolve? Language is necessarily ambiguous for brevity and therefore can't be used for common sense reasoning. For example, which would be the newspaper headline, “Man bites dog” or “Dog bites man”? By the way, this context-dependence is called “deixis” and is one of the main reasons natural language processing by computers is so difficult.Does our mother tongue fundamentally shape the ways we can think? This is a common misconception, and there is no scientific evidence that it is true. You may have heard about how inuits have hundreds of words for snow, but it is a conventional absurdity.My favorite fun fact was about William the Conqueror. When he invaded England in 1066, he brought with him the norman dialect of french to serve as the language of the ruling classes. Words naturally seeped into English, giving us many idiosyncratic grammar rules such as “electric” -> “electricity”. The latinate segment of English, due to its long words and history of formality, is responsible for what we see as stuffy language. For example: “The adolescents who had effectuated forcible entry into the domicile were apprehended,” instead of the anglo-saxon, “We caught the kids who broke into the house”Final ThoughtsPinker’s style is witty and polished, and he packs a ton of information into a concise and addicting book. This is one of my favorite pop science books ever. I can’t wait to move on to his style guide, ""The Sense of Style.""Favorite Quote“The English language is a rich verbal tapestry woven together from the tongues of the Greeks, the Latins, the Angles, the Klaxtons, the Celtics, and many more other ancient peoples, all of whom had severe drinking problems.”"
106,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27843945-raja,3,"I started this book hoping to get the basics of linguistics for one of my projects. I am very glad I went on with this book and not Chomsky’s Syntactic Structures (Read few pages and couldn’t understand anything). This book was like a quick crash course on linguistics. While most of his work is build on Noam Chomsky’s Universal Grammar, Steven Pinker, professor of psychology at Harvard, differs from Chomsky's theory a lot. Pinker talks about everything from the difference between vowels and consonants, the grammar in black vernacular English and Pidgins, Morphology and Phonology. Why children of migrated parents don’t get their parent’s accent? Why there is not a significant difference in language abilities in the different part of the world while the culture changes drastically? etc.. In short, he says humans are born with language skill, and it's not something that we acquire after we are born (Nature vs. Nurture). Apparently, this is just one school of thought in linguistics (Refer Linguistic Wars).Steven Pinker along with Neil deGrasse Tyson and few other are notable scientists who want to take science to the common man. It is a very appreciable and noble work especially in the times when half of the North America doesn’t believe in global warming. The problem though is the language and scientific vocabulary they use. It is understandable that the language should not be brought down so much that it loses its essence. But a bit more effort to communicate some basic stuff would have made it more enjoyable and at the same time informative for me. As it stands, the book is very informative but not easily enjoyable. But it should be mentioned that the author has put visible efforts in making it more understandable like have a glossary for all the linguistic terms. Maybe what Steven Levitt did with Freakonomics series by joining hands with a writer or as simple as having more (at least some) subtitles in 50-page chapter putting everything in context might help.On the whole, the book is condensed. The first half of the book is easily readable compared to the other half. Maybe the information that I was looking for were in the there. Despite all my rantings on the writing (or my inability to understand the text), I would recommend it to anybody interested in linguistics or just curious about how language works."

If find the chart there terribly amusing then go ahead and buy it. If not you might want to move on.Pinker has obviously thought about this, a lot....people simply assume that words determine thoughts...Sometimes it is not easy to find any words that properly convey a thought. When we hear or read, we usually remember the gist, not the exact words, so there has to be such a thing as a gist this is not the same as a bunch of words....if there can be two thoughts corresponding to one word, thoughts can't be words.Our sixth sense may perceive speech as a language, not as sound, but it is a sense, something that connects us to the world, and not just a form of suggestibility.When a series of facts comes in succession, as in a dialogue or text, the language must be structured so that the listener can place each face into an existing framework.This mirrors my thoughts exactly- not only for words but for knowledge in general....there is a specific syndrome called Pure Word Deafness that is exactly what it sounds like: the patients can read and speak, and can recognize environmental sounds ... but cannot recognize spoken words; words are meaningless...Oh boy! This is sooo me! Often I have to visualize the written words before I can understand what was said.Great advice Pinker received from one of his editors-Think of your readers as your college roommates: people who are as smart and intellectually curious as you...I agreed with most of his conclusions but he lost me at;""The linguistic clumsiness of [age] might be the price we pay for the linguistic genius we displayed as babies""I just don't see why it has to be a zero-sum game.It's funny that the next book I read was Paul Allen's biography. At the end he talks about how incredibly difficult it is to catalog and index vast amounts of information. Pinker was even mentioned by name! Certainly those two geniuses could pool their knowledge and come up with an algorithm based on Pinker's understanding of language to file and organize all that is known on a subject."
108,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25108-andy,3,"A overview of linguistic theory regarding the structure of languages, universal commonalities between languages, language disorders, and how these come together to give scientists a picture of how the brain processes language. The central argument is that despite the diversity of languages across history, the brain must have certain biologically rooted, innate language processing systems. I found the evidence on the balance to be fairly convincing, although the book's chapters vary quite a bit in how convincing they were. Without attributing language function to specific brain structure, it is difficult to explain how children pick up languages so quickly, or the pidgin-creole evolution of languages, or some of the disorders encountered in the book. But I don't know that many people would disagree with this point, and so the book is less argument here than a description of the state of science at the time of its writing (1994). With regard to language universals, I found the book to be much less compelling. For instance, I failed to see the significance of the ""mice-eater""/""rat-eater"" issue or ""flew""/""flied"", two examples Pinker used to argue that people are systematic about sentence and word construction. Doesn't the presence of irregular verbs at all fly against this anyway? While there are systematic rules within a language I don't see any universals here and I don't see how this necessarily points to an instinct above and beyond general flexible grammar processing (in this language the verbs go here, etc.). Pinker writes in a friendly, somewhat folksy manner, sprinkling his writing with jokes and humorous anecdotes, and when he is debunking myths about language he is at his most entertaining. The Whorf theory (Eskimos having many words for snow) is really convincingly trashed, and the useless deprecations by snooty grammarians about the decline of writing standards and proper English and civilization in general are themselves properly counter-deprecated by Pinker. A decent book, one that will get me to read more on linguistics at some point, but not one that blew me away. "
109,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4809742-benjamin,3,"This was probably a good book, but it was too much of a slog for me to appreciate. It raises thought-provoking questions, proposes equally interesting answers, contains lots of little historical tidbits, and has moments of fun wordplay, but the sum is somehow less than all of these parts.This is the second time I've read a linguistics book for a general audience, and I am again struck by how much some linguists seem to want to be mathematicians. Pinker makes tangential reference to an impressive number of technical subfields of mathematics, computer science, and logic, but some of his (or his camp's; I'm unclear on that distinction) inferences about how the mind creates and understands language are less than compelling. There are a number of times that (my understanding of) his argument boils down to ""we can only think of two explanations for how this would work, empirical evidence eliminates one, so the other has to be true."" There is also an implicit assumption that whatever computational ability underpins the brain in general and language in particular has a to be consistent, contradiction-free, logical system. One might certainly wish that's the case, but it is not obvious to me at all that this must be so, and there was never any attempt to justify that assumption.Some quick notes... The empirical observations about how and when children develop language was very interesting. I really disliked just about every section that discussed technical details of proposed grammars: they were never precise enough to be rigorous (or maybe I was unwilling to read carefully enough to see the rigor), but you still had to slog through far too much technical jargon to make for an interesting read; this was somehow the worst of both worlds. The description of the historical evolution of language families was fascinating, and Pinker was very upfront about how much conjecture was in that narrative. The language mavens chapter was great; it was entertaining and he made a compelling point about how we judge people by the language/dialects they use.my favorite quote: ""Mental flexibility confines children; innate constraints set them free."""
110,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32821346-jason-wittenbach,5,"This book is great popular science writing - it strikes the perfect balance between including enough details that you actually learn something but not so many that it turns into just a bad textbook. His writing style is very jovial, enthusiastic, and readable though also precise enough to convey complex ideas clearly.Pinker wants to make an argument for language acquisition being something innate (an ""instinct"", as the title implies) as opposed to a completely social construct that we use our general intelligence to pick up. By examining many different aspects of language as well as how language is acquired in the first years of life (his specialty as a researcher), he makes a convincing argument. However I want to point out two short-comings of his approach. First, all of this theory of language is based on the ideas of Chomsky's school of linguistics and cognitive science. While Chomsky should definitely be credited as the first person to make a serious and compelling case for how language could be innate, his proposed theory for how language is organized at the cognitive level is not the only one out there. It would have been for for Pinker to explore, at least briefly, some of the alternative models. Second, Pinker's final chapter musing about what other cognitive abilities of humans that we usually think of as ""learned"" might also come from an innate cognitive faculty is highly speculative. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this kind of speculation, but as an authority on the subject, Pinker has some obligation to clearly inform the reader just how speculative these ideas are. I think he could have been much more clear about this.Criticisms aside, language is a fascinating phenomenon - it's the reason I chose my own direction for my doctoral studies! This book is an excellent introduction to many truly fascinating ideas about the complex structures and rules that we find in human languages. Everyone uses language, so I can't imagine anyone who would not find something in this book that is interesting to them."

(The new 2007 edition seems to updated, but I haven't read that edition)The Language Instinct wonderfully combines cognitive sciences, behavioral genetics and evolutionary biology to make a case that language is not a complete human construct like say metal-working and pottery, but something innate (still affected by the environment though). There are cultures out there with no iron but none without a language. And there is no ""bad language"", all languages in the world follow their rules rigourously, even such derided ones like ""black vernacular"" and ""teen-speak"" according to Pinker. Although I'm no expert, I was convinced with Pinker's case for a ""Universal Grammar"". And although Pinker is only rehashing Noam Chomsky's work here, he digresses from Chomsky when he states that language is a product of natural selection (although he doesn't spend too much time on this at all).The book really shines because of Pinker's witty and erudite writing. He's always engaging and does a really great job lightening the mood every now and then with hilarious pop-culture references when the going gets tough. And boy are some sections tough to get through. Believe me when I tried really hard, but I simply had to skip some sections, maybe I'll re-read them in a couple of years. Special mention for the amazing excerpts, newspaper headlines, and comic reproductions, Pinker definitely knows how to pick them!Recommended to everyone with an interest in language, and how it affects our minds.  "
112,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3239706-gordon,3,"A fairly complex book that I would have to read several times to internalize all it offers. It is a bit too analytical for my taste, but I did learn some worthwhile points. Language is a uniquely human experience (not earth-shattering news, but no other animal has any capacity for language even remotely close to ours - something Steven Pinker enjoys pointing out as he repeatedly debunks relevant animal studies). Language is much more sophisticated in its make up (grammar, syntax, morphology, vocabulary...), in its constant evolution from generation to generation, in its innate relationship between mind, concept, sound, and transmission; and, thus, how it is learned. As (overly) thorough as always Pinker challenges conventional thought and education about language and introduces concepts of linguistics, psychoanalysis, neurology, and social science to make his various points. My biggest take-aways (among dozens offered) are: we are all born ready-wired to learn languages, but the ability to learn / speak different languages fluently rapidly deteriorates as soon as we are physically matured; languages are in constant flux as they are passed from generation to generation - as each generation actively refines & remodels what they receive in words, conventions and rules, then successively passes on minor changes (usually in more logical and simpler patterns) and introduces new words that capture old and new concepts more accurately or in usefully new nuances. What often passes as ignorance of grammar or spelling or syntax are actually modifications purposefully introduced to ease communication and improve understanding. Along the journey of this book I learned a lot more about why English is constructed as it is, why changes occurred in English over the past millennium, why it is progressively difficult to learn new languages as one ages, why and how languages continue to evolve, and why language is so uniquely human. "
113,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893735-joseph-sverker,0,"Pinker makes a very strong case in this book that there are common grammatical structures underlying all languages. This he refers to Chomsky (as he should), but he also develops Chomsky's idea of a universal language, but not simply stopping at looking at different languages, but instead Pinker proposes that this similarity in how languages work reflects a similarity in how the human mind works. In other words, how humans handle language, and the fact that it is made so similar (with a few parameters that changes such as word order and so on) points to a language instinct according to Pinker. Whether to call it an ""instinct"" or not, I think Pinker makes a good case for his argument that there is a propensity in the brain to deal with and learn language. This propensity is found in all humans in all cultures. This leads Pinker to argue against the thought that language controls thinking, rather language is an expression of thinking. I am not completely sure if Pinker makes a correct interpretation of, for example, Wittgenstein on this. I haven't made any serious studies to do prove this, but my sense is that Pinker simplifies parts of that tradition of philosophy that include Derrida, Barthes, Foucault(?).Nonetheless, this is a very readable book and it clarifies many things about language. Pinker feels fairly level headed and gentle in this book (in comparison to The Better Angels...) and he doesn't seem to have a many bones to pick just yet.What this book says about human nature and mind, I have to think about further (and it is also what I will deal with in my PhD), but I think a general question is how exactly one is to move on from the cultural examples that Pinker gives about human universals to the psychology of the human. Pinker does so by giving certain examples and criteria. I have to read them again and more carefully to see if I am really convinced."
114,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30915-anthony,4,"it's hard to say what possessed me to read this book now of all times. some people will know that i've read most of ray jackendoff's Patterns in the Mind, which covers a lot of the same ground, and i've also taken/audited courses on semantic/syntactic theory with ray, so why read pinker?while confirming a lot of things any casual student of cognitive/psycho-linguistics will already know by now, pinker is still definitely worth reading, and in this book he's at his finest. he explains the basic ideas with simplicity and grace, in a way that won't be tedious even when the general concepts are familiar (though real linguists might be bored). and of course, this is pop science, so pinker steps back to capture the big picture now and again, tying together the strands of current research (c. 1995) into a coherent picture of mind, brain, language, and evolution.i'd have to say that the most valuable thing i gained from reading pinker was the way he adeptly handled the most contentious issues in this field. he makes a clear case for the core of chomskyan theory, without hesitating to draw lines where chomsky is wrong. he engages with some of the prevalent speculation about language evolution, challenging a number of widely-held beliefs. he takes a stand against the desire to find human-like language in other animals, noting that 1) it's just not there and 2) to insist that we need to find human language in order to elevate other animals to our stature is chauvinistic in the extreme.basically, i'm sorry i didn't read this book in fall of 2004, when i first started thinking seriously about these issues and could have gained the most from it. but i have no regrets at all about reading it now."
115,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4407536-steve,5,"After a slow start, this book comes alive mid-way through when Pinker moves beyond the universal syntax of all languages to talk about the innate language abilities we are born with and how language, speech and hearing function within the brain. This book is rich with anecdotes and interesting facts. For instance no tribe has been discovered in modern times that didn't have a developed language equal in complexity to our so-called modern languages. Or, if a person is only exposed to language after the age of 6, he will never be able to master it (or any other language). Whereas a child can master multiple languages before the age of 6 (there appears to be no discernible limit as to the number of languages a child can master). Or, that thought is indeed possible without language - a fact debated by many philosophers but conclusively answered by Pinker. I also appreciated his outright dismissal of so-called ""grammar experts"" who preach that phrases like ""Me and John,..."" and the splitting of infinitives are incorrect usages to be avoided at all times. In actual fact deeper structural analysis shows that these rules are often false and ""developed"" by academics trying to complicate language for reasons other than communication. Lastly, I appreciated Pinker's defense of quirky spelling in the English language which certainly gave me some pause for thought.This is a long, deep read but fascinating if you have an interest in language and how the brain works. Behind only Noam Chompsky, Pinker is probably the leading thinker in this area at present (and a great deal more interesting to read!) I read this just before starting to learn Spanish as an adult this year and have really appreciated the deeper understanding it has given me on a) the process of learning a language and b) the inherent structure of any human language."
116,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/877389-james,5,"I don't often read something that actually changes the way I understand my world. I've been aware of Noam Chomsky's name and have vaguely associated it with a poorly understood and not-at-all-subscribed-to-by-me notion of an innate ""universal grammar"" for a long time. I was one of the kind of people discussed in this book, who believe that thought itself depends on language. I subscribed to what Pinker calls ""The Standard Social Science Model"" of absolute cultural relativism. While already a ""descriptivist"" with regard to the immutable purity of Standard Written English, I did believe that the bugbears of the style manuals actually contributed something to clarity and precision.Color me converted. Pinker illustrates how the emerging experimental field of cognitive science has utterly borne out Chomsky's theories. We don't teach children language. They teach themselves, or, rather, they learn how to fit the particularities of a specific learned language into pre-existing intuitive tree-like schemata for imposing and communicating cognitive order with respect to actions, actors, and the acted upon. Though they are incompetent in every other way, Pinker convincingly demonstrates that human toddlers undergoing what he calls the ""grammar explosion"" are linguistic geniuses. As he shows, the complex grammatical reasoning of which a two-and-a-half-year-old is capable is nothing short of breathtaking.In addition to a mind-blowing, sound-as-brickwork argument and elegant yet pointedly unpretentious style, The Language Instinct is replete with astonishing facts. I've subjected everyone I know to an endless stream of Pinker tidbits, and I've gleefully read excerpts from his screed against ""language mavens"" , in particular his defense of her bete noire, ""I could care less,"" to my occasionally pedantic editor fiancee.I can't recommend this enough."
117,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/914349-arthur,5,"This is a must-read for anyone interested in how language works. As the title would indicate, Pinker argues that language is an instinct and that our brains come pre-programmed with a Universal Grammar and an innate capacity to fill in the blanks with the specific grammatical rules and vocabulary we hear people use around us. He also describes the basics of the modern science of language developed by Noam Chomsky and his followers, and although this section is a little technical, it is well worth reading, and Pinker adds enough humor to make it an enjoyable read.The highlight of the book, I believe, is the chapter called ""The Language Mavens,"" in which he argues that many of the grammatical ""rules"" we are familiar with are actually based on ignorance of how language works. For example, two of the great ""rules"" we are always told about is to not split infinitives (see what I did there?) and to avoid ending a sentence with a preposition. Both of these grammatical rules are foreign to English. They started because a lot of English speakers considered Latin to be the paragon of logical consistency, and so they applied many of the rules from Latin to the much different grammar of English. Both of these ""errors"" are impossible in Latin, and therefore these early language mavens declared that they should be avoided by English speakers. Another error that he says is no error at all is ""He took Alice and I to the airport"" or other constructions of that form. This is no error because the object of the verb is not ""Alice"" and ""I"", but ""Alice and I"", and it is unnecessary to inflect both nouns within the phrase. This is an excellent book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to know a little bit more about how language works."
118,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24844858-hayley-bermel,3,"This should be said right now: I love language. I love the how it shapes how we think about issues, how it evolves alongside us, and how it can unify humanity and section them at the same time. Steven Pinker took this to a new level in The Language Instinct, and it was excellent. He touched many subjects and really delved into how our mind as a computational system can process language, acquires it, and how we are able to communicating ideas. That being expressed, Pinker goes a bit too much in detail about these processes for me at times. This is a subject I'm very passionate about and interested in, but I find that I'd often be flipping through a section to see how many pages there were left in it. I felt like he continually hit the same points over and over again, and then would write for another twenty pages about the subject. Don't get me wrong- I love this book, I just think Pinker may have underestimated his audience's ability to comprehend something without explaining every minute detail. I'd recommend The Language Instinct to anyone who is already interested in language and linguistics, and has done some reading before hand. I would also not recommend it for casual reading, but more as a leisure book that you pick up from time to time. It can get mind numbing and dense. Also: it was written in the 90s, and some of his attempts at reference to pop culture and tech are no longer relevant, which may turn away younger readers. Overall, it is a great book, though, and people should read it, because it will incite a great curiosity in you. Here's a link to Pinker's website, if you wish to learn more about his work at Harvard or MIT, or his other works. Pinker's Website"
119,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9892350-ollie,3,"It only took a couple pages to realize that I might be in way over my head with this one. But wanting to know more about linguistics and with a recommendation by Chomsky on the cover, I thought this book to be as good a place as any to get some perspective on what linguists have to say about language.I speak several languages, and unfortunately, I never bothered with the grammatical rules behind any of them. As such, I have only vague ideas of what “present perfect” or “subjunctives” or any of that stuff is. I don’t understand how the languages I speak are arranged, I just speak them. But unfortunately, large parts of this book are devoted to picking apart how sentences are arranged and organized and I couldn’t help but glaze over these parts. It was just too exhausting.There are several references to Chomsky’s work in this book and Pinker takes plenty of time discussing them. I’m pretty sure it takes up most of the book. But anyhow, the parts of the book I especially liked were Pinker’s argument that language is just a limited software we use to communicate what the hardware (the brain) is thinking. Some languages are better at translating mentalese than others. From babyhood we are already speaking a universal mental language “mentalese” and as we grow we are somehow programmed to pick up the patterns and rules through the noisy complexity learning how to use words to convey our thoughts. We pick up the patterns AND the exceptions. It’s all genetically built in, apparently. Oh and practice at an early age is essential as we lose this skill when we get older. Like I said, I was in over my head for this one, and what I understood I really enjoyed. I just might reread this book someday and maybe absorb what I had missed."
120,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2785703-myla,3,"Enjoyable view of the workings of the brain from the point of view of language. I don't know if ""I really liked"" but it's worth the time just taking in a bit of lucid discussion about some pretty technical stuff (fortunately, stuff Pinker conveys well). You'd better like language and or if you have a problem with natural selection, this highly readable text will be a source of angst or a snooze. The text also requires attention. Given the nature of this book, for eaxample, the author has to present incorrect and ""just off center"" phrases to demonstrate and contrast certain language principles. And you'll find that you have to periodically re-read some sentences and phrases. Pinker provides more than adequate spacing between episodes of re-reading to prevent the episodes from becoming an annoyance. On the other hand, I noted a couple of editing errors that I otherwise might have missed - I read the paperback version. I'm not such a careful reader, but I do know these were errors because I had to stop and write out Pinker's text (an exercise I never do). When you read the book you'll see why I had to resort to writing out these two or three errant sentences to see if they were wrong. Pinker makes an arguement in his languauge mavens chapter that strikes me as mental gymnastics that defy his premise (humans are hard wired to communicate) - it concerns how a maven criticizes saying, ""Give Al Gore and I your .... "", but Pinker backs into a logic-ladened gynastic/arguement rendering the phrase correct/acceptable. Dude, it's, ""Give Al Gore and me ...."" (Always, period)But I enjoyed your book. "
121,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/613016-maggie,4,"the aspects of this book that detail language is excellent. the evolutionary tie-ins are stretches that are best-guesses but far from experientially proven connections. so if you love language, you will indeed enjoy this book. but a cautionary word: don't forget those critical reading skills so you don't swallow the long-stretch evolutionary wishing-is-believing ... in neuroscience and technology, the more the scientists find out, the more questions are raised. so the more they know, the more they know they don't know. so beware of firm statements of evolution when it comes to the language instinct. we wouldn't want to close out any possibilities or discoveries. the sheer depth (literally) of the process does not easily yield its methods and whereas pinker does indeed outline the difficulties of studying the deep process of language, he seems to disregard this reality as he jumps on the evolutionary bandwagon. perhaps it's a peer pressure thing. or a job security thing. but whatever his (hidden -- perhaps even to himself) motivation, it isn't science. not yet. perhaps we cannot be reduced to mere machines. a radical thought for materialists, i realize. but it hasn't yet been shown -- esp. in the language instinct area of science -- that we are mere machines. serious study of human neurological areas requires reduction. but we appear to be far more than the sum of our parts. and a book such as this one or a scientist such as steven pinker adds to our knowledge. no doubt. but they really might up the ante on their methods by retaining at least a modicum of mystery to their method. imo."
122,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8769239-lauren,4,"This was certainly an illuminating read, even if it is slightly out of date-there was a significant portion of one chapter that was entirely dedicated to the lack of machine ability to listen to and understand or respond to language. Since 1994, circumstances have definitely changed. That was the only obvious dating that I could tell of the material in the book. I'm sure there are others that are more niche in the linguistics field, all of which would have been far beyond me. Although the book is sold as being laymen-accessible, I really don't think that that was always the case. Often, Pinker would ""explain"" certain constructions of language that I didn't find particularly accessible. Mostly because I don't think I had the necessary linguistics background, or perhaps the jargon, I really couldn't connect with what was being said, though I always understood the point he was trying to make. I didn't really hold this against Pinker, as trying to explain the nuances of how individuals create language is vastly more complex than the way the language learners understand their language abilities. Ultimately, I recommend this to individuals who are looking for a book about language creation. Pinker's argument (as can be inferred from the title) is that individuals have a language instinct, it is not a recurring invention. I would have enjoyed a little more on the evolutionary aspect of things, but the taste included in this book was very interesting. I loved the chapter ""The Language Mavens,"" it really highlights Pinker's humor throughout the book, as well as being amazingly entertaining. This was very engaging, mostly pleasurable read."
123,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1392101-scarlett-sims,5,"I originally bought this book as supplemental reading for one of my linguistics classes, but didn't read the whole thing at that point. Then I saw Steven Pinker speak and so when I found this book at my parents house I decided to give it a go.In the past, I have been known to down-rate scientific books if they are outdated. I am definitely interested in reading some of Pinker's more recent stuff but this book was great. I think one of his biggest strengths as a writer, speaker, and scholar is his knowledge of what people are interested in reading. While putting forth a serious theory (and I do classify this as science because of its basis in evolutionary biology) he uses humor and interesting examples to illustrate his points.This book is geared to the non-specialist. There is a glossary in the back and lots of information that will be familiar to anyone who has taken an intro to linguistics class. I would like to read a book that takes the opposite view (if there is a recently written one--I really don't know about current developments in cognitive sciences); Pinker is pretty convincing but I don't like to hear only one side of a story.One of my favorite chapters in the book was where he talks about ""language mavens"" and speaks out against prescriptive grammar. I used to be really into grammar and correcting people but a few years ago when I became a meta-snob (my own personal term meaning a snob about not being a snob) I stopped doing that so I enjoyed his criticism of ""standard grammar."""
124,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7566522-ray-campbell,4,"In the Silent Language, the classic treatise on culture and of anthropology, Edward T. Hall explains the expression and communication of culture including language - Pinker would differ. Far from being an expression of culture, Pinker argues that recent research points to the idea that language is hard wired. He explains that we have innate tendencies and capabilities that manifest based on context but that these manifestations of a language capability in humans follows uniform and predictable patterns. In order to make his point, Pinker explores everything from biology and neurology to psychology and comparative linguistics.While Pinker lost me on his discussion of linguistic models which sound like equations that prove the laws of physics, the book is surprisingly readable. Pinker gives dozens of fun, funny examples of language in action which serve to bring his ideas back to reality regardless of how abstract his discussion of hard science becomes. Ultimately, Pinker's argument is compelling. Thinking of language as a set of sounds and syntax leads one to imagine that a language like Mandarin could have nothing to do with Old Norse, but the point isn't the system of sounds. When sounds are taken in sequence, the same physiology determines that ""i"" ""o"" ""u"" will go in that sequence. When syntax differs, it is an inverse, never an arbitrary variation. I enjoyed the book and gained understanding of how language develops. I would recommend this to anyone with an interest in language or human development. "
125,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41126068-jilliebelle,4,"I enjoyed this book up until chapter 12. His argument that prescriptive grammar is useless and that it is not English at all is absolutely pathetic. He has no real ground for his argument and it is just a bunch of meaningless opinion. In his other chapters , his arguments had excellent studies and empirical data but this chapter seemed as though it was just pushed into the book because he was mad at his editor. Honestly, it took down the overall quality of the book. I agree that human language (no matter the dialect) is human language and shouldn't have to be corrected by extremists who don't understands the differences between standard English and Black Standard English. But when speaking American standard English , one should follow the rules laid out for them. Also, his history of how grammar rules were established seemed a little sketchy. Ok...a lot sketchy. It wasn't some ploy to control the mass populous and feel superior to others. At that time, there were different dialects in English that made it hard to communicate via papers or even just speaking to one another. So , enthusiasts came together and made rules for the benefit of all. My argument is: if you want to speak American standard English and speak it properly, you should obey the rules laid before you. Other than that, the book was very insightful and pragmatic. Overall, I loved the book and enjoyed the read. I recommend this reading to anyone who is interested in linguistics (or in debate). It is definitely a ""must read""."
126,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51941-tani,4,"More properly, this would be a 3.5. I really enjoyed the early parts of the book, and they were a solid 4 stars. However, the book dragged at the end, and that would warrant more of a 3 star rating. I'm not a linguist. I just have a passing interest in the subject, so I can't really comment on the validity of Pinker's arguments. I can say that what he argued made sense to me most of the time, with a few small exceptions, and I wouldn't be surprised if he is mostly correct. But I'm not an expert. So, there's that. As for writing style, Pinker does pretty well. As I said above, the book started very well for me. I think Pinker has an engaging writing style and that he uses examples to illustrate his points quite well. Unfortunately, he does sometimes get bogged down in the minutiae. I understand that the grammar discussions were important to make his point, but I felt like the way he just threw you into them was a bit abrupt. I spent a good long while reading grammar descriptions without being sure what the ultimate point was going to be. That may have been a problem with my reading, but I think Pinker could also have been more upfront about where he was going with it. Either way, I enjoyed the book, and would recommend it for language geeks like myself. At times it may be a bit technical, but as long as you keep on keeping on, you'll come out with a broader understanding of the language mechanism in human beings."

I was hoping in this book to find some science on language, and how it could have evolved. Instead I found a pile of stuffy nonsense, full of opinion and short on facts. I did not finish this book, after realizing it was (for the great part) bullshit.The writer intends to confuse, I would swear, going on and on about the most dull long-winded points that amounted to nothing, while anything that could have a possibility of substance was disregarded and glossed over.While venting my doubts and frustration about the book to Caleb one day I was surprised to learn he knew of the theories in the book, and he let me know that they're pretty much considered disregarded at this point. I'm not sorry that I started reading the book, because honestly sometimes I question my critical thinking skills. I often feel like I am easily influenced by others thought and opinions to an extent that I hardly have any of my own, and I am nothing but a chameleon. Not that it is wrong to be influenced by others; nothing in this world is original; but I hate feeling as if I am just a leaf in the wind. Being able to detect the poorly constructed arguments in this book did not necessarily make me feel less influenced, but it did give me some sort of hope that I do have a critical bone, somewhere in my body."

I didn't notice the date on this book (1994) until after I bought it at the public library's Friends of the Library basement bookshop. It only cost me two bucks, so that's cool, and it's very interesting and insightful. And Pinker, who always strikes me as blithely brilliant, inserts just enough smartassery to make you wonder if it's too much and then to decide that no, it is not, but it's *almost.* And damned if he isn't great at simplifying complex information and theory without *over*simplifying, and at not overselling his theories and conjectures -- he always acknowledges them as theory and conjecture. That's nice. Tell me the truth and let me decide what to mine from it. What more can you ask of a book?But 1994. Sheesh. It's that magic time between 'So Old It's Only Good for Ideas and Not Anything Definitive Like Research' and 'Fresh, Hot-Off-The-Press"" research. Since it's neither, it's nearly useless in terms of any academic pursuit beyond rank, raw interest and hobby. And maybe pursuing the current research to see what seems silly or misguided now in retrospect. But still, it's fascinating as hell. Even an obsessive armchair linguist like this professor learned some things. Enjoy. "

Since it was originally published in 1994, I found some of the content to be a bit outdated, but it was still packed with a lot of goofy “aha” moments about language. Many sections had me babbling to myself, testing out examples that were provided (I mostly read this at home, so as not to disturb other people). I first learned about Steven Pinker when he gave a presentation at my university essentially summarizing The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined (i.e. global violence has actually declined over time, here’s how--with statistics--, and here are six main hypotheses/reasons why). It's a concept that interests me, so I looked him up and found his work on cognitive science and language. The Language Instinct is kind of for a niche audience (and you’ll know who you are). For the less-committed, I’d recommend trying Pinker's TED talks, which are only 20 minute investments of time and more approachable for a lay audience."
130,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,3,"This is listed as one of the New Scientist Top 25 Most Influential Popular Science books. The thesis is solid...the execution burdensome. Here's a thought: make a point; reinforce a point; if at that point you feel the need to keep talking, show the reader where in the footnotes or appendix all the repetitious extras can be found. Pinker spends an enormous amount of time talking about language grammar and the English language in particular, none of which have anything to do with why language is instinctual. It would have been a lot more tedious if I hadn't just listened to John McWhorter's lectures on The Story of Human language. The parallels could not have been coincidental...both relating elements of language development, grammar structure, proto-languages...but McWhorter wasn't talking about instinct. He was talking about language. Pinker undermines his case with all the side trips down linguist lane. Focus on instinct, not on the idiosyncrasies of a hodgepodge tongue. Pinker could have made his point very well in 100 pages. I admire succinct conveyance of knowledge. Pinker sure has a way of complicating concepts with extraneous details. I didn't admire this book. "
131,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57394557-jack-greenrose,4,"I had read almost every single book written by Steven Pinker except this one. He is one of the most skilled contemporary writers, but The Language Instinct proves that writing is a skill that is developed over time. This book is not bad by any means (it's great) but it's occasionally repetitive and Pinker's trademarks, such as the use of comic strips as a comic relief, are missing. His jaunty personality is occasionally overshadowed by his almost homicidal hatred toward what he calls as the Standard Social Science Model (SSSM), which also makes him slip into strawman-like oversimplifications of it. I agree with Pinker that SSSM is mostly just silly, and thus it was easy for me to agree with his arguments even when I noticed how easily some of them could be challenged. Richard Dawkins' works have also clearly influenced him as a young author and I felt that this is The Extended Phenotype translated into linguistics. In spite of all that, I learned a lot that I didn't know before and I nodded in agreement more often than I shook my head, which makes this a book that I wholeheartedly recommend."
132,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/960078-erin,2,"I am a polyglot and fascinated by languages and language learning/acquisition and how they relate to the human experience. I am also an academic and translator who loves reading about these topics from an academic perspective.This book presented many of the themes about language and the human experience that interest me, but the style is not necessarily one that appeals to me. That is not really a comment about the quality of the book and the information but more about my own personal preference. Pinker takes a strongly linguistics-based approach, which is not the way I necessarily think about language. I know that might seem contradictory or unusual, but linguistics tend to use scientific methodology (especially categorical terminology) to explore and explain language. I personally do not find that approach useful or interesting, though I understand why many do.Overall, Pinker offers many valuable observations about language, human experience, and the brain, but the overly linguistic approach did not strongly appeal to me. I'm sure it would to others who enjoy a linguistic approach to studying languages, human behavior, and physiology."
133,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,4,"Couldn't put it down. Another interesting set of insights by Mr Pinker.""A language is a dialect with an army and a navy""-Max WeinreichThere are developed and underdeveloped economies, but there is no such thing as an underdeveloped grammar. All people, everywhere in the world, speak with a grammar of equal complexity. We (including myself!) hear blacks in the US use very strange ""uneducated"" sounding english. As a matter of fact, the black population has their own dialect inherited from the days of slavery.Children everywhere on earth learn to speak on their own, without assistance from their parents like the ""mommy talk"" that is popular in the west. Children don't need to be trained to speak, just like they don't need to be trained to walk. We'll all do it on our own.As we age, we loose the ability go ""grow"" language. If someone is to be 100% bilingual, the younger they are immersed in the target environment the better. After six or seven, most children loose the ability to develop the native gramar for a language."
134,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1470364-matt,3,"The main thesis of this book: We are not born as blank slates. We are born with some pretty impressive intellectual machinery that just needs to be oiled and put to work. I am glad I read it but can’t say I’ll be recommending it to others. That said, I will be annoying my friends talking about the main points. For example, his bashing of language “mavens” is great. I enjoyed how he ripped apart the argument that language is falling apart. I also found his ridicule of certain “rules” of language - like not splitting infinitives or ending a sentence with a preposition - to be liberating. He also makes a direct attack on the racist arguments against “black” language and showed how rich and expressive all dialects are. And I found his belief that the brain is made up of various innate computing centers pretty interesting and compelling - and very cool. The last 3 chapters of this book are great. 5 star chapters. However, to get the most out of those chapters you do need to read all the previous chapters - which, for me, were a bit slow, repetitive, and incredibly dense. "
135,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28187620-connor-stein,5,"This book is a great introduction to linguistics. Pinker shows how humans have an innate language learning module which allows children to rapidly hone in on the correct generalizations of grammar from a few examples, easily avoiding the multitude of other seemingly valid generalizations that could be inferred. It neatly summarizes past linguistic research, highlighting insights on how language processing is localized in the brain, the common threads between different languages and the fundamentals of phonology and morphology. He challenges the so-called language mavens by walking the reader through flaws in their logic - for instance why do they insist on ""whom"" when they can bear the loss of ""ye""? Linguistic ideas that are often presented as fact in textbooks are exposed as myth, one example being the classic ""Eskimos have 100 different words for snow"" which turns out to be totally false. Overall you come away from the book with an appreciation for the astonishing complexity and speed of language processing and the striking universality of many of the features of language."
136,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39021080-peter,5,"Outstanding book. As an undergraduate Linguistics major in 1979, I was familiar with many (but not all) of the topics and enjoyed the book completely. It was a like the summary of the entire major in a single book! What a great experience it would have been to have Pinker as your professor. The writing is so clear, it is so refreshing. I can understand how many might get lost in the technical analysis of language, but they should give it a try. Amidst all the technical explanations are gems of insight, anecdotes, and humor - but it takes patience to get through it - unless you were taking exams in it 40 years ago! I am amazed how much I have remembered! In this single book, language history, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics are summarized with clarity and humor. I am truly disappointed that the book was published in 1994 - that's 24 years ago. I can only imagine how much more there is to add to all these topics. I guess I'll have to find other authors to bring me up to date!"
137,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5338819-ed-bernard,3,"Obviously, Steven Pinker’s “The Language Instinct” is a monumental work, one of the seminal works of modern social science. I had read this book many years ago and have heard it referred to frequently since. That’s why I wanted to go back and give it another listen. And you know what? It wasn’t a great read for understanding the core concepts — at least in audiobook form, there’s too much statistical data, too much math, too many things that I’m sure are fine in diagram form but are just plain confusing in prose. Maybe it works as a textbook (and it is used as one), but as a book to read, there are other books and writers that describe the concepts with more clarity (though, to be fair, Pinker is a good writer who displays wit and a sense of style) and less “under the hood” jargon. I don’t really blame Pinker — I probably am not his audience, and I definitely prefer a “science for poets” approach when listening to an audiobook. If that’s what you’re looking for, this book is still brilliant but perhaps a bit overwhelming — I stopped about 2/3 of the way through.Grade: B-/DNF"

However, it still read a bit like a scientific/academic treatise, which made me end up skimming certain parts -- especially when I felt like he was repeating points he'd already clearly proven. Nevertheless, I did find this an interesting read and enjoyed being reminded of the linguistics courses I took in college. I suspect that I would not have skimmed as much if I'd read it closer to my college days and could've seen it sparking lively discussions with other students and my professors. If you have a casual interest in linguistics or language acquisition, you may find this a bit dry despite the author's efforts to make the material lively. Regardless of your background in the topic or interest level prior to reading it, this will challenge you to think about language differently and will likely teach you something new. "
139,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7188699-abhaga,4,"3.5Interesting but not as interesting as I had hoped for. Steven Pinker sounds so much like Richard Dawkins!The book is making a case for the thesis that some kind of language facility is hardwired in human brain. It presents variety of arguments, and results from scientific experiments to buttress the claim. Pinker makes a good case but along the way he keeps shooting off on tangents. Like a chapter on language mavens the sole purpose of which seems to be to write off certain people he doesn't like much. It is a pretty lengthy book and such diversions could have easily been avoided.Many parts of the book, especially those related to syntax, parse trees etc were familiar to me from before so I skipped them. Cannot comment on how accessible he has been able to make those for someone without any background in the area.I wouldn't mind reading a shorter and more updated version of this. May be even by another author."
140,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4017921-mckenzie,3,"Certain parts of Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct are utterly fascinating, as he explains how language itself works, regardless of the specific language being spoken. However, this book delves into super-academic jargon so far that I largely skimmed entire pages, particularly those where he outlines the mental grammar rules that dictate how all languages are built. There were insights that required that level of depth to understand, however this book is definitely not for a lay person with a vague interest in how language works. I will probably remember certain details (in particular, the difference between a pidgin language and a creole language developed by the descendants of those who speak pidgin, which is always more complex than the pidgin language even if the children develop the creole language in isolation), but overall can only recommend this book if you have a deep interest in the subject. "
141,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3728503-1-1,3,"A solid book with an interesting argument, plenty of details, plenty of interesting asides, and a wide purview of language... plus a very compelling argument in favor of not only a language instinct, but a specifically developed language circuitry in the brain (duh). So yes, the book dives deeply into the subject. Deeply enough, perhaps, to lose you every now and then—but Pinker always comes up for air and generally scatters enough lively examples in that you'll stay your course. If you don't like sentence trees, X-bars, and other inane linguistic nattering, this book may still be for you, since those aspects are thoroughly covered rather quickly and effectively, and then the author moves on to the big stuff, which is wickedly interesting, and most definitely worth reading and learning about."

Argues in favor of considering language as an mostly innate function of the human. A result of evolution and natural selection. But with a careful delineation of what is thought to be innate (universal grammar, speech production organs etc. with openings on neurosciences) and what is the result of individual adaptation to environnent (the actual language instance, French, English, accents and dialects, vocabulary etc. and this killing argument of Creole languages being children invention). Finally a very accurate list of arguments against language ""experts"" and their non-sense of correcteness. This last part could have been opened to more political/sociological issues regarding use of ""standard"" language as a tool for domination."

(I also found a little cringeworthy to see Universal Grammar capitalized; it makes the whole thing feel like a sect.)That said, when I read books like this I'm looking for new ideas and to change how I perceive the world. This book excels in both things. And even if I'm not qualified to have an opinion on the Chomsky debate, I like to know that it exists, and to have a very basic understanding of the arguments in favor of the (here we go again) Universal Grammar.And one more thing: these ""idea books"" tend to have a lot of fluff in the final chapters. Here, in my opinion, the final chapters are some of the best. Chapter 11, on why a language instinct can have a Darwinian explanation, was probably my favorite."
144,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62838312-richard,4,"Took me a long while to work through. A few chapters exemplify the challenge of transcribing an academic linguists knowledge into a form accessible for popular science readers. Pinker tackles this with clarity and examples that are easy to relate.There is plenty I gained from this text. As someone working in children's education, it was perhaps lacking in applicable knowledge, but as a curious learner it was quite insightful. Touching topics of natural selection, brain science, education, culture, parenting, linguistics. Language Instinct is perhaps more expansive than I expected but this benefits ita main thesis that the capacity to learn language is innate to humans. It is compelling, but perhaps would benefit from updating in light of contemporary neuroimaging and cognitive science."
145,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56609924-flaviu-vescan,4,"In this book, Pinker takes his theory on how language is partly genetically encoded in humans and dissects it. It does a great job at showcasing both it's strengths and weaknesses. Each chapter takes a different approach, so the best way to read it is with slight pauses between the chapters so you can digest what it was trying to convey and how it reflects on other topics like natural selection, grammar, art or history. I was already accustomed with and a fan of Pinker's style and ideas, so there was a lot of confirmation bias for me to enjoy this one (which I'm unapologetic about). There were plenty of ideas in the book I was unaware of and ways of looking at language that I never thought of. I'm pretty satisfied with it since it lead me to update my view on how the mind creates and molds communication. "
146,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8272524-david,4,"Pinker is one of those wacky, made-for-TV, pop-science wonks with his big hair, scientism/humanism bent, and gentle Canadian patience. But this was actually quite good. Pinker writes with minimal academese and does a decent job explaining Chomsky's theories of Universal Grammar. The wheels fall off in the final chapters with Pinker's blind faith in Darwinian natural selection, and it's a shame to see him try to explain away the irreducible complexity of human language with the old favourite ""but over millions of years anything is possible"". He'd have been better off sticking with Chomsky's ""we just don't know."" Still, there's more good in here than bad. Pinker's a witty chap who writes about philology with a clear passion. I'm doubtful his newer, more political stuff is worth the price of entry though."

In the book I have discovered that the people I dislike are the ""language mavens"" who try to preserve absurd prescriptive rules. The fundamental rules of language are universal, and all 3-year-old human beings uses them to analyse theirs' parents speech and re-invent a language. In the case of parents or caretakers speaking a pidgin, the children invent a new language: a creole.From the last page of the book:""Among laypeople, race is lamentable salient, but for biologists it is virtually invisible.

We have had the mental faculties to learn language for tens of thousands of years, but to explain how or why it works is not simple. Some of it is innate in our ability, and sets us apart from other animals that roam the earth. But language acquisition is also conditioned or learned, because we cannot learn language in isolation or after a critical period of development, lest we become a feral child and unable to learn language for the rest of our life. There are those who can speak syntactically correct sentences like ""Colorless green ideas sleep furiously"" and make no sense. There are those who are otherwise bright but have a difficult time communicating.Turns out, language acquisition is an interesting business."

It'll blow your mind."" My scalp tingled with excitement through chapters of linguistic minutiae and scientific cross-pollination, from neuroscience to biology to anthropology through to computer coding and poetry and authentic frontier gibberish. Pinker is one hell of a writer, and his persuasive style is one to envy, at once confident and humble and also hella funny. Even when I'm skeptical of a given conclusion he draws (his take-downs of competing theories are occasionally less effective, given the scope he chooses as examples) I feel enlightened by the exploration. Seriously, dude. It's a super high."

It takes us away from the Whorfian idea of speaking a language influences how you see the world, but rather we are all born with the innate faculties to speak. The so called Language instinct. For example babies when learning their parents language, display grammatical errors that they could not have learnt from their parents but rather by filling in the blanks themselves. This refutes the idea that babies are a 'blank slate', instead they have a mental framework in place to begin to learn the language. As an amateur in linguistics hoping to improve my knowledge this was a good foundation and introduced a lot of topics in linguistics from core stuff like phonetics to sub fields like neurolinguisrics.

So some of Pinker's concepts and ideas are simply outdated. He added and afterword ten years later to set some things straight but still you should be careful about some facts especially the ones concerning brain research.He uses some of Chomsky's ideas which Chomsky himself by now declares as being incorrect.Pinker gets pretty much down to the basics, explaining what a noun phrase is and so on. Don't expect an all to easy read and don't expect to many news if you already have a basic knowledge of linguistics and children's language acquisition. His ideas might have been ground-breaking in 1994 but are a bit dated by now."

However, Pinker takes us to a mesmerizing journey to the depths of human brain and history of its development in the context of language learning and creation. He adds also many studies and academic trivia to fill in fact for the doubters and claims that language was a natural way to evolve human race. As a teacher and educator, I will come back to this book in upcoming research and quote bits and pieces as same as using it as a reference to more academic studies.It was 1-year road to understanding my students better and in fact understanding better the entire process of learning, remembering, categorizing and structuring language."

Did a good job of seamlessly integrating special vocabulary and terminology. A little dissappointed that he didn't root concepts a bit more firmaly in evolutionary biology, but then remembered that he wrote this 20 years ago and was actually far ahead of his time and anticipated some of the discoveries since irst puplication.Dynamic speaker and entertaining enlightening writer. Three more of his books in my reading pipeline for this year should get me caught up.Fascinating how many hugely complicated mental processes we take for granted. Language and its acquisition are quite a bit both clearer and cloudier after reading this book."

As a person who's pretty convinced that there is no mind-body ""problem""--our minds are embodied, I think--his Darwin-based theories of language evolution convince me; but I know his work is controversial (and I have read some of his sources who are at odds with his theories, and they are thought-provoking, too)."
155,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15907771-jack,4,"Certainly a challenging read. Some material was above me and the scope of the book was wide I found a little overwhelming. However, I felt that this book was worthwhile. A reread is required and exposure to other linguistic texts necessary, as I'm not in any sort of position to judge Pinker's belief in a innate Universal Grammar. His arguments were impressive and he does a brilliant job highlighting the amazing talents that children have in acquiring spoken language. It certainly seems plausible that language acquisition is too complex to learn via instruction. Pinker's anecdotes are numerous, humorous and cement his theory. Wish I could give a better chapter by chapter run down but I just recall all that info. "
156,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4627768-fawwaz,3,"Pinker explains how language is an innate capability of all human beings, and how it's hardwired into the brain and not something only taught by parents. He describes how children learn language, how all the world's languages are very similar, how evolution shaped it, and why it's not a big deal to stress on grammar.I enjoyed large parts of the book, but others I found extremely technical and boring. It goes very deep into grammar structures of the English language or how the brain analyzes sequences of sentences. Overall, I still enjoyed it, but by the end, I couldn't wait to finish it. Don't get the audiobook on its own since some parts of it are very hard to understand without looking at the text itself."
157,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8721987-shalini,4,"Pinker offers an interesting elucidation of the Chomskyan theory of language, particularly that of grammar acquisition being an innate skill. While most of the book was interesting, explanation of neuroanatomy and genetics in lay terms was a temptation to skip pages. I suspect this cannot be avoided in a book aimed at populistic simplification of complicated theories. Some concepts (such as mondegreen) were fascinating. It also lets mothers off the hook (slightly) for their role in their children's language acquisition. This book is a useful addendum to McWhorter's linguistics course. I look forward to the alternate perspective offered in Geoffrey Simpson's book. "

I found this book very difficult to understand, mostly because I think that the book hasn't decided if it is written for the layman or for the academic. At times its one; other times the other. Sometimes it's both in the same sentence (which make for some really confusing syntax). I studied the History of the English Language in college, I've completed courses in linguistics from the Teaching company and continued to read books on the topic. In my opinion, this book is really not accessible, even to someone with background in the subject. It was just too much of a slog. I suggest reading John McWhorter instead."
159,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1162544-jacob,3,"Pinker takes on the topic of the origin of language, ultimately arguing that it emerges from our genetic code as a specialized behavior akin to the elephant's trunk -- particular to the species, evolved for a certain set of tasks, and subject to natural variations. A bit dry. As pop science writing goes, it doesn't quite hit the mark. Pinker deals with some pretty abstract stuff, like how our brains process sentences (many branching possible meanings, narrowing as we progress through the sentence? or one hypothesis of meaning, continuously tested as we progress?) without much in the way of easy metaphors or visual aids. His jokes border on dad-ish, too."

I ran into some problems with author's main theory (that language is innate) by page sixty. Unfortunately the thrust of his thesis seemed to become a reaction to another point of view. This caused him to veer off point. This happened several times more and the book suffers for it. I had to skim through some parts of the book; something I dislike to do while reading. Although the book had some interesting parts, all in all the book was disappointing.

It surveys the interesting topic of linguistics and contends that language is as much of an innate instict unique to humans as an elephant trunk. Most of the book covers Chomsky's theories of language and universal grammar. His own opinions and interpretations are heavy throughout. The study is a good mix of psychology, english, and biology.

171,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37766563-aastha-mehta,3," Language is one thing which is universal to all humans, piercing the physical and mental barriers. It binds us as a species and gives us a unique position in the animal kingdom, so much so that acquisition of language is a water-shed movement in the history of civilizations. Steven Pinker, a renowed psychologist and linguist, who wrote ""The Language Instinct"" in the year 1994. It is a thoroughly researched book about some clinching questions from the world of linguistics.Before actually discussing about the book, it is important to give some key takeaways from the massive piece of work. These key points will help you determine, if at all you would want to pick up this book. 1. Language is not a cultural artifact that we learn through nurture, but part of a complex and specialised part of our brains, ingrained in our biological makeup. The Language Instinct is wired in our brains at an unconscious level. It's innate and universal. 2. There is a Universal Common Grammar amongst humans, irrespective of the language. The idea of Universal Common Grammar has been heavily borrowed from Noam Chomsky's research and the book builds upon it by saying that babies don't learn grammar rules from their parents from a young age, but still are able to speak grammatically correct sentences. It is an argument based on the premise that some grammar rules are part of our genetical and biological code, making it easier for young kids and babies to speak grammatically, irrespective of learning. It is a common sentence structure that we all share since birth, with some natural variations in different languages. For more on this topic, I am putting a link here which is a small-brief on the concept of Universal Common Grammar (https://www.britannica.com/topic/univ...) 3. There is a language of thought called Mentalese. We do not require words necessarily to think, since thought process has its own language. Supporting linguistic relativity, Pinker says that thoughts of the speaker require something beyond words, which is mentalese. Simply put, mentalese is the idea that humans think in visual terms through representations, in a pictorial form rather than in a literal sense using words. ""Representational theory of mind"" would mean that our brains are wired to think in terms of images and not words, which is why babies even though are unable to speak are scientifically known to have thought process. (Note: An interesting article here which questions mentalese for bilingual speakers- https://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewconten...) 4. Why are there more than one languages, if all humans come equipped with the same instinct and biological program? Well, Steven after drawing from Darwin's theory of evolution, points out three main reasons for linguistic diversity among humans: Innovation, learning and migration. There is a selective pressure on humans to make language and speech an innate part of their system, in order to fully cooperate with other similarly situated humans around as well as to ensure survival of the race. It also focuses on ability of humans to reanalyse the words of the speaker and innovate something completely unique from it. (Interesting fact: @pg. 249- He discusses Sanskrit as world's oldest language which has mind-boggling similarities with earlier languages spoken in West)5. In nature v. nurture debate, it is nature which wins. Babies do not learn language from their parents, what they learn essentially is how to use speech and vocabulary. Learning of grammar is inherent, and therefore need not be a necessary requirement of outside nurture. We also know that it is difficult to acquire a second language in adulthood, rather than in childhood, for the simple reason that our neural circuits concerning language are at their peak in early childhood making it easier to pick up different languages. 6. You can see language in action in the left hemisphere of most right-handed persons and in right hemisphere in left-handed persons. There is no single organ or part of the brain, but a complex activity centre in the left hemisphere which develops our language instinct and decodes our grammar code. Now, let's see how this book comes across to a reader.  Writing an interesting book is not enough, if it extremely difficult and unintelligible to read. Keeping in mind that not many readers are going to be linguistics, cognitive scientists or psychologists, this book is supremely technical for layman. A book which is interesting and painful to go through in equal measures. While his research and arguments are convincing, it makes for highly academic read. A person with a background in any of the aforementioned fields would be more well-versed in reading a heavy piece of research, rather than persons who like popular science. It required some easy to understand and accessible writing.   This book is heavily influenced by Noam Chomsky's work and research, and Pinker openly admits to the same in the book. Also Pinker relies heavily on Darwin to substantiate his arguments. Therefore, anyone who has either read Chomsky or Darwin earlier can find this work a good piece of research. The scientific urge to get to the bottom of questions, which we may have wondered at some point of time, will rub on the readers, provided one reads it with patience and high-levels of concentration.

215,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,5,"The best summary of the Language Instinct I found in another Pinker book, The Blank Slate: ""Language is based on a combinatorial grammar designed to communicate an unlimited number of thoughts. It is utilized by people in real time via an interplay of memory lookup and rule application. It is implemented in a network of regions in the center of the left cerebral hemisphere that must coordinate memory, planning, word meaning, and grammar. It develops in the first three years of life in a sequence from babbling to words to word combinations, including errors in which rules may be overapplied. It evolved through modifications of a vocal tract and brain circuitry that had other uses in earlier primates, because the modifications allowed our ancestors to prosper in a socially interconnected, knowledge-rich lifestyle.""What Pinker does is present Noam Chomsky's revolutionary theory of deep grammar as an evolved adaptation of the species. Chomsky was skeptical that universal grammar could be explained by the process of natural selection, and so that is where this book takes off: to match cognitive linguistics to the Neo-Darwinian paradigm. Chomsky's theory is that language has an innate structure in the mind, like a computer has built in hardware. Though languages may differ in gender pronouns or the order of noun to verb, all languages have a universal structure. Latin has gendered pronouns compared to English, but whether pronouns are gendered or not is a reality all languages have. Every language has a noun phrase and a verb phrase regardless of the word order. ""Pigs fly"" is about a simple sentence as one can get; pigs is the noun phrase and fly is the verb phrase. Also universal is the auxiliary which tells something about the relation of noun and verb. ""Pigs don't fly."" The auxiliary is parallel to the copula in logic (are, are not): ScP. The auxiliary belongs to the noun phrase. In every language there is an object an action, just as in logic there is a subject, a copula and a predicate.This fundamental division of language and logic into the relation of noun-verb and subject-predicate is related to the perception of the world into space and time. Things can be separated into objects which persist in time in different spaces and do different things in particular times and places. This is advantageous for the survival of the species. ""It's a jungle out there, and the organism designed to make successful predictions about what is going to happen next will leave behind more babies designed just like it. Slicing space-time into objects and actions is an eminently sensible way to make predictions given the way the world is put together...Look away, and the rabbit still exists."" There are two rules used to convey meaning: Saussure's arbitrariness of the sign which pairs sound with conventional meaning and Wilhelm Von Humboldt´s ""language makes infinite use of finite media."" A sign can stand for just about anything, and the combination of words with recursion, reuse of phrases, can produce seemingly infinite words with different meanings. ""The way language works, then, is that each person's brain contains a lexicon of words and the concepts they stand for (a mental dictionary) and a set of rules that combine the words to convey relationships among concepts (a mental grammar).""Pinker criticizes the influential Sapir-Whorf hypothesis: that language determines or is necessary for any conscious awareness. It would be strange if animals had no awareness at all. From an evolutionary standpoint this is absurd as humans evolved from a non-speaking common ancestor. The hard version of Sapir-Whorf is linguistic determinism, the weak version is linguistic relativity that language shapes our perception. Infants and animals exhibit a basic cognitive ability to differentiate things. The claims Sapir-Whorf relies on are reports of languages which lack words for certain colors. What experiments show, in particular the one by Elizabeth Rosch with the Dani people, is that people are able to understand a color in relation to ones they have words for. As Pinker says, it would be incredulous that language could alter what the physiological senses give us, and rewire the cones, rods, and retina of our eyes. Language is an adaptation itself rooted in physiology, though I think sentient awareness is a different thing than self-consciousness which requires language.""Though most common words have many meaning, few meanings have more than one word. That is, homonyms are plentiful, synonyms rare.""This goes to dissuade fears of a George Orwell 1984 future where language is used to alter people´s perception of reality. In his famous essay Politics and the English Language Orwell argued that totalitarian regimes justified their actions by debasing language into simple emotional phrases that are either totally positive or totally negative. Ideas can be condensed into unambiguous phrases and ideally into single words which will invert the natural human suspicion of power into total submission, like Miniluv for the ministry of love which tortures people. While this may be a more effective means of state communication and propaganda, it isn´t going to destroy our perception of reality.""The twenty first century toddler may be Winston Smith's revenge.""Several organs are used in the production of speech: the vocal cords, the trachea, the tongue and the mouth. Air leaves the lungs through the trachea (windpipe) which opens into the larynx (voice box, visible as the Adam's apple). The larynx is a valve with an opening covered by two flaps of muscle tissue called vocal cords but really are vocal folds. The frequency of vocal folds opening and closing determines pitch. Our brains process language in the left hemisphere: Wernicke's area is associated with language understanding and Broca's area is associated with production of language. Language production usually begins at age one, word combination at one and a half, and fluent grammatical sentences at two or three. Infants can already distinguish between sounds and have a basic mental language, ¨mentalese.¨We think with mental representations, not just with a particular language. This is what computers do with their operating systems for us. ""People do not think in English or Chinese or Apache; they think in a language of thought...There must be extra paraphernalia that differentiate logically distinct kinds of concepts."" ""People without a language would still have mentalese"", like non-human animals and infants do.¨The behaviorist perspective influential to the mid-twentieth century denied a language of thought or any consciousness not translatable to observable behavior. There is no basic language of thought which is universal, programmed in us. It is all learned as individuals. A passage from another Pinker book How the Mind Works is useful here:""The computational theory of mind also rehabilitates once and for all the infamous homunculus. A standard objection to the idea that thoughts are internal representations (an objection popular among scientists trying to show how tough-minded they are) is that a representation would require a little man in the head to look at it, and the little man would require an even littler man to look at the representations inside him, and so on, ad infinitum...Why doesn't all this homunculus talk lead to an infinite regress? Because an internal representation is not a lifelike photograph of the world, and the homunculus that 'looks at it' is not a miniaturized copy of the entire system, requiring its entire intelligence. That indeed would explain nothing. Instead, a representation is a set of symbols corresponding to aspects of the world, and each homunculus is required only to react in a few circumscribed ways to some of the symbols, a feat far simpler than what the system as a whole does. The intelligence of the system emerges from the activities of the not-so-Intelligent mechanical demons inside of it.""The homunculi would correspond to neurons in our brains and transistors in computers I guess. The functions they do collectively are conscious awareness. Consciousness as internal representations do exist, and so does mentalese. From Karen Wynn´s experiments we see that five month infants can do simple mental arithmetic: show a baby a bunch of objects long enough and the baby gets bored and looks away; change the scene and the baby notices the difference and is interested. Five day old babies are also sensitive to number; they notice if when screen removed and more objects are there such as when two Mickey Mouse dolls is placed behind a curtain and notice if the second one taken away. Given these abilities and others also observed in animals we see it is possible to have mental software which can build towards language comprehension and production.For language to be an instinct, there needs to be credible evolutionary mechanisms. BF Skinner whose view of language was opposite of Chomsky's said that instinct just means what we haven't found an explanation for. Instinct for Pinker means innate or heritable, having a basis in our biology and shared by all humans in normal course of development. Natural selection requires different forms of language which can be selected from. Proto-languages would include chimp signing, pidgin, child language in two word stage, and partial language of children raised by children. ""The languages of children, pidgin speakers, immigrants, tourists, aphasics, telegrams, and headlines show that there is a vast continuum of viable language systems varying in efficiency and expressive power, exactly what the theory of natural selection requires."" Pidgin is a language formed by speakers of different languages, and aphasia is damage to the left brain hemisphere which impairs language.One must be careful with speculations for how language began, otherwise we end up with just-so stories which may be useful and entertaining but lack proof. Pinker mentions the Throwing Madonna hypothesis that the reason why most people are right-handed is because prehistoric mothers held their babies with their left arm to calm them with the heartbeat, and so the right hand was free to throw stones at small game. These women survived and passed on their genes, by both pacifying their fussy babies and contributing to the hunt. It´s a fascinating story but its hard to imagine how to prove this is the reason why most people around the world are right-handed and left brain dominant. Such stories tend to discredit evolutionary psychology in the minds of critics, so we can come up with scenarios for how language could evolve but it is better to search for data.The language mutant baby could have had siblings to talk to, and other family members would have had other more primitive means of communication, which would have given an advantage to the language mutants. Pinker does think language serves important services for our survival against the environment and in social life. ""If contemporary hunter gatherers are any guide, our ancestors were not grunting cave men with little more to talk about than which mastodon to avoid. Hunter gatherers are accomplished toolmakers and superb amateur biologists with detailed knowledge of the life cycles, ecology, and behavior of the plants and animals they depend on. Language would surely have been useful in anything resembling such a lifestyle...People everywhere depend on cooperative efforts for survival, forming alliances by exchanging information and commitments.""I think sexual selection could also have been a mechanism. Sexual selection occurs when males compete with other males for females and the females choose who to mate with. The selection process is about what can signal greater fitness, in terms of resource provision among other things. The book The Mating Mind argues that intelligence evolved this way by sexual selection as an ornament to impress females like the feathers of the male peacock. Much of our intellect is not about struggling against the environment and definitely doesn´t reflect reality, but demonstrates our ability to expend energy and time to such superfluous social activities like a handicap.Keep in mind that written language is not an instinct. Written language is a late development in human history and is not universal. This is why reading disorders like dyslexia are with us even in our literate societies. Alphabets don't correspond to sounds, at best they correspond to the phonemes of the mental dictionary. Foreigners can usually spell better than they pronounce, as according to Bernard Shaw fish can be spelled as ghoti.Just because language is an instinct doesn't make it not special, just as the fact that birds are designed to fly doesn't make the feat less impressive to us. The big takeaway of The Language Instinct is language is a universal human adaptation with a basis in biology and evolution. No matter how different various human languages are, they share basic structure. This means accepting that there is such a thing as a scientifically meaningful human nature that has something to do with biology and evolution. This belief may be politically incorrect for some people, but it also means on a fundamental level we are the same and can understand one another. I also take away from The Language Instinct that folk language, like folk psychology, isn´t really wrong or useless. Of course it often is wrong from a scientific point of view and science does require precise technical language, but for the purpose of communication mentalese is fine. This was Ludwig Wittgenstein´s insight: that the nature of language is public, and so we can understand one another without a technically precise or scientific language so long as there is an agreed upon meaning of words in a language community.Update 9/25/17:My conclusion is that there is a common syntactical structure to language that is true independent to individual learning, but this does not prove innateness or that language use is an instinct any more than the behavior involved. It’s an important distinction conceptually as going back to John Locke that just because a truth may be a priori or reached by logical necessity by virtue of its structure or definition does not make such a truth innate in the mind. The truths of math and logic are not due to human psychology but are true on their own analytically. The same goes for the structure of language and rules involved. They aren’t inherited any more than math or logic is inherited. They are discovered by us but they not just there in our heads. That explains nothing but infers more to be explained. Language is learned according to our physical abilities and operates according to syntactical rules while the semantic meaning is in a language community of reinforcement. All an instinct is is an unconditioned physical response to stimuli. Certainly our physical use of language evolved but it was for certain definite conditions, eliciting responses from the social environment, the environment in general. An infant’s crying is the language instinct which if not responded to as we can see with the horrific Harlow experiments does not lead to language development but decreased chance of survival, death. Those aspects of the body as coded genetically (and epigenetically perhaps) which aided in eliciting environmental responses which increased fitness to reproduction in past environments are what is inherited but not the behavior itself which is what language is. In hindsight we find as with reality itself a coded structure and regularities in the uses of language, but as with logic and math such a structure holds true without the existence of human “minds” or behavior which are contingent on the selecting environment.

216,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5590114-greg,4,"I'm just about at page 300, but wanted to start working on the review ahead of the end.Look, I know that I'm no linguist. I started learning French about 6 months ago and am fascinated by the differences in languages and the generally gloomy prospects for adult language learners. Why, I wondered, are adults so convinced that they can't learn a language like a child can?I have my own pet hypotheses on this question, and they're somewhat more practical than Pinker's hypothesis. Mine basically involves how much time, desire, and willing partners one has to learn from as an adult versus as a child, but people confidently tell me that ""there's more to it than that."" I'm trying to be open-minded to well-researched points of view that don't match mine...but so far I'm extremely distrustful of many of the conclusions in this book. To the degree that a non-fiction book of this type is about imparting new, relevant information to the reader, I believe that valid doubts about the logic and conclusions presented in this book are valid reasons to deduct stars in the rating, even though I think it is very engagingly-written.First I have to thank Mr. Pinker for debunking early and forcefully the nonsense belief that we ""think"" in our mother tongues, or that our thoughts are constrained by the languages we know. This idea has always been completely absurd, but I think lots of people in their desire to know deep insights about human nature have uncritically adopted it without thinking it through. If you ""think"" in your mother tongue, then you couldn't think about things that you didn't know the words for. How would you learn a new word at all? The very fact that we often struggle mid-sentence to find the right word, or we forget the names for things, is proof that we have thoughts that are not expressed in words in our brains. A bit of common sense, people. Come on!But moving on to the major theme of the book, Chomsky's Universal Grammar and the stunning precociousness of young children when it comes specifically to language skills, I have grave doubts about the conclusions on offer.And it's only right that I admit that I have not read many of the relevant studies, did not perform much linguistic coursework in college (though I did do some), and my doubts are essentially just intuitions informed by my struggles to learn Latin in high school, a bit of Russian in college, and French right now. That is, my intuitions are scientifically moot.But I think recent doubt cast over the research methods and findings of many of the landmark studies in the ""soft-sciences"" of psychology, sociology, etc. leave a bit of an opening for questioning first of all just how valid and significant the cited research in the book is, and then there are the numerous soft spots in the line of reasoning that leads from ""3-year-olds are pretty good at speaking"" to ""humans have an innate sense of grammar that assists their learning as children (but presumably not as adults.)""My complaint is mostly that Pinker seems to be eager to jump from suggestive results in studies to provocative conclusions without examining potential alternate explanations beyond a cursory dismissal of the alternatives that immediately jump to mind. In fact, as far as it has been presented at this point in the book, Chomsky's ""poverty of the stimulus"" argument could largely be called ""cursory dismissal of obvious alternatives.""For example, there is the argument that children couldn't have learned to call a fictional monster that eats a certain kind of rodent a ""mice-eater"" when it eats mice, but a ""rat-eater"" when it eats rats. It's used throughout the book to remind us of a seeming intuition that children have, wherein they correctly guess that a monster is a ""mice-eater"" despite lacking an example like ""rats-eater"" to go off of as an example to extrapolate from. After all, a ""rat-eater"" eats rats and a ""mice-eater"" eats mice, but there is no such construction as a ""rats-eater."" But I have serious reservations about this example and line of reasoning, even if the results of the study that support it are 100% as presented by Pinker. First of all, as a native English speaker with my own intuition about how to create heretofore unseen constructions like ""rat-eater"" or ""squirrel-eater,"" etc., I have to say that ""mice-eater"" doesn't even strike my ear as sounding correct, which kind of dashes the impact that this example is supposed to have. Now I may be wrong about my interpretation, and perhaps ""mice-eater"" is better than ""mouse-eater"", which is my preferred form, but I think the fact that a native American English speaker has some questions over the more correct form is a bit of a fly in the ointment anyway. To me, a ""mice-eater"" seems to imply that the monster eats mice by the handful, whereas a ""mouse-eater"" eats mice one at a time. In which case ""rat-eater"" would be correct because probably it's only eating one rat at a time, but maybe a monster could eat a whole handful of mice at a time. I guess I'm just being charitable here, though--to me ""mouse-eater"" sounds better in either case.Lots of these ""poverty of the stimulus"" arguments propping up Pinker's/Chomsky's conclusions seem pretty weak to me. I think I read an article a long time ago that characterized ""poverty of the stimulus"" as an argument from ""poverty of the imagination,"" and that feels accurate. I'm already writing a long review so I'll limit myself to one example--the oft-used ""Don't giggle me!"" mistake that children make. It is argued that since no adult would have said ""He giggled me"" or ""Don't giggle me"" to a child, the child lacks a stimulus to create this kind of phrase. Therefore, the child is overgeneralizing a grammar rule that they have learned. For example, you can say ""I'm burning"" and ""He burns me,"" but for some reason ""I'm giggling"" does not correspond to ""He giggles me."" This example is presumably significant because it goes to show that children's ""mistakes"" tend to be hyper-grammatical, and the real rule that we're faulting them for missing is an exception or is in some cases ungrammatical, and they fail because they are doing the grammatical thing. In essence, this example shows that even many counterexamples to children's grammatical abilities are in fact examples of how grammatically-inclined they are.Now I don't disagree that the child is overgeneralizing, but I am interested in the dispute about whether the child is really in possession of the knowledge of a grammar rule, and to what extent acquiring such a ""grammar rule"" is significant. It's significant to Pinker and Chomsky because they posit that children have an innate capacity to acquire grammar rules, but for an adult language learner like me, I'm quite suspicious. By any measure, I am acquiring more correct French more quickly than a child does despite not being immersed like a child is, and many committed language learners have similar experiences (though many don't.) Of course, eventually children pass up adult language learners, but this almost certainly has to do with more available time to practice, more indulgence from practice partners, a compulsion to learn more to keep pace with peers and in academics, and a longer time-horizon to become native-like speakers. So I'm suspicious of the ""child's innate capacity for grammar"" idea in the first place, and when I see it propped up on wobbly legs like ""poverty of stimulus,"" I want to kick at those legs and see if they hold.I see a number of problems with the logic chain between ""He giggled me"" and the endpoint of ""Children have an innate capacity to acquire grammar."" I don't mean to say that Pinker says ""He giggled me"" implies a language instinct, but it is an example marshaled in support of the poverty of the stimulus argument that underlies the language instinct. So is ""he giggled me"" a significant example of a child using a grammar rule that they could not have learned from their environment? My contention is that although this is a valid example of experimenting with a form that the child has never heard directly based on intuition from other things that a child has heard and said, it doesn't seem significant to me. It's significant to Pinker and Chomsky specifically because they look at language in a certain grammatical way, wherein it is constructed according to combinatorial rules of construction. But is that a true understanding of language? Or is it a potential misunderstanding? For example, Pinker says that the child is generalizing from ""It burned"" -> ""He burned it"" to ""He giggled"" -> ""She giggled him."" But is this really the way it happened? Or is it possible that the child mistakenly thinks that every verb has both a transitive and intransitive entry in the dictionary? The fact that a child might not make the mistake with certain other intransitive verbs (verbs that don't take a direct object) may be due more to the lack of opportunity to make those errors due to what the words mean. Maybe a child would also make the mistake of saying ""The cat got"" instead of ""the cat got something,"" except that ""got"" doesn't really make any sense without a direct object, even to a child, but ""giggle"" does make a kind of sense even when it does have a direct object. Maybe if you asked a child ""Who got the ice cream?"" he might say ""I got!"" instead of ""I got it!"" I don't know. But nevertheless, it's not impossible to think of alternate explanations for why a child might try ""She giggled him."" Maybe the child was just venturing a guess and didn't feel confident in what they were saying anyway. Maybe the child had a feeling that it was incorrect to use ""giggle"" that way, but they weren't sure of the correct construction so they said ""She giggled him"" anyway. I don't see how it would be possible to dismiss all of the possible reasons that a child might have arrived at this phrase without having an innate knowledge of the grammar, but Pinker and Chomsky do dismiss it.---Part 2.Pinker goes a lot farther in the last 130 pages toward describing why he thinks that there's an innate language module in humans. I'm upgrading my review to four stars from three, because some of my early complaints were addressed late in the book.However, he still undeniably loses a star for his completely absurd defense of the saying ""I could care less."" He says it's sarcastic, because of the way it's intoned. No way. Pinker is living on Crazy Island. It's way too oblique to be a popular sarcastic saying. For it to be sarcastic, the person being sarcastic has to be sure of how we're going to understand what they say, while at the same time their intonation would indicate that they don't really mean what they're saying. Like ""Oh, that's helpful."" But ""I could care less."" is not straightforward enough to easily betray your meaning with your intonation. In fact, if it were said sarcastically, I would expect it to sound more like ""I could care less.""People who say ""I could care less"" don't think they're being sarcastic; they usually defend the saying as meaning ""I don't care at all, so it's impossible for me to care less."" Then they think about what they actually said and say ""Oh...I knew that. I was just...just...just slurring my couldn't!"" I appreciate Pinker's defenses of certain annoying ""rules"" of language, like the mandate to not split infinitives (tee-hee) and the mandate to say ""Whom do you love?"" instead of ""Who do you love?"" But some things that people say actually are wrong, and ""I could care less"" is one of them.Also, despite the extra chapters devoted to explaining a possibly evolutionary/biological brain module for language, I still strongly feel that the sum of the arguments presented adds up to significantly less than a proof of the existence of a language instinct that intuitively understands Universal Grammar.And I guess a major complaint I have about this proposition of a language instinct is the very idea of Universal Grammar itself. I haven't ready Chomsky, but...but I just don't think it exists. For example, Pinker described a lot of these rules for the Universal Grammar as conditional: if your language has this one kind of feature, then it doesn't have a different feature, or if your language has this kind of construction in it, then it will also have this kind of construction.That doesn't make much biological sense. Languages, despite similarities, have some extraordinary differences. If all languages were Romance languages, I would be more inclined to accept the Universal Grammar, but does it make sense for a few hundred generations of Western Europeans to be storing an evolutionarily-designed instinct for how to construct tonal, tenseless languages like Mandarin, or agglutinating African languages from the conditional rules applying to tonal and agglutinating languages, according to the rules of Universal Grammar?Something stinks in all of this. Isn't it possible that the explanation is a lot simpler? Maybe based on some shared basic principles of a language that are learned easily enough as children, only certain other kinds of constructions make sense. I wanted to slap Pinker each time he claimed that children recognize rules like ""John might fish"" and ""John loves hot dogs,"" but never make the mistake of saying ""John might hot dogs."" There's a simple reason that kids don't make that mistake--what would ""John might hot dogs"" even mean? Children don't say it because they never have a thought that would potentially be expressed as ""John might hot dogs."" As for more probable errors, children cutely make them all the time. Imagine that John was at the grill cooking a fish and a child is looking on. It hears someone say out of context ""John might fish,"" meaning that John would consider going fishing later. The child, however, associates the idea of ""might fish"" with ""might cook a fish"" or ""might eat a fish."" Later the child returns and John is grilling a hot dog. Might the child not then say ""John might hot dog?"" It doesn't sound absurd to me.So I suppose I need more convincing about Universal Grammar. Lots of people say ""Yep, it's real, just go read Chomsky,"" so maybe that's what I need to do. Of course, a lot of people also say ""It's a bunch of baloney,"" and they have read Chomsky, so I don't know.The last few parts about the concept of the Universal People and shared human instinct/learning modules was pretty much all speculation, as far as I can tell. Interesting stuff to think about, but I don't think that we can take a hypothesis like the existence of universal characteristics of all peoples and use that idea as any kind of support for the language instinct hypothesis."

The red plague rid youFor learning me your language! - The TempestLanguage is a constant creation of alternative worlds. There are no limits to the shaping powers of words, proclaims the poet. ‘Look,’ says Khlebikov, that virtuoso of extreme statement in his ‘Decrees to the Planet’, ‘the sun obeys my syntax’. Uncertainty of meaning is incipient poetry. In every fixed definition there is obsolescence or failed insight. The teeming plurality of languages enacts the fundamentally creative, ‘counter-factual’ genius and psychic functions of language itself. It embodies a move away from unison and acceptance – the Gregorian homophonic – to the polyphonic, ultimately divergent fascination of manifold specificity. Each different tongue offers its own denial of determinism. ‘The world’, it says, ‘can be other.’ Ambiguity, polysemy, opaqueness, the violation of grammatical and logical sequences, reciprocal incomprehensions, the capacity to lie – these are not pathologies of language but the roots of its genius. Without them the individual and the species would have withered. – George Steiner, After Babel (234-5)I read Steven Pinker’s 
The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language 
because I wanted to know something about Noam Chomsky’s linguistic ideas without making the likely futile attempt to read Chomsky. The book fulfilled this purpose as well as I could wish - except for a few boggy passages it was clearly written, with frequent humor, and the material very well organized. As I reached the end, I became curious about linguistic dissenters from Chomsky and whether these had legitimate scientific arguments or were driven to apostasy by Chomsky’s politics or personality. I briefly toyed with then abandoned the idea of reading Tom Wolfe’s The Kingdom of Speech; it was clear this would have quickly turned into a pure hate-reading experience. I did discover that Wolfe’s main source on anti-Chomsky linguistics is Daniel Everett who, linguistic accomplishments aside, seems pretty interesting as a character. I may eventually read his book Don't Sleep, There are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle, but for now I was satisfied with this long New Yorker article by John Colapinto. Overview:1. An Instinct to Acquire an Art. The claim that language is an instinctual rather than learned behavior.2. Chatterboxes. The universality of language and the commonalities of the necessary components that make up languages.3. Mentalese. Showing that thought is not dependent on language.4. How Language Works. A description of grammar - Chomsky's theories - how grammar builds meaning.5. Words, Words, Words. Vocabulary; inferred rules governing the building of words (tenses, possessives, compounds).6. The Sounds of Silence. How speech embodies language and affects its structure.7. Talking Heads. How language is understood by the hearer or reader.8. The Tower of Babel. Conjectures about the variety of languages and their origins.9. Baby Born Talking - Describes Heaven. The pattern of infants' language development. Conjectures about how this learning occurs.10. Language Organs and Grammar genes. - The hardware of language - brain, neurons, genes. Interesting on how brain injuries or damage can affect speech ability in very specific grammar-related ways.11. The Big Bang. Contemplates evolutionary paths to language. Mocking accounts of human researchers teaching chimps and gorillas sign language or language-like symbol manipulation. More than once Pinker makes the claim that ""natural selection can take skills that are acquired with effort and uncertainty and hardwire them into the brain,"" (pg. 377) which seems to me indistinguishable from Lamarckism. Unlike Pinker, Chomsky himself seems unwilling to definitely say that language is a result of natural selection. The alternative would seem to be that, given a sufficiently large brain, it ""just growed"". (Topsy's intuitive regularization of the irregular English verb grow is itself an example of Universal Grammar in action.)12. The Language Mavens. Grammar gurus are, at best, entertainers like Richard Lederer and at worst, scolds like William Safire who, in looking for grammatical ""errors"" violating arbitrary rules of usage, miss the inventiveness and nuance of nonstandard English and unusual, but grammatical constructions.13. Mind Design. The implications on the brain having an inherited ""language module"". Opposition to the ""blank slate"" Standard Social Science Model. A list of characteristics of the ""Universal People"", human behaviors and practices that exist in all cultures and lands; Pinler's conjecture on what sort of mental ""modules"" might underlie these characteristics."
218,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7807167-ayman,5,"I am still on the journey of exploring human nature. This book explains language which is another capacity we take for granted as part of daily life. Thinking of it, It’s really a miracle that I can convey an idea in a Facebook post so that anyone could reconstruct the same idea with all its intricate details in their mind any time they read my words. There are so many questions to unpack and here is my summary of it:  1- Are we born with language skills or do we learn them from society?Up until Noam Chomsky’s universal grammar revolution, behaviourism was the dominant theory on linguistics, that’s people learn behaviours (including language) from society and are not born with them like physical features. Chomsky challenged that view and, supported by significant evidence from neuroscience, that we are born with language centers in our brain that has universal grammar skills and when we learn a specific language, say English, we only train those brain regions to the parameters specific to English such as the Subject Verb Object-SVO structure used in English . Chomsky and his friends spent their career synthesizing hundreds of languages from all corners of the planet to arrive to those universal grammar rules, such as the concepts of noun phrases, verb phrases, recursive structures e.g., “The boy’s shirt’s button” and found them in all languages. Furthermore, neuroscience showed that different levels of damage to brain regions such as the Broca and Wernicke areas have specific effects, e.g., inability to identify names in general or even specific categories of names such as fruits or colours. Chomsky’s universal grammar is the current model of understanding language, behaviourism is completely ruled out. 2-How did language skills evolve?Thousands of modern human languages developed and changed independently across the globe, however the universal language skills we are born with is believed to have passed down to Homo Sapiens from their Homo Erectus or even older ancestors. We can’t know what was homo erectus language like compared to, say modern English, but we know for sure that no other living species on this planet have our highly complex language organ like no other species other than elephants have their sophisticated trunk organ. Language gave early hunters a great advantage to communicate military and hunting plans, therefore, it’s not hard to imagine why the ruthless force of natural selection favoured it. It’s also believed we were pushed to learn it very early in our lives, because the earlier children learned language, the sooner they would understand their mom’s warnings from the close by sabretooth, hence, the higher their chances to survive and re-produce 3-How are languages different?While technology and science enabled the industrial revolution and the great rise of European political power in the past 500 years, European languages are by no means the most advanced. In fact, some of the languages found in modern day hunter gatherer tribes are so complex it would put English and other common languages to shame! An example of that is the Kivunjo language spoken by less than a million people in Africa has verbs with seven possible prefixes and suffixes, two moods, and fourteen tenses; the verb agrees with its subject, its object, and its benefactive nouns, each of which comes in sixteen genders! I thought Arabic is a sophisticated language, but compared to Kivunjo it’s a child’s play! 4-How does language change?Language change significantly, 1000 years old English could hardly be recognized as the language we speak today. It started in Germanic tribes then had strong Latin and French influences, followed by natural tendencies to simplify, for example. The past tense of verbs used to follow an old model of Take, took. Fight, fought, drive, drove. But the auxiliary ‘did’ transformed to ‘ed’ was an easier way to create past tense versions, e.g., created, played. However, the most common irregular verbs remained in language as a fossil of the old grammar. The same exists in Arabic, where an old complex pluralization grammar “takseer” still lingers besides the easier and more standardized “Mozakkar salem and Moaanath Salem” format. 5-What are the societal implications of linguistic studies?Linguists discovered that languages from India to Europe and several places in between share many common words, such as “mother”, “brother”, etc which led them to believe that early humans who spread eastward to India and Northwards to Europe shared an old common language called the Indo-European language. European racist movements claimed that this language originated in Europe in what’s commonly known as the Arian race. They claim that some Arian tribes migrated to the south spreading the language, however, in the process, they interbred with locals and lost their “Arian purity”. That’s why racist cultures in Nazi Germany and American south banned interracial marriages. Needless to say, this is all bogus, however, racist ideologies are still alive and well in 2018. Highly recommended."
219,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23596724-jane-griffiths,4,"Comrades, this book made me a Chomskyite. No, no, no, not politically, OBVS, but linguistically. I read Chomsky many years ago, and wasn't quite convinced, somewhat under the influence of eg George Steiner.New readers start here: Chomsky said, essentially, that language was innate, and had what he called a deep structure, common to all human languages. Children have a universal grammar, which is hardwired into their brains before birth, so they do not learn language from others but develop it themselves. This is why children who have just started talking say things like ""I goed"" instead of ""I went"" - words they have never heard, but have extrapolated from their pre-verbal grammar. My daughter, aged two, when urged ""Quickly!"", often replied ""I am quickling"". Anyway, I wasn't totally convinced, back then, and was in any case prejudiced against Chomsky because, like too many USian academics, he is a monoglot - but Pinker has done it now. It's certainly clear that children are not language tabulae rasae.Along the way, Pinker points out the Great Eskimo Language Hoax (that there are many words for snow) - in fact the languages of that region typically have fewer words for snow than English does - which hoax is still widely believed; largely I think because people want it to be true. Pinker is also educational and clear. He tells us straight, for instance, that a creole is the language that results when children make a pidgin their native language. All languages are created by children, and they do it by creating a grammar for the words they use. This would invalidate Orwell's Newspeak, as children would creolise it within a generation.Thoughts are not words, Pinker informs us. If they were, how could more than one thought be expressed by a single word? Or vice versa?This book treats of cognitive psychology, and is often complex. I confess to reading the complex accounts of experiments and studies in speech and thought quite quickly, not stopping to study and consider them as I would have to do if I were reading this book in an academic setting.Pinker points out that what he calls ""language mavens"", but which he means prescriptive pedants (people who write to newspapers saying that a preposition is something with which a sentence should never be ended) choose their examples of abominable English from sources like welfare applications, insurance claims, and student papers; in all of these the writers are trying to convince, and to make a good impression, and are only rarely using language that is natural to them. And yes, I know how long that sentence just was.This is not a crowd-pleaser, or a particularly easy read. Pinker's own passions do show through, at times entertainingly: he hates relativism, he says ""more than I hate anything, excepting, maybe, fiberglass powerboats"", and it is a quirkily amusing read in many places without ever being arch or droll.This is a book for anyone interested in language - and we all, in our own ways, are."
220,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35655787-ahmad,4,"Steven Pinker propounds that language isn't just a social construction, acquired by children through mere imitations of sounds in a conversation of two adults. Language is, as Chomsky partially put it, an innate mechanism of the mind. Although Pinker, conceding that Chomsky influenced his views on language, still differs with him on Universal Grammar. How could the mind have evolved without the endowment of natural selection? This investigates more than just a biological claims of language; rather, it delves into intricate compartments of language in morphology, phonology, grammar, syntax, cognitive abilities and speech perception, first language acquisition and the book ends how the mind produces language, which is brief. Of course it is a misunderstanding that thought is superseded by language, it is vice versa; thought supersedes language. And, Pinker, having touched on linguistic determinism in several accounts, illustrated that it's actually symbols, gestures and conventionalized semantics that propel language, through thought, to be produced. This is discussed in great detail in How the Mind Works and his advocacy of the Computational Theory of Mind, and Conceptual Semantics in The Stuff of Thought. What I found intriguing about this book, although not as much as the Stuff of Though, is his redundant content. Pinker at times seems to perpetuate consistent arguments about language, cognition and psychology, which is inherently good from my point of view. However, having read The Blank Slate, The Stuff of Thought, How the Mind Works (60% of it) and the Language Instinct. I've noticed a certain pattern of cross-over references to language, mind, culture and human nature, as if each book, generally, leads to the next one. The Language Instinct, with all its glory, is aimed at the general public, who may or may haven't studied linguistics. I studied linguistics at university and did some extensive reading about it before reading this book. I'd say much of what the book says is, for me at least, repeated. But that's not a bad thing. I recommend this however to those who haven't studied a thing about linguistics for its friendly writing style and brimming knowledge that it's got not only on language, but also on the human condition"
221,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69056-ada,4,"""The Language Instinct"" is not an easy read, but it is a fascinating one. Steven Pinker describes in detail the idea that language acquisition is an instinct of the human mind. His thesis is based on Chomsky's research and evolutionary psychology. First of all, Pinker is adamant in his dismissal of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis - the idea that language we speak shapes the way in which we perceive the world. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is often illustrated by the hundreds of words Eskimos supposedly have for snow- in fact, Pinker points out, they have no more than dozen ""but by such standards English would not be far behind: snow, sleet, slush, blizzard...."". Pinker believes that the studies which suggest that our language shapes our perception of the worlds are at times grossly exaggerated, and at times improperly conducted and woefully inadequate. His own suggestion is that we perceive the world with something he calls ""mentalese"": ""people do not think in English or Chinse or apache; they think in a language of thought"". In a way, Pinker's description of mentalese takes us back to the James Joyce vs Virginia Woolf debate: do people think in words or do they think with the use of images?Pinker's suggestion of mentalese introduces his general attack on linguistic relativism. His hypothesis that human beings all share a basic language instinct is linked to inherent belief a single structure of the human mind which is the same for all mankind. The book is particularly interesting in its exploration of language acquisition in children. Not many people are aware that: ""A newborn has a vocal tract like a nonhuman mammal (...) making it anatomically possible to drink and breathe at the same time. By three months the larynx has descended deep into the throat, opening up the cavity behind the tongue to move forwards and backwards and produce the variety of vowel sounds used by adults.""My one slight problem with the book is Pinker's dismissive attitude towards language learning in adults. His patronising attitude towards the English of Conrad, Nabokov and others seems to indicate that it is useless to learn any new language past the age of seven (which is the acquisition window for being able to become a native speaker). He seems to comfortably ignore the fact that the two people he mentions above are two of the best writers in the English language, despite their struggles with accents and unwillingness to give live interviews. There are a great many aspects of ""The Language Instinct"" that I did not manage to touch upon in this short review- suffice it to say, it is a very informative read for anyone with the slightest interest in linguistics."

In other words, their professional ""expertise"" has made them complete and total gulls. Just as fundamentalism disposes you to accept accounts of miracles, being of the trained anthropologist faith disposes you to believe in any exotic account from Elsewhere. In fact, a lot of this nonsense is part of the standard intellectual equipment of every educated social scientist, providing a permanent obstacle to balanced reasoning about various psychological and social phenomena. I figure it will make me permanently unemployable, so I am not aiming to finish it any time soon.""“With a few exceptions… mainstream American Linguists have left the field entirely to the Mavens. Or as Bollinger calls them, the Shamans.In language there are no licensed practitioners, but the woods are full of midwives, herbalists, colonic irrigationists, bonesetters, and general-purpose witch doctors, some abysmally ignorant, … whom we shall call shamans. We are living in an African village and Albert Schweitzer has not arrived yet. Most of the prescriptive rules of the language mavens [i.e., shamans] make no sense on any level. They are bits of folklore that originated for screwball reasons several hundred years ago and have perpetuated themselves ever since …The rules conform neither to logic nor to tradition … Indeed, most of the ‘ignorant errors’ these rules are supposed to correct display an elegant logic and an acute sensitivity to the grammatical texture of the language, to which the language mavens are oblivious.”"

In our study of rectifying and correcting her phonetics made me curious about language.I always knew that there are four aspects of any language Read, write, understand and speak. Not many people excel in all these 4 aspects for all the languages that they know. If you take my example English and native 2 regional indian languages, i cover all aspects but Arabic i can read but donot speak or understand. This is just one of the example of complexity of linguistics.Even if you take just one language that we use everyday - English, the pronunciation or accent is different depending on which part of the world you are coming from. This book digs into the origin, morphology, phonology of languages. There are parts where the book explains the grammar that we use taking English language as an example and i must confess to be lost in those parts - grammar never being my stronger point or much of interest. But the parts that puts matter of fact of human linguistic instinct would make you go ""huh how come i never paid attention to this!"". This book not only explains about spoken, written language but also about sign language. Deaf babies babble with their hands just like babies babble with voice - a fact that i didn't know at all. Linguistics is such a massive topic that i never could think someone would be able to explain it at all, Pinker does a phenomenal job in this. The book should have been titled Linguistics for dummies! Highly recommend this book to parents of newborns, professionals, general population of the world. For me it has opened up a whole new world of linguistics and anthropology that i would love to pursue further. And those who are curious on where we are with our daughter, Insha - English as primary language for read, speak, write, understand; phonetics stage and reintroduced Hindi as conversational and understanding language, arabic alphabets as phonetics."

I was really hoping for more and I don't know why I thought I would get it.If you've taken phonology, syntax, semantics, first language acquisition, and second language acquisition, as I have, you've learned this stuff already! And heard many of the exact same examples Pinker uses in the text! And also, read many, if not most, of the studies he cites! And wondered why you bothered reading The Language Instinct!So that was a bummer. I fully admit to HEAVILY skimming the last three chapters because I was, understandably, pretty bored. At the same time though, I can't imagine handing this book to a non-linguistics-student friend and honestly believing that that friend would still let me recommend them books afterward--it feels to technical for people who don't want to be linguists but not all that helpful for someone who might be on their way to becoming one. Who is this book for?It's just a really weird space for a popular science book to sit in.Also, Pinker kind of badmouths Carl Sagan a little--not too seriously, it felt like more of a misreading--but it offended my Sagan-loving sensibilities while I was already kind of over this book. It felt like the last straw."
225,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3410606-ingrid,5,"This book is great, okay. I usually am super nitpicky in my reviews but you win Pinker, you've written a great book. Of course it helps that I'm probably the exact target audience (so take this review as you will).tldr; have you ever wondered about language? Or maybe you haven't but now you're curious - this book will give you a the rundown of everything there is to know at a very readable, friendly, introductory level. Yes, there are concepts you might not understand, but this book should propel you to do more research/reading if you're interested in a specific part/topic and instigate that language love and curiosity.At least it did for me.Okay, I might have 'cheated' a little since this is basically what my major (Cognitive Science) back in college was about. I had context in almost all the topics he covered, but it was great to get another perspective as well as dive a little deeper on the English language. Oh, note, this book is mainly about the English language. He does touch a little on other languages when doing comparisons but I don't think he has the background (and he acknowledges this) on languages such as Chinese to do a in-depth analysis on that. It was also refreshing to have an author acknowledge things he did not know. In the end, he presents a few pages on things that changed sine he wrote the book - ie. theories that were disproved or veered off since then. It made the book seem much more conversational instead of a dry textbook full of facts type of feel.I feel like if you don't have any background, it might be a little tricky to understand (as I see from the other reviews on here). But I do urge you then to just find the sections you're interested in! Since the book covers a ranger a topics from grammar (love) to biology to artificial intelligence (also a real interesting section considering this was published in 1994). It serves a great intro to this crazy world of human language and cognition and Pinker does make the effort to make it as readable and enjoyable (a lot of jokes) as possible."
226,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107220923-rahul-banerjee,5,"The best book that I have come across, on the topic of linguistics, so far. This book deals mostly with the syntactic aspects of language and the possible cognitive mechanisms that are critical for language acquisition and understanding in humans. There are 2 popular schools of thoughts regarding this. The first, championed by the likes of Noam Chomsky, believes that every human possesses something called a 'universal, generative grammar', which is an innate mental framework that underlies any language and is the mechanism responsible for learning languages. The other school of thought, that of Linguistic Relativity which was championed by the likes of Sapir-Whorf, believes that language learning isn't something that can be associated with any distinct internal machinery and is something that must be taught and is something that has the ability to affect our thoughts and actions.Professor Pinker clearly belongs to the former group but unlike Chomsky, who took a purely analytical approach to linguistics, he also improves upon the validity of the universal grammar theory by providing experimental evidence from his own resesrch into cognitve mechanisms of language learning and often, language therapy.In addition to syntax, topics on phonology and morphology are also discussed in separate chapters and make for a fairly complete reading of the subject. The content is extremely accessible and comes with an extensive bibliography for those interested in exploring certain topics at greater depths."
227,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47074510-the-wanderer,5,"This was the sole book on language or linguistics in the bookstore, and I wanted a book on that topic, so I bought it, though I didn't really want to. I'm not a scientist or particularly interested in learning about science, but I do respect it, and the only other encounters I've had with evolutionary psychology made me feel the field was incredibly lame at best, as in no-science-involved-here. Apparently I've had a poor sampling (probably because the stuff I read generally isn't written by scientists). I put down this book feeling like I understand evolution and natural selection better than before, and appreciating, if not fully understanding, how thought and language may be connected to those processes. I left thinking he knows what he's talking about, and even that maybe, one day, I'll have to follow up and read more on the topic. Big win, Pinker! But more importantly for me is I learned so much about how language works in the mind - I was fascinated by his explanation of the Walkmen/Walkmans dilemma, for example, and by the experiments that reveal to us how children analyze language use. This book covered so much ground! It hits that sweet spot of being written for a popular audience as a survey of a large academic field, without being too informal or gimmicky, yet also not being stiff and dry. And despite the amount of STUFF, it traveled at an appropriate pace and was well-organized.Now, having stated my admiration and appreciation for what he wrote, I would like to make a few critical notes.First, having recently discovered that a friend of mine is an ""aphantasiac"" and does not have a mind's eye/ear/empirical sense, I do question his concept of ""mentalese"", or at least what I understand him to be saying. I know myself that sometimes my thoughts DO present themselves in English.Second, while I'm not a scientist, I am a careful reader, so I can say that Pinker's argumentation is not as watertight as he'd like it to be. He occasionally forgets what he's arguing for: for example, he's not worried about losing the word ""whom"" because descriptivism, but ""whom"" is stupid in the first place and ""who"" should be prescribed as the better option. What? Sometimes he even contradicts himself: Our larynx dropped because of the evolutionary advantage that language gave us. But neanderthals might have used a perfectly functional language despite undropped larynges. Third, I did finally get lost in the last two or three pages. Too many high-level ideas packed into too few words to follow or understand the point. Way to end with a bang?Fourth, he has a surprising number of typos and plain mistakes that I'm surprised weren't fixed by the editor in reprints - for example, he once refers to a ""quarter-twist"" as able to correct a half-twist.But while I may have questions and disagreements with this book, I have to give it to Pinker for translating something so broad and deep and detailed into something so manageable for a lay reader. I may have bought it because I had no other options, but this is one that'll stay on my shelf for a very long time."
228,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56212685-lakmus,4,"An oldie but a goodie.I've taken a break half way through (interrupted by a nostalgic binge of Harry Potter audiobooks) and so now have forgotten what Pinker talked about in the first half. I'm sure something has seeped in anyway and will usefully re-emerge at some point. I found it amusing how after a paragraph of polished academic writing Pinker will suddenly make a witty comment or say something colloquial or slang-y. I hope I too will some day reach the level of self-confidence and authority to refute an argument with something similar to: ""To this I say: maven, shmaven."" (This was followed up with more reasoning, but appreciate the nerve!)The last chapter was naturally of most interest to me (evolutionary psychology, modularity debate) and pulled some interesting references out of it. Overall, I skimmed some parts, just because I am already familiar with the arguments or the studies, but there was always some interesting opinion or conclusion, so the book is still enjoyable if you have some background in the area. Probably gonna be mindblowingly cool in places if you did not study any cognitive psychology or linguistics or something similar. (Although may be a little dry if you get too hung up on auxilaries and predicates and noun phrases moving about in such and such way. A few Wikipedia articles can probably help here for the likes of me who don't know much about grammar terms)."
229,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87877492-gabriel,3,"I’m going to struggle reviewing this book simply for the fact when I purchased it I was misinformed as to what it was based upon.I was looking for a book to help with foreign language learning and while this was slightly helpful it wasn’t really what I was looking for. However after reading this I can’t help but feel there were many things about my own language and how we take to learning it which was really useful information to know and very interesting also.It’s was strange to notice all the misconceptions surrounding the English language and could tell that Steven Pinker felt very strongly opposed to what some linguists believe is the correct use of speech and how that may well be entirely incorrect.The fact that as species we have an instinct to naturally learn the language of our native tongue or that in which we are raised makes us completely unique to all other animals.What I also found intriguing was the fact of how some people could struggle to express words in their speech but were still able to read and write to an advanced level. I believe he mentioned a famous Polish writer who’s name I can’t remember, but he quoted him saying that his writing was excellent yet when he spoke it was like that of a 10 year old due to English not being his first language.Overall it was a good book even though it wasn’t exactly what I was looking for but if it’s a topic of real interest to you I’d highly recommend it."
230,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30182712-alexander-miles,5,"I first started reading this book during a layover in an airport, surrounded by a language I did not speak. It was in that context that I dived head-first into Steven Pinker's book outlining the case for an intrinsic instinct underlying human language. Pinker provides a significant amount of detail to keep a non-linguist (and non-neuroscientist) in context with the arguments, as well as thoroughly entertained. Several passages are dedicated to wrestling with common criticisms of modern english, and prescriptivism more generally, all of which are surprisingly fun to read even if they're a bit of a branch off the central argument of the book. Previously I'd never put much thought into language as a marvelous neurological feat, outside perhaps the occasional polyglot, so the central essence of this book was all quite new to me. I'll also admit I'd been awed by the signing apes and other animals-with-language that have made the news over the years, the self-same ones that Pinker thoroughly explains away. All said, I thoroughly enjoyed both the entertaining anecdotes and more contagious arguments - both have made me more thoughtful about the things people say and the machinery that makes ""saying"" even possible. I'd recommend this book highly to anyone curious about language, brains, development, and the quirks of English in particular."
231,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56494686-theres-lessing,3,"Ignore the weird cover. I read this because my linguistics friends recommended it and it gives you (as far as I know!) a good introduction to the field. My favourite point he makes is that humans' language is just a special skill like bats' sonar.I learned some cool things, including how it's possible to do experiments with babies (by checking when they look surprised/pay attention). He also goes into other topics like evolutionary theory, which I knew less about than I realised. For me, it's hard to assess how biased it is - he's pushing his theory of a language instinct and I'm not sure how much of the book is accepted orthodoxy and how much argument.It took me about two months to read this book, reading a chapter at a time - in true Pinker style (from what my friend who read Blank Slate told me) it's pretty dense. He's also a massive fans of examples (I think a typical linguistics trait) and goes a bit OTT on them - feel free to skip the lists! My least favourite chapter was probably where he was just slating ""Language Mavens"" (bad language columnists) who slate other people for bad grammar."
232,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27362230-rhian-pritchard,3,"20% of this was utterly fascinating. It made me think about language, biology, evolution, psychology and sociology in new ways. The other 80% was padding out an essay to make the word count. Perhaps that's because I'm more interested in certain aspects of linguistics? Perhaps it's because I listened to the audiobook? Perhaps it's even because these ideas have been around for so long that they've been absorbed in the public conscience and no longer need such in-depth defence and justification? But I'm pretty sure had I had a physical copy I could have skim-read a decent portion of most of the chapters without leaving too much of the understanding behind. That said, sections of it were worth suffering the rest for. One day I'll probably get a copy to stick post-it notes in and refer back to, but also this is supposed to be a book for the general public and there are bits that I would have had to go away and google if I hadn't already done a very basic linguistics course. It's not an introduction; don't start here unless you've already studied language in some capacity. Don't expect it to be up-to-date. But it's a fascinating reference point. "
233,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95355583-sjoerd-bijl,4,"Very interesting book, regardless of who you are, as someone who enjoys learning foreign languages I should admit that this changed my view a bit on the purpose of it and will leave me thinking on my approaches to them.-The main argument the book makes is that language develops naturally during childhood, it's further discussed that learning a language later in life can't be compared to learning the language as your mother tongue, as the ""grammar"" developed in childhood is the closest to the real language.-On the other hand, the book claims that the ""rule"" that language can't be considered correct, once it has taken a dialect, is nonsense. Once you can see the layer beneath the ""mistakes"" people make by using their way of speaking, and that the main purpose is getting the right message across, language becomes more enjoyable. This gives me confidence in not focussing on perfection too much in learning my target language, but rather seeing the purpose as: Being able to understand, and to communicate, with or without mistakes."

The existence of the language instinct to a certain extent, for example. Nor I appreciate his way of presenting them. It leaves me sad when scientists accuse other scientists of having different points of view. However, I find him brave as there aren't many linguists who embrace the grammatical reality instead of purifying all those who err through the test of hell fire. I expected the book to be more about neuro- and less about linguistics. There was a whole chapter dedicated to how the brain processes language. The topics of all the others were spread across the area of language and the focus was somewhat blurred. Generally, it was refreshing to scan through the book purely out of interest and without the pressure of the necessity to pass the Linguistics exam at Uni."
235,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72748888-sangeetha,3,"Throughout the entire book, the author has one goal of trying to convince us that language is actually a human instinct. Steven Pinker provides viewpoints from different field experts- linguists, psychologists, anthropologists, and various studies. He provides various possibilities and theories that prevail in the field and then provides arguments to convince us that language is in fact an instinct to us humans.Whether or not anyone is convinced by this book that language is an instinct, they would surely end up appreciating the ingenuity of the human brain behind language perception. I found the sections about speech perception and parsing very interesting. Overall, this book gave me a good introduction to how a linguist views language. But, there were many parts of the book where it felt like there was too much technical detail for a reader who is not from this field. "
236,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45321954-jens,2,"Not what I expected. Only the first chapter I found interesting in a philosophical way. The rest is really about the ""How"" of the subtitle. He goes into nitty-gritty detail about why for example the ""nitty"" comes before the ""gritty"", how letters build words, pronounced in specific ways in phonemes, building sentences. Another chapter is his own opinion on how we should me more flexible in grammar rules, with plenty of his personal frustrations. The only take-away was the fresh perspective he offered with reference to the animal kingdom: People talk like spiders spin a web. Short, not the book I wanted to read."

The cover of this book doesn't do justice to the content and research. At times I was completely lost as to what he was trying to explain, but the analogies are brilliant and you will definitely learn something and laugh along the way. His focus is the belief that our brains have the biological makeup to develop language spontaneously, without conscious effort or formal instruction. I would recommend it to linguistic enthusiasts. "
239,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69201273-nitay,4,"A solid work. Pinker writes lucidly, accessible, always plainly and often in a witty manner. He covers most linguistic-adjacent sciences - the nuero-linguistic, as well as the psyco-, the computo-, the evolutionary biologico-, historico-, and plenty others. Sometimes overly pedantic, but the parts you dont like you can often skip, so i cant say it leads to a significant worsening of the experience.

I love that Pinker went to the effort of critiquing Whorf (just elements of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis), because no one does that, but I think he’s only partly right at best. A better defense of language as perception-primer should stick to dialects and jargons of a single language to cut back on some of the extra historical/semantic variables.I was not familiar with the depth-first vs. breadth-first parsing debate, that was interesting."

Pinker also seems to believe that selection acting alone and directly on the language-associated regions of the brain is solely responsible for the evolution of language acquisition. His arguments would be better supported by a more balanced view of how both adaptive and nonadaptive processes might have contributed to the evolution of language. One plus: Pinker is a good writer.

I have meant to read this for a long time, and I waited so long that some of the concepts are outdated. For example, the author states that computers cannot yet ""understand"" human speech well enough to transcribe it. That probably was true in the late 1990s. A lot of the concepts in the book are pretty complex; however there is much that is fascinating, and Pinker takes a technical subject and often discusses it in very down to earth (and often humorous) terms."

Regardless of whether that is true or not, I found it a fascinating book! His style is amiable and easy to understand. Being someone interested in language, I would have this book is more centred on linguistics; there is a good dose of grammar analysis, but in reality it's much more about natural selection, evolution and hereditary/non-hereditary characteristics."

262,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62678201-aaron,4,"I am still a bit unsure of what to make of Steven Pinker as an author, after reading two books by him. I feel he could have used less technical language, but overall, found it accessible. I do appreciate the notes sections, where he made corrections and comments on what has changed since the 1st printing. I appreciate the evolutionary psychology approach to the subject also. "
263,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21750402-nienke,4,"Super interesting, and definitely one of my favourite non-fiction books. Well written, clearly argumented, and it stands the test of time pretty well. Not everything he says I find fully believable (e.g. genes encoding for grammar) but language is explained in a most lucid, logical and also entertaining way.Also, I find the Afterword added ~20 years later and the reference list very helpful."
264,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38805603-jake-dennie,5,"Very dense at times and skips from technical to theoretical and between unrelated topics often, but on the whole absolutely worth the read. I've brought up different concepts from the book in conversation several times within a few months of starting it because it really is eye opening to so much of our everyday lives "
265,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39979107-alex-french,3,"A lot of really interesting content. It was particularly interesting to compare to the almost-three-year-old in our house. I want to give it 4 or maybe 5 stars.It also felt like it really, really, really dragged on in many places, so I'm rating based on how I actually feel about having read it.I suspect some material could really use an update today in 2018."
266,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58030330-jake-wells,3,"I don't have a real argument for the premise that we are born with the ability for forming language, there are many scientific examples in this book, that's the downfall for me. It could have been more accessible as it is an interesting topic, with some clever wordplay and linguist jokes I could just about understand"
267,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9888704-leisha,0,This is a good introduction to the core concepts of human language but it fails to deliver an overall argument in my opinion. Maybe it was the audiobook or the speed at which I consumed this or the fact that I knew a lot of the content already but I feel like this is more a book for students rather than interested professionals/scientists who want to hear another person's point of view.
268,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54137866-elliefint,3,"I wasn't sure what to rate this, because there were a lot of parts where the science and stuff was so cool and interesting that I wanted to give it a five, but also parts where the author was so obnoxious that I wanted to give it a one. So here's halfway between that, learned some really cool stuff, wouldn't necessarily read this guy again."
269,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71103538-krokki,4,"This book is cognitive brain food. Pinker has a powerfull pedagogic way to explain his theories, like when he picks up stuff from earlier chapter in his later ones to make his point clearer and more understood in his complete theory of the language instinct. I will definitely read more of Professor Pinkers books."
270,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116019378-michelle-schermer,2,"Long winded and somewhat dated now in 2020, but I felt that I needed to have read it as a language educator. Pinker provides some great examples, but I often found myself coming up with counter examples and arguments in my head in some of the later chapters. I'm glad that I finally made it through the book after over 5 years of intending to read it."
271,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108070613-caroline-hirko,5,"A great breakdown of how innate/instinctual language is and a fascinating look at universal grammar rules. Pinker's wit and cultural commentary made me LOL in real life. If you have a curious inkling towards linguistics, I highly recommend this book but if you want a list of fun etymologies, this is not for you. (Instead, I'd recommend the podcast History of English or the book Lingo)"
272,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9644972-craig-citro,3,The first third of this book gave me a good sense of how little I really knew about language and linguistics. The fact that it was only the first third of the book gave me a good sense for how much interest I have in the topic. :)
273,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10712120-alan,5,"Steven Pinker, one of the world’s foremost experts on language and the mind, explores how language works, how we learn it, and how it evolves. He lands on the site of language being a human instinct, birthed by evolution."
274,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52417234-mike,2,"A bit on the meh side. Maybe 30% in I decided to get the audio version but fell asleep listening to it several times if memory serves. Sorry, I don't think you'll learn much that's useful? I may be wrong, but always value your time."
275,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34350343-ankit-agarwal,2,"A very intriguing hypothesis around the language instinct is covered in the book. However, it is a difficult read with few powerful insights explained with too much of unnecessary detail for the casual reader. Trust it could have been way shorter."
276,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28153510-amanda-williamson,4,"A really interesting book to read, particularly if you're interested in languages. It influenced how I speak to my kids–I now state the same thing in different ways (you're on the swing, I'm pushing you on the swing, you're swinging high) and often think back to this book. "
277,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99326490-j,1,"Hard to believe a man as supposedly educated as Pinker was completely blind to the obvious fallacies of the theories presented in the book. On the upside, the idea of genetic grammar made for a good laugh"
278,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73297740-salah-abdou-mohamed,4,Pinker is a magnificent thinker. His way of proposing ideas shows you how knowledgeable he is. But showing how very complicated the language is and proposing that it came with evolution and liking it to elephant trunks is just bizarre argument I don't agree with.
279,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15690774-juan-jacobo-bernal,3,"This book opened my eyes to the multi-layered relationship between consciousness, biology, and language. I did find that Pinker tends to digress into academic minutia which made me lose track of the overarching narrative. "
280,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53301204-luke-sookocheff,5,"Fascinating, insightful, and easy to read. Spoiler alert: this book debunks entrenched beliefs about human nature, such as Orwell’s hypothesis that you could eliminate the idea of freedom by censoring the word itself (according to Pinker, you can’t; humans reinvent words when they go missing.)"
281,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57316581-david-laflin,5,What a great read. Steven examines language in a way that you can understand. He does so with a touch of humour throughout the book which makes it both pleasant as well as interesting.Highly recommended to anyone who is interested in linguistics and language..
282,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44206294-tristan,5,It was amusing to read what appeared to be a raging Pinker in 'Language Mavens'. As an evolutionary biologist it's a must have. Was quite a tough read as an untalkative someone who still can't recollect what an infinitive is (even after first reading 'The Sense of Style') but happy I persevered.
283,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61227874-vahidlitphil,0,Negative 3This is bay far the most coherently incoherent book that I have ever come across. Pinker aspires to be a figure like Chomsky in innovation and ends up with a nothing but superficial jokes about language and inconsequential explanations.
284,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58160463-joanna,3,"I love the idea and the learning, but it was pretty technical/heavy, so only read part of it. Would use as reference or read slowly"
285,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9690979-anoop-k,5,A great introduction to language and how it works
286,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49038787-jatin,3,"Fine book, except the parts where the author tries to defend English - for most of those were rather weak arguments that require little attempt to dismiss."
287,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63356592-rebecca-byrne,5,"Perfect intro to linguistics, a discipline that is not what most people think it is!"
288,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4048835-rebecca,4,Actually a very articulate and organized approach towards language and cognitive science. Liked the critique against the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.
289,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75635036-melanie,4,One of the best books i have ever read. Read this to aid my personal statement application for university 3 years ago!
290,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19990739-abe,5,Don’t know why I read blank slate before this. This was the best nonfiction book I’ve read in years.
291,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4161383-john-hatley,3,A fascinating subject and one I am very much interested in.
292,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61392177-victor,5,"I think there was one chapter, chapter 3 or 4, that was kind of a slog (explaining grammar, NPs, VPs, etc.). Very good book; I especially like the evolutionary biology tie-ins. "
293,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11149029-hany,3,Interesting but too lonf
294,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10092190-dee-rose,3,DNF. The first part was very interesting as it had several anecdotes about people but then it got very dry when it started going on about sentence structure and nouns and verbs and so on.
295,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86118921-manuel-brenner,4,"A little outdated at times and it felt a bit unfocused and lengthy at other times, but overall interesting read."
296,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21468757-leasha,4,Oh how I could love to read an updated version of this! 
297,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58706017-kate-callen,5,Great intro to my linguistics degree
298,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6706929-ane,5,5/5. Amazing. top5 of the year maybe.... but it's still january...
299,0060958332,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9154489-alexandra,2,"Sorry, no. Too positivist, which I should have expected from Pinker, but was somehow hoping to be positively surprised (pardon the pun!). Didn't finish it."
