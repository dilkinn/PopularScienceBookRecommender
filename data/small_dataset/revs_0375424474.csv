How did we come to have the hands, arms, heads, bone structures, ears, eyes and many of the other parts we have? It turns out that homo sap is a very jury-rigged critter, an accumulation of biological compromises and re-purposed parts. One can look at fossils to see how we got from there, waaaay back there, to here, and one can also find, in comparing embryos of different species, evidence of our developmental history. DNA tells tales. Neil Shubin follows both paths on his road to our past in a book that demonstrates popular science writing at its best. Neil Shubin with Tiktaalik or the other way around - image from the Chicago TribuneThere is a wealth of fascinating material in this easy-to-read book on how human anatomy came to be. Paleontology, like Con Edison, swears by the motto “Dig we Must.” Shubin offers a quick intro into how one decides where one should dig to increase the odds of finding what you are looking for. He should know. Currently both a professor at the University of Chicago and Provost of the Field Museum, his primary claim to fame was as the person who located in the Canadian Arctic, a fossil, Tiktaalik roseae, a flat-headed fish/amphibian that marked the transition of animals from sea to land. This was front page news across the world in 2004.Looking at how embryos develop one can see remarkable similarities among species. Human embryos look a lot less different from embryos of other species than we as adults look from the fuller versions of other critters. Plunging into the DNA of each holds many answers. In Your Inner Fish, Shubin looks at different parts of the human body, for example teeth, and hands and arms, eyes and ears, then traces their structures back through the scientific record to see where each bit first appeared. This is way cool, and gives one some perspective into just how much we, as humans, are part of all life on earth (and who knows where else?) Children of Mother Earth - image from Feynmanino.watson.jpDid you know that ""the head is made up of vertebrae that fused and grew a vault to hold our brains and sense organs?” (p 88) How about that “bones that are the upper and lower jaws in sharks are used by us to swallow and hear.” (p 92) There are many revelations of this sort. I was most impressed by a section that described how our ear was related to a sense organ, the neuromast, present in the sides of some fish. This figures prominently in our reaction to over-imbibing. People who overindulge in spirits experience spins. This has to do with a side-effect of alcohol not mixing well with the water in one’s ear, the ear that helps regulate our sense of balance. Just as the neuromast lets fishes know about the world around them, acting as a sense, and ultimately, balance organ, so too our ears use a very similar mechanism to help us retain our sense of balance. When alcohol mixes, poorly, with the water in our ears, it mucks up the works, thus that unfortunate spinning sensation This book offers a cornucopia of gee-whiz explanations just like those.  Shubin shows how our genetic makeup makes us high-end mutts, the product of eons of accumulated changes, a creature designed by a committee. That baggage can get heavy at times. Elements of our makeup that made sense when we were hunter gatherers now leave us ill-prepared for sedentary life in the 21st century. Shubin has a gift for popular science writing. He says that he was “trying to understand the family tree of relatedness.” Clearly, he succeeded. There were only one or two times in the book when I felt at all strained. And his effervescent enthusiasm for his field is infectious. If I were a student, I would be offering bribes to anyone who could help get me into his class. My only gripe about this book is that it was too short. Maybe it needed more time to evolve. =============================EXTRA STUFFThere is a nice interview with Shubin at BloggingHeads TV. It runs about 51 minutes and was never boring. Another is a piece from the University of Chicago that offers detail about Tiktaalik roseae. Also Preeti provided a link in comment #5 below to a PBS series that has been made of this. I know I'll be watching. And Alfred added a link to an excellent Slate article on the series in comment #8.August 17, 2016 - a nifty item in the NY Times Science section - From Fins Into Hands: Scientists Discover a Deep Evolutionary Link - by Carl Zimmer"
1,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"This really was a pleasure – another book recommended by Wendy – although what I liked most about it was possibly not the most obvious things about the book. From very early on I was in a bit of a world of my own and had started to wonder what to make of the fact that palaeontologists tend to make such wonderful science writers?I’ve said it before, but I think Gould is a better writer than Dawkins – and that is a big statement for me, as I tend to prefer an English voice over an American one. I don’t mean that to be rude, but there are many more similarities between British English and Australian English than I think there are with American English – but Gould is in a class of his own. I get Gould, I understand him much more readily than I understand other ‘science writers’ and I think this is because I really understand his notions of development and change. His book, Life’s Grandeur (or Full House – in the States) is perhaps one of the greatest books on evolution ever written – as someone who had read many, many books on evolution before I had read Life’s Grandeur I really didn’t think I would ever ‘fundamentally’ learn anything new about evolution again – this book showed me just how limited my understanding of evolution really was. The only other book to come close to ‘teaching me anew’ something I thought I knew well enough was Deep Time. Although Your Inner Fish didn’t fundamentally change my view on the world – I think it might if you haven’t read much on evolutionary biology. Even if you have, there is much of interest here.But I’ve distracted myself – the thing that had me fascinated throughout this book was the idea that it was so well written and again, written by a palaeontologist. What is it that makes them such good writers? Well, I think it might have something to do with the fact that while the rest of science is focused on specialising to a nearly absurd level – palaeontologists are required to be generalists. They need to know geology to know how old rocks are, they need to know chemistry to know how bodily processes or rock processes or uranium processes work, they need to know physics (or at least physical chemistry) to understand why fossils don’t form in basalt, and they absolutely need to know a little theology because – well, because you know why. Also anatomy, DNA and physiology of many, many animals.Someone once said all science is either physics or it is stamp collecting - I think this book goes quite some way to showing that 'stamp collecting' has very many payoffs and physics has little to be quite so smug about.I think it might be the fact that there is so much they need to know, so many bits and pieces of knowledge – the fact that they need to be generalists – that makes them such good science writers. And this guy really is a very good science writer.Years ago I worked with a couple of Fundamentalist Christians. When we were talking one day one of them became outraged and said to me, “Do you really think I’m related to a FISH”.I had no idea how to answer him at first. Given Christians are quite fond of fish (Peter and all that – well, and those stickers they put on the back of their cars) it took me a second to work out the problem. I had also been expecting APE – so when he got worked up over fish, well, I wasn’t sure what had happened. I told him it was worse than he even imagined – I didn't want him to take it personally, but actually I thought he was related to a bacteria. He didn’t seem to find this a much more comforting notion and looked at me as if I was completely insane. He wasn't the first, he won't be the last.This book does not waste time arguing with fundies – and that has to be a good thing. Already there has been far too many trees cut down and turned to paper in a pointless attempt to achieve the impossible – that is, to convince those who have no interest in understanding that their God just didn’t create the world 4,000 years ago – I’ve decided that it is best to just ignore these people. They have self-selected themselves to a life of ignorance and blindness, unfortunately, nothing can be done for them – and whilst this is terribly sad, it is, nonetheless, a fact of life.What this book does do is work its way through your body and show interesting little facts about residual properties we have that are there due to our ancestry. And not just our paternal grandfather, Herbert St George, but those fish my fundamentalist friend was so outraged over. And more – down into the deep dark past when we were not even yet fish, back when we were yeast or something similar.  Because that is one of the truly fascinating insights that fundamentalist Christians will never get to grasp – the ‘theory’ of evolution allows us to make remarkable predictions about how we live and how we have come to be the way we are. Those predictions allow us to delve into our genetic heritage and to make sense of where we have come from – and that knowledge, that insight, is not barren (in the sense that saying ‘God did it’ is barren), but rather allows us ways to potentially find solutions to some of our life’s ongoing ills. For me the end of this book was by far the most interesting – the part where he explains why some many of us suffer from haemorrhoids or varicose veins or hernias. Our inner fish can sometimes seem to have had it in for us. His explanation of the evolutionary choices that are made by animals (I mean that metaphorically, obviously) particularly around whether to see in colour or in black and white, is truly fascinating. I also learnt what is happening in my ear when I drink too much alcohol and the room starts spinning – and who would have thought that your eyes would tend to move to the right due to this misperception of a spinning room? Fascinating.In fact, the book is full of little bits of information about bodily processes I have experienced, but never really understood. And that is always a nice thing to find out. We do tend to spend quite a bit of time in our bodies and being told what they are up to can be quite something.This book is worth reading for his discussion on embryology alone, if you know nothing about this fascinating subject you should rush out and get hold of this book. I also enjoyed it for the stuff about dolphins not being able to smell, due to their on-again / off-again relationship with the sea. I also enjoyed him talking about the nerves in the face and how these twist and turn in ways one would never get them to do if one was ‘designing’ their function from scratch, so to speak. Not that this was actually what interested me, what really interested me was the discussion of the various muscles of the face that make us frown and smile or do things like that. I had a chicken/egg moment where I wondered which came first, the ability to frown to display perplexity – or was this something that was selected for so that the muscle become ‘honed’ over time, or generations rather?This was a fascinating book, with lots of asides to chew over – if you are interested in how we got here and how much of our inner fish is still obvious about us – this is a great book to read – now it is my turn to recommend it"
2,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia-the-serendipity-aegis,5,"My inner fish hails the author!This fish, tiktaalik, of course, it was more than fish! It could do push-ups! "
3,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112548-katherine-furman,5,"This book delivered exactly what I wanted: an explanation of evolution from fish (and before really) to man in layman's terms, but not moron layman--well-spoken layman. I had so many 'ah-ha!' moments while reading this book that my head began to spin a little, but in a good way. For instance, when I used to think about evolution the hardest part for me to wrap my mind around was the slow progress of body parts morphing from one form to the next. What this book enlightened me to was that it's not just the body parts themselves that are physically changing in particular organisms, but it's the genes that change which cause the bodily structure change. It was a lot easier for me to wrap my brain around slight changes in DNA that cause physical mutations that, if useful, are passed through generations. For some reason I had always put the horse before the cart and thought of evolution in terms of the physical change before the genetic mutation. But even if your questions on evolution are more sophisticated than my unfounded misguidance, you will learn a ton from this book. Structure by structure. Piece by piece. You can see how we evolved from our aquatic ancestors. This book was more informative and enlightening than all the anthropology classes I ever took in college. It's like getting a free minor in human evolution! "
4,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,3,"It was refreshing to see recent (and not so recent) discoveries about evolution of the body and brain put into an accessible book. My medium rating reflects the limited impact I got from the book due to a former career in developmental neurobiology and past reading of inspired writing on evolution from the likes of Gould, Dawkins, and Wilson. Still it’s sexy and cool to hear about how structures evolved for one purpose get adapted for new functions when opportunities for expansion of life emerge. Thus it was for fish making the transition to land life as amphibians by “repurposing” bony structures of fins as forms that comprise bones of the limbs and paws/hands. That Shubin was involved in finding the rare fossils of transition forms above the Arctic circle brings some valuable authenticity to his story. He is in his element as well when he covers the lineage of the bones of the mammalian inner ear from bones of the jaws of ancient fish. And he does a pretty good job keeping it lively when he covers basic embryology behind basic body plans, limb development, and the evolution of teeth, smell, and eyes. He has to spread himself so thin, that the molecular genetic revolution spawned by the discovery of pattern genes called Hox and how cell fates are determined gets such a light treatment that much of the wonder and magnificence of these advances don’t really shine.The hook for the general reader is an altering of your mindset as highlighted in the book’s title, i.e. like Russian nesting dolls, the forms and patterns of our fish ancestors lie within us. The concept of lineage from one parent to another assures continuity even further back (he notes that he could have called the book “Your Inner Fly” given the analogous roles that Hox genes play in their development). Looking at the advances from the fish side of things, his playful perspective leads to a section near the end called “Why History Makes Us Sick”:In many ways, we humans are the fish equivalent of a hot-rod Beetle. Take the body plan of a fish, dress it up to be a mammal, tweak and twist that mammal until it walks on two legs, talks, thinks, and has superfine control of its fingers—and you have a recipe for problems. We can dress up a fish only so much without paying a price. In a perfectly designed world—one with no history—we would not have to suffer everything from hemorrhoids to cancer. That’s a pretty punchy way of looking at things, and he tries to make good on the conclusions by diverse examples of diseases and problems with our bodies that reflect on its evolutionary history. He just ran out of space in a 200 page book to do the subject justice. Somehow I miss the creative ability of Lewis Thomas to highlight the concept of mitochondria as bacterial invaders enslaved in all cells with the sentence along the lines of: “I sometimes wonder whether I am taking my mitochondia for a walk or whether they are taking me for a walk.” Shubin just doesn’t have such wonderful skill in writing. Few do, and many readers can still learn much from a decent B+ lecturer."
5,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1945066-vince,2,"If you have a semi-extensive science background, you'll probably find this book annoyingly vague. Lots of handwaving, little in the way of explanatory detail.If you're a fan of well-written scientific prose, you'll definitely be driven around the bend. The author was chosen to write this book because he made a terrific discovery in northern Canada a few years back -- a key missing link between fish and mammals -- not because he can write his way out of a wet paper bag. Each chapter lunges hither and yon, little bits of distracting trivia are thrown in at random, and sequential thinking is fiercely avoided. Typical chapter:1. Strained humorous anecdote2. Wannabe paradigm-shifting question, dimly related to anecdote3. Assorted poor summaries of recent research4. Lame pun5. Handwaving6. Shocking answer to question: Mammals are a lot like fish!7. Remember that joke I told? Ha ha, right!?"
6,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Your Inner Fish presents simply and straightforwardly a view of life that shows how much we are a part of this world no matter how much we want to think we are above it. Shubin’s easy going style with fascinating details is very engaging. Beyond the structural and developmental similarities of different species outlined in the book, most compelling were the discussions of placing a gene from one species in the embryo of another that seems distantly related. The results were startling. For example, a mouse gene for eye development placed in a fruit fly embryo caused normal fruit fly eyes to develop. Even more amazing is that the gene Noggin from a sea anemone placed in a frog embryo had the same effect as the frog gene would. It appears that all animals are made out of basically the same stuff. I felt humbled and enlightened learning about my deep connection to nature. Your Inner Fish is a wonderful book everyone can enjoy."
7,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1321471-nate,3,"There are lots of titles out there in American bookstores that see the need to defend the idea of evolution from the claims of creationism and intelligent design. But this book is not one of them. Shubin assumes that you accept evolution to be a fact about the world and gets on with it. He is a fish paleontologist who teaches anatomy to first year medical students at the University of Chicago. If that sounds strange, it won’t so much after you’ve read his book. Paleontology and comparative anatomy can tell us a lot about the human body, especially when it’s backed up by molecular evidence in the DNA that we share with apes, fish, and even bacteria. Although it’s not directed at creationists, you may want to suggest this book to anyone who doubts evolution to be true yet hasn’t taken the time to look into it. It still amazes me when I hear people say, “You know, after 150 years, they still haven’t found one missing link.” People still say this. In a way, this book is entirely about the “missing links” that some people haven’t heard about. "
8,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,5,"For those who enjoyed the writings of paleontologist and evolutionary biologist, Steven Jay Gould, here is another master in communicating complex science to the lay person. Neil Shubin has the smarts, the skills, the enthusiasm and the insights to enlighten us on the manner in which we humans are part of the world's amazing collection of life forms past and present.Gould taught at Harvard and was associated with the American Museum of Natural History. In remarkable parallel construction, Shubin (who received his doctorate at Harvard) has similar roles with the University of Chicago and the Field Museum of Natural History.Shubin's self-imposed challenge is to explain how scientists can be so confident as they reconstruct relationships among ""long-dead animals and the bodies and genes of recent ones."" Gould starts with an example of the relationships and hierarchies among creatures:Everything with headsEverything with heads and limbsEverything with heads, limbs, breasts and hairEverything with heads, limbs, breasts, hair that walks on two legsHe then focuses on the common plan for limbs: one bone, followed by two bones, then little ""blobs"", then fingers or toes. Pointing out that ""the differences between creatures lie in differences in the shapes and sizes of the bones and the number of blobs, fingers and toes."" He clearly lays out how the tools we now have allow us to explore and pin down relationships among creatures.I have to agree with the promo on the book's cover: ""Your Inner Fish makes us look at ourselves and our world in an illuminating new light."" Well done."
9,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/361403-kapi,5,"Update 12/2009: Shubin and I have just released 40 figures in this book as a deck of PowerPoint slides with the hopes that educators across the country will be able to use them in their lectures on evolution and biology. They're available for free on the Tiktaalik website: http://tiktaalik.uchicago.edu/book-to... Hope they're useful!Review from 12/2007: Keep an eye out for this book's release in January of 2008. I worked extensively with the author while he was writing it, and was constantly entertained by the content and the style. Shubin skillfully uncovers the evidence for evolution we carry within our bodies every day, all the while weaving in personal anecdotes of adventures in the Arctic and self-discovery in cadaver labs. The book caters to a broad spectrum of folks - from your average person who vaguely remembers reading a headline about some dinosaur find last week to the most dedicated science geek. If you don't come away from the book with a greater appreciation of the profound connectedness of life, at least you'll gain an arsenal of fun facts to bust out at your next cocktail party. Definitely a good read!"

I feel sorry for people who for whatever reason cannot accept who we are and where we all came from. The book can be summed up in this passage: ""All of us are modified descendants of our parents or parental genetic information. I'm descended from my mother and father, but I'm not identical to them. My parents are modified descendants of their parents. And so on."" A lot of meaning in those three words: ""And so on."" "

I would have appreciated more detail and a little less hand waving, but that's my inner scientist showing through.He had a very detailed bibliography, with not just titles he drew on and others to explore, but commentary on why they might be useful.

15,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3341092-magila,2,"I threw in the towel with this book about half way through. I found it to be dull, and missing a voice. It feels mostly as if the author is trying to convince his audience that evolution is real. It's written part to the layperson, part to the scientist or student, it's neither a textbook not a successful popular work to me. I love scientific books, and could point folks to a few which I believe were amongst the best that I read in the last year or two, but this book just misses the mark. I would not read this unless you are heavily vested in the subject matter and can't stop yourself. Otherwise, I believe there are better places to invest your time and would suggest the bulk of the reviews are from folks who are more excited about evolution in general than they actually were by this book.**As an aside, this is a challenge in Crowdsourcing and books. We have a terribly skewed sample pool when it comes to books and rankings. I generally only pick up books that are suggested to me, or subject matter I enjoy. Therefore, I am predisposed towards liking them more, and this raises their scores. You don't see me giving tons of books 1 or 2 stars because I would never even crack the book open. Because I was so interested in this topic, I persevered through half the book before finally deciding the lack of clear voice, and/or interesting writing style was just too much. The sad truth is it will be impossible to read every book I would like to in my lifetime, so I have to quit some to make room for others. "

It then goes into various elements of land vertebrate biology and how the development of embryos works with genetic triggers as well as the experimentation on various animal models.We also get descriptions of the origins and structure of the various senses in living creatures from single-celled life forms to much more complex life."
17,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,4,"I knew about this book from Trevor's review some time ago. I saw it in the Bibliography of some of Dawkins' books and it that of Why Evolution is True by Jerry A. Coyne which I recently read, and I got interested to read it very soon. It is truly a remarkable work. If not for anything, just because it shows how evolution can be very helpful in making advances in Medicine. Neil Shubin, who is very well versed in Comparative Anatomy, shows how certain parts of our body can only be understood in light of our evolutionary history. It changed how I see myself and Homo Sapiens in great degree. If you want to understand what scientists mean when they say the literally true and beautiful statement ""we are all of the same family"", then you really need to read this book. One thing I didn't like was that Shubin wasn't consistent in the level of details of his topics. Sometimes, when I wanted to know more about a thing like Embryology, he stopped short and picked up a different topic. He also begins the chapters by telling a personal anecdotal about how he and his colleagues found certain fossils (like the famous Tiktaalik) which was kinda boring for me. But apart from these passages, it was a joy to read. Especially the chapter before the Epilogue called The Meaning of it All. To know how much of our bodies is shared with Sharks, Flies and Tadpoles is truly breathtaking. To know the answers questions such as why we have hiccups, or why the male testes travel to the scrotum, or why we like fatty food is truly mind blowing. It was indeed a remarkable book which I will absolutely recommend to Evolution enthusiasts. "

Excellent science writing by the actual practitioner -- highly recommended.

Just if you might be interested.Another big banner for evolutionists' advocates is the fact that Shubin's brilliant work contrasts with the confused theses of the Creationists. The discoverer of a link between land creatures and fish uses numerous examples to show how, in the course of the development of higher life forms, several properties, and physiological peculiarities could last even into humans. Where appropriate for fish, reptiles or birds meaningful and advantageous specializations can take their revenge in a primate body. Thus, there are various Achilles vision and design errors. Such as the tendency to intestinal rupture and hiccups, the poorly designed pathways of some nerves, and some non-optimized constructions in the human body. Many civilization diseases are caused by the manifold influences of hundreds of millions of years, in which unfortunately sometimes not always useful gifts of mostly extinct ancestors lurk. The illustrations and drawings, which depict the development of the specialization of an initially utterly different kind in their course up to the final placement in the human being, apparently illustrate this extraordinary variety of passing the time. Whereby in some of the representations, one or the other eye rubbing may be necessary. To allow the derivation, which one would never have come of its own accord, as a fact to take on itself. It turns out, how about almost immeasurably many modifications abilities from entirely different living environments are adapted to the particular conditions, which correspond optimally to the current needs of the ""gene host"" (own creation).The objects of observation are insects, fish, reptiles, and worms whose various body parts such as eyes, bones, internal organs, teeth, and gills are represented in their metamorphosis as components of other forms of life. The research and theses are based on genetic analyzes, fossils, and studies of embryonic development. Especially with the latter, as every expectant parent knows to report, we can point to our cross-species gene pool in an impressive way that lets us stand in awe of the genius of nature. Thus, the human inner ear was formed from the lateral organs of the fish, the ear ossicles from jar bones and the mitochondria from unicellular bacteria. In particular, the micro-level, including viruses and bacteria, in which the first primitive life forms emerged, holds in other respects even more unexplored, exciting insights. Because the tiny life forms were not only the basis of all life but also increased a lot later with a lasting effect on the design of the ecosphere. The extent to which many of our bodily functions, DNA, metabolism, and heredity have been influenced and modified by bacteria and viruses is challenging to assess seriously from the current state of research, which is in its infancy. There are many theories in this regard and only rare, contentious evidence. For future generations of scientists, this represents a license to enter a new world of research. In contrast to now, where paleontologists of the 21st and 22nd century can only demonstrate a connection through visible traces of primeval ancestors that can be traced back to the skeleton or organs. In the 20th century, an alliance was formed with biologists and biochemists. Also, in its wake, much more impressive details, not just how individual fragments of our physique were created, will come to light. However, up to individual cells and their modes of functioning, an endlessly branched pedigree will open, at the temporary end of which human stands.Bemerkenswert, aus welch verschiedensten Komponenten anderer Arten sich der Mensch zusammensetztEin großes weiteres Banner für das Bestreben der Befürworter der Evolution ist es, das Shubin mit seinem brillanten Werk vor die wirren Thesen der Kreationisten stellt. Der Entdecker eines Bindeglieds zwischen Landlebewesen und Fisch belegt anhand zahlreicher Beispiele, wie im Zuge der Entwicklung höherer Lebensformen etliche Eigenschaften und physiologische Besonderheiten bis in den Menschen überdauern konnten.Wobei für Fische, Reptilien oder Vögel sinnvolle und vorteilhafte Spezialisierungen sich in einem Primatenkörper durchaus rächen können. So gibt es dadurch bedingt diverse Achillessehen und Konstruktionsfehler. Wie die Tendenz zu Eingeweidebrüchen und Schluckauf, die schlecht konzipierten Bahnen einiger Nerven und generell einige nicht optimiert scheinende Konstruktionen im menschlichen Körper. Viele Zivilisationskrankheiten sind bedingt durch die vielfältigen Einflüsse hunderter Jahrmillionen, in denen leider mitunter nicht immer nützliche Geschenke größtenteils ausgestorbener Urahnen lauern.Die Illustrationen und Zeichnungen, anhand derer die Entwicklung der Spezialisierung einer ursprünglich ganz anderen Art in ihrem Verlauf bis zur finalen Platzierung im Menschen aufgezeichnet wird, verdeutlichen diese wundersame Spielart der vergehenden Zeit auf anschauliche Weise. Wobei bei einigen der Darstellungen schon das eine oder andere Augenreiben vonnöten sein kann. Um die Herleitung, auf die man von selbst niemals gekommen wäre, als Fakt auf sich wirken zu lassen. Es zeigt sich, wie über schier unermesslich viele Modifikationen Fähigkeiten aus komplett differenten Lebensumgebungen an die speziellen, den momentanen Bedürfnissen des „Genwirts“ (Eigenkreation) optimal entsprechenden, Gegebenheiten angepasst werden.Als Anschauungsobjekte dienen Insekten, Fische, Reptilien und Würmer, deren verschiedenste Körperteile wie Augen, Knochen, innere Organe, Zähne und Kiemen in ihrer Metamorphose zu Komponenten anderer Lebensformen dargestellt wird. Die Forschungs- und Thesengrundlage bilden genetische Analysen, Fossilien sowie Studien der Embryonalentwicklung. Speziell mit letzterer lässt sich, wie jedes werdende Elternteil zu berichten weiß, auf atemberaubende und vor der Genialität der Natur in Ehrfurcht erstarren lassender Weise, unser artübergreifender Genpool darstellen. So entstand aus den Seitenlinienorganen der Fische das menschliche Innenohr, aus Kieferknochen Gehörknöchelchen und aus einzelligen Bakterien die Mitochondrien.Speziell die Mikroebene samt Viren und Bakterien, in der die ersten primitiven Lebensformen entstanden, birgt in anderer Hinsicht noch mehr bisher unerforschte, spannende Erkenntnisse. Denn die winzigen Lebensformen waren nicht nur die Grundlage alles Lebens, sondern stiegen auch viel später ein weiteres Mal mit nachhaltiger Wirkung in die Gestaltung der Ökosphäre ein. Wie weit viele unserer körperlichen Funktionsweisen, DNA, Stoffwechsel und Vererbung von Bakterien und Viren beeinflusst und modifiziert wurden, lässt sich vom momentanen, in den Kinderschuhen steckenden, Stand der Forschung aus betrachtet schwer seriös einschätzen. Es gibt diesbezüglich viele Theorien und nur rare, strittige Beweise. Das stellt für kommende Generationen von Wissenschaftlern einen Freibrief für den Eintritt in eine neue Welt der Forschung dar. Denn wo jetzt größtenteils nur anhand offensichtlicher, an Skelett oder Organen nachweisbaren Spuren urzeitlicher Ahnen eine Verbindung bewiesen werden kann, wird den Paläontologen des 21. und 22. Jahrhunderts eine Allianz mit Biologen und Biochemikern beschieden sein. Und in dessen Gefolge werden noch wesentlich beeindruckendere Details, nicht nur darüber wie einzelne Fragmente unserer Physis erschaffen wurden, ans Tageslicht kommen. Sondern bis zu einzelnen Zellen und deren Funktionsweisen hin wird sich ein endlos verzweigter Stammbaum auftun, an dessen vorläufigen Ende der Mensch steht."
22,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"I feel bad not giving this book a higher rating. Heaven knows we can use more books that explain complex scientific material to the general public. Gifted writers such as Jonathan Weiner (
The Beak of the Finch
), David Quammen (The Flight of the Iguana), and Gilbert Waldbauer (Insects through the Seasons) have expanded my own intellectual horizons considerably, simultaneously educating and entertaining. Alas, I can’t in good conscience place Neil Shubin’s book in the same league. It read more like a dumb downed college lecture than the stimulating exploration of evolutionary biology that I had hoped it would be. I fully confess to stylistic prejudices here. I’ve never been a fan of stripped-down easy-to-read prose. Shubin writes as if he’s patiently addressing a talented group of middle school students. He even employs the textbook writer’s device of summarizing a chapter at its end. (I half expected a set of “comprehension questions” to follow.) There are heavy-handed attempts at humor, too, as evidenced in the pun-heavy chapter headings such as “Getting Ahead” for a chapter on the organization of the head. Sometime clumsy analogies are used in an attempt to make things clearer, such as the history of organs compared to a Chevy Corvette. While these might indeed be successful strategies for reaching some audiences, I found them a little uninspired. Shubin is probably a gifted lecturer, but he comes across as just that: a lecturer. It probably didn’t help that I’d recently read Jonathan Weiner’s Time, Love, and Memory, which went over some of the same ground but far more eloquently. Or that I’m married to a scientist whose hobby is collecting fossils. Or that I worked for years in academic settings with molecular biologists, immunologists, and various medical researchers. Thus, many of the ideas in this book were already familiar. However, I did like the clear use of illustrations to demonstrate key concepts, and I found in general that the book improved as it progressed. Truth to tell, I was about to set it aside after the opening chapters, which seemed overly simple and too laden with personal anecdotes, but I was curious as to why my sister had thought so highly of the book, so I persisted. After the first few chapters, the book picked up pace, with plenty of quirky details about how the human body contains relics of earlier evolutionary forms. The chapter on the ear, for example, revealed how ‘repurposing’ bones originally used by reptiles to chew evolved later in mammals to be ones used in hearing. Likewise chapters on the sense of smell, eyes, and teeth contain interesting information on how these attributes and structures evolved in other and earlier organisms. As Shubin notes, the book could have equally been called Your Inner Fly or Your Inner Worm as the main message that a ‘pattern of descent with modification’ defines us. I think, in fact, that Shubin’s book probably accomplished its aim as an introduction to key concepts in evolutionary biology. I may be remiss in having expected a little more than that. Judging by the reviews here and elsewhere, it seems to have generated a lot of enthusiasm. "
23,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,5,"When I was a kid, I loved to read the non-fiction books of Issac Asimov.I was fascinated by how things worked, be they natural of something man-made and Asimov wrote to inform the layman like me of the wonders of everything from physics to biology (and even the Bible).Once I worked as a lowly night janitor in a Bell Telephone office. I couldn't wait for my lunch hour to run to the basement, pull up a chair and dig into what Asimov had to say on the structure of the atom and how electricity worked.It wasn't hard for him to come up with whole chapters on fairly narrow topics so there was plenty of reading to keep me busy.So what does this have to do with Neil Shubin's book?Shubin has not just matched the quality of Asimov's writing, he has surpassed it by being able to cover the most basic, yet captivating ideas in a minimum of words while leaving the reader fully satisfied that real understanding has been gained.Your Inner Fish should be read by everyone because it asks and answers so many questions we have about our favorite topic - ourselves.How did we get to be the way we are? How did eyes and ears and arms and heads and jaws come about? How is it possible that we are related to other animals as lowly as a jellyfish? How come all of life isn't still the bacteria that has been around for hundreds of millions of years - in other words, how is it that multi-celled and multi-structured bodies came about?Well, aren't you interested?Shubin talks of the clues found in fossils and DNA with a simplicity that makes this book a snap to read, but accompanies it with beautiful drawings that illustrate his points. I don't believe anyone can get through this book without saying ""wow, no kidding!"" at least half a dozen times.A central theme of science in the last century has been the confirmation of kinship in all life and the leveling of humanity from the once separate and superior species to just another form of animal that shares almost every feature with at least one other species and often several. After getting over the dazzling picture men held of themselves (even women were a lesser breed!), we are finally learning the fascinating truths of evolution, ""descent with modification"" as Darwin put it. Not only has this opening up of our mental picture of the natural world brought better self-understanding, it has brought greater appreciation for all our relatives on Earth that, though they may look entirely different than we do, are our companions in ways never before realized.Shubin ties it all together in a simple but powerful way. Your Inner Fish is a tiny masterpiece."
24,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876605-kam-yung-soh,5,"A fascinating book to read to learn about how life on earth is related to each other for one simple reason: we are all descended from one common ancestor. Changes may have occurred as all life on Earth branched out from that common ancestor but you can still trace that common lineage between us all; even between humans and fish.Shubin is best known for discovering Tiktaalik but he uses his other experiences (searching for other fossils, teaching human anatomy, running a lab that explores both palaeontology and genetics) to help guide the reader as he shows the various ways we are connected to various life forms on Earth: to fish via our hands and arms, to amphibians via the way our heads and faces developed, to reptiles via the way reptile jaw bones became parts of our inner ear and to mammals via the way our teeth develop.He sums it up by showing that evolution can only work with what it has, explaining why some parts of our body seems to have developed in a haphazard way. The obvious answer is because our original body plan started out as fish and as we developed, parts of us get moved about, leading to all sorts of strange routes taken by our body parts as they moved from the original fish-related positions to where they are now.He also shows that some of the problems that ails us are due to this fish to human way to development. Probably the most unexpected is the reason we hiccup; it was a response originally required by tadpoles to help breathing but is now a relic response that causes hiccups.It is such insights and others in the book that make you understand just how we are all connected to one another and to all life on earth. And you will definitely learn to appreciate your inner fish."
25,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1647517-victor-sonkin,4,"This is a book about your (our, my) inner fish — the evolutionary legacy of all creatures great and small in our bodies. The author brilliantly saddles the seemingly unbridgeable divide between field biology (paleontology, in his case, but of the most hardcore type, working for seasons on end in Arctic sleet or desert sands) and molecular biology; he is clever enough to point out that recent enthusiasm for all things molbio which were supposed to completely displace field disciplines was premature and misplaced.There is a problem with this dual narrative, because the book lacks a single, well-focused, energetic plot (I do realize that asking for a plot in biological nonfiction is a stretch, but all the best books have it). As a result, the central point (about the fish, or tadpole, or fruit fly that lives inside of all of us) is sometimes muddled. But it is never lost completely, and some of the discoveries that I made while reading Shubin were truly amazing. For example, I never realized that the effects of alcohol-induced spinning (and subsequent hangover) were physically connected with alcohol diluting blood and penetrating the inner ear with its viscous liquid — a process that disorientates the villi and makes one's head spin. The fact that ear bones are descended from large jaw bones in reptiles is also fun, and some of the vision facts, too. As for evo-devo, most of that I knew from other books. But the Tiktaalik saga, and in general the story of looking for fossils, though, strictly speaking, not immediately relevant, reads as a mystery novella in its own right.Overall, very good."
26,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5434117-david,4,"There are plenty of people writing reviews about this book detailing examples of what is covered in the book, but if you are on the fence about reading it, here is what the book offers: a basic overview of phylogenetics (specifically cladistics, which tries to use novel features to determine how species are related to each other), the natural history of several important innovations in the evolution of the body plan we share with other land-based vertebrates (birds, fish, mammals), and insight into how science (especially involving the study of evolution) works from the start of an idea through the research process itself. If you are a professional investigator or student of evolution, the specific discoveries will not be breaking news, yet the journey and passion will still hold an appeal. If you want to learn more about how scientists are studying evolution and what it means for how our bodies are put together, this an excellent place to start or a next step in expanding your knowledge. This is the kind of book you can give someone who is eight grade through their senior year of college and potentially inspire them to seek a career in research or seek additional education. It's also great for teachers introducing students paleontology, evolution, or science in general. "
27,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704574-tom-meyer,5,"If Richard Dawkins attacks Creationism with rhetorical broadsides, Shubin does it with a carefully-aimed silenced rifle; less dramatic, but far more effective and humane.Unless I missed something, I don't think Shubin uses the word ""evolution"" anywhere in the book. But he presumes Common Descent and -- without the reader having to be consciously aware of this -- causes the reader to presume it as well. He or she has to for the book to make any sense. Indeed, until the final chapter, I don't think the average reader even needs to think that this book has anything in particular to do with Evolution in the politicized sense and Shubin's such a likable guy that a mild Creationist might not even know to have his guard up.Otherwise, the book is delightful; Shubin's got a light touch, a gift for explanation, and an eye for finding the right examples that make for an excellent pop-bio book that's accessible and interesting to a wide audience.Highly recommend."
28,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1289391-michael,4,"This is a very important book that not only updated my knowledge on the current state of comparative anatomy in relation to evolutionary biology but also kept me turning the pages in absolute fascination. I almost read it in one sitting because I couldn't bear to put it down. No one who reads this could possibly have any doubts about the relatedness of all of life or the fact that we carry the evolutionary history of more than just humans inside us. I found the writing style less than elegant, but that's a small quibble with a book that explains why we get hiccups, hernias, and are prone to choking on food. The work is the definitive destroyer of arguments for intelligent design, but it's a must-read book for intelligent Dasein. "
29,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4816194-debra,5,"Amazing stuff. Evolution, biology, paleontology given to us in layman's terms, and oh so fascinating. Each chapter reveals a new revelation and the proof of ideas I've not contemplated deeply before. "

31,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31365952-saige,4,"4.5 stars. As far as scientific reading for the layman goes, this was wonderful. Shubin strikes the perfect mix of explanation, humor, and overarching ideas. From his personal achievements and experiences, to the well-known and deeply researched fundamentals of his field, the book as a whole provided a lovely introduction to evolution and the connections between living creatures. It was remarkably readable. My main issue with this book was less with the writing itself and more with my own knowledge when faced with this content. I have a strong background in biology and chemistry, but not nearly as much with paleontology. This meant that many of the biological explanations felt very surface level. Conversely, I continually found myself wishing he would expand upon a point in the fossil record or a method in the lab that I had never heard of. I wanted more in some places and less in others. However, I think a good scientific book leaves readers informed but still curious. Obviously no book has all the answers, but I think this one did a great job of casting a wide enough net to interest and engage people from all backgrounds while also not sacrificing meaningful content to do so. A great read!"
32,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16951301-bryan-they-call-me-the-doge,4,"I rarely read anything on biology, paleontology, natural history or evolution, whether in book form or in magazine articles, and my review is going to reflect that. So those readers who are au courant with those subjects (and even Shubin's book is probably aging quickly) will likely find that other reviews will address their questions about this book better than mine. I don't make any claim to being able to dispute Neil Shubin on any point he makes, nor argue any of his conclusions. I might as well be a blank slate when it comes to these topics. With those parameters in place, I admit to enjoying Your Inner Fish quite a bit, even though it is about science stuff. Shubin is extremely friendly in this book--never preachy, never ivory-tower-ish, and never a know-it-all. His goal, I gather, is to make even a guy like me as enthused about fish fossils as he is. (He nearly succeeds). I can easily imagine him at his lectern, engaging his students with some subtle humor and an infectious obsession with the fossil record. He wants me along for his ride, not to put me off by pointing out the gap between his learning and my ignorance.Does he break any new ground here? I don't know--I don't think so, but, again, I'm not in the position to know. What he does do is marshal together several sets of evidence for the idea that all life on Earth is linked to a common ancestry. While this itself doesn't seem new to me, a lot of the evidence that he presents are aspects that I was not aware of--at all. And I thought it was presented in a very easy to digest manner. Interestingly, Shubin rarely uses the word evolution. I noticed it first by its absence, and then did see him refer to it once, though there could have been a few times I missed. His term of choice is Descent with Modification, and I don't know if this is a political expediency, or that he thought it was a more accurate description, or that he just wanted to get away from any connotations the word evolution might have for his readers. (The word doesn't even appear as an Index entry.) Because one of the other things that struck me was a gentle, sometimes subtle, refutation of Intelligent Design, without ever going so far as to say so. I think the last thing Shubin wanted to be was contentious. So Shubin gives ample evidence of the fact that Descent with Modification happens, and some convincing reasons as to how it happens. The why still seems to be the tricky spot, and the ghost of Darwin's survival of the fittest emerges (here Shubin is talking specifically about the first appearance of creatures with bodies):One theory about this is extremely simple: Perhaps bodies arose when microbes developed new ways to eat each other or avoid being eaten? Having a body with many cells allows creatures to get big. Getting big is often a very good way to avoid being eaten. Bodies may have arisen as just that kind of defense.This sounds perfectly logical to me, but it still doesn't seem to address the fundamental question: what impulse directs life to mount a defense? But, as I'm not a science guy, I may be misunderstanding the argument. That perhaps it is not an impulse, but an accident. Random luck. Pure chance that cells mutate, which starts the process in motion. I don't pretend to have a different answer--I think it's unknowable. Or ineffable, one of the two.But, truthfully, the answer (if there is one) doesn't matter to me. (I have Teilhard de Chardin for that, ha-ha) What I enjoyed was the plain language description of the modifications that made us, us. Very satisfying and recommended.  "
33,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,5,"This well written book reveals how the human body is the product of a long process of evolution. While the content gives overwhelming evidence for the theory of evolution, he does not discuss, or even acknowledge, any notion of intelligent design or the existence of a Divine Designer. The facts are allowed to speak for themselves. He frequently includes personal stories of how he practices science. This book is science with personality.It is often said, even by people who should know better, that the theory of evolution amounts to a bunch of Just-So stories. In other words, it is not testable. This book is the answer. For example, Shubin decided to look for fossils of the animals that came between between fish and amphibians. In other words, he wanted to find what might be called a missing link. He knew the ages of when the latest fish and earliest amphibian fossils were found, so he had to look for fossils laid down during the few million years in between. He knew to look in rocks representing shallow rivers flowing into the ocean. He looked at geology maps until he found a region that met his criteria. He went there, and found what he was looking for. That is what a test looks like, and there are many other such examples in his book.I have to confess a bias. Part of the book is about his exploration to find early dinosaur fossils on the beach in Parrsboro, Nova Scotia. I have been to that amazing beach many times, and have even seen the holes he drilled in the beach to date the rocks. Reading his account makes me feel like part of the story, irrational as that is.I loved his story about joining a fossil finding expedition in the desert with two experts. He complains that they were finding lots of fossils while he saw nothing. Then one day, he says, “All of a sudden, the desert floor exploded with bone; where once I had seen only rock, now I was seeing little bits and pieces of fossil everywhere, as if I were wearing a special new pair of glasses, and a spotlight was shining on all the different pieces of bone.” I have experienced the same thing in a small way myself, while walking the beach in Joggins, not far from Parrsboro.There is much more in the book teaching us about the origin of our anatomy. I highly recommend it."

I love that author Neil Shubin did not spend a great portion of the book discrediting creationism, in fact he didn't even MENTION creationism! As someone who fully believes in evolution instead of creationism, this was very refreshing to not have to wade through chapter after chapter of arguments for evolution and against creationism, that I already happen to agree with. Starting with Neil's co-discovery of the 350+ million year old Tiktaalik fish fossil in 2004 (a discovery I remember hearing about), Neil describes this creature that has the same arm makeup that we have: shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrists and even hand like bones in its fins, and how it is without question a missing link of how life evolved out of the water and into being land creatures. Eventually leading to humans. The evidence and arguments that he lays out in the book as to how we are related to fish through our biological makeup was astounding, convincing and actually exciting to learn! I highly recommend this book to those that are interested in evolution. It's written so that those not too familiar with evolution can learn from it, but concise and well researched to were even seasoned evolutionists can learn and plethora of knowledge from it. "

There are living trees as old as human civilization. American history represents 1 ten-millionth of the history of life on earth. And the thing is, that entire timeline of life on earth matters. We were not human for much, much longer than we've been human and all that history is still inside us, affecting us in innumerable ways.This book does a beautiful job expanding our perspective of who we are by putting our bodies into historical context. In the process, it shows us just how deeply connected all life is (after all, if we go back long enough, we find common ancestors between us and the trees outside). And of course, although Shubin doesn't discuss it too much, our minds were shaped by similar processes. It's a fascinating ride. While Shubin is a good writer, his prose doesn't reach the levels of eloquence of natural history masters like Stephen Jay Gould. Hence I'm withholding one star, but this is still a fine book and well worth reading. "

I learned, or was reminded of, several great tidbits to enrich my Anatomy & Physiology lectures. So good it sent me back to my Comparative Anatomy textbook from undergrad, which had been languishing on the shelf of my office with the other relics. Inside, I found the “lecture notes” and materials on macro evolution that I had developed for my presentation to the Evolution class when I was a tutorial student taking “Advanced topics in evolution”! (Note: these materials included color prints of overhead projections. !!! ). It was such a trip to see my old annotations of “structure and function,” looking as though I just wrote them on the blackboard yesterday.I have to hand it to Professor Destasio for knowing just the right assignment to give me in order to give me a grade for a class that was basically me raiding her office bookshelf every week for discussion.

There are several 'stories' about the author's field work finding fossils which mark the 'transitions' between the major vertebrate groups, but the book's focus isn't field-oriented. Instead, it mostly concentrates on relating the structures and functions we find in humans, and other mammals, back to a small group of fishes that started the whole process in the late Devonian. Shubin writes well, and the book admirably traces the essential events of vertebrate history leading to us: fish to amphibians to reptiles to mammals. Having spent the last 30+ years immersed in biology, I already knew a lot of what the book covers. But, if this story is unknown to you, this book is a quick and fascinating way to learn how evolution, given a few hundred million years, produced the living world we see around us."

The book is wonderful in its presentation of history of discoveries and easily understandable differences in what was present through time. It is the author's propaganda for evolution (I'm not a Creationist) that riles me. Evolution has built into its definition that the changes transpired on their own (they ""just happened""). All he does is make a good case that one life form may have derived from another. That they did it on their own (so called random mutation) is another matter."

It tells us two fantastic stories: the story of our bodies and the story of one of the greatest scientific discoveries ever made. It's a fantastic enlightening book that tells us why we look the way we do. This 240-page book is composed of the following eleven chapters: 1. Finding Your Inner Fish, 2. Getting a Grip, 3. Handy Genes, 4. Teeth Everywhere, 5. Getting Ahead, 6. The Best-Laid (Body) Plans,7.The Adventures in Bodybuilding, 8.Making Scents, 9.Vision, 10.Ears, and 11.The Meaning of It All. Positives: 1. One of the most enjoyable science books ever written for the masses. Loved it! 2. One of the few books that actually takes you through a groundbreaking discovery. I'm in awe! 3. Science writing at its best. Mr. Shubin's background in paleontology and biology and his uncanny ability to convey a story, created the perfect storm of science writing. 4. Common ancestry illustrated. 5. Great explanation on how converging sciences led Mr. Shubin to the sight of one the greatest discoveries in support of evolution, Tiktaalik. 6. Tiktaalik is an intermediate between fish and primitive land-living animal. How cool is that? A great example of macroevolution. 7. Use of DNA to trace our history. 8. So many great aha moments in this book. Genetic recipes illustrated, including how our DNA recipe illustrates how to build our upper arms, forearms, wrists and digits is virtually identical in every creature with limbs. 9. Anatomy for the masses. 10. Conception and genes like you have never imagined. How embryos hold the clues to some of the most profound mysteries of life. The patterns of life. 11. Mutants! 12. How the discovery of Hox genes in the 80s changed everything. 13. Smell genes, we dolphins don't need any stinkin' smell genes! 14. So how did eyes evolved? I see... 15. What about the ears? I hear `ya. 16. The overwhelming evidence in support of a fish-to-human framework explained. 17. Great quotes and lucid thoughts abound. Negatives: 1. It's such a good book I have to say I wanted more. I can't wait for Mr. Shubin's next book. In summary, this is a fantastic book that relays the beauty of science at work. The validity of science is justified by its immense success and Mr. Shubin provides one of the best examples. I can't recommend this book enough.

It was just not what I was looking for. I wanted a book about the latest research in palaeontology, and I got an account of the researchers' adventures. I guess all those stories - about not being able to find a sandwich in the Arctic, feeling overwhelmed with the media attention, or about personal impressions of a dissection process - may be very useful as 'hooks' for less informed readers who need to be told the difference between igneous and sedimentary rocks in a manner different from that found in academic textbooks. I respect that and I'm happy to see that researchers are ready to put so much effort in order to attract the wider public to their subject. Yet the book can be very disappointing to more advanced readers, because it contains only basic material relevant to its title."
44,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874018-diana,4,"#NonfictionNovember2017 Substance CategoryI have had this book on my TBR for a few years now. It was suggested to me by a couple of my Geology professors in my second semester of my freshman year of college, which was in 2014. I had so many other books that I wanted to read that this kept being bumped back in the pile. I'm thankful that Nonfiction November gave me a reason to pick this up. I learned quite a bit about a subject barely discussed in our second Geology class once we started talking about the fossil record. I was amazed the first time my professor mentioned the fish fossil that was found that had the same amount of bones in two of it's fins that we have in our wrists and the theories that came from that discovery. If you're interested in this part of Geology I highly suggest this book."
45,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1107171-libby,4,"Entertaining science writing is a too-rare thing, and Neil Shubin's effusive tour of our anatomical past is not to be missed. Shubin has a remarkable knack for explaining the overarching concepts that have shaped his own work in such a way that make them seem methodical, even inevitable. For example, in order to find an as-yet undiscovered transitional fossil fish, he described analyzing the existing fossil record and concluding the specific age of his theoretical fish and where it would have lived, and then deciding to look in a particular part of the world where rocks of the correct age and composition are known to be. And several very cold digs later, the theorized fossil was found. In an age where science is sometimes viewed with suspicion and fear, it's intensely refreshing to read a book that shows science as amusing and messy, but also profoundly robust."
46,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/832846-thomas,2,"This one is a little heartbreaking--I really wanted to like it, but couldn't. Shubin is an excellent evolutionary biologist, with an interesting story to tell--among other things, he discovered a ""missing link"" fossil, intermediate between fish and land vertebrates. He tells the story of evolution by emphasizing how each new species is built from the parts of those that preceded it. It's an important part of how evolution works, and goodness knows we need more scientists to take up the job of sharing the work they do with the broader public. But I'm afraid Shubin's writing (from overall organization right on down to word choice) gets in the way of what could have been a fine little book. Fingers crossed, his next effort will be a little more polished!"
47,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/821374-nicole,5,"Dr. Shubin's book leans more to the evolutionary connections between organisms. He covers an enormous list of experimental evidence in passing which links the way the genes have been reused over millions, and in a few cases billions, of years in constituting the various body & sensory parts. Change the regulation and combination of genes to get a whole new organism.From Paracoccus dentrificans to humans via the Poriferans, Cnidarians, & the Chordates.This is a great book to read with ""Endless Forms Most Beautiful"" that leans toward the embryological impact of the way the genes are actually expressed in various ways."

A bit. Our torsos are more solid because of the way our reproductive organs develop). Seriously, I have read so many books about genes and DNA lately, and this one was still a circus of fascinating trivia, strange experiments, unbelievable connections, and ridiculous puns. Entirely satisfying for fans of childlike wonder and gene splicing alike."

I read this book for fun, a little novel research for a science fiction element, and general academic stimulation. I’m not a student, scientist, or teacher. There’s a lot of extras in this book some readers might find dry (I didn’t). The author takes time to explain things that the everyday desk-shrimp such as I might not know, or have a working understanding of. If you’re hip to biology, you may have to shuffle through info you don’t exactly need. He also writes in chatty, anecdotal ways that describe his personal journey on the way to discovery. I personally found them fun and engaging, especially as it lead into actual scientific explanations and break downs, but again, that all depends on what you need from this book.Lots a dad jokes from our friend Neil, but I’m here for it. Don’t let that fool you though, this book gets down to business. I feel like I have a much clearer understanding of genetics and evolution. The author uses postmodern bodies as maps to the past, and vice versa, and shows the reader how it all connects. From teeth to gills, to wrists and knees. I found it entertaining and helpful, and now enjoying the big picture of the inner fish, kind of magical. I think this book would be particularly remarkable to those who are new to the concept of evolution/genetics, just because it really hones in on the baby steps that take one life-form to another and how one gene in a human behaves the same way in just about every other similar life-form, even down to far distant relations such as the sponge. The book also includes a further reading section if you’re interested in stronger materials on these subjects. I dug around youtube and found that there’s a documentary of the same name, featuring this author. I haven’t had a chance to watch it yet, but if you’re interested, check it out here."
58,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6559292-lindsay,5,"I read science books a bit slower than I tend to read fiction because I want to absorb every single word & make sure I'm not mindlessly skimming or reading while I'm too tired. I never wanted to put this book down though - waiting at the vet, at work, laying in bed, waiting on line at the bank.... I had my kindle app open and I was reading. I wish more, if not all, science & education books were written like this. The author had the right mix of humour, explanation, fun science, serious science, personal anecdotes, and everything in between. I also felt like he was able to convey complicated genetics in a way that ""regular"" people can understand. I didn't feel condescended to at all, but he also didn't go full tilt technical terms. He explained everything in a way that not only made total sense, but also made me want to read more on the subject. The last chapter was easily my favourite since he ties all of the concepts together in one big grand finale. Actually, I liked this book so much I read the Notes & References at the end of the book just so I could keep going. I will be watching the TV series immediately."
59,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,5,"Books on human evolution are plentiful and one of the nice things about Neil Shubin’s, Your Inner Fish, is that the work adds to the pantheon of anthropological thought which helps draw connections across billions of years of history through modern research and scientific discovery. Shubin is a paleontologist whose work in the icy tundra of the Arctic Circle has unearthed fossilized fish and transitional fossils. Early in the work he acknowledges that the connectives of all species is really the fortune of complex DNA, adaptation and errors, which provide species the engine to change over time to meet environmental pressure. The author notes, “It turns out that being an anthropologist is a huge advantage in teaching human anatomy. Why? The best road maps to human bodies lie in the bodies of other animals.” From the start, the author makes some comparatively important insights into how humans share similar morphology with species currently alive and those which make up the fossil record. Indeed, he notes that even a typical zoo’s design supports the fossil record by usually laying out displays from the more ancient life forms to the more complex. So you’ll have fish (everything with heads – and found in the oldest rocks); then lizards (heads and limbs); mammals (head, limbs, hair and breasts; and then primates (all those plus animals which walk on two legs and which are found in comparatively late geology). The author certainly has the credibility to write on the topic of evolution as his team was responsible for finding Tiktaalik, a transitional species of fish whose eyes sat on top of a flat head and had specialized fins for moving in mud. This fossil is a link between ancient fish and later terapods. Shubin makes the case from this and other finds that once a trait exists it is easy to replicate and change as speciation and evolution takes place. As an example, he compares the human arm and how it evolved over billions of years. The author looks at the comparative anatomy of dinosaurs, birds; bats, penguins and humpback whales, and the reader can see easily how human arms, wrist bones and phalanges are just a variation on a theme called limbs. Although the author is a specialist in the search for fossils, he also acknowledges that fossils alone cannot tell the full story of the evolution of life on earth. We have to look at genes for answers to evolution as well. Shubin writes, “What I haven’t mentioned is that we can also trace our history inside our genes, through DNA. This record of our past doesn’t lie in the rocks of the world; it lies in every cell inside us.” But this is not just a literary indulgence, the author reviews the science of the genetic code which controls the genes that make body features and functions.So if it were just long bones that were similar between species, one could argue like the Intelligent Designer’s do, that somehow these similar traits are god’s design. But there is no evidence of god in DNA, just the chemicals of life which support natural selection and evolution. Shubin also does a nice job explaining how so many species evolved teeth (found in fossil mammals 225 MYA), eyesight, and hearing. All while showing how developing offspring of species share their DNA with past and later generations. These genes chemically turn on an off during fetal development to create new members, slightly different than their parents, within a given species.As far as our human bodies are concerned, the author suggests that while we are “a package of two trillion cells assembled in a very precise manner” that our basic design can be found in fish, lizards, cows, and other species where bodies have symmetry (front, back, top, bottom, left, right, head on top, etc.). This, the author notes, is all thanks to our evolution and DNA.For instance, the nasal openings in lampreys, fish, rats and humans all function the same way. Essentially these holes exist to push odor molecules through an opening in the head to the brain. Shubin notes that humans traded an awful lot as a species when they gave up highly tuned senses for big brains.Unlike the watchmaker analogy of centuries ago, which has been refuted by science but still used by creationists, the author shows that sight is yet another sense which is really a generalized trait. Eyesight is a simple transfer of ancient molecules and tissue which respond to light and over time developed into various forms of eyes for species across the taxonomic and fossil records. Eyes vary from invertebrates (flies and worms) and vertebrates. The author notes,""The eyes may look different-some with a lens, some without; some compound, some simple-but the genetic switches that make them are the same. When you look into eyes, forget about romance, creation, and the windows into the soul. With these molecules, genes and tissues derived from microbes, jellyfish, worms, and flies (and mammal and humans), you see an entire menagerie.""This is a wonderful book and one that clearly refutes creation science and Intelligent Design. By reviewing the fossil record and DNA, the author notes that our genes can be used to harness knowledge of both our connectedness and our descent. Indeed, Darwin’s decent with modification is a hallmark of evolutionary theory and is clearly discussed through many examples by the author. I recommend reading the book as informs while not coming off as a text book.At the end of the book, Shubin writes what is essentially a clarion call hoping that we humans realize our place is the animal kingdom. He notes, “Our deep history was spent, at different times, in ancient oceans, small streams and savannahs, not in office buildings, ski slopes and tennis courts.” Nor are our bodies designed to live much past eighty, eat junk food, play football, or sit on our butts all day. In each of these cases we may be doing more harm than good to ourselves and our planet. "
60,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61946484-patricia,4,"I have read this book several times over the past decade; each time I appreciate it more for its overview of the history of life and the interweaving of genetic mechanisms from diverse species to bring us to the state of our human existence on this planet. If you want a deeper awareness of our interrelatedness with all life forms from bacteria through the various phyla over the past 3.5 billion years of evolution and adaptation this is an excellent introduction. The author is well versed in paleontology, the history of science, vertebrate and invertebrate anatomy, embryology, ontogeny, phylogeny, genetics, molecular biology and current research to advance these disciplines. His ability to pull all of this together in lucid prose with supporting illustrations will keep anyone who is curious about our origins engaged from start to finish. I recommend this book for those who are curious about science and the evolution of life. "
61,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16609246-whitney,5,"Excellent! Popular science writing at its finest. Shubin explains things clearly and vividly in a way that is accessible but not dumbed-down. I love reading about evolution. It brings together my interests in both history and science. Back in high school, my AP biology teacher taught us that evolution is a tinker, meaning that evolution builds upon itself and the result is that biological structures and processes are designed with what is available and based on what works, not necessarily what is optimal if one were building an organism from scratch. Shubin makes the same point as he talks about the ways in which our bodies are similar to the more primitive animals (and even microbes) we evolved from. I loved reading about the specific ways in which scientists discovered the evolutionary history of things like arms, ears, and teeth as well as the health implications of our evolutionary past. One of the coolest parts of the book was a description of how you could make a glob of DNA separate from a chunk of meat in your blender. I am dying to try that! "

Left me wondering if ""that is all there is to it?"" Not that i wanted it more technical but most of it appeared condensed.It did offer insights on evolution and on how our sensory organs function - how we hear, see .. especially liked the details on the notion that our evolutionary history has medical implications.I should probably have started with Stephen Gould or Sean Carroll but maybe this one has been a good appetizer .. so thanks Mr. Shubin"

That the human genome is vastly similar to that of sharks is no coincidence, as all life on earth evolved from the same basic prehistoric micro-organisms.

Highly recommend. "

He makes a connection for the reader between the evolution of fish and the evolution of man, as evidenced through the fossil record. Each chapter in the book – chapters on eyes, ears, teeth, digits – reveals and explains another connection. Some of the explanations are a little dry, some are illuminating and mind boggling. I actually learned quite a few new and interesting tidbits. I'd recommend this book to those interested in fish, fossils, and human evolution."

The discovered & confirmed connections among seemingly radically different animals (and bacteria!) were oddly comforting to me. These are times that make one feel disconnected from family, friends, co-workers, and other humans who may vote differently. It is good to know we all have those nerves, those gill arches that disappear in utero, and the same genes. Of course, when I say ""we,"" I mean people, amphibians, fish, and all sorts of other animals. Interconnection is a lovely thing."

77,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"""Your Inner Fish"" truly merits ample praise for being one of the best-written books on science I've read in years. It also ranks easily as an early, leading candidate as one of the finest books published this year. In clear, concise, and quite vivid, prose, this marvelous terse tome recounts in spectacular fashion, the incredible saga of the evolutionary history of our human body. Vertebrate paleobiologist and anatomy professor Neil Shubin is our enthusiastic, expert guide through this amazing journey into our body's primordial past, weaving with utmost brevity, a most compelling, and intricate, tale from fossils, genes and developmental biology. A fascinating trek through these aspects of evolutionary biology that represents too an intriguing personal scientific odyssey from a novice graduate student to a seasoned scientific veteran of major field expeditions in search of rare, often unique, vertebrate fossils across the globe and of substantial laboratory work in evolutionary developmental biology. In short, in terse, exquisite, well-written, prose, Shubin demonstrates the deep evolutionary connections that unite humanity not only with other mammals, but with other vertebrates too, and indeed, as well, with a veritable tree of life. Most of Shubin's succinct chapters are devoted to the evolutionary history of both the human body plan and its major organs, such as the eyes and teeth. The opening chapters briefly explain man's kinship with other vertebrates, and recount the unexpected discovery by Shubin and his team of Tiktaalik, the earliest known transitional fossil between fish and tetrapods (land-dwelling vertebrates, including us). These are followed by an extremely short, quite lucid, introduction to the relevance of genetics in evolutionary developmental biology research (Chapter Three), in which Shubin clearly traces the evolution of limbs from fins to bird wings, and finally, human hands. Succeeding chapters include those devoted to the evolutionary history of teeth (Chapter Four), eyes (Chapter Nine) and ears (Chapter Ten). However, the two most intriguing chapters are those devoted to the development of the vertebrate body plan (Chapter Six) - drawing upon both classical embryology and modern molecular biology and genetics, emphasizing the importance of Hox genes - and the evolutionary developmental history of multicellular animals (Chapter 7), culminating in a terse discussion of the Precambrian Ediacaran fauna. Shubin concludes this fascinating little volume with an intriguing discussion (Chapter 11) of human ailments ranging from hiccups to hernias and obesity, demonstrating how these have their origins in our distant evolutionary past, as far back as four hundred million years ago. Without a doubt, ""Your Inner Fish"" will delight not only students - and others - interested in evolutionary biology, but also those seeking a deeper understanding of both human anatomy and medicine from the perspective of evolutionary biology. (Reposted from my Amazon review)"
78,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/887347-uos-s,5,"One of the co-discoverers of the ""missing link*,"" fish-fibian, fossil Tiktaalik takes you through a narrative, chronological journey of human anatomy. I never had an anatomy class, so this was very interesting. I think of all the evolution books I've read so far this one has the most thorough coverage of embryology, and the specifics of common genes and gene functions amongst the various branches of life (remember that DNA is not simply a piece of the body, or even just a set of instructions - DNA is the very stuff of heredity).One thing that confuses me, though, is when evolutionists speak of more ""primitive"" creatures. I know that they mean that these types of creatures first began to appear somewhat early in the fossil record, that their body organization was the seed or building block for later body plans, but why have some organisms changed less than others? For example, modern jelly fish and human beings have been evolving for exactly the same amount of time - so how come they are more ""primitive"" and we are not? I'm pretty sure it had to do with how much variation there was in our respective environments, and what we needed to do to survivie/thrive in that environment? So, in the history of the human branch of life we have needed to alternately be in water, be on land, eat plants, eat animals, be able to warm ourselves, be able to cool ourselves, be social, have long childhoods, etc, etc. But jelly fish found a nice, stable niche early on and have done pretty well for themselves just staying as they are. I'm pretty sure that's the basic explanation but I'd like at some point to see a detailed analysis of comparative rates of evolution amongst the various branches.""When you are finished changing, you are finished."" - Benjamin FranklinI think that this is truth, and given an evolutionary context it makes sense that it would be true. However, it seems to be somewhat more true for, say, human beings than for jelly fish. Why? Is there a way that it could become less true for human beings? Would that even be desireable?*The term ""missing link"" is commonly used, but misleading since it implies that life united by common descent is a single-lineage ladder or chain, rather than a tree (like a family tree). Also, every organism with progeny is a link in that tree, and most are never fossilized at all, and therefore can never be found, and will always be ""missing"". However, for the ones that are found, they are no longer missing. But if I said ""recently demonstrated branch"" nobody would know what I'm talking about."
79,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"University of Chicago paleontologist / anatomist, Neil Shubin, charts the progression of life that ultimately leads to the human body. Professor Shubin’s discovery of one of the earliest fish (the Tiktaalik) to survive at the fringes of land makes him well placed to delve into this topic. The book does tell the paleontological detective story involved in tracking down the Tiktaalik. Shubin also uses his experiences in cadaver dissection to elucidate some of his points. However, the book goes beyond these stories to unshroud the development of the arms, hands, heads, and sense organs that lead to our own structure. Along the way, the author does an excellent job of clearly presenting the overwhelming evidence in support of Darwinian evolution. A fine example of this can be seen in the quote, “If digging in 600 year-old rocks, we found the earliest jellyfish lying next to the skeleton of a woodchuck, then we would have to rewrite our texts.” Needless to say, no such discovery has been made, and the layers of rock remain an orderly record of the progress of life from simple to increasingly complex. Shubin spends more of his time talking about the evidence in terms of specific anatomical detail. For example, “All creatures with limbs, whether those limbs are wings, flippers, or hands, have a common design. One bone,… two bones,… a series of small blobs…”The book is arranged in eleven chapters. The first chapter provides an overview and tells the story of the search for and discovery of the Tiktaalik. Then the book goes on to explain the development of limbs, genes, teeth, heads, anatomical plans, and the various sense organs. A final chapter looks at what our evolutionary history means for our present-day lives (particularly what systematic problems the process has left us, from hernias to heart disease.) The book covers many of the structures that define us as human, but notably excludes the ultimate defining factor: our relatively gigantic brains. That’s alright; the evolution of the brain is surely a book or more unto itself. There are line drawings throughout to help clarify the subject, many of these show analogous structures between various creatures. I found this book to be readable and informative. It’s both concise and clear. It’s approachable to readers without scientific backgrounds. I’d recommend it for anyone interested in learning how the human body got to its present shape. "
80,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell,4,"The most excited a book has gotten me about evolution since Kenneth Miller a decade ago. True, I’ve held onto this copy of Your Inner Fish for a while, but it was worth every day of wait. Shubin is equally honest about his ineptitude at hunting fossils and at the awe of biological diversity on earth. By examining key structures in organisms, including fins, teeth and wombs, he renders a vivid understanding of how life could descend from fish, to dogs, and to us. By the end you’ll appreciate that we even have something in common with a silicon sponge.Now, Shubin gets undeniably weird. One section is devoted to why our genes don’t tell the womb to put an anus on the front and a mouth on our rear, but this was useful to me. I’ve mostly thought of evolution in terms of jigging up whatever is beneficial; a tenth of an eye happens because it helps you hunt, mate, etc. But there’ s another crucial component to evolution and biology in general: whatever develops has to be tenable. Evolution can’t make you do magic unless a magic-gland can be repurposed and mutated from existing organs or materials. How our teeth work show us why our skeletons developed in certain ways because similar processes developed them across the millennia. Understanding why our digestive systems, mouths and butts line up a certain way in natal development is crucial to understanding how evolution actually executes.He also undertakes the tricky task of giving us historical appreciation for discoveries. You may know about Richard Owen (discoverer of dinosaurs) and Charles Darwin (of evolution), but likely not of the ""Sonic hedgehog project"" or how salamanders revealed the nature of pre-birth development. These scientific studies, experiments and breakthroughs are presented as titanic achievements over things that previously no smart person understood. Only Bill Bryson has so successfully captured revelation in anecdote quite so succinctly and in such entertaining fashion.Altogether, I couldn’t have picked a more engaging first book for 2013. I only feel the least bit guilty about waiting so long to get to it."

""One of the joys of science is that, on occasion, we see a pattern that reveals the order in what initially seems chaotic."" 

Your Inner Fish is a more detailed and collected work than the only other science book that I have read (The Greatest Show on Earth by Richard Dawkins); assuming more knowledge than Dawkins' work, making the novel less accessible however, is more 'collected' as it does not jump from place to place as much (having more of a defined structure). Shubin is more personal and recounts many of his groundbreaking days in the field as a palaeontologist. This difference I enjoyed as Shubin was a very likeable narrator to an informative work. His discoveries are very intriguing and triggers a more unique and individual relationship between the author and his audience.I must look deeper into the gill arches which Shubin describes quite frequently as well as embryology and how different parts of DNA are switched on and off for different function. These aspects just flew over my head making the reading experience quite heavy as I could not understand it the first time it was mentioned however, whenever the topic was revisited Shubin assumed that the audience understood these concepts fully (and rightly so) but caused quite a few headaches on my part. This makes my rating of the novel very difficult because I am young and still have a lot to learn which is not the author's fault in the slightest.I think what makes this a 3-star read is that I found myself less in awe of what I was reading and also I had a lot less ""Holy Moly"" moments than in The Greatest Show on Earth. I must say however, when Shubin started talking about ears and teeth: that stuff was gold, pure gold. I will never tilt my head in the same way again. Also, I am never drinking alcohol and will make sure to walk all the time."
82,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,3,"YOUR INNER FISH BY NEIL SHUBIN: Neil Shubin is a professor and associate dean at the University of Chicago. Also a paleontologist, Shubin made headlines around the world in April 2006 when he discovered the “missing link” in the world of fish with Tiktaalik, a fish with many features like that of tetrapods or four-legged animals. When asked to teach a human anatomy course, Shubin discovered that a lot of the structures and evolutionary processes of the human body could be better explained through the evolution of fish anatomy. Thus was born Your Inner Fish: A Journey Into the 3.5 Billion-Year History of the Human Body.Shubin breaks everything down into its fundamental parts, with specific chapters on genes, teeth, scents, ears, and sight. He traces the evolutionary history of the important organs of the body, tracing their development over the millions of years through fish and other animals. It is a fascinating study into how the evolutionary marvel of the incredibly complex human body came to be; how organs, tissues, and vessels changed and improved through a process of natural selection to become the most beneficial. The result is a never-stopping fast-running factory house with over a million continuous processes that is taken for granted by most of the world’s population.Shubin writes in a simple and easy style that makes it accessible to any reader, no matter their scientific knowledge or background. Filled with pictures and tables and graphs illustrating the facts, Your Inner Fish is an interesting read into our evolutionary history as seen through the developing bodies of the animal kingdom.For more book reviews and exclusive author interviews, go to BookBanter."
83,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1478144-john,3,"I found myself reading this book midway through the screening of Shubin's three-part TV series of the same title (even better than Cosmos as an example of science communication), and for once in my life I found myself preferring the TV treatment . . . although the first episode of the series is based closely enough on the book that I could hear the echo of Shubin's voice speaking the words as I read! This isn't to say that the book's bad at all; but the screen version somehow seems more coherent, as if someone sat Shubin down and told him to focus on the evolutionary story he wanted to impart rather than bounce around the room telling us lots of exciting stuff about evolution.Of course, the TV series leaves out some of the good stuff, so the book's a very useful companion piece. And it offers one valuable insight (p118) that I think (unless my wife was speaking through it) the TV series didn't: that you can think of evolution as being like a family cake recipe, with which people tinker -- let's add raisins! -- so that, after many generations, it has changed really quite radically while still being recognizably the same basic recipe. Probably every else but me has come across the analogy une mille fois before, but . . .One oddity. Normally I can ignore the Oxford comma as the pretentious bit of faux-scholarliness that it is, but here for some reason I found it quite often impeding my comprehension, so that I was having to go back and reread sentences that would have been pellucid had it not been for the redundant commas. I don't know quite why this should have been; as I say, the usage doesn't usually trouble me too much. Perhaps Shubin wrote the book ""in clear"" and then someone came along and stuck all the commas in?"
84,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2892211-jason-mills,3,"Shubin's team spent several summers in the frozen north looking for fossils of creatures that were evolving to live on land. Ultimately they discovered an exciting fossil called Tiktaalik, whose skull is flat like a reptile's and whose limbs begin to resemble those of many lineages, including mammals and thus humans. After describing this expedition and the predictive methodology that told them where to look, Shubin uses Tiktaalik as the launch-pad for comparing elements of our own anatomy with their predecessors in ancestral species. We learn, for instance, how the jaw-bones of reptiles became the tiny bones of our inner ears, and how the hiccup derives from an ill-placed nerve we inherited from fish and a respiratory gulping action still seen in tadpoles.It is, then, a book about homologies; yet it's telling that that word does not appear in the text. Though the author plainly knows his stuff, this book is perhaps pitched a little too low for its likely audience. I encountered plenty of details that were new to me, but few fresh ideas. Contrast this with, say, Nick Lane's Life Ascending, which delves deep enough to continually surprise the reader with natural selection's 'blind ingenuity'. Where that book was a full meal, Shubin's feels more like a light lunch.Nonetheless, it does a good job at its own level. It's very well illustrated, wide-ranging and thoroughly accessible, even chatty: I found the writing at its most engaging when Shubin was describing field-work. My paperback edition includes an afterword written a year after the hardback, updating a few items. There's also notes-cum-bibliography and index."
85,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2439329-keith-davis,4,"Neil Shubin is a paleontologist who spent years teaching anatomy to medical students. His combined background in ancient fossils and human anatomy gives him a unique perspective on the evolution of the human body, both its wonders and its flaws. Shubin's view of the human body is like a car that has been rebuilt many many times to serve different functions. Imagine you started with a small sedan and then expanded it into a big family minivan, then added a racing engine, then attached a plow and turned it into a bulldozer. Each adaptation of the vehicle would be built up on parts of the older vehicles, leading to all manner of awkward design issues. For example, mammals get hiccups because the nerves that control our breathing muscles have the same wiring that ancient amphibians used to breath in quick gulps and then seal their lungs against drowning.Speaking as someone who lives in the American Southeast, I live in an environment in which a large portion of the public (maybe even the majority) believe evolution is a lie from Devil meant to trick people into doubting the Bible. Shubin wisely never discusses the anti-evolution controversies, he just lays out the biological facts and the prevailing scientific explanations for them. Books like Your Inner Fish are perfect for people who are struggling with the idea of evolution. He shows that the human body is not a masterpiece of perfect conscious design, but rather a fish adapted into a reptile then adapted into a small mammal and then into upright primate, and evidence of the earlier forms can be found throughout the structure."
86,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,4,"In this book Neil Shubin describes his recent discovery of a transitional fossil between fish and four-legged land creatures on Ellesmere Island, in the Canadian arctic. After consulting with Inuit tribes, he named the find ""Tiktaalik"" -- ""fish with wrist"".Shubin then goes on to describe how many features of our bodies are rooted in ""primitive"" prehistoric creatures. Human teeth, for instance, which have varied functions yet perfectly occlude, originated in some tiny rodents. Our ears are descended from the jaws of ancient fish. 1000 genes (3% of our genome) are devoted to odors, but 300 of these (ie 30%) of these are inactivated due to mutations -- evidently once we developed color vision we didn't need to rely on smell much any more.What's more, many of our modern-day afflictions are rooted in our shadowy past. Knees are injury prone (but fish didn't have to walk on two legs); obesity, heart disease and diabetes are serious health issues (but our hunger for sweets and fats served our ancestors well in recurrent feast-famine cycles); sleep apnea affects many adults (it stems from our flexible throat descended from fish gill bars); and hernias are a problem in many men (in sharks and other fish, testes were up near the heart; only in more advanced animals have they descended to the exterior of the body, resulting in a weak spot).This is all very interesting reading. But it also makes clear why those advocating ""intelligent design"" and the like are barking up the wrong tree. Indeed, these results make a compelling case for the evolutionary paradigm."
87,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59013922-reid,4,"The book 'Your Inner Fish' by Neil Shubin takes you on an evolutionary adventure through time to explore the finite process of how mankind came from Tiktaalik, Neil's favorite ""Fish with a wrist"", to modern day humans. Neil's story begins with a crisp, detailed and sometimes humorous look at his career as a paleontologist and his adventures. He explains the kinds of expeditions he and his colleagues venture on and the research that is often correlated with their findings, and also research on subjects that overall are related to Neil's field of profession. Neil's story then enthusiastically flows into the relation between the research behind paleontology and evolution with his extraordinary explanation of the correlation and evolution between the limbs, eyes, jaws, genome, and overall anatomy of ancient fish to our own species. I am very interested in Neil's amazing explanation of the journey behind our own bodies and how he deeply explains every detail. He helpfully fills his work with diagrams and visuals to help the reader understand what he is explaining while keeping you exceedingly hooked the whole way through. His work is secretly covered with emotion and a sense of discovery by how he explains it and simply the general idea and subject of the story. For anyone who is attracted to the miracle of the science in evolution, who is studying evolution, or simply anyone who can't find the right book, this book can inform and amaze whoever reads it by simply telling the story of your inner fish."
88,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58384939-callum-quinn,4,"This fantastic book starts with an account of the expeditions that uncovered the 375-million-year-old fossils that provide inexorable evidence for the theory that life originated in the sea before transitioning to life on the land. Neil Shubin, the head of the Anatomy Department at the University of Chicago, takes us on a trip through the course of the evolutionary path from ancient fish to modern humans.By drawing information from the fields of palaeontology, embryology and genetics, Shubin describes how the particular characteristics of the human body and all mammals alike, owe their current state to billions of years of evolutionary change. The gel-filled sac like cells that run the length of a fish that allow it to interpret the the flow of water around its body, are the same cell type located in the cochlea of humans which allow us to hear. We know this to be true, not only because these structures are phenotypically very similar, but because they develop from the same germ layer in the embryo of each animal and are encoded for by the same comparative genes. This is just one example of many that Shubin uses to reveal the secrets of our inner fish. As a biologist, the main down side to this book for me, is that it's not thrice as detailed and six hundred pages long. None the less, this is a great piece of scientific writing presenting EVEN MORE solid evidence for the theory of evolution, and definitely worth a read. Especially for today's backwards creationists that are still in denial about how the creatures of the earth came to be."
89,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30481431-ana,4,"For many years, I have been interested in the innermost intimacies of the human body. While school taught me a few things about anatomy, it seemed to me that all of this was just information about the final product which, interesting as it may have been, was simply not enough. What I needed to know was the exact circumstances of how we started and the actual processes that molded a bunch of cells into limbs and organs and tissues.When I first lay eyes on this book, I thought it was going to be a text on how our fish ancestors moved house from water to land. While a certain part of the book does indeed tackle this issue, a significant number of chapters linger on what I had been longing to know for many years, and that is how we made it to our final form. I'm convinced the author meant a lot more than that and it surely is fascinating to read about what makes human similar to frogs or flies or worms and how all of us ultimately descend from a fish-like common ancestor, but the part about the very origins of human body was truly the most reveling to me.The language however was ofttimes too scientific and I had to look up certain terms because the explanations were too vague or all of a sudden. That shouldn't stop you from reading this book though. It really is a game changer."
90,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063661-woodge,2,"Neil Shubin is a paleontologist who delves briefly into the history of the human body by way of fossils and DNA evidence. Sure, I learned stuff... like how interconnected all the species really are; and that mammals have three bones in the inner ear while other species have fewer; and that there's a gene called Sonic hedgehog; and how to extract DNA using common household appliances and items you could easily buy in a store (a blender is involved and I'm easily reminded of the Bass-O-Matic). But, really this short book (just over 200 pages) was a bit of a slog to get through (although the explanations are clear enough). I've read other non-fiction that was much more compelling. But if you've an interest in fossils and DNA and where we came from, you might find this enlightening. But since this book deals with actual science, I definitely wouldn't recommend this book to Creationists. Though I suppose a Creationist wouldn't be picking up a title like this one in the first place. They're probably looking for something more along the lines of Your Inner Godliness: A Journey Into the Four Thousand Year History of the Human Body. But I digress."
91,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8220121-lissa,4,"The author explains the human body by interweaving aspects of the fossil record, embryology, physiology, comparative anatomy, and genetics in a manner that is widely understandable. In doing so, he provides the current (2008) scientific understanding of evolution - although this is not explicitly stated. It is a compelling story and if evolution were taught as part of what we know about our own biology, starting in grade school, I doubt that there would be the degree of public controversy over teaching evolution that exists in some places today. That controversy, in and of itself is a prime example and result of how our schools are failing - but I digress. Understanding the biology also leads one to the conclusion that if humans were designed intelligently, there would major differences in both anatomy and physiology, which would leave us less vulnerable to different types of problems.I rated this book a 4, not a 5, because of the narrative style. When the author sticks to the scientific subject matter, he does well. His forays into his own personal experiences are annoying and detracting, as are his attempts at humor."
92,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17741126-sadia-zaman,4,"Recently I've been enjoying non-fictions related to evolution and history. This book covers both, Neil Shubin starts with his experience and journey to discover Tiktaalik; which links fishes to amphibians. Along the ride, we see how we humans are connected anatomically to various other animals, starting from microbes to jelly fishes to sharks. We also get a glimpse of how a little tweaking of genes here and there reveals fascinating results. The parts I enjoyed most were when he was talking about teeth, eye and ear formation, how alcohol consumption affects our body. Those chapters were pure gold. Only thing I can complain about this book is I wish there were more details. For example, when he said there was a link between our colorful vision formation and forests going from monochromatic to colorful; I was longing for more on matters like these on some parts of the book. Even if you don't have science background, I feel like you wouldn't face much problem in following the book. It explained well various scientific terms and process. Overall, I enjoyed it well and might read it for second time."
93,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1553970-eric,2,"Archaeology, anatomy, evolution...these are not things where I am well versed to give a thoughtful review, but since I've insulted this work with two stars, I should explain: I was awaiting the chapter that would make me reconsider myself as a fish and send me running to a swimming pool for relief - and did not find it.Basically, this seems more like an overview of evolution and the title's idea seems like a last thought of many chapters. The diagrams are, at times, more relevatory than the prose. For example, four weeks after concepton, in what Shubin calls the tube-within-a-tube phase, a human resembles a fish - and we know that from the diagram. I liked Shubin's analogy of how long life has existed: if the earth's history were a calendar year, not until October would there be an organism with a head; and a human would not appear until December 31. Shubin is no doomsdayer, but I think the directors of the Doomsday Clock could certainly take his thoughts a couple minutes closer to midnight."
94,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49874567-matt-davis,3,"I realize that my comprehension of molecular and evolutionary biology is likely above that of the book's target audience, so please take this review with that in mind. In my opinion, the book started out a little weak and truthfully, I found it unremarkable. However, it slowly picked up pace and began working into an informative series of sections. For the high school or early college-level student, this book may be a great source of invitation to the world of biology and evolution. Several genetic and evolutionary concepts are explained in varying degrees of clarity, but the end result is this: humans share a common ancestor with all other members of the Animal Kingdom. There were moments where it felt as if Dr. Shubin was actually condescending to the readers, and I admit I feel asleep a time or two when he would re-visit an anology that had been made half a dozen times prior. However, the information presented in his book is informative, easily approachable, and at times very interesting. I would lie if I said I learned nothing from its ~200 pages."
95,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/705887-broodingferret,2,"This book wasn't terribly engaging. Though it certainly possessed its share of interesting points, it was simplistic in its explication and amounted to little more than a collection of interesting trivia points mixed with some nostalgic recollections of past paleontological digs. Shubin was also remarkably timid whenever he referred to the book's underlying theme of evolutionary relationships between lifeforms; he didn't even use the terms 'evolution' or 'natural selection' until the very end, opting instead to make circuitous references to 'relationships' and 'similarities'. The whole approach struck me as an attempt to sneak evolutionary concepts past the predicted skepticism of some of his readers, and a clumsy attempt at that. Still, there's some interesting information in the book, and his brief discussion of the trials and tribulations of digging up fossils in the Arctic was enjoyable; the treatment of the main topic, however, could have been done better."
96,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3735303-eleanor,4,"I learned a lot from this easy to read book on evolution. Neil Shubin is a paleontologist and professor of anatomy who co-discovered the infamous Tiktaalik ""the fish with hands."" He has a lot to share and is very passionate about his field of study. I learned about the things I have in common with sharks, fish, tadpoles and one-celled microbes. I, personally, really enjoyed that. My only complaint (and the reason I gave this four stars instead of five) is that Shubin is most definitely a scientist, not a writer. Although I wouldn't have had it any other way (a writer, not a scientist telling me about evolution), his editor seems to have been very lax in removing over-used words and expressions. I don't think I've ever read a book by any author (other than Dan Brown, who has an affinity for italics) that said ""jury-rigged"" on just about every other page. If you are interested in exciting science, I highly recommend this book."

I am deeply pleased when lots of disparate threads are connected in ways that throw new light in many directions. Shubin is the co-discoverer of Tiktaalik, a fossil that stands between fish and land creatures in the evolutionary tree of life. Shubin is enthralled by the beauty and wonder of life, and his passion is strong and clear in this book. He makes clear and readable how the history of our own human development is written into our bodies. We do indeed have in us our connection with Tiktaalik as well as earlier life forms, all the way back to bacteria. Our bones, organs, blood, brains, and even the ways we tend to get sick, all display this connection, and Shubin does a marvelous job of showing how humans are enmeshed in the great flow of life on this planet. I recommend this book for any who want solid scientific knowledge of evolutionary biology, as well as science that reads like a good novel. "

The documentary with the same name is great, too! Some of the examples that stand out were the detailed examples of the evolution of the middle ear and the weakness in humam design that causes men to get inguinal hernias.

The information presented here and the described trajectory of single-celled organisms to human beings are simply astonishing -- this is the kind of book that causes you regularly to stop and think, ""that's cool."" Nevertheless, I hold this book back a little bit in that it ultimately reads less like literature than as a string of anecdotes. Despite somewhat pedestrian writing, though, Shubin carries you through with competence and good cheer, and you learn a lot along the way (you'll never experience your hiccups the same way again)."

AND an inner worm (well, let's just say we've all noticed the worm). I adored this book. Mine was the Kindle edition. I only wish the illustrations were a bit more legible (putting on the old reading glasses helped the majority of the time).What did I learn? That the anatomy found on earth uses the same old pieces of the pie over and over again, just reshapes them to new use. Gill slits become inner ear bits, etc. ... The convolutions in our abdomens are millions of years of reorienting other bits. Our evolution is written in our very bodies and footnoted by all the other species that went their separate ways.Bah!

I read it in one or two sittings, and I liked the simple but specific writing style and the handy, no-fuss illustrations. I already knew a fair amount of the material presented, but was particularly interested to learn new things about my teeth, ears, and sense of smell. It was a bit awkward to read this as an animal advocate--Shubin presents a clearly hierarchical vision of life on Earth, and he doesn't seem to have any problem with zoos, etc.--but hey, I'm glad to have a glimpse into his fascinating world."

Though I am not a scientist, I was able to understand this book. While plodding in parts or loaded down with a lot of info in parts, this book is a treasure trove of information from a highly scientific mind, and one that belongs in any library - whether a general/public one or the personal collection of a scientist (or myself!)For those wanting to read about evolution, this book starts off as a great starting point. There are so many evolution books out there, and I can honestly say that this is a good one. "

Billion years to the present. Really. It has great illustration that, for example, explain how the inner ear, detached, floating pieces of bone and cartilage were once a solid piece of bone on a fish, or why a shark embryo looks so much like a human one.It's a great book for a high school student or an elderly layman trying to satisfy his curiosity."

While filled with intimidating vocabulary at times, it's an easy-to-read and detailed account of our ancestral history. The book is overarching as it touches on topics from fossil recovery to the science behind drunken ""spins."" Being someone that knows the principle of evolution but nothing further, the book provided excellent exposure to what evolution looks like biologically, from genealogy to similarities in species' embryotic development.

The book talks about how different parts of our bodies contain the remnants of and the evidence for evolution. My favourite parts would be the ones where the author writes about his field works and lab works I kind of wish it could focus on Tiktaalik a little more. Sometimes, certain facts are repeated a few times which seems unnecessary. The author does try to write in a very accessible way so it's suitable for anyone who is interested in evolutionary biology or biology in general."
106,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635936-jeremy,4," evolutionary biology is an endlessly fascinating subject, and shubin's exploration is remarkably accessible and engaging. i wonder, however, whether creation scientists (outdoing even the most oxymoronic), when not cursing the incontrovertibility of the fossil record, recoil moreso at the thought of having emerged from the selfsame primordial ooze as all other living things, or at the notion that if they accede to the logic of evolution then the remainder of their reasoning will suddenly appear as laughably spurious. everytime an archaeologist unearths another bone fragment, jesus punches a dinosaur. "
107,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/918607-rachel,4,"Shubin, a paleoichthyologist, tackles major trends in the water-to-land-to-bipedalism transitions with a good sense of humor about the whole ordeal. For the lay anatomy enthusiast, this book does an excellent job of summarizing shared anatomies and evolutionary scenarios while not getting bogged down by terminology. Particularly enjoyable is his manner of incorporating modern medical maladies with an evolutionary perspective on the human body. For the more advanced student, chapters on middle ear evolution, CN X distribution, etc. will be old hand (and the presentation a tad superficial) – but a fun, brief read nonetheless."

I was glad I had visited the museum in Vernal, Utah (Dinosaur Country) recently because of how it explained why paleontologists can go to certain places and be sure of finding fossils, because of the different time periods for the different geological formations (which I have also been very interested in), and this book talks about learning how to find fossils as well as learning from them. The book also has instructions for extracting DNA, which I thought was great. I'll have to try it sometime."
109,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1803718-jackie,5,"This was an outstanding book on human evolution from the fields of paleontology and embryology. Written by a scientist whose discovery filled a gap in the fossil record, his recount of geographical exploration highlights the complexity of finding the right fossils in the appropriately aged rock. Coupled with his experience as a professor in medical schools, his understanding of the human body and it's connection to the other animals whose genes we share in modified descent is fascinating. This book is a must read for students of biology, anatomy & physiology, and medicine. I expect to read a lot more books on evolutionary medicine. And, now, I understand hiccups. Cool."

Although most of the facts and experiments from this book I read before, it was a pleasure to meet them under one cover and learn more.  Genius of nature has created incredibly complicated and distinguished world inside of us. We possess the most perfect system ever known, but do we treat it accordingly? You do not have enough motivation to work on yourself, quit bad habits, ect? This book might help. Are you trying to know thyself? This book will definitely help! "

The explanations were for the laymen, without being too dumbed down. There was quite a bit of humor thrown in at random intervals too! However I felt the read a little inconsistent in the mix between humor, fact, and stories making it difficult to get drawn in to. I would have rated it 3.5/5 if there was an optionAlthough now I have to admit, I think about lungfish and whale ancestors quite a bit recently...  "

144,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14131374-anthony-lawson,5,"This work has become a classic where the author illustrates the human body through it's evolutionary history from the remote past up to today.Chapter 1 - Finding your inner fishIn chapter 1 we are introduced to the idea that we can see patterns in the fossil record that shows that we are related to other organisms. He tells how to employ these concepts of relatedness to determine the best location to find specific kinds of fossils. In this case he was looking for fossils that showed the transition between fish and land animals. He then recounts the steps that led him to the Arctic in Canada and of the discovery of Tiktaalik. Chapter 2 - Getting a gripShubin tells us of his own experience in a medical school anatomy lab where he had to dissect human cadavers. This brings us into a discussion about how certain features, specifically the limb bones, showed a pattern, one that was discovered by Richard Owen back in mid 19th century prior to the publication of Darwin's Origin. This limb pattern (one bone-two bones-lotsa blobs-digits) are found in many animals but we can see the beginnings of these features in ancient fish.Chapter 3 - Handy genesChaper three moves from fossils to DNA and tells the story of the discovery of the Sonic hedgehog gene and the role it plays in forming limbs. This gene was initially found in flies, but was soon seen in chickens, mice, humans, and even sharks. The Sonic hedgehog gene speaks to our common relatedness.Chapter 4 - Teeth everywhereTeeth and bones are another example of how fish, humans, and other animals are related to each other.Shubin nicely summarizes the first four chapters,""A theme of these first four chapters is how we can trace the same organ in different creatures. In Chapter 1 we saw that we can make predictions and find versions of our organs in ancient rocks. In Chapter 2 we saw how we can trace similar bones all the way from fish to humans. Chapter 3 shows how the real heritable part of our bodies—the DNA and genetic recipe that builds organs—can be followed in very different creatures. Here, in teeth, mammary glands, and feathers, we find a similar theme. The biological processes that make these different organs are versions of the same thing. When you see these deep similarities among different organs and bodies, you begin to recognize that the diverse inhabitants of our world are just variations on a theme.""Chapter 5 - Getting aheadShubin tells us about the history of the head, its various nerves, how they are developed from gill arches and how we see these develop in various organisms, again, showing our relatedness even to ancient worms.Chapter 6 - The best-laid (body) plansShubin argues that there is a fundamental pattern of life and we see it in embryos. The chapter has a nice discussion of Hox genes, embryology, and how development is a recipe.Chapter 7 - Adventures in bodybuildingThe chapter traces the origins of bodies and discusses their component parts focusing in on such molecules like collagen and proteoglycans.Chapter 8 - Making scentsShubin argues that the sense of smell shows a general pattern of relatedness, whether we are talking about fish, amphibians, or mammals including us. Shubin nicely writes,""We carry a lot of baggage in our noses—or, more precisely, in the DNA that controls our sense of smell. Our hundreds of useless olfactory genes are left over from mammal ancestors who relied more heavily on the sense of smell to survive. In fact, we can take these comparisons deeper still. Like photocopies that lose their fidelity as they are repeatedly copied, our olfactory genes get more dissimilar as we compare ourselves to successively more primitive creatures. Our genes are similar to primates', less similar to other mammals', less similar still to reptiles', amphibians', fishes', and so on. That baggage is a silent witness to our past; inside our noses is a veritable tree of life.""Chapter 9 - VisionThe history and diversity of eyes and vision are traced, from the opsin molecule found in bacteria to the processes of how eyes are switched on with the pax 6 gene. Vision points to our relatedness to all organisms.Chapter 10 - EarsShubin tells the story of the evolution of the ear, focusing in part on the relationship between the reptilian and mammalian ears and there transitions. He also examines the common genes used in hearing that shows we have a common history.Chaper 11 - The Meaning of it allShubin concludes his work by showing the close relatedness that he's been discussing throughout the book are evidence of descent with modification and illustrates the tree of life: evolution. He then continues the illustration with a number of short sections showing how various ailments and diseases can be traced back to our earlier origins.The book has been enhanced with a three part documentary hosted by the author with the same title as the book.The book (and the documentary) are highly recommended."
145,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44193447-dean-boulton,3,"Your Inner Fish: A Journey Into the 3.5 Billion-Year History of the Human Body, written by the palaeontologist and evolutionary biologist Nick Schubin, sets out to explain the profound anatomical connections between primitive and ancient animals such as fish, and modern humans. The inspiration for this investigation is explained to have come from a time in the author’s life in which he, a palaeontologist who had mainly worked on fish fossils, came to be teaching a course on human anatomy at a university- so naturally, the author is well qualified to write a book on this topic.The book explores these connections by delivering a more or less sequential history of human evolutionary development, organising chapters into explorations of the original development/subsequent evolution of various body parts or senses, such as limbs, teeth, eyes, bodies in general, olfactory senses, and the like. Each chapter offers an investigation and exploration of fossil records, DNA/gene analysis, and embryonic development in order to show the reader the deep connections between these body structures in humans and other animals. In doing this, the author provides a mini history of developments and discoveries in various scientific fields, along with some of his own personal field experience as a palaeontologist and evolutionary biologist.The tone of the book is relatively easy to understand, and it is clear that the author has gone to great lengths to ensure that the book is as accessible to as wide an audience as possible- at no stage was I lost in any of the scientific explanations as to how certain phenomena were discovered, etc. The book is also structured in an appealing manner, with each chapter focussing on a particular body structure, which also made for easy reading.My personal take is that this is a very interesting book, well structured, easy to understand and dotted with many interesting facts, while sticking to a streamlined and sensical structure as to not lose the reader. However, that being said, the book is certainly not a sort of tome-like magnum opus for the dedicated science reader, rather it is targeted at the layman who is interested in some interesting, but quick reading. This is not as much a criticism but more just a matter of taste, and what you are after in a science book (for those interested in large scientific tomes, I would recommend The Emperor of All Maladies, or The Big Picture 😊 )Some of the more interesting takeaways from the book, for those looking to “try before they buy” were the author’s explanation of some of the “faults” in our bodies as a result of the evolutionary process- an example given is hiccoughs, which might result from leftover “programming” in our brain stems from the time when we were tadpoles- the hiccough involves a specific series of actions in which we intake air, but part of our throat closes, which is the precise mechanism of action that tadpoles use to suck water through their gills without getting water into their lungs (they have both apparently, which is interesting in itself)Another really interesting part of the book was the discussion of the development of bodies, in which the author explains various reasons that single celled organisms might have evolved into multicellular organisms in the first place. One explanation is that they would evolve in this manner in order to avoid predation (increased size means decreased depredation), and surprisingly, this theory was able to be replicated in a laboratory. When a bunch of single celled organisms were left on their own, they remained single celled for hundreds of generations. But when a predator was introduced, after a number of generations the formerly single celled organisms were found to be clumped together into eight-celled clumps- the sweet spot between large enough to avoid predators, and small enough to still take in enough sunlight to survive. A very cool experiment.Overall this is a solid and interesting book, reasonably short, that is full of a lot of interesting facts that will certainly give most readers an appreciation of both the evolutionary history of our bodies, and of the actual complexity and importance of appendages and organs that we largely just take for granted. Of course, the book also gives a very powerful insight the extent to which we share things with other animals such as fish, and even bacteria."
146,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92222187-william,5,"YOUR INNER FISH reminds me of Richard Dawkins' THE ANCESTOR'S TALE, the reading of which gave me truly new insight into the workings of physical evolution. Even though I devoured Dawkins' work some time ago, I can say the same for Shubin's book. Shubin, however, does not delve as deeply into his subject as Dawkins nor present as many details, hence the subject I've used for this review. Also, while Dawkins' book may challenge the conceptual skills of a college graduate, Shubin's is, I feel, as appropriate for young adults of, say, high school level reading ability, as it is for older adults.Both authors are far, far more readable and capable of sustaining a reader's interest than the father of evolutionary theory, Charles Darwin, was. I would greatly prefer to reread both YOUR INNER FISH and THE ANCESTOR'S TALE than to plow through the dry facts in Darwin's ORIGIN OF SPECIES again.While I believe it is fairly accurate to observe that Dawkins explains the process and the proof of physical evolution partly in terms of molecular structure and function, Shubin does so primarily by demonstrating that more or less every part of the human anatomy has its counterpart in creatures of far simpler structure with origins that predated the earliest modern humans by millions of years. It is fascinating to see how primitive physical structures changed in location, form and function over the 500 million or so years that animals with body structures have existed on the earth. Not all of these are particularly intuitive, either; for example, I'd have never guessed that the tiny bones in my middle ear originated as gill arches in fish!Paleontology finds a prominent place in Shubin's book. The importance of the fossil record to our understanding of evolution is well illustrated by the discovery of Tiktaalik, a fossil fish with the rudiments of modern wrist bones in its fins. Shubin does not stop with his successful comparisons of modern humans and ancient fish, however. If we proceed farther into the realm of rudimentary life forms, we see the equivalence of the notochord in worms with our own spinal column. Without belaboring the fact or using biological names for organisms, Shubin also demonstrates the principle behind taxonomy and the grouping of life forms into kingdoms, families, genus, species and other such categories.Among my favorite “pet peeves” is the almost universal human practice of speciesism, the faith-based belief that humans are superior to and hold natural dominance over other animals. (Early Christians even wrote this belief into their bible.) If there is one thing that should cause such believers in human supremacy to reconsider their assumption, it is the fact that every structure in their bodies has evolved from equivalent structures in the bodies of other animals and that even the structure of their individual cells can be seen in the simplest unicellular microbes. Without the mitochondria in their bodies' cells to convert sugar and oxygen into energy, they'd cease to live, yet those mitochondria once were free-living microbes! If our bodies hurt or sicken, the malady is in many cases traceable to the fact that our bodily structures began in aquatic environments and have yet to adapt perfectly to bipedalism. Shubin's book is not only instructive but, more importantly, is also humbling. It adroitly shows humans' place in the much larger animal kingdom and helps us see that we are only a point on a continuum of constantly evolving life forms.I heartily recommend YOUR INNER FISH to every reader from teen years through adulthood who wishes to understand humanity's place as a life form among many such life forms on the earth and how we came to be where we are. I do wish the book were longer, for the final sections dealing with evolution-related illnesses are all too brief, but if Shubin's book awakens one's curiosity. Dawkins' THE ANCESTOR'S TALE would be an excellent follow-on."
147,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67737925-ethelinda-webb,4,"This book was a Christmas present from a family member, who rightly guessed that I would enjoy it. It was very good!The author is a paleontologist and professor of anatomy, and he has a clear, engaging writing style that was very easy to read. The book is (as you might guess from the title) talking about evolution as it relates to the biology and anatomy of the human body.I really loved the way he talks about science! He talks about his lab (which is half fossils and half genetics/DNA, apparently), and he talked about looking for fossils in ways that I hadn’t thought about before. He points out that while yes, there is a certain amount of luck involved in actually finding the fossils you’re looking for, you have to start by doing the right prep work identifying where your chances will be greatest.He uses the example of wanting to find an intermediate stage between finned fish and amphibians with true limbs, a transition which happened between 385 and 365 million years ago. So, he had to identify rocks in that age range, of the right type to preserve fossils at all (meaning, sedimentary rocks), and that were somewhere exposed/accessible to people. In this case, Ellesmere Island in Canada, north of the Arctic Circle, turned out to be the best place, and so that is where he and his team have gone summer after summer. And, after many seasons, they did in fact find the kind of fossil they were looking for; Tiktaalik was a fish that had fins…but they were fins with bones in them, and bones in the same basic number/arrangement that we see in all limbed animals today.He does a really good job of working the reader through a somewhat abstract idea (that we can trace our bodies/body parts/body construction back in time through evolution, as evidenced by both fossils and genetics), by providing several concrete examples that show this, and going through the process each time. Looking at our bodies this way helps to make sense of some things about us that seem confusing when you think about them by themselves. Hiccups, for example. Why do we get hiccups? Well, probably because our bodies are descended from amphibious creatures that needed to be able to switch back and forth between breathing with lungs in air and breathing with gills in water. The muscle/nerve combination that causes hiccups originally worked as a pausing mechanism that allowed for that switch…only we don’t need it anymore, so for us it’s just a leftover thing our bodies do that can be a nuisance.All of his examples are really interesting like that. Going back to limbs, he points out that every vertebrate creature that has limbs has limb bones in the exact same combination: one upper bone, two lower bones, blobby bones in the “wrist,” and then rod-like bones that radiate from those (fingers/toes, for us). The exact shapes, lengths and configurations of these bones are very different in an alligator, a bat, and a human, but the same basic combination is there in all three animals. In another example, he talks about nerves in the human head, some of which are very complex and kind of confusing, because they do lots of different-seeming things. But when you look at them from a developmental view, they make perfect sense, because one nerve is connected to all the various parts of the head that form from one “gill arch” on the human embryo, and another nerve is connected to all the parts that form from another “gill arch,” and so on. (Those “gill arches” are so called because, in fish like sharks, they do actually form into gills. In humans, they are present when we are an embryo, but then develop into various parts of our face, jaw, neck, and throat.)So it was a very interesting book! It falls into the category of “I sort of knew the basics of this"" (evolution and how it works), but this book lays it out so much more specifically and with such fantastic examples that it just becomes much, much clearer in my head. Books like that are the best ones, for me. I definitely recommend this one to anyone interested in paleontology, science, evolution, or the history of life on earth. A fantastic read!"
148,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54858719-suzanne-dia,5,"always found myself interested in Evolution and biology in general, I think they’re extremely interesting, so I was looking forward to read something about evolution and I started with this book. So basically, in 2004, Neil Shubin, a paleontologist, co-discovered a fossil that belongs to an animal that has some characteristics of fish and some characteristics of land-living animals, and this fossil belongs to a time period that was prior to the appearance of amphibians but way after that of fishes , which means that this animal, that they called Tiktaalik, is the link between fish and land-living animalsSo four years after this, Neil Shubin wrote this book to explain this discovery, as well as other related researches, to the general publicSo this book discusses the evolutionary origin of the organs and structures found in the human body, each chapter follows the history of a specific body part and tries to answer the question “where, exactly, in the evolutionary tree did this body structure arise?”, for example, one chapter discusses the origin of heads, another discusses the origin of eyes, or ears..etcI thoroughly enjoyed this book, I don’t think I can recommend it enough, the first chapter was my favorite, it was written like a documentary, so while reading you feel like you’re watching a documentary which made it really interesting and just a total page turnerIt was very informative, I personally gained a lot from it, one example that sticks out is the fact that there’s a gene called Sonic Hedgehog, now isn’t that interesting?. but I also find it not as detailed as I hoped, there were many things mentioned in the book that weren’t discussed thoroughly or weren’t as clear, so I had to research them online, but I don’t know if this is the book’s fault or my fault. I don’t think this book was meant to be an introduction to evolution, it doesn’t discuss the basic mechanisms of evolution, instead it discusses the origin of body parts according to evolution, so for someone who doesn’t even know what evolution is, this might not be the book to start with.If a science book’s job is to make the reader more curious about the subject, and make them want to read more about it, then this book totally succeed in that, I’m looking forward to read something else about this topic, and I recommend this book to anyone interested in biology or science in general.Quotes:“Do the facts of our ancient history mean that humans are not special or unique among living creatures? Of course not. In fact, knowing something about the deep origins of humanity only adds to the remarkable fact of our existence: all of our extraordinary capabilities arose from basic components that evolved in ancient fish and other creatures. From common parts came a very unique construction. We are not separate from the rest of the living world; we are part of it down to our bones”“Take the entire 4.5-billion-year history of the earth and scale it down to a single year, with January 1 being the origin of the earth and midnight on December 31 being the present. Until June, the only organisms were single-celled microbes, such as algae, bacteria, and amoebae. The first animal with a head did not appear until October. The first human appears on December 31. We, like all the animals and plants that have ever lived, are recent crashers at the party of life on earth.”"
149,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595-robert,4,"(1) I really enjoyed Shubin's vivid descriptions of what it's like to search for fossils in remote locations. (2) I really enjoyed the individual chapters which discussed in detail some very specific anatomical similarities between different species, especially in arm structure ( chapter 2), teeth (chapter 4) and body plans ( chapter 6). Some of these similarities are pretty striking, for example how the arm/wing/fin bones of many different species follow the same pattern.(3) I REALLY liked these quotes from the section ""Why history makes us sick"" in Chapter 11 (the last chapter).""Take the body plan of a fish, dress it up to be a mammal, then tweak and twist that mammal until it walks on two legs, talks, thinks, and has superfine control of its fingers - and you have a recipe for problems""""Our deep history was spent, at different times, in ancient oceans, small streams, and savannahs, not office buildings, ski slopes, and tennis courts. We were not designed to live past the age of eighty, sit on our keisters for ten hours a day, and eat Hostess twinkies, nor were we designed to play football""In certain aspects we're not well adapted for modern life:-We're not supposed to be so sedentary (our ancestors were rather active)-We're not supposed to have so much food available to us (our ancestors had food scarcity)-We're not supposed to have digital distractions 24/7 (Our ancestors didn't have smartphones).-We're not supposed to seek popularity from millions of internet followers (our ancestors didn't have Instagram)-We're not supposed to regularly stay up past midnight (Our ancestors didn't have artificial lighting, and besides they couldn't really do much after the sun went down)So basically, we didn't naturally evolve ways to deal with many aspects of modern existence.QUESTIONS:(1) Are humans still evolving? Will our descendants be better adapted for modernity?(2) Humans are the only ""intelligent"" species that we know of. Has this ""broken"" evolution? Do the old patterns no longer apply?(3) Could we have evolved very differently if conditions were slightly different? Perhaps a differently shaped species would have developed technology? Or was something very similar to humans very likely to evolve on Earth given the basic laws of physics and chemistry?"
150,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68288026-huan-ha,5,"A wonderful book. A book of science that, unlike many existing books of the same type, can be read and enjoyed by almost everybody. This book, certainly, is not a deep, advanced analysis about the history of creature. It is a friendly, easy-to-read version of many studies that researchers have conducted for years. There are some jargons that, I guess, are unavoidable to keep the flow of the story. However, will the minimum knowledge about biology and some clicks on Wikipedia, everybody can digest the book without any difficulty. The book describes, not only the beauty of evolution, but also convinces us the importance to understand the biological relationship between human and the rest of creature. I will, for sure, put this book in the reading list of high-school students. Một cuốn sách hay, bổ ích và cuốn hút. Neil Shubin đã mô tả một cách sống động những bằng chứng về chuỗi tiến hoá của sinh vật, cách thức chúng ta phát hiện ra những bằng chứng đó và tầm quan trọng của việc hiểu rõ chuỗi tiến hoá. Một cuốn sách khoa học, nhưng không khó đọc. Dĩ nhiên vẫn còn một vài từ chuyên môn mà tôi đoán không thể tránh được nhằm đảm bảo tính trôi chảy của câu chuyện. Tuy nhiên, với một ít kiến thức sinh học và vài lần tra cứu wikipedia, bất kỳ ai cũng có thể hiểu được trọn vẹn nội dung cuốn sách. Trong cuốn sách, tác giả không chỉ mô tả vẻ đẹp của tiến hoá mà còn cung cấp đầy đủ bằng chứng và quá trình mà các nhà khoa học tìm ra những bằng chứng đó. Giữa những phân tích khoa học, ta thấy được sự đam mê, yêu nghề và tính kiên nhẫn của các nhà khoa học, và đồng thời ta biết được lý do vì sao họ lao động cật lực như vậy: niền tin bền bỉ rằng kiến thức mà họ khám phá ra có thể giúp cho chúng ta sống tốt hơn, ít ra về mặt sinh học. Trong số những cuốn sách tôi từng đọc, đây có lẽ là cuốn sách nên được đưa vào chương trình giáo dục phổ thông nhất. Đơn giản vừa đủ, dễ hiểu và hấp dẫn, tôi tin rằng cuốn sách không chỉ cung cấp kiến thức, mà còn là một công cụ hướng nghiệp hữu hiệu cho các bạn trẻ. "
151,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105671990-nidhi,0,"Neil Shubin, an American paleontologist, in his book Your Inner Fish: A Journey Into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body, delineates the similarities between various animals and humans. Shubin is best known for writing Your Inner Fish and discovering the Tiktaalik roseae. In the book Your Inner Fish, Shubin does an excellent job of conveying to the reader that humans share traits with various animals because of the process of evolution. Shubin develops this notion by using comedic analogies and loads of scientific data to build up his credibility and the idea of evolution. Shubin divides Your Inner Fish into eleven chapters in order to focus on a single body part at a time and to relate back on the concept of evolution. This strategy that Shubin carries out is very resourceful because it allows him to build up his argument more efficiently. Shubin also uses many comedic analogies to allow the reader to understand complex topics. For example, when Shubin is describing an animal he states “fish that look like hamburgers with fleshy tails” (77). These kind of analogies are very useful because Shubin is able to take away confusion from the reader and instead bring understanding. Shubin also cites many pieces of scientific data to prove to his reader that evolution is the reason for why humans are developed in a certain way. Although the data seems very excessive, it is a great tool to for the reader to understand where Shubin is coming from. In conclusion, I believe that Shubin did an exceptional job of connecting the idea that humans share traits with numerous animals, even fish, because evolution has allowed these traits to be formed incrementally over a duration of time. Shubin was able to break down a complex topic and share with his reader the way evolution works, which is something that is very admirable. "
152,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13390644-jarl-olsen,4,"I'd say 3.5 stars. Or one. This really is not a book, like Carl Zimmer's ""Parasite Rex"", that you can pimp to friends who maintain that they have no interest in biology or science in general. Shubin may be a better scientist than a writer, but his writing isn't bad. He's conversational and pulls off the all-important feat of making complex things seem simple. (Is there any popular science writer who doesn't get points for making complex things seem simple?) Geeky stuff about HOX cells and landmark experiments on chicken embryos might send some readers for the exits, but everything included in ""Your Inner Fish"" is useful when the author is making his big arguments, mainly that all things living things share a more-or-less common blueprint and that evolution is not just a fact, but makes predictions that we are able to test. I liked this book. 85 percent of the time. What I didn't like was the author's obsession with giving credit where credit is due. The result is that when Dr. Shubin describes the fossil find that he is justly famous for, a missing link between fish and amphibians, a dozen people are cited as helping making it all possible and I'll be damned if I cared. It was a bit like someone winning an Academy Award and giving shout-outs until the orchestra starts playing and people are fidgeting in their seats. When I am reading ""Nature""-- OK, I can only read about one in four articles in ""Nature""--I expect to see sources cited and long roll-calls of persons whose fields of study like up with the fields of study relevant to the articles. I think that is enough for those guys. Leave them out of the audio books or paperbacks with prehistoric dinosaur-ish mudpuppy things on the cover. For me."
153,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51761421-jazmine,5,"I found this book to be great. I really loved how Shubin showed how everything was connected and how it fit together. For me, showing the anatomy of the fossils and relating that to human anatomy really helped to highlight the similarities. One of the things I liked most about this book was how it was organized. First Shubin told of how to find fossils, then how they are cleaned and prepared for analysis, and then the anatomy and physiology on the significance of the structure that they found and what its use if for the organism. This arrangement made the information in the text easier for me to process and find the book to be more enjoyable since I didn't have to try and make since of what Shibin was saying, it simply explained itself. Shubin's writing has quiet the sense of humor to go along with it, it adds to the book and doesn't take anything away from what is being told. Some of the examples Shibin used had some humor to them, but it helped to bring the point of the section across. In the end of the book when Shibin was tying everything together, he used clowns as an example. I for one don't really like clowns, but the use of them in the example serves the purpose of giving readers a visual of the main idea. Overall, I found this book to be a great way to learn about how everything is related to everything, even though things have been changed over time, if you look back at the structures and arrangements of things, you can begin to see where the relations between different groups like mammals and reptiles and fish are. "
154,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71134876-alex-ousback,3,"I read most of this book in a single day, so that is why there are so few updates.I wish I could have given this book 5 stars because I love the premise, but I have one MAJOR criticism that took off two stars for me: This book reads too much like a textbook. Chapter after chapter, topic after topic: it goes from discussing teeth to ears to eyes as if you were reading an anatomy textbook! This impaired me as a reader, and I actually started and finished two other books before I finished this one because lots of it was very dry (with a good little joke here and there). It read to me like a list of examples; most of it was written in the format of ""human body part + comparable structure in a distantly related organism + discussion of why this is interesting."" By themselves, these example truly are fascinating, but one tires of reading similar things over and over again. I had to take breaks every 15 pages to unwind.The book has many strengths too, don't get me wrong. The writing is very clear in explaining complex processes and obviously comes from somebody who is very knowledgeable in their field. I liked his stories about searching for fossils more than the 'textbooky' part because they seemed more personal. His enthusiasm definitely added to the experience of reading the book; it could have been much more boring than it was if he didn't care about anatomy this much. Lastly, learning about the connections between humans, fish, sponges, sharks and more was fascinating (if a little dry at times)."
155,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27012410-chanah-dow,5,"Since reading ""Your inner fish,"" I have been reflecting about the beauty of shared experiences and abilities, as well as how our differences allow us to do amazing things like swim powerfully (dolphins, sharks), fly and echolocate (bats), use tools and use logic (primates) to build tools that make rockets to the stars (humans). It has made me feel humble to think about no matter how diverse life is, there is at some point buried in the history of our biological anatomy, a shared part. If we can see ""kindred likeness"" through the skeleton to a bat or a crocodile, feel ""shared experiences"" that bond us to dogs/cats and primates..... Shouldn't we be able to find kindred likeness and shared experiences and bond with every single other Homo Sapien, if we look hard enough and WANT to see? Those similarities having been found, shouldn't we approach our differences in cultural perspective and Memory with curiosity and respect? The world is so much more of a beautiful place with our minds and hearts open rather than buried in what we think we know. These are just some of the questions I asked myself since reading this book. It can be, at times, a bit dry and anatomically-specific (yay biology!), but the tone of the book is witty, humorous, conversational, non-confrontational/elitist, and very inviting. As an audiobook only 7 hours long, it's relatively quick and absolutely fascinating.I will be looking for more by Neil Shubin!"

157,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17344111-joseph-f,4,"When i studied biology back in the early eighties I thought i was learning such complex stuff. This book, in which so many of the discoveries talked about took place after i graduated, is a humble reminder of how little we know and how much we have yet to learn.Using comparative anatomy, paleontology, genetics, embryology our author gives us an evolutionary view of just how our bodies have evolved from simpler life forms. Sure the fish has preeminence in tracing our anatomy and genetics, but various genes and proteins, indeed body planning in general, have their origins way back to the simplest of multicellular organisms. He talks of fruit flies and worms and bacteria! (Oh my)He even discusses why we suffer from certain ailments like hemorrhoids and hernia. It has to do with the mammalian body plan being gerry rigged upon that of a fish. Throughout, Shubin gives us anecdotes of his learning and adventures hunting for fossils, making this a personal story of discovery.Why not 5 stars? I think it took me awhile to get into it maybe? Also, being a biologist, I kinda knew some of this stuff already.I didn't know there was a hormone in limb development called sonic hedgehog!That's reason alone why you should read this book. Or you can give it as a gift to any evolution denier."

I was already familiar with much of the developmental genetics discoveries cited in the text-- in fact, since a few of them occurred during my college years, I was reading the articles on them as they were published--but I learned a great deal about paleontology and comparative physiology.That being said, the tone of this was all over the place. Sometimes it seemed like it was trying to be a textbook, all dry and precise, and other times it was filled with personal anecdotes and dad-joke-level humor that didn't amuse me at all. The science itself was mostly watered down to the level palatable to a layperson, which frustrated me at times with my strong science background, but I understand this is for the masses and not the specialists, or former specialists.My other frustration was that the host of diseases and complications that have resulted from our incredibly patchwork design was relegated to an incredibly brief end chapter, when to me, that's one of the more interesting things about the human body. But that's a criticism quite personal to me.On the whole, it's a good read for anyone who wants to know why we are the way we are."

When i first started to learn about human evolution out of the water, it blew my mind to think that we as Homosapiens are just more advanced fish that are able to live on land. This book explains why we hiccup, why our back hurts all the time, it explains our relatedness to fish and our evolution out of the water and onto land. This book explains why we have shoulders and why our arms are shaped and used the way they are. This is truly the most fascinating book that someone will ever read and if it doesnt make you fall in love with history and evolution i dont know what will. Neil Shubin, a leading paleontologist and Archeologist as well as a professor of anatomy who discovered one of the biggest archeological discoveries of all time, Tiktaalik, the ""missing link"" that made headlines around the world in 2006. He tells the story of evolution by tracing the organs of the human body back millions of years, long before the first creatures walked the earth. By examining fossils and DNA, Shubin shows us that our hands actually resemble fish fins, our head is organized like that of a long-extinct jawless fish, and major parts of our genome look and function like those of worms and bacteria."
160,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99464341-dan,5,"This book was not for me, and if I could I’d rate it 4.5. Yet I can see how this would be relished by a medical person, a fossil nut or any other profession steeped in just the right amount of miscellany and detail. Or myself, if I had the time. Shubin writes fairly well, though he should not kid himself that he’s writing for the layperson: this is seriously ‘put your waders on’ stuff if you’re after a few quick answers, as I was. Yet for the right audience (and who picks up the book is out of his control) this was thorough and will be approachable. My search? I wanted to know more about the mammalian dive reflex, and how our breathing even today is a product of our fishy past. Indeed Shubin went kinda there, but not in a way that helped me. I did, on page 188, have some takeaways on why leg-squats — and other informed active responses to our modern lifestyle as a whole — are important though. Another issue I had, again which I won’t ‘penalise’ the author for with a one-star-subtraction, was the ethical nature of experiments on creatures, especially embryos and man-made mutations. "
161,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41300392-shenyu,4,"This book tries to explain the history and machinery of our body from the view of a paleontologist. Though in some parts of the book, complicated terminologies are introduced without detailed explanation, I still consider this one a nice book for laymen of biology, especially for the people who are interested in organs' evolution, because...This book is thin enough for impatient persons. I've been looking for a biological-relevant book for some time. However, most of them were just too heavy for me. It's, honestly, a frustrating experience to read a book started with molecule, bacteria or trilobita without knowing the relationship of myself and these bizarre vocabularies. In contrast, this book emphasizes the relationship in every chapter for us.Considering its thinness, it is an incredible achievement that the author covers most main topics of the human body here. Not only the knowledge of paleontology is covered, knowledge gained from genetics and embryology is also heavily mentioned in this book. "
162,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,5,"WOW - Darwin barely touched the tip of the iceberg! I thought I knew a lot about human evolution and biology until I read this book. Neil Shubin does an EXCELLENT job of tracing human development from the earliest life forms including details about how our hearing, vision, etc. developed from earlier species and in response to a changing environment. The first few chapters read easily and are filled with anecdotes about the author's educational and professional development and a lot of how paleontology works. In the later chapters, he draws on this general background to go into details about how our bodies are like a souped up Volkswagen Beatle - each new feature evolving from what was there before including both the strengths and weaknesses. Shubin takes us through details of how we walk all the way to why hiccups are an evolutionary weakness. I found this book to be easy to read and engaging while being full of significant scientific information that I had never been exposed to before. Interested in how humans evolved? Here is the book for you!"

There are some jaw-dropping moments here: perhaps most amazing for me was the recounting of an experiment in the late 90s that recreated in the lab the origin of multicellular organisms.For this and more the book is a fascinating read. Unfortunately, while Shubin is not a bad writer, he's not a particularly good one either, and the prose doesn't carry you along with the same rush that the ideas discussed do, and everything suffers a bit as a result.Still, I didn't read this book for the literature. I hoped to get some insights and remarkable stories and facts about how we became what we are and I got that. Mission accomplished."

What Shubin is able to determine through fossils and basic experiments is really remarkable.What is most impressive is how digestible Shubin articulates the process of evolution, the development of structures like ears, limbs and how they came to be in our bodies. I was impressed to find that gene sequences for some of the things active in our bodies are present in creatures like lampreys, bacteria, and animals that lived some 500 million years ago. The experiments described using algae to visualize how predation likely catalyzed the evolution to bodies is particularly interesting. In a simple display, it seems that the macrocosm of over 3 billion years of evolution can be portrayed in this simple experiment, giving more legitimacy to the survival of the fittest argument for evolution. Definitely worth a read, and an excellent exposure into the esoteric world of paleontology."
165,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8095671-s-a-klopfenstein,5,"One of my favorite popular science reads recently, this book is well-written and, in the tradition of science writers such as Sagan, Gould, or Dawkins, Neil Shubin takes a broad scope of scientific fields and discoveries and tells the engaging story of the evolutionary history of the human body. The book is full of fascinating information, for those like me without an extensive background in biology or paleontology. But the book's greatest strength is the way Shubin (a field paleontologist who discovered a link species between fish and amphibians) weaves discoveries in genetics and modern medicine with the fossil record and comparative biology, as well as his own experiences in the field. His enthusiasm for his work is evident on every page, and may inspire you to search for fossils yourself, or at least to appreciate the elegance of our complicated history through the tree of life. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and highly recommend this read for anyone interested in a more in-depth understanding of evolutionary biology and paleontology."

It points out the interrelatedness of all life on earth, essentially showing us our “inner fish,” through data from fossils, DNA and anatomy. It is very good overview of the topic for non-experts, to whom I would recommend the book highly.So, why only three stars? Well, as I said, this is really a book for non-experts and this is a topic that I know a great deal about. The best popular science books are both accessible to the lay audience and have information that is worthwhile to an expert, such as biographical information on the scientists and descriptions of how the science was done. Unfortunately, this book was mostly lacking in that later category. So, I would encourage anyone who reads this review to think about how much they know about the topic of this book. If you are just getting to know it, then this could be a really great book as an introduction. But if you know a lot already and are looking to expand and deepen your knowledge, then this book has less to offer."

Anyone who knows me is aware of my love for many of the popular science books written by Richard Dawkins, particularly the Blind Watchmaker. And it is brilliant. But 'Your Inner Fish' may have just become the popular science book that I would recommend to anyone. It is not a particularly long book and I think it would be a good read for everyone. Including people who do not have a biological or scientific background. My background in biological sciences makes reading Richard Dawkins books quite pleasant, and whilst I think the writing style and language is suitable for everyone, I could understand people finding them a tad ""heavy"" in places. Your Inner fish is a much lighter read, but no less interesting. It is filled with fascinating information and facts about our evolution and how we sit within the tree of life. Definitely a must read. If you want a better understanding of how we are linked to every living thing on this planet and the science that has uncovered this information, then go and read this book."

The book is broken down by chapters that delve deep into different parts, functions, and evolution of the human body. The book is able to recap the 3.5-billion-year journey of evolution that has transpired for humans to function and look like they do today. Within the book there are a multitude of scientific evidence to support the claims that are made about how humans became two-legged beings, or why are sense of smell is only half as good as it could be. Shubin includes his own research and experiences out in the field of research. This is a great book to include in a science high school class, the book is easy to read and carries a plot that makes the information your reading easier to digest. This however could be a controversial book for parents and school districts to accept into the classroom as not everyone shares the same thoughts on evolution and how humans came to be. "

What parts of our body plan are modified versions from simpler animals?The science presented in Your inner fish is interesting and sound. I enjoyed reading it and gaining new fun facts about my evolutionary history. However, I found Shubin did not have a command of story that drew me in and kept me reading. The beginning and end of the book were great, but my enthusiasm waned mid-book. I would still recommend this particularly for those looking to get a mini crash course in the mix of paleontology, genetics, and evolution. "
170,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88985331-sarah-rigg,4,"This was a book recommended by a friend, and I really liked it! When it comes to science topics popularized for the general public, I sometimes am frustrated that they aren't telling me much I don't already know, since I do a fair amount of science reading for pleasure. This is especially true in the area of evolution, as I've done a fair bit of reading on the topic, from ""The Blind Watchmaker"" to ""On the Origin of Species."" There are a few places in the book where Shubin is rehashing things I already know, but he gets there in a different and entertaining way. And, I learned a ton about the evolution of the human body, and found the section on the evolution of our ears especially fascinating - do you know why getting overly-drunk can give you the spins? I know now, after reading this book! I highly recommend this book for anyone curious to learn more about the evolution of the human body while simultaneously being entertained."

I know, I know it's a ""fact"" but given that its claim to fame is mostly going up against creationists, I will call it a religion. [For the record, it is a scientific fact]. Evolution is one field of knowledge where my intuition slowly lost out to overwhelming evidence until eventually I had to accede to its central tenets. I had accepted micro evolution but my last hold out was speciation, then I came across the argument that when enough recessive genes manifest, the result is a new species. This is very plausible, couple that with the new evidence that supports Lamarck's theory, speciation seems very likely....after that I had to accept evolution is really a fact. The thing with facts is that they slowly fade away from memory but your intuition sticks with you, so from time to time I refresh my memory by reading some book on evolution. This one so far is the best. Forget Dawkins and his ilk, Neil Shubin did not tie himself in a thousand knots in the creationist argument. He simply told us the story of how they discovered the Tiktalik( thought to be a descendant of both fish and amphibians) then went on to show us how we are related to fish. It was a fascinating story. I would recommend this to people who are curious about evolution but do not want to get caught up in the evolution-creationists debate but if you are looking for new ammo to shoot at your creationists adversaries check out Jerry A Coyne's Why Evolution Is True "

I, however, majored in physical anthropology in college and found it right up my alley. This is a nonfiction book about the study of ancient and modern animals (both land and sea-life) and comparing anatomy in establishing ideas of human development and evolution. While not heavy with technical terms, it is not dumbed down either. An idea of human physiology and development with a smattering of knowledge of paleontology, genetics and some comparative anatomy.I actually enjoyed the book. I found the narrator easy to follow and between his performance and the writing there were parts that I laughed out loud.For what this book is, I enjoyed it."

I really enjoyed reading Neil’s personal stories and his explanations of where us humans got various parts and senses. He made sure he kept things easy to comprehend, despite what his readers backgrounds might be. It’s was incredibly interesting to see how we are related not only to fish, but all life, even pond scum. We are all just modified versions of our parents genetics, which gets really interesting when you look millions of years back. Despite making such a huge discovery, Neil is still humble towards everything we don’t know and his work of digging up the past: “I can imagine few things more beautiful or intellectually profound than finding the basis for our humanity, and remedies for many of the ills we suffer, nestled inside some of the most humble creatures that have ever lived on our planet.”"

An example being how our the bone structure in our arms and hand can be traced all the way back to fish fins.Shubin does a great job making this book accessible to the armature. I read it for a science class in college. I didn’t know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy and clear the science was presented in the book. I definitely came away from the book with a better understanding of my own body and why things like hiccups or the spins occur. Another strength of Shubin’s writing is that while it is accessible it isn’t insultingly dumbed down. I really enjoyed reading this book.

It definitely reads as if it was written for the ""lay-person"" so keep that in mind. Regardless, it is filled with a lot of interesting evidence of evolution based on anatomy. The most interesting part is the last chapter where we can see where evolution had to make do with what it had vs creating ""perfect"" bodies, as we may expect from a god. Many may find this book too ""easy"" but i think it's a good entry into some of the interesting ""missing links"" which creationists seem to be obsessed with. The author doesn't seem to be making as strong of a claim as Coyne does in Why Evolution is True, but lays out the facts and states why these anatomic similarities between us and other species only really makes sense in light of evolution."

I like the concept very much - I'm three chapters in, and already I find the science quite intriguing. However, the writing style is just not my cup of tea. I find it takes Shubin half a chapter to get across what many other authors would get across in a page or two, because he has a tendency to repeat the same step in an argument for an entire paragraph, or make nearly identical arguments in two consecutive paragraphs. I've reread entire sections because I'm never sure if I'm just failing to see a more subtle argument that is being furthered and not repeated, and it feels very tedious. That said, in the places where he repeats himself less frequently, his writing style is actually quite nice, and very organized. "

This is a book about human history and how we evolved from fish people to Homo sapiens. Very science-y. A quick read, enjoyable, entertaining, it reminded me of a biology documentary in book form. I realize I must sound rather childish in this review, it’s just that I didn’t quite understand a lot of it.

This book- like my anatomy lecturer- delves into some weak arguments claiming that the designer of life on Earth displayed little intelligence. Apparently, the reason why men suffer from hernias can be explained by their spermatic cords inherited from our ‘ancient fish ancestors’ which leaves their gut tissue susceptible to spilling through muscle walls, not because of the poor lifestyle choices that humans make. The anger I used to continually feel sitting in my anatomy class and while reading this book is now back, oh great memories :) "

For me personally, it was a slight let down - I knew a lot of what it covered already - but I think that's mostly my fault, since I've read books about the evolution of the feather, evolutionary anatomy, etc., and obviously there's going to be a lot of overlap at some point.Shubin keeps an engaging pace and a slightly humorous (if Dad-jokey) tone throughout. My favorite section was actually the last chapter, The Meaning of It All when he detailed the anatomical/evolutionary reasons for different... ""bloopers"" such as hiccups. Hadn't known that stuff.Overall, worth the read. "

Shubin's enthusiasm for scientific exploration and discovery is evident on every page, and the story he is telling is both thrilling and not nearly well-enough understood. Humans share a history legacy with all of life on the planet, and the clues we are discovering through the fossil record, DNA, and our own bodies reveal novel adaptation borne of necessity rather than of design. That is, our bodies, our existence are wonderfully clunky things, miraculous both in their capacities and in the fact that they work at all.Read more at https://znovels.blogspot.com/2019/05/..."

I know some reviewers have said it came across as an argument for evolution, but to me it simply presupposed evolution and common ancestry and proceeded from there.If you've ever wondered what you have in common with a sea anemone, one of the answers is that you and the sea anemone both use versions of the same gene, called hox, to organize an important body axis. In humans, it's the anterior-posterior axis, or ""head to tail"" in higher animals. Sea anemones obviously have different parts, and in them the equivalent axis is known as the oral-aboral axis. We, along with frogs and mice, also share commonalities in the genes responsible for organizing the dorsal and ventral sides of the body, to the extent that the product of one of these genes is interchangeable between frogs and sea anemones!"
182,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45656164-ryan,3,"Interesting read, although not very memorable. My take-a-ways:1. All cells contain the same DNA, but turn on different genes at different times to differentiate themselves2. All living things are variations upon past models, jerry-rigged versions of our previous ancestors to serve different purposes. Moreover, all living things on earth are related to each other, and therefore contain very similar structures and genes, most of which are visible in early embryos across species. This is the reason a shark embryo and a human embryo are very similar.3. Genes are not species specific. For example, a gene that makes eyes can be taken from a fly and used in a frog embryo, and it will create frog eyes."

It's an enjoyable read including some basic science and a few anecdotes from Shubin's own digging. It's a very accessible read and even though it's an ""adult"" book, it probably works as a great outline for creating elementary or middle grade lesson plans where the amount of scientific accuracy can be increased where appropriate. There are lots of illustrations although to be honest I think these are the weakest part of the book. While I understood the text just fine, the illustrations are sometimes confusing - or maybe just too oversimplified.

Just to be clear, if you have already studied books on comparative anatomy or embryology, or read Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"", then you will already be familiar with much of this book's content. Even so, Shubin explores and answers really interesting questions about the evolutionary tradeoffs that have resulted in the modern human body. A good book for the latent scientist in all of us. "

It has some really messed up animal research in it, but it doesn't make up the majority of the book. There's still too much. Learned a few things and also almost put it down a few times when he discussed researchers playing God and growing animals arms on their faces with no empathy whatsoever for the animals.

Apparently find the fossil of a fish with front legs is harder than most would think. The challenge of finding an intact enough fossil in the right place from the right time period and being able to dig it out without destroying it is outlined perfectly through Mr. Shubin’s book.

The book talks about how human bodies have traces of ancient animals (sharks, tadpoles and etc.), and it explains a lot of diseases, functions of our body. If you design a human being from scratch, you wouldn’t make many parts as we have today. The only reason for that is we evolve over millions of years and some functions were only useful when we were fish. The chapter about our eyes, speaking, hiccups, hernia are all very interesting. The only thing is that the book is a bit too short. I wish the author could expand some of the chapters, because it’s so interesting! "

And, as expected, it was worth its while being a very informative read written in a light and often humorous style that reaches its climax midway through, although several of its parts were less engrossing to me due to the fact that I had already come across them in the film. So I strongly recommend reading the written account before savouring the visually wonderful docuseries."
205,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,3,"Fun little book. Shubin doesn't elaborate enough about any of the topics but instead gives a quick tour of some of the human body's anatomical and genetic features that we share with more primitive life forms, thus proving common ancestry. Shubin's writing style is sometimes a little too basic--crude even, but he comes across as a favourite professor you might have in freshman year who throws in stories and reflections about the nature of professional science. Nothing extremely deep, but a comforting intro to an unfamiliar subject."

But, for whatever the reason, I just could not get into this book.I think all the stories about the author's personal fossil hunting at the beginning just put me off. I'm used to books about people who did things. Not books by the people who did the things. It felt strangely braggy. Interesting topic. Avoid the audio. Maybe it's better in print form."
207,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36129487-shiloh-cleofe,4,I really enjoyed Neil Shubins writing and find anything about Tiktaalik fascinating. The technical depth in the book is enough to keep you engaged and thinking without it being a bunch of fluff. Great for anyone that is interested in diving into physical evolution a little deeper without being a full time student in the area. He makes some connections that are thought provoking and encourages you to look at yourself and the animals around you a little closer.
208,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41078522-olivia,2,"This book was a very long read, considering that it is a book about facts and tells the reader a story about this paleontologist and how they find bones. Then connecting it to the past and tells the reader about the evolution of bones and how fish and other animals adapt to time throughout the years. Or how thy relate to us. This book was very long and some parts were dragged out, so if readers are into this kind of informative read, then go for it. Otherwise, you'll get bored of it. "

In elegant and understandable prose, Shubin explains how connected life on earth is. Evidence of wrist bones in a fish fossil take us on a journey through multiple species and DNA and lay out, in logical progression, how we both inherit and modify genetic history. It was fascinating!

However it was still enjoyable yo listen to on audiobook. If you have no biology background then I would recommend it, as it explains pretty well evolutionary concepts. However, do keep in mind that it simplifies some things. So this might be a good starting point and then you can build on it later. "

However, he is pretty repetitious, so that may be quite helpful in solidifying the main points. Otherwise an interesting read about evolution and the story behind relatively recent field discoveries."

It’s one of the best introductions into evolutionary development that has ever been written. It’s digestible, entertaining, and has the potential to completely modify how you think about morphology. It’s one of those books I bring out every few years to re-read. It even has some diagrams and illustrations for folks who aren’t familiar with homologous structures. If you have a basis in biology, then it’s fine as an audiobook. "

I always understood vaguely that mammals evolved from simpler forms of life, but this book shows how this happened in a step by step manner. I will no longer look at a fish, worm or fly in quite the same way, now that I know that we share some of the basic building blocks of life. "

It reads like a lecture but annoyingly some things are explained in two or three examples that seem to go on forever. Perhaps this was meant for a more curious general audience but it was rather irritating being pandered down to and yet bored to the point that my eyes struggled not to glaze over.That being said the information and research is strong, it’s the presentation that IMHO was lacking."

Much like Carl Sagan uses the stars to look back in time, the human body shows our history, as well. Archaeology had uncovered lots of animals that answer out questions about how water animals came to dwell on land. DNA analysis further reinforces out findings and this book is able to tie a bow around both in a way that is entertaining and enlightening."

The book sometimes found itself mired in a ""that's why evolution is true"" argument a la Dawkins, but fascinating details.

It is a great description of evolution and how even complex structures (like the eye) can develop from simpler structures. It's a book anti-evolution should read so they understand all the science behind evolution. Sadly, they never would. Having never taken an evolution or comparative anatomy class, I found many of the comparisons quite fascinating. There was quite a bit about new fossils that are transitional species. My favorite part was the discussion of the evolutionary link to disorders like hiccups and hernias. It makes perfect sense when you understand what the human body evolved from.Shubin is writing this book for a general audience. He goes into some specifics and technical parts of biology (especially genetics) but doesn't throw a lot of jargon into the book. For example, he discusses limbs as one bone, two bones, blobby bits (your wrist or ankle), and lots of thin bones. I can totally picture that as my arm or leg, and see how it connects to so many other organisms."

268,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54903764-erik-hall,4,"Great book from a science standpoint. The author is clearly writing with one evolutionary theory in mind, but tells the story very well. It wasn't too watered down and not to deep / a pleasant balance."
269,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1844829-jessica,4,"This book is great at explaining evolutionary biology, embryology, and genetics in a way that makes sense to a lay audience. Just enough paleontology and geology are woven in to give the important context. Overall, an interesting and quick read."
270,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27463867-trang-nguyen,5,Neil has described some difficult techniques to track the evolution in a way that makes it very easy to understand. It provides a systematic way to understand about the evolution and how connected human is with the animal. It feeds my curiosity about how and why we exist in the world. 
271,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35865386-jeri-bitney,4,"Interesting enough and well done, but I didn't enjoy this dry tome nearly as much as I did the delightful and entertaining ""Gulp"", by Mary Roach. Imagine, if you will, a science and biology book which holds your attention and causes you to laugh out loud. That is ""Gulp""."
272,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39364424-eric,4,plenty of history and evidentiary links between fish and humans without getting bogged down in scientific vernacular or jargon. Great for high-school level biology students and could easily be paired with Jerry Coyne's Why Evolution is True or Richard Dawkins' The Ancestor's Tale.
273,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21340465-ciara-eichhorst,4,I read this book for my introductory biology course in college. I think it is a good read for anyone wanting to understand more about evolution but who isn't super well versed in biology. It's very easy to understand and very interesting!
274,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17588869-vilhelmiina,4,"This was a really interesting read, and complemented my course nicely. I would have loved even more content on Tiktaalik, which I find so interesting, but the rest of the book was great too. I like how Shubin writes, and feel like he's probably a great professor, too."
275,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41287699-austin-haukinz,3,“We are simply a mosaic of bits and pieces found in virtually everything else on the planet.” - Neil Shubin A fairly interesting journey to the inner workings of how our bodies evolved from everything from sharks to pond scum. An enjoyable read but feels overly academic at points. 
276,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4560826-jared,4,Great book that takes the reader through the evolutionary history of the human body. The author makes very complex topics simple to understand and emphasizes the connections we have to other organisms. Very easy to read and very engaging.
277,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83006977-pauldeb-claxton,4,"I guess it IS all in the details. I love it when an author/researcher/explorer makes a branch of science accessible & interesting to the lay-person. I never knew the anatomy of a fish could be fascinating - but if you like science, this is a good read."
278,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10449329-peter,5,"Really enjoyed this book. He explores how various aspects of our bodies ( e.g. limbs, teeth, ears ...) are related to other creatures both present and ancient past. The information is very well presented in non technical language so accessible to all. Highly recommended."
279,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27584548-kevin-warman,5,Science teaches us to make sense of the world and Shubin teaches us to make sense of our bodies. Shubin manages to tie together so much information and present in a fascinating way. We need more books like this.
280,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70010792-sharon-bluemer,4,"Gtreat general overview of how paleontology examines fossils and how organisms relate to each other. Additionally, short field experiences are littered throughout which helps moves the dialogue along. "
281,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51373154-asja-marchand,5,This book is amazing. Very accessible for those who don't have a scientific/evolution background while also still stimulating for those who do. Leaves you thinking of your body in new and positive lights.
282,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3171974-sean,5,"If you're like me, and took science in high school, less in university, and like looking at fossils, this book is perfect. A clear and simple explanation of the journey of our genes and the genes of more or less every other form of life, what a joy to think on and explore."
283,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93618574-andreia-cabrera,5,"It’s humbling, honestly. Human kind sees itself as such a superior race that it almost makes itself the only thing in this world. YIF connects one species to another and makes you see the world a little more unified."
284,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71969032-marcos-vinagrillo,5,"The book is amazing, it´s an excellent science communication excercise and still very personal. The author makes you understand his life as a scientist while making humans conect with our inner animals through evolution. I really enjoy this trip"
285,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91555224-renata,5,"If you’re looking for a basic book dealing with evolution that doesn’t waste your time taking on Young Earth and Creationist hogwash, this book is great. This would be a great read for a high school-age person, or a lay person without a science background. "
286,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/311367-iris,4,"Simply yet eloquently explained. I'd recommend this to someone who wants a starting point to explore the science of evolutionary genetics, with The Tangled Tree as a follow-up (and much more in depth) read. The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs would also be a good book to read after this."
287,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3704210-adina,5,"A quick and easy read, but absolutely fascinating! The history of our bodies is incredible and awe-inspiring. I found some explanations to be a little over simplified, but that does not take anything away from overall quality of this well researched book."
288,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33761275-katherine-tirado-ryen,5,"Neil Shubin’s “Your Inner Fish” is a fantastic book of field paleontology, gross anatomy, and evolution across millions of years and species. It’s given me an appreciation for pre-Cambrian limestone impressions, single-celled algae, human teeth, and—yes!—our inner fish. Highest recommendation."
289,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96585395-vik,3,"Maybe I need another few years before I’ll manage it all the way through. The topic itself is quite interesting, but IMO the book lacks a voice that enables you to take in and digest all the scientific information."
290,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54308365-shayna,4,"Overall a great book. I read it over the course of a semester for a comparative anatomy and physiology course, but I love that it can be understood well by people who aren’t in the discipline. I would highly recommend to anyone who is curious about our evolutionary past. "
291,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/892866-janice,5,One of the most interesting non-fiction books I've ever read. I used it as a resource for brief presentations to campers and staff at a Girl Scout camp in the Sierras in July 2018. Highly recommended if you have an interest in human physiology and development.BCID: 492-13602417
292,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108943701-finn-danger,5,"Fantastically written for the layman who has no idea about any of this stuff. The book made sense without being condescending, it never felt dry, and parts were quite humorous. I've definitely learned a lot from it."
293,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105313475-molly-rettell,4,"A very interesting view into our evolution and relationship to all species on earth! I loved the connections Shubin drew to many different species. This book will take you on an exciting, informing journey through our DNA, history, and evolution. "
294,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36599001-shakir,4,“knowing something about the deep origins of humanity only adds to the remarkable fact of our existence: all of our extraordinary capabilities arose from basic components that evolved in ancient fish and other creatures.”
295,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29728087-duong-dang,3,"I personally find it hard to juggle between the ideas of reading this book casually or not. Seems like the book itself also suffer from that identitity crisis and the ambiguous target audience. 3/5 good read, too much information."
296,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92832090-philip-j,5,"Journeying into the unknownA gentle read lays the human body as reused, adapted, ... work to adjusting to our atmosphere ... then left with who we are today... no longer active, yet feeding voraciously. Neil Shubin lays the unknown history of the human body as awesome!"
297,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113789869-austin-dalsing,5,"I read this online and bought it again to physically own in person, with the intention of reading it again. I would consider this book a must-read for anyone even remotely interested on the topic, or even if you just want to see some cool data/studies/facts alongside a very well-told story!"
298,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118338086-yunus,4,"Gives you an understanding of how dna works. Shows how efficient the evolution actually is and how it recycles a lot of things. It is a very good book, would like it better if it explained the mechanism behind dna and cell multiplication a bit more detailed and in layman’s terms. "
299,0375424474,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105638233-sof-a,1,"It is a good start for all of those who wonder why do we suffer from hiccups or why does my father have haemorrhoids. But as a biologist, I hated it. It is full of teleological explanations. It doesn’t have a clear argument. It feels like he had a 29-pages book and the editor asked for 170 more. "
