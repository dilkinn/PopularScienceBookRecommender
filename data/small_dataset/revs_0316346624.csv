0,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/269132-nick,4,"This book is fascinating and I was disappointed to read that many other readers didn't think so. So here's my response. I think those readers are approaching this book the wrong the way when they critisize Gladwell for his inability to prove his points thoroughly. Sure, Gladwell could have dotted every i and crossed every t and shown every counter-example to the theories he's proposing. There's a word for the books that accomplish that: BORING. Gladwell is a storyteller and he knows how to keep the reader involved. By going into too much detail, he would lose his audience. Hopefully the reader who isn't convinced entirely can go into further detail by reading Gladwell's sources which are exhaustively referenced in the back of the book. Another criticism is that Gladwell doesn't come to a specific point or that his points are hazy (this was probably more true with ""Blink""). I almost want to say ""who cares?"" This book and ""Blink"" are veritable digests of the latest advances in psychology and sociology. So what if the overarching idea of the book is loose? You have now understood countless fascinating anecdotes which you can reconstruct in your own way. It is Gladwell's loose structure that allows him to connect these disparate dots in a story that you can digest, and despite the accusations that he is not precise about his overall thesis, the individual incidents are very well explained. I love knowing the differences between Sesame Street and Blue's Clues and the differences between an adult's and a child's cognitive capabilities. Would I have read an entire book devoted solely to that? Probably not, but I was happy to read a chapter devoted to it, and a very well-written one at that.Perhaps I approach non-fiction in a different way than most--and I will admit that I'm fascinated by almost any new, dramatically different idea about any subject, regardless of whether or not I believe it to be true--but I think that people who go into this book seeking a different way of thinking about the world around us, macro & microcosmically, will enjoy themselves. Those who go into the book seeking to be convinced beyond doubt that that way of thinking is the correct way, will not."
1,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/947109-jessica,2,"This book grew out of an article Malcolm Gladwell was writing for the New Yorker. Frankly, it is better suited for a 5-7 page article rather than a 280 page book. The crux of the book is that the ""stickiness factor"" of epidemics (whatever the nature) begins with a tipping point. This tipping point arises because of three distinct sets of individuals: mavens, connectors and salespeople. He also examines the well-known S-curve which begins with innovators, then early adopters, followed by the early majority and finally, the late majority. He is overwhelmingly redundant in expressing his ideas, providing examples of epidemics throughout the text while comparing them to one another (children's television, Hushpuppy shoes, Paul Revere's ride, nicotine, and the list goes on and on...). The Conclusion, the eighth and final chapter, was pointless: if the reader did not understand Gladwell's point by now, he or she must have been as lost as Washington Redskins' new coach Jim Zorn when he commented his family was proud to wear maroon and black.All that said, the book was not horrible. It was a well written first person narrative and the lessons of the emergence of epidemics are applicable to almost any career or lifestyle, as Gladwell demonstrated with his countless examples."
2,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1236166-sarah,1,"Can I give this zero stars?When I read this book, back in 2006, I got really mad and wrote a scathing review of it on Amazon.com. Here it is:""I've been duped!, June 20, 2006By Sarah (California, USA) - See all my reviewsThis book sucks. Don't waste your hard earned money on it. Let me save you a few bucks here: Malcolm Gladwell is either a self-aggrandizing ass who is too busy thinking he is the god of marketing to notice that a great majority of his arguments lack any kind of cohesion or credibility whatsoever, or he is just so excited about his self-proclaimed 'paradigmatic' keys to the essense of social epidemics that he conveniently forgets to include that much needed credible evidence to support his long-winded theories, resulting in a book fit to satiate the appetite of audiences hungry for pop pseudo-science BS that will make them feel smart for reading it. Basically all this book is is a compilation of anecdotal evidence that is supposed to prove the truth in his words. Gladwell's arguments clearly violate some very important rules guiding intelligent thought: correlation does not imply causation (and the fact that two events happened on one occasion at the same time does not necessarily imply correlation), and the idea that a theory is bankable because one instance of anecdotal evidence exists. Umm, okay, that's like saying that I know a guy who won the lottery (I don't, but humor me), so it must be a logically good place to invest my paychecks (I don't have paychecks, but, please, humor me). I mean, I'm a 21-year-old college student, and not even a GOOD college student at that, and I could easily point out the flaws in his arguments -not just a single argument, but ALL of his arguments -as soon as I read them. I didn't even have to put the book down to think for a few minutes before I realized how absolutely pointless and downright ludicrous his 'insights' were. All that aside, his writing style is so patronizing and self-congratulatory that I could hardly stand to read any more than five pages at a time before my face got all scrunched up and I started uncontrollably muttering curse words under my breath. It makes me sad that people read this book and consider it a revelation in modern psychological and scientific thinking, not seeing it for what it is: an apparently very successful (thanks, readers of America) profit-driven waste of time. Gladwell made a ton of money off what probably only took him, like, 15 minutes to write, and THAT is the only thing genius about this book.""Yeah, I was kinda mad when I wrote that. This book doesn't really do much in the way of illustrating how to market ideas -rather, it seems more like a marketing tool itself. Gladwell sure knows how to create a brand for himself, complete with a legion of raving followers who can't think for themselves. That scares me."
3,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,4,"Really good book. It read like a bestseller (quick read), but had a lot of substance to stop and make you think.three Rules of the tipping point: the law of the few, the stickyness factor, the power of context.Law of the Few (people who influence): - Connectors: super connectors (eg Paul Revere). William Dawes had the same mission as Paul Revere the same night but we haven't heard of him b/c Paul Revere was a super-connector & knew who to rouse. - Mavens: A Maven is a person who has information on a lot of different products or prices or places. This person likes to initiate discussions with consumers and respond to requests. They like to be helpers in the marketplace. - Salesmen: people with the skills of persuasion. Good at reading people entering into ""conversational harmony"" with them. Facial gestures (nods, smiles, frowns) are key indicators. Emotional Mimicry. Studies showed Peter Jennings viewers voted Republican b/c he unconsciously smiled more while covering Reagan.Stickyness Factor - Sesame street succeeded b/c it learned to make TV sticky. It did a TON of testing with focus groups of kids to increase stickyness (how much kids remembered) of each show. They would cut scenes that didn't hold attention until each show was good. - Blues Clues did even more testing and discovered that kids love repetition - it plays the same show 5 times in a row and kids love it. - make the message personal to make it memorable The Power of Context - Broken window theory. NYC cleaned up its crime epidemic by cleaning off the graffiti from its subways.  - Often to change human behavior you have to change the context the problem is presented in. - Stanford Prison Experiment by Zimbardo proved that context matters. - law of 150: a person can't 'know' more than 150 people, so companies usually start to fail at that point. Gore-Tex breaks up a company into 2 once it hits 150, because they've found things work better that way."
4,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5275261-patrick-dijusto,1,"How the flying fuck did this piece of shit ever get published? How on God's green earth did this thing become a bestseller? Yes, I'm the last person in America to read The Tipping Point, and I'm glad I waited. Now that all the hype has burned off, it's easy to see this book for what it is: a very well crafted collection of half-truths and speculation, sold as ""truth"".Let's look at one example. I read The Tipping Point as an ebook, so my pages might not match completely with yours, but it's the story about the AIDS virus, Chapter One, Section 2, page 24. In writing about a weird epidemic among newborns in the 1950s, Gladwell says of the lead scientist, ""Goudsmit thinks that this was an early HIV epidemic.""Nothing wrong with that. Gladwell is reporting what a scientist thinks. Gladwell then offers an extended quote from Dr. Goudsmit, which is loaded with conditional statements: ""this adult could have died of AIDS"", ""he could have transmitted the virus"", ""she could have given birth to an HIV infected child"", ""unsterilized needles could have spread the virus"". Again, all well and good: Goudsmit was speculating, and making it clear that what he was saying was not certain, but that it ""could have"" happened.Then Gladwell returns and destroys the careful foundation he had built by making concrete statements about things that a moment before were only hypotheses: ""They defeated HIV"", ""The strains of HIV circulating in the 1950s were a lot different from the HIV circulating today"", ""HIV itself changed"" None of this is proven by any of the information Gladwell gave us. All of it is speculation. But Gladwell draws firm conclusions from things that are, at best, educated guesses. I'm sorry but that's just wrong. Actually, I'm not sorry. What Gladwell did is so wrong it's unforgivable.I've been a journalist for 20 years, and I work with some of the finest fact checkers in the world. If I ever handed in a badly reasoned piece of shit like this book, they'd tear me a new asshole. (No they wouldn't. They're very nice people. But they would tear the manuscript a new asshole, as they should.) More to the point, I have enough respect for myself, my readers, and my fact checkers that I'd never hand in something like this in the first place. That Gladwell thought he could get away with it (and let's face it, he did get away with it) is metaphorically criminal. Fuck him."
5,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68050592-lori,3,"I think missed the best by date for this book. It's more fun than an introductory course in sociology and covers some of the same material. Reminded me of Bellwether by Connie Willis and William Gibson's Blue Ant series. All looking for the point where people change behavior and a new trend begins.I loved the part about creating the children's education tv programs Sesame Street and Blue's Clues. What worked with preschoolers, and what didn't.It seems likely Gladwell relies on his enthusiasm for his theory more than fact. That being said, I'll probably read more of his books. It's good food for thought."
6,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason,3,"Here’s why you need to read The Tipping Point. You don’t!!Look, it’s not because the writing is poor, the concepts disorganized, or the book fails to instruct. It’s simply that the ideas are anachronistic. This is no fault of Malcolm Gladwell. He published in 2000, wrote in ‘99, and used case studies from the mid-90’s. How could he have known he was publishing a book about social media on the eve of social media’s inchoate move into our social DeoxyriboNucleicAcid, or that the overgrowth of social connectedness would evolve at rates understated by the term logarithmic.This is a snappy little book--a good one for Thursday evening book club affairs. I quite liked it. Digestible chapters with jaunty titles, connecting for the reader complex sociocultural beliefs to gravid marketing slogans. Pert discussion, and a context that builds on previous conclusions, leading the audience like an unbridled horse gently to water. Gladwell, he’s a good salesman, one that can close a deal without hiding a rotten premolar or repeatedly glancing at his wristwatch. It’s 3.5 stars.Nevertheless, if you’ve fogged a mirror in the last 10 years, much of what Gladwell worked hard to synthesize in year 2000 is merely a matter of course in the mercurial, social, connected life we lead today. Essentially the book is about marketing. (There’s more herein than marketing, but that’s what I’d like to focus on). The title underscores a link throughout the book, viz., that no matter the medium, information reaches a ‘tipping’ point beyond which it spreads above and away from any reasonable measure of altitude control. He repeatedly uses the term epidemic, and I like the image that word conjures in my mind when I think of how pervasive and persistent and contagious marketing can be (like the scene in Ten Commandments where the pestilence of God’s wrath moves down from the moon and like a swampy yellow miasma flows through the streets of Ramses’s Egypt) . Gladwell lays down some meaty discussion about the ‘whys’ and ‘wherefore's’ of the nature of networked relationships, using sociology, psychology, penal philosophy, genetics, pop culture, economics, archeobiology, and personal interviews. It’s a snapshot of a fossil, though. He is in essence describing our world when information was still Near Real Time (NRT), a military acronym meaning ‘actionable’ but not ‘exactable.’ We upgraded that acronym circa 2004-2006 when information became--no shit--Real Time. Real Time worldwide data is a phenomena we’ve only recently begun to comprehend and manipulate. Write a discussion about how your start-up can triangulate consumers, and you’ll have a lead story in Harvard Business Review. Develop an android app that geolocates high volume consumers, and Starbucks will give $$credit$$ to the first 10 people that check into their stores in Cleveland, Charlotte, and Chattanooga. Twitter trends topics, not daily, but hourly. Google Metrics displays global boolean traffic on word searches RIGHT NOW. Crowdsourcing, flash mobs, #hashtags. I can set a Google alert that pings me the next time Brittany Spears has an inadvertent bush shot at the Palms Casino. I can scan barcodes on my phone, and know by a factor of pennies where I can get the cheapest sun dried tomatoes. I can listen to any law enforcement scanner in the country while sitting in my tighty-whities in my fall-out basement. Gowalla, Foursquare, StumbleUpon, grooveshark, HTML5, mashable, MMORPGs, skype, Goodreads. And the every present memes--viral video memes, photo memes--Christ, look at the major news networks during an election and watch the TV anchors in the studio move to the floating, diaphanous plates of glass and enlarge voting counties and predict elections with two-fingered zoom.Malcolm Gladwell could not have foreseen the breadth and rapidity of tipping points in today’s market. No one could have--not even industry leaders in year 2000. Tipping points are not isolated events anymore, like the slow resurgence of Hush Puppy shoes from 1994-1996 (the most cited tipping point in the book, and one Gladwell considers--by his own criteria--rapid). They are daily memes, forcing us into ever tighter circles of consumption, and causing many of us to brux our teeth when we lose cell coverage or go to airplane mode on our smart phones. SMART PHONES--a technology by itself that puts the rust on Gladwell’s conception of tipping points. Despite sound research methodology, and pertinent statistical evaluation, I don’t envision many people going back to The Tipping Point. It’s like reading last week’s headlines; last year’s Consumer Reports; financial data from 2008; political promises from 2006; real estate values from 2005, or the Manhattan skyline on 10 Sep 2001. Maybe for an anecdotal dissertation by some students squirreled away at Weber State or Lehigh University, but other than that I think most of the 77,000 Goodread reviews of this book occurred much nearer the time it was on the best seller list in 2000-2001. There are 4 copies available at my library. It ain’t flying off the shelves anymore, and neither is the 1994 Rand McNally Atlas. You dig?But, wait, let’s go deeper. I dogeared these passages.Here are the titles of the 4 parts of this book. I.EpidemicsII. The Law of the Few: Connectors, Mavens, and SalesmenIII. The Stickiness FactorIV. The Power of Context-- These are important constituents in marketing, but Gladwell speaks of months and years. We both know it's days and hours in 2011.What was the connection between the East Village and Middle America? The Law of the Few says the answer is that one of these exceptional people found out about the trend, and through social connections and energy and enthusiasm and personality spread the word about Hush Puppies. (p. 22)-- Social connectedness was an ephemeral measurement in 1999. Now organizations have followers (see Facebook and Twitter) and can measure their daily virility (see the ‘like’ button and most-viewed videos on Youtube) and watch their epidemic spread (see trending topics on technorati or mashable or gizmodo).It is safe to say that word of mouth is--even in this age of mass communications and multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns--still the most important form of human communication. Think, for a moment, about the last expensive restaurant you went to, the last expensive piece of clothing you bought, and the last movie you saw. In how many of those cases was your decision about where to spend your money heavily influenced by the recommendation of a friend...word-of-mouth appeals have become the only kind of persuasion that most of us respond to anymore. (p. 32)-- Yes, word of mouth is, indeed, persuasive. But, today we are motivated and persuaded even more by word of text!!!Your friends...occupy the same world that you do. They might work with you, or live near you, and go to the same churches, schools, or parties. How much, then, would they know that you wouldn’t know? Your acquaintances, on the other hand, by definition occupy a very different world than you. They are much more likely to know something that you don’t... Acquaintances, in short, represent a source of social power, and the more acquaintances you have the more powerful you are. (p. 54)-- This is perhaps Gladwell’s most prophetic statement. I know more people today having never met face to face than actual people I knew in 1999.Mavens have the knowledge and the social skills to start word-of-mouth epidemics. What sets Mavens apart, though, is not so much what they know but how they pass it along. The fact that Mavens want to help, for no other reason than because they like to help, turns out to be an awfully effective way of getting someone’s attention. (p. 67)-- Today Lady Gaga, Kanye West, and Ben Affleck, combined, have more ‘followers’ than the population of Panama.We have become, in our society, overwhelmed by people clamoring for our attention. In just the past decade, the time devoted to advertisements in a typical hour of network television has grown from 6 minutes to 9 minutes, and it continues to climb every year...estimates that the average American is now exposed to 254 different commercial messages in a day, up nearly 25% since the mid-1970s. There are now millions of web sites on the Internet, cable systems routinely carry over 50 channels of programming, and a glance inside the magazine section of any bookstore will tell you that there are thousands of magazines coming out each month... (p. 98)-- Multiply all of the above figures by a factor of 10 to the 2nd power. A rate of growth that cannot be compared by measuring from 1999 back to the existence of Abraham.The spread of any new and contagious ideology has a lot to do with the skillful use of group power. (p. 172)-- The skillful use of group power makes me feel violated in today’s marketing environment."
7,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"The book that became a catchphrase! The term ""tipping point"" has become so commonly used in news stories that I wonder how many people know it came from a book.I read this back in 2000 when I was in grad school for sociology. It's a fun little book of case studies, many of which applied to what I was learning in my classes. Here it is 13 years later and I can still recall many of the details and theories, which shows how interesting I thought they were. Gladwell, who writes for The New Yorker, has a skill of weaving different elements and stories together into an enjoyable narrative. The gist of the book is how information spreads among people -- why do some ideas/products spread quickly and effectively, but others don't? Are there kinds of people who are better at transmitting information? (Hint: Yes, there are.)Some of the stories I remember best are about how ""Sesame Street"" was founded and its impact on literacy (it's surprisingly high!); how to reduce the spread of HIV among drug addicts; how the size of an office can enhance the feeling of community among its workers; how suicide can become more widespread in a region if someone of high stature commits it; and how crime can rise and fall in a city.But perhaps the most salient concept I still use is about connectors vs. mavens. A connector is someone who knows lots and lots of people. They are extroverts and are good at making casual acquaintances wherever they go. In contrast, a maven is a Yiddish term that means one who accumulates knowledge. These are people who gain the respect of friends and colleagues for giving good advice, so when they recommend something, the advice is usually followed. (For example, as a librarian I try to be a maven of good books.) Advertisers are interested in mavens because their opinions carry weight. Gladwell gives several examples of the differences between connectors and mavens, the main one being that the advice of a connector is not always taken even though he/she may give it to more people (because they know more people), but almost everyone follows the advice of a maven, even though they may give it to fewer people. So a maven might have more of an impact on spreading an idea.It would be interesting to reread this book now to see how it holds up, because many of these ideas seem to have become part of the cultural zeitgeist. I think I would still recommend it to anyone interested in some pop sociology."
8,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"I wish there was another word I could use instead of sexy. I mean it metaphorically, obviously, but I want to tell you about the thing that I find to be the most sexy thing imaginable – and I’ve realised that sexy isn’t really the word I should be using at all. You realise, of course, I’m talking about intellectually stimulating or satisfying when I say sexy. That is what I want to talk about – the thing that gives me my biggest intellectual buzz.Look, it isn’t any of the obvious things you might be thinking of – and all of those obvious things this book has in abundance. Not that I actually read this book – I listened to it as an audio book, and that is important to say because I don’t know if the book always has the afterword – and it is something in the afterword that I loved most about this otherwise merely wonderful book. (As you may have guessed, we will be returning to this later)What I’m saying is that Gladwell is a sexy kind of guy anyway, even before he did the best of all possible things in the afterword of this book. He is what I like to call an interpreter. I think he even refers to himself as this somewhere. He straddles a number of worlds – psychology, medicine, marketing, social theory, economics – and he draws lines between those worlds in the way one might if one was to place a piece of plastic film over another piece of plastic film on an overhead projector, so that what is written on both films of plastic merge to ‘complete the picture’ in beautifully interesting ways. Now, that is sexy – but it is only level one sexy. I love watching relationships and patterns appear and I love a good story and Gladwell knows his stuff when it comes to patterns and he really knows how to tell a good story. Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing the matter with level one sexy – but it is intellectual foreplay and needs something more to be truly satisfying.One of the things this book is about is trends. How do trends start? What makes it fashionable for kids to start smoking? Why do books by unknown authors suddenly become best sellers? How is it that two people can do much the same thing (and he gives a fascinating example from American History to explain this) and yet have completely different (in fact, nearly opposite) results?Or why did Hush Puppies, a brand of shoes that had virtually died, suddenly become – in the lingo of the streets – uber-cool? (Yes, I know, ‘don’t try being cool, McCandless, it really doesn’t suit’.)Essentially, he talks about a small number of personality types that exist in the world that kick trends along, and these types of people help make ‘the virus of the latest thing’ spread to us all. Those types of people are, communicators (people who know essentially everyone), mavens (people who know essentially everything) and salesmen. Sometimes we think that if we want to spread an idea far and wide we should find a way to get it to as many people as possible – much like spam. But when was the last time you bought something recommended to you from a piece of spam you received in your inbox? See what I mean. But I guess most of us know some car nut we go to when we are thinking of buying a car, someone who reads all the car magazines and (maybe) even spends his (it is always a boy) weekends ‘test driving’ the latest models. This is the sort of person who can not only tell you the difference between an overhead cam-shaft and polyunsaturated margarine, but also why the cam-shaft is better than butter. (In case you have not quite worked it out yet, I am not one of those mavens)In a world awash with ‘information’ – much of which is lies (although it is probably best we call it by its more polite name, advertising) – we are becoming, ironically enough, more dependent on word of mouth information from sources we know we can trust. Now, isn’t that a wonderful thesis and a direct confirmation of what you probably already suspected, but hadn’t put into words yet. I guess this might be the second level of intellectual sexy.The next level towards intellectual nirvana is when someone says something totally unexpected that makes my brains resonate in a way that I know will have me thinking for weeks. And he did that this morning as I was walking back from the beach by talking about collective memory. This is penultimate in the scale of intellectual sexy – I knew when he said this that what he was saying was going to end up in my review.They did a test on people, they put people through a series of remembering tasks – and they gave them these tests in pairs. Some of the pairs were people who didn’t know each other from a bar of soap – and the others were people who were literally couples, people in relationships. And the result? Well, the people in the relationships did lots and lots better at remembering stuff than the people that the fickle hand of fate flung together. Isn’t that fascinating? Doesn’t that send a shiver down your spine? But it gets better. He then goes on to talk about why this might be the case – and essentially he claims that we use our partners as a memory extension slot for our own brains. In a relationship there is a division of labour when it comes to remembering stuff – with one partner remembering the kids’ birthdays and the other remembering how to use the ice cream maker.And now comes the bucket of ice water that made me stop on my walk and think, “God, now, isn’t that really, really interesting”. Part of the reason people fall into a deep depression when they go through a divorce (and I thought, perhaps even die shortly after their ‘life partner’dies) may not just be that their partner has metaphorically taken away a part of their heart, but literally taken away a part of their brain. It is that line from Laurie Anderson about when her father died how she felt like a library had burnt down (I think from The Ugly One with Jewels, just before Speak My Language, but I could be wrong).But do you know what is the sexiest thing about this book? And the reason why you should avoid a first edition and get an edition with the afterword? It is that after he has built a pretty good case for something, made a rather good comparison that he uses to sustain the last bit of the book, after he has finished writing the book, after it is printed and ‘done and dusted’, he thinks about it some more and makes a couple of major revisions to some of his thinking in the afterword that goes in a later edition. It is utterly clear to me that if he had the chance to write this book again he would do it differently. Essentially, the afterword is showing us how he would have made it different. He is showing that no idea is ever finished with, no idea can be finally put aside as a shining trophy, only to gather dust and bird shit, but ideas are only worthy of that name if they are alive and alive things change and grow or sometimes they sicken and die.And someone who does that, that goes away and thinks about it even after it is done and finished with and then comes back and says, “Actually, I could have done that a bit better, let me see if I can just say it this way…” Now, that is sexy – that is the best. This book is not nearly as good as Outliers, and I only read this book because I read that book. But do you know what? This book is good enough that if I’d read this book first I would have gone on read that book too. "

10,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216885-david,4,"In a work heavily influenced by the budding science of memetics (though he never once uses the word meme), Malcom Gladwell seeks to provide a framework for explaining why certain isolated phenomena (suicide in Micronesia, wearing hush puppies, reading a particular novel) can suddenly become widespread and why situations can suddenly swing from one extreme (rampant crime in 80s NYC) to another (the huge drop in crime in that same city during the 90s). Gladwell postulates three mechanisms of cultural epidemiology, the axioms of the law of the few, the stickiness factor and the power of context. The law of the few declares that change is often initiated by a small group of people (three different types) with an ever-widening pyramid of influence. Making up the first type are the connectors, basically human nexuses whose webs of important acquaintances (note that these are not friends) spread out in logarithmic vertigos of extension (e.g., Revere’s “the British are coming” spread more quickly than that of William Dawes because of the many people Revere knew in the towns he visited). Another group mentioned in the law of the few are mavens, whom we could term data strategists, their almost hobby-like information-gathering not just carried out to further their own interests, but to assist a broader sphere of people. The final set of individuals counted among the few are the salesmen, persuasive communicators whose instinctual ability to adapt the non-verbal cues of others and infect them with emotion is key to effecting wide-sweeping change. The second axiom in Gladwell’s informal theory is stickiness: the impact of the vector on the host, i.e., an idea or product must be memorable in order to spread; otherwise, it will not be embraced by the people in the connector's network. As a result, marketers must constantly devise ways to present products so that they are memorable. Of course, there is no ready-made science of what makes something catchy. However, the effectiveness of a product or idea’s packaging can be tested and tweaked, as Gladwell demonstrates in his discussion of how the creators of Sesame Street and Blue’s Clues try to ensure that children remember their message (in other words, learn the concept being taught). The final factor leading toward the tipping point is the power of context. This area is less well defined by Gladwell, and he unfortunately seems to be trying to herd together a host of disparate considerations under a single, handy rubric. The basic concept is that human behavior is strongly influenced by external variables of context. For example, ""zero tolerance"" efforts to combat minor crimes such as fare-beating and vandalism on the New York subway led to a decline in more violent crimes; the perception of increased vigilance altered the behavior and attitudes of the passengers. This theory of broken windows is well-known in sociology: attention to small details, reparation of seemingly unimportant (when looking at the big picture) problems, can engender massive change in a larger system (this is sort of the butterfly effect of sociology). On the whole, however, Gladwell has made an admirable foray into the construction of a theoretical model of memetic transmission and epidemiology. Building upon his layman’s approach, scientists specializing in cultural transmission might now begin testing his specific claims with an eye toward developing such a model."
11,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,4,"Malcolm Gladwell has written five books, all of which have been on the New York Times bestseller list. He is extremely readable.This now-famous book is about popular ideas and products, and how they spread through society. Starting off small at first, they slowly gather momentum until they reach a 'tipping point', where they take off and become fantastically popular. This book is all about the mechanics of how this happens, and the different types of people and businesses enabling the process.The best bits for me? The illustration of how we are all incredibly different - how some people are freakishly sociable, others are freakishly knowing, informative and knowledgeable, whilst others have the charisma to sell you anything. Given Gladwell's clear examples I was easily able to slot a couple of my friends into these categories, and therefore relate to the ideas he was describing. These are the movers and shakers - the people who make things happen.He uses a wide range of phenomena to illustrate the idea of social epidemics - the rise to popularity of Hush Puppy shoes, a sudden decline of crime in New York, the success of the children's programmes Sesame Street and Blue Clues, the cleaning up of the New York subway, the spread of new corn seed in Iowa in the 1930s, an increase of suicides in the South Pacific islands of Micronesia, plus the reasons why smoking has drastically increased amongst teenagers in the US, despite strenuous efforts to discourage it. I was impressed by the wide range of his examples.My one criticism is that it was all rather predictable. The relationship between causes and effects were often ones I had heard before, or that I had worked out for myself. Unlike the book Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything I didn't feel that I was being exposed to some really original ideas behind society's statistics.Still - an interesting read by an excellent writer. It clarified several concepts I already had, and made them a lot less woolly."
12,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu,3,"Holy suppositions, Gladwell! There's a whole lotta coulds, may haves, apparentlies, perhapses up in here!Malcolm Gladwell's basic premise in The Tipping Point: To explain how word-of-mouth is spread.A couple of the examples he used were how crime was reduced in NYC under Giuliani's reign and how an old, dead-in-the-water brand of shoes seemingly suddenly were selling like hotcakes. But honestly, my favorite bit was the section on Sesame Street.It's interesting stuff, no doubt with some truth to it, hell maybe even all of it, but it seemed like every hypothesis put forth was followed by misrepresentation of studies. Scientists were quoted as saying that possibly their study pointed towards such-and-such a conclusion, and then Gladwell took it and ran with it. That's not the case through out the book, but even if it only happens once, it casts doubt on the whole freaking thing. There were times I hated this and times I actually enjoyed it. In fact, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, more than I wanted to. For you see, this is the sort of thing feasted upon by ladder-climbing, power-lunchers, who want to put Gladwell's theories into practice for the purposes of creating their own wildfire word-of-mouth epidemic in the exalted name of the great and almighty greenback. That sort of greed, rising above the heads of most of humanity to serve the bloodsucking desires of one, is repellent. I guess I'm one of the few who didn't read this about 10 years or more back. I resisted for a while, but succumbed to peer pressure and misrepresentation of the book's content. Regardless, here I am. I've read it and probably you have too. So I ask you, is this shit or is it genius? After all, this stupid little book managed to put its theories into practice and the damn thing blew up like nobody's business."
13,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/125509-stacy,2,"Malcolm Gladwell shows us with this book that he is a jack-of-all-trades (or intellectual disciplines) and master of none. He very loosely weaves together existing social science and economic research to support his thin idea that there is a ""tipping point"" in all epidemics. While it was a page turner and interesting to read, his glib conclusory statements interpreting others' research was a bit jarring... For example, use of the word ""always"" when describing a social phenomenon is not a practice to which most trained social scientists would subscribe. I was also hoping for more practical advice resulting from his work, but not much was to be found other than that many complex forces (people, context, etc.) are at work in achieving a tipping point in most epidemics.

16,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/669573-kathrynn,5,"Thoroughly enjoyed this easy to read non-fiction, business/sociology book. The author did a nice job putting information together in a clear, concise manner and I enjoyed the examples used throughout the book. Some examples used early on are carried through the entire book, i.e., Hush Puppies (shoe) fad, AIDS, etc.The Tipping Point explains the phenomenon of why some products, businesses, authors, etc become hugely successful (tip) while others never seem to break apart from the masses as anything special. The author introduced the following labels:Mavens: People that are very particular about products. They thoroughly research products or businesses and like to stay in the ""know"" about many things. ""Mavens have the knowledge and social skills to start a word-of-mouth epidemic."" Mavens are the data banks. They are the messengers. * Enjoyed reading how Lexus dealt with keeping the Mavens happy when they had a recall. Neat!Connectors: People who KNOW a lot of people. Not just close friends, but acquaintances. Interesting to note, that a connector is not out for self-serving goals, i.e., authors acquiring massive GRs friends, but they are more observers who genuinely like people. They come off an airplane knowing names of several new people in their lives...People with the gift of ""bringing the world together."" Connectors are the social glue--they spread the word.Salesmen: People with the skills to persuade us when we aren't sure. They are the critical point for the ""tipping"" of word-of-mouth epidemic. Why was Paul Revere known for his ""midnight ride"" when William Dawes was not? Paul Revere was a connector.Why does one restaurant or book become hugely successful while another just as good (or better) remain fairly unknown? They had a Maven, Connector and Salesmen in their corner that spread the news of their product or business like a virus. I enjoyed the ""Broken Windows"" theory and how it was presented in cleaning up the New York Subway System and subsequently used to clean up run-down, crime-filled neighborhoods. The Magical Number Seven--had no idea. The information about Gore Associates (business) and how they are all ""associates"" with mentors in lieu of supervisors. They practice the idea that each building hold a maximum of 150 employees because beyond that and the employees no longer know each other or stay aware of what is going on in another department, loosing the personalization and job satisfaction...The last section involved smoking, trying to quit smoking and teen smoking. Wow! Some really good ideas presented here. This section also touched on peer pressure. How teens attempted or copied the Columbine shootings and why, how teens have suicide ""epidemics"" and why. Why do teens want to smoke?The Afterword that the author added to this book was neat because he addressed e-mail and it's overuse. He used the telephone as an example. Telemarketers, etc. Fax machines. All were neat when they weren't overused, now we are inundated with e-mails everyday and we don't take the time to respond to most and if we do, it's usually very short. A lot of good information packed into this book for business as well as sociology. "
17,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/296382-c-c,3,"To understand ""The Tipping Point,"" one must understand what led to its creation: In 2000, there were 5.5 billion people living on the planet Earth. Many of them were considered human beings, but a few were thought to be celery. The difference between the two categories bewildered the top dog breeders of the day. To help us think more deeply about the consequences of the problem, consider the following fact: If you were born after 1975 and tried to ride a bicycle from Iceland to Darfur, the chances of crashing your bike into a British nanny increased 13% based on the number of Blossom reruns you watched as a child. Whether or not your parents are divorced is immaterial, as is the amount of padding in your seat. Social Scientists had a term for this late 20th century phenomenon: ""Whoa!"" Meanwhile, in Canada (if that's your real name), a young, mild-mannered boy named Malcolm recognized the unique power of combining individual letters into meaning-units called “words.” He quit his job making ice sculptures out of rusted fenders and moved south of the border to America (the nation, not the ice-cream stand). His timing was impeccable. At the end of the 90s, America had just entered a period of reckless behavior wherein, with little prompting, Americans would try to arrange words into ""sentences"" and, if sufficiently coked-up, slap those sentences into ""paragraphs."" Conservatives like Pat Buchanan were furious. Senator Bob Dole went on Meet the Press and blamed his erectile dysfunction on syntax. The era ended suddenly on December 31st, 1999, when, according to a budding bow-tie fanatic named Bill Nye, both the year AND the century had run their course. Feeling threatened, Gladwell went on national television to declare ""writing"" is the radical, counterintuitive explanation for the existence of what he called ""books"" but what conservatives called ""syphilis"". The strategy worked: He signed a contract with the biggest publishing house in America, which then promptly issued his first minor masterpiece: ""Writing: How Letters, Sentences, Paragraphs, and Chapters Add Up To The Thing That Came Before the Colon."" From that point on, it was all gin and roses (until Slash and Hypen left the band)."
18,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/604493-dru,4,"I can see now that the 
 Freakonomics
 boys took quite a few pages out of this book. The Tipping Point launched the trend of examining social experiments with results that are, to use Mr. Gladwell's phrase, ""wildly counterintuitive"". I breezed right through this one--the most popular books always seem to be quick reads--because I was so caught up in Gladwell's straightforward style of writing and fascinating subject matter. (I particularly enjoyed the Sesame Street/Blue's Clues experiments.) The book only lags (and then only slightly) towards the very end with his ""case studies"". Someone named DeeDee Gordon, whom Gladwell tells us is an expert in spotting ""trendsetters"", delivers the following monologue:""I've run into trendsetters who look completely Joe Regular Guy. I can see Joe Regular Guy at a club listening to some totally hard-core band playing, and I say to myself, omigod, what's that guy doing here, and that totally intrigues me, and I have to walk up to him and say, hey, you're really into this band. What's up? You know what I mean? I look at everything. If I see Joe Regular Guy sitting in a coffee shop, and everyone around him has blue hair, I'm going to gravitate toward him because, hey, what's Joe Regular Guy doing in a coffee shop with people with blue hair?""What's sad is that almost everyone knows someone who talks like this. And sometimes we want to punch them. I mean, can you even imagine these ""Joe Regular Guy"" scenarios actually occurring? First at the club:DeeDee Gordon: Hey, Joe Regular Guy...JRG: Pardon me?DeeDee Gordon: You're really into this band. What's up?JRG: They're okay, I guess. What do you mean?DeeDee Gordon: You really intrigue me, Joe Regular Guy.JRG: My name is Ted. DeeDee Gordon: I want to know what Joe Regular Guy is doing listening to a band. In a club. JRG: Are you hitting on me?DeeDee Gordon: Is this a new trend I spy, Joe Regular Guy?JRG: I'm going to go stand over there.(JRG leaves)DeeDee Gordon: I wonder what Joe Regular Guy is doing standing over there?Or, in the coffee shop: DeeDee Gordon: Hey there. JRG: Um, hello.DeeDee Gordon: What's Joe Regular Guy doing in a coffee shop with people with blue hair?Blue Hair #1: She has identified our leader!Blue Hair #2: Pummel her!(Joe Regular Guy and blue-haired acolytes pummel Deedee Gordon)At least that's what I hope would happen.

19,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6940509-hannah,1,"1 Start - Horrible book.Yes, yes, even though I started this yesterday I did actually finish it. And after doing so, I regret reading this. Full disclosure, the subject matter didn't really interest me but I've been wrong before so I gave it a go. I'll never be able to get back those precious reading hours.There are two things that make this book, in my opinion, unreadable. The first is that the concept/central theme of this book is nothing new. Now, I know this was published ca. 2000 so I'm about 17 years late to the party but come on. I can't imagine how this book struck a chord with so many people. The idea that there is some sort of tipping point (clever) that causes certain trends, ideas, etc. to become phenomenon's. To me that seems logical and a no-brainer. I mean, duh. There are certain elements that cause certain things to catch on while others don't. I just wasn't impressed with the author's fervor and excitement in trying to explain a logical thing. I felt as if he was talking down to the reader.The second thing that made me despise this book was that the author leaves a lot of half-thoughts. He rarely finishes an idea all the way to the end and the book is full of cases that are unfinished. He leaves one example before he's fully explained how it relates to his thesis and begins on another. I found it irritating and a bad way to write a book.I have Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by the same author and while I'll probably read it, I need to cool down from this one before I can jump into another one of his (what I presume will be horribly done) books.Do not read."
20,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,4,"I first read about this concept several years ago in a New Yorker article that discussed the theory of epidemics as it relates to crime, particularly the power of context. A book (Fixing Broken Windows Restoring Order and Reducing Crime in Our Communities by George Kelling) proposed that police should spend more time dealing with the little things, e.g., arresting people for public drunkenness, going after the street hookers small-time dope dealers, rather than putting resources into the high-profile, big crimes. ""If a window is broken and left unrepaired, people walking by will conclude that no one cares and no one is in charge."" This theory was adopted by David Gunn, the new director of the New York Transit System, after Kelling was brought in as a consultant. New York and the subway system were in the throes of a terrible crime wave (remember Bernard Goetz?). Gunn had the transit cops arrest fare-beaters, and they never allowed a graffiticovered car to enter service. The kids would spend three nights painting cars and then the workers would paint over what the kids had done. ""It was a message to them. If you want to spend three nights of your time vandalizing a train, fine. But it's never going to see the light of day."" The cops, at first angry they were spending time arresting simple fare-beaters — after all, only $1.25 was at stake — discovered that many of those they caught had records and were carrying guns, and many had outstanding warrants, and an important signal was being sent. In less than six years, the subway system became one of the safest. Mayor Giuliani hired the top transit cop to implement the same theory city-wide. The emphasis was now on the socalled ""minor"" stuff, the ""squeegee men"" who extorted money from drivers at intersections, public urination, throwing trash on the streets, and other ""minor"" crimes. The effect was sensational. The crime rate in New York plummeted. The murder rate fell to one of the lowest in the nation. Context was everything. Studies over the years have revealed that we are mistaken when we view character as something innate, and that we overestimate the importance of character traits when it comes to interpreting other people's behavior. It turns out that ""character isn't what we think it is, or rather, what we want it to be. . . It's more like a bundle of habits and tendencies and interests, loosely bound together and dependent, at certain times, on circumstance and context."" Broken Windows and the Power of Context theory say ""that the criminal — far from being someone who acts for fundamental, intrinsic reasons and who lives in his own world — is actually someone acutely sensitive to his environment, who is alert to all kinds of cues, and who is prompted to commit crimes based on his perception of the world around him."" The book is much more than about crime and its causes. Gladwell is interested in systems and why certain people and linkages can create social epidemics, be they the purchasing of certain items in a store or how children react to concepts on television. Ideas and messages spread just the way viruses do, and if a certain mass is reached the epidemic begins and is caught by millions. Why do we remember Paul Revere's ride, but not the other fellow who set off in a different direction but carried the same message in the same manner? Gladwell has an explanation. He had two things going for him. He was a ""connector,"" i.e., he knew and was known by almost everyone in the Boston area, but he was also a ""maven,"" an individual that collected information about the regulars. Gladwell has filled the book with lively anecdotes that support the data he is presenting, making a fascinating read. "
21,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/584195-natali,5,"This is Gladwell's most thorough book. It has everything that I wanted from Outliers and Blink: research, diagnosis, and a clear call to action. Although admittedly, the research is not quite as fun as it is in his two following books. If I had Gladwell's attention, I would ask him this: How do you capitalize on your role as either a Connector, Maven, or Salesmen? And what if you are none of the above, but rather a part of the phenomenon-following mob? Can you aspire to a different role than the one you are naturally gifted with? I identified with the Maven, as I'm sure most journalists do. So what do I do with that beyond disseminating news and culture? Can a Maven be a trend setter or a Connector? Since I don't have Gladwell's attention, I guess that is rhetorical.One thing I love about Gladwell is that he presents strong theory and analysis in a way that allows for variance. One of my favorite quotes from this book: ""That's why social change is so volatile and so often inexplicable, because it is the nature of all of us to be volatile and inexplicable."""

23,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22189980-belhor,4,"This is a book on epidemics. In this book, Malcolm tries to explain, with the wit, clarity and beauty you'd expect from him, the way something small and insignificant turns into a huge wave. The book started slow and gradually became more and more interesting. I loved chapter 7, which was partly about smoking. I always knew there was something fundamentally wrong about anti-smoking campaigns. Turns out I was right! Here I just want to note the beauty of mass data gathering. Without mass data, the late parts of the book, in my opinion, could not have existed. For example we always had data on anti-smoking campaigns, the money the spent and the results they got. But it's only when you have access to limited but wast amounts of data that you can really figure out what is going on inside the system. Now, this is the first lesson of the Tipping Point: Starting epidemics requires concentrating your efforts in a few key areas. The second lesson of the tipping point is that whether we like it or not, our intuitions are often wrong. People and organizations that start the epidemics don't stumble upon them by chance. They deliberately test their intuitions. What we need to understand is that human communication has its own set of unusual and often counter-intuitive rules. Here again, mass gathering of data and analysis comes into play. The final and maybe the most important lesson of tipping point is that change is possible! That people can radically transform their behaviors and their beliefs in the face of the right kind of impetus. This also has ties to problems of free will. I think here we can see that the best philosophy is explained by compatibilism (soft determinism)! Here we can see that our understanding of freedom must change radically. I can go on, but I don't want to! "

An interesting theory… I liked the examples and note that this much more than just a book of examples. To me, I liked the breaking down of how something started and grew to something more from the likes of Sesame Street and rumours through to sneakers and New York crime! The magic number 150 chapter is thought provoking, although to be clear Gladwell was far from the first to identify essentially the maximum number of acquaintances one can have. Recommended read, just to be aware of the trend examples provided. 7 out of 12, up to 9 out of 12 after my 2016 reread!"
25,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/249292-nicko,5,"I've heard Malcolm Gladwell speak a few times at Harvard and had been interested to read The Tipping Point for a while. It's a mixture of anectdotes, psychology, economics, marketing, epidemiology and more. The principle focus of The Tipping Point is how small changes, can bring about large effects. With examples such as marketing of Hush Puppies shoes, the broken windows theory, Airwalk shoes, Paul Reveres midnight ride, word of mouth, mass hysteria and more. Gladwell really captures the spirit of human connections and the human need to feel part of something. A definate must read for anyone interested in looking at what moves people and how a small event can result in large response.I felt the argument of this book proceeded very logically and was adequately developed and supported by the factual examples. That argument is essentially this: that many social trends and phenomena follow the same basic pattern as epidemics; that they follow the same pattern because they are caused and sustained in much the same way; that the difference between trends that get past the ""tipping point"" and those that do not may often be one or more very small factors; and that if one wants to create any sort of social trend (whether that be buying a product or committing fewer crimes), it is important to attend to such very small factors. But for my part, I think Gladwell is a perspicacious observer whose insights here are original, interesting, and even useful. "
26,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/123142-aaron,2,"I bought this book for half price at Borders. I should have thought to myself: ""Hey, there's probably a reason this book is on the half price table."" But I didn't. I bought the book. The best way I can describe this one is to remind people of what it was like to take an essay exam for a liberal arts course in college. You have a full hour to fashion a coherent thesis out of the trivia you've learned over the past five months. So you come up with a topic sentence, build up a head of steam, and start sprinkling in facts to build up verisimilitude. You're not really convinced of the correctness or importance of your thesis; you just want that A grade. When I went to college, the technique was called BSing. Malcolm Gladwell is very good at it. The only problem is that after about 100 pages, you can tell he's BSing. Like many journalists who write books, he doesn't know what to do with all the extra space he needs to fill. If I were his editor, I'd tell him to pare down ""The Tipping Point,"" ""Blink,"" and another BS extravaganza into one tight book. I would probably give that book three stars. This one only gets two. Sorry, Malcolm."
27,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633211-vikas,4,"This was third Malcolm Gladwell book I read and also similar to others which I wanted to read for a long time. This one deals with statistics and how there is a critical point in spread of anything idea or virus that can make it successful or a failure and with various examples Mr. Gladwell successfully pushed his ideas forward from Independence of USA to resurgence of a Shoe Brand to Shows for Kids to Teenage Smoking to Teenage Suicide. This one was the book which I felt can be used in Marketing studies or advertising after all it already contains many examples of the Sticky message. I have always loved comics, and I hope that I will always love them. Even though I grew up reading local Indian comics like Raj Comics or Diamond Comics or even Manoj Comics, now's the time to catch up on the international and classic comics and Graphic novels. I am on my quest to read as many comics I can. I Love comics to bit, may comics never leave my side.

As noted in the synopsis, ""the tipping point is that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire."" Mr. Gladwell offers multiple examples of this phenomenon in various domains including business, education, religion, health, and crime.My husband ONLY reads business books (how boring right?) and he has suggested this book to me on multiple occasions. When he shared with me the definition of a tipping point, I thought it was pretty much common sense and wasn't overly motivated to read this. But, my husband doesn't get excited over much in the reading world so I gave in. I have to admit though that Mr. Gladwell's thoroughness provided a valuable learning experience.

I wonder how it is that this man's book spent many many weeks on top of the new york times best seller list?(But then again look at the new york times best sellers list.) What struck me the most about this book is its total lack of in depth analysis. The question which lead to the writing of this book has to do with how fads start. He explains the process of what takes place in order for a fad to happen with the implication that if these steps are not met then the fad will not happen. This to a certain point is interesting, where the book disappoints is that he never gets into why one fad is started presumably at the expense of another. Suppose we have two things in the possession of a connector/maven, why does this maven/connector choose one thing over the other. Presumably these types of people also own other things and wear more than one pair of shoes or pants. Why the Levi's instead of the Dockers or the Nike's instead of the Reeboks?"

32,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2400165-hannah,4,"I picked this one up based on various recommendations, having no idea how fitting it would be for our current situation. It's a book about various kinds of epidemic and about identifying the point at which things go ""viral"" or ""tip."" Lots of good food for thought, not just in terms of understanding the whole COVID crisis of 2020 but also for considering how mob mentality works (riots were burning through the country, destroying businesses and neighborhoods as I was reading this). The book also describes certain kinds of people who have a disproportionate effect on the opinions of others, the enduring popularity of smoking among teens, the copycat effect with suicide and school violence, the appeal of particular kids' shows or brands of shoes, the way environmental factors (broken windows in a neighborhood or graffiti on the subway, for example) seem to give people permission to behave in ways they otherwise wouldn't, and so on. Gladwell tends to take an evolutionary and deterministic approach to some of these social trends. It's as if individuals in certain circumstances can't help how they behave. But he's got a point. Circumstances and environments do grease the skids toward certain kinds of choices. A thought-provoking book, with a lots of takeaways for pastors, marketers, civic leaders, and really anyone wanting to better understand how small decisions and seemingly minor events can shape an entire culture."

Without using terms like 'Viral', 'Influencers' etc, the book explains in a simple structured manner the science of social ideas give exponential result. The Law of few chapters and examples introducing connectors, mavens and sales people were easy to understand. The stickiness factor is something which doesn't have the answers but the book seems to encourage experimenting. The sesame street example for kids attention span - I was able to relate.The power of context resembled a bit to the chaos theory and causality. I think more than what was conveyed in the chapters, I really liked the idea of engineering incidents to happen. The epidemic reference was also contextual. This is one of the good books for someone trying to make sense of the social media world - since it does not talk about any of it. Loved it."
34,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32091911-sallie-dunn,3,"I listened to this audio (my second ever audio) and I do believe it’s a little dated now. However, the concepts are still valid. The examples sited to illustrate the author’s point throughout the book were all from the 80’s and 90’s. I was curious if listening to non fiction while driving would work for me; I found it quite easy to become distracted. Nevertheless, some good points made about how little changes can sometimes create the “tipping point.” Three point five stars. "
35,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4269099-angela-blount,3,"2 ½ Stars Note: I listened to the audiobook. Gladwell reads his own work, and the vocal effect is generally pleasing. Having first read Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, this earlier work of Gladwell's was a bit disappointing. The premise is intriguing, particularly from a sociological and marketing standpoint. Gladwell explores numerous factors that seem to provide compelling explanations as to why certain products or ideas (intentionally or otherwise) become virulent phenomenon, while others simply fade into obscurity. On the one hand, there's no denying this book is dated. The studies mentioned are largely from the early to mid-90's, though he goes back in the epilogue to revise some of his examples (particularly of epidemic youth suicide in Micronesia—which he initially tried to parallel to teen smoking in the U.S., but amended with a far more fitting claim regarding school shootings in the post-Columbine era.) On the other hand...there are a few takeaway concepts that could possibly be considered timeless if properly translated to one's own field/situation: the law of the few, the power of context, and the stickyness factor. But an instructional guide, this book is not. Repetition is overused, at times, to the point of tedium. (While he suggests this principle worked well for certain children's TV shows, it was perhaps not the most effective approach to his target audience.)To this reader, the most fascinating part of the book involves the history of Sesame Street and Blue's Clues, two of the most successful and effectively educational children's TV programs to date. I'd previously had no idea of many studies and tweaking went into the production of these shows. (Although, some information on their long-term effects would have felt a bit more meaningful.) Historically speaking, the story he kept coming back to about Paul Revere's midnight ride was thought-provoking. Even if it did sometimes seem this was being used to force the author's point rather than to point the readers toward their own conclusions. The author makes some interesting observations—some that may very well have some credence. But then, in many instances, he seems to go the unnecessary extra mile of drawing problematic (if not outright faulty) conclusion. One glaring example would be his early-on illustration involving the AIDs virus: In mentioning an anomalous 1950's epidemic among newborns, Gladwell says of the lead scientist, ""Goudsmit thinks that this was an early HIV epidemic."" This is an interesting bit of speculation. He follows that up with a connect-the-dot's trail of how an AIDs-infected adult could have passed the virus on to a woman who became pregnant, infecting her own baby in-utero, and how the practice of sharing out unsterilized needles could possibly have spread the virus through the maternity ward. The problem isn't Goudsmit's possible-yet-unproven scenario. The problem I have (which many have pointed out before me) is that Gladwell takes this and runs with it, making oddly definite statements like: ""They defeated HIV""(in reference to the surviving infants) and ""The strains of HIV circulating in the 1950s were a lot different from the HIV circulating today."" Those are pretty bold leaps to make without citing any evidence beyond the anecdotal. And unfortunately, because this came so early on in the book, Gladwell's later postulations were then brought into serious question in the mind of this reader. "
36,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1627983-mahlon,4,"Malcolm Gladwell discusses how trends spread, or reach their ""Tipping Point"" in this thought provoking book. He identifies 3 Laws in his theory: 1. The law of the few: Gladwell identifies 3 types of people that aid in ""tipping"" trends:Connecters- Socially outgoing people who seem to know everyone (he cites Paul Revere as an example)Mavens- A person who likes to collect information on various subjects or products, and delights in distributing it to friends to aid in their decision making process. A maven also knows where the deals are. For example if you want to buy a car but have no idea which model gets the best gas mileage, you might want to seek out a maven.Salesmen- A person blessed with the gifts of gab and empathy, they are able to persuade people.2. Stickyness Factor:The art of making a message memorable- Gladwell examines the world of children's television for examples of this.3. The Power of Context:The law of 150: 150 people is the maximum amount that we can have in our circle of friends and still maintain a meaningful relationship with. I was skeptical of this until I looked at my facebook page, and saw that my friend list is nearing 150.Gladwell uses these examples and other enthralling case studies to drive home his points. I was surprised at the writing style employed in the book. It wasn't poor by any means, it was just very repetitive. While I can understand that the author did this to ensure that his ideas stick with the reader, it got annoying rather quickly. Gladwell also cited many sources verbatim, using long block quotes, which made some sections of the book tough to wade through. Also he needed better organization, the chapters were too long. The Tipping Point is a quick read, and a must-read for anyone with a business, marketing, or management background. However, the case studies are so intriguing that they should interest the casual reader as well.This was my #1 book of 2000, and made my Top 25 of the decade as well."

40,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20906001-cori,3,"Last year, I came across a large Goodreads list containing interesting psychology reads. I added a huge number of them to my ""To-Read"" list and so far have not been disappointed by any of them. The Tipping Point is two parts psychology, one part economics, and maybe just a smidge of generalized statements. And it was fascinating. What makes a fad or style take off and become popular? How do we change the tide of criminal activity or healthcare? Why was was Paul Revere's ride so effective while no one even knows who Daws is or that he rode another route the same night? This book delves into the possibilities for answers to these questions and more. The Tipping Point was readable and easy to follow along with. I can't say I agreed with everything the author said. At times, he took his concepts so far as to absolve human responsibility in our reactions to the world around us. He gave the example of Kitty Genovese, a young New York girl who was stalked, raped, and brutally murdered by a knife-wielding butcher while 38 neighbors listened to her screams and never called the police. Malcolm Gladwell explains the tendency for humans to assume someone else will respond if a crowd is around, thereby excusing ourselves from action. While this makes sense, he comments, ""Kitty Genovese's screams sounded like an open-and-shut case of human indifference, until careful psychological testing demonstrated the powerful influence of context."" No, Mr. Gladwell, this is still a case of human indifference. While understanding context is valuable because it shows us the importance of human traits we need to combat, it does not absolve us of responsibility. While his wording was subtle, he, more than anyone, recognizes the power of suggestion. And he suggests several times throughout the book that we may not be responsible for our actions because of (_fill-in-the-blank_). I don't feel that this book should be shied away from because of his, perhaps, bias, but I would challenge readers to go into the book watching for these subtle suggestions. The more the reader watches for it, the more it pops out. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found some of its concepts incredibly valuable. For anyone with a message to spread or a product to circulate, this book is for you. For anyone interested in psychology, this book is for you. I'd rate this book a PG."
41,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,5,"I already started reviewing this book a few posts back and wanted to give you a more complete rundown now that I finished it. While it started out a bit dated with the Hush Puppies example of something that tipped, and his Paul Revere example of a Connector and Maven sounded a bit Palinesque, the book was worth reading until the end. I suppose that since I have been living outside the US, I appreciate more global examples and this book is very US-centric in that aspect. Nonetheless, the idea that there are particularly “sticky” ideas and carriers of those ideas in the form of Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen so that they “Cross the Chasm” is not revolutionary but still insightful. That ideas are highly sensitive to their context is also obvious but the examples here abound. I particularly liked the explanation of Sesame Street psychology and it was thanks to this book that I discovered Blue’s Clues (like I said, I have been out of the US a LONG time) which is now a favorite of my kids. The parallel between teen suicide in Micronesia and teen smoking in the US was a bit of a stretch and as he offered a possible factor to minimize teen smoking, he wasn’t as generous for the kids in the Pacific. I think that the steady rise in cigarette prices has had a far more devastating effect on tobacco sales than his idea of reducing toxins in the cigarettes. Another curious side-story here: his explanation for the drop in crime in New York in the 80’s (freshly painted subways and fixed windows) is totally different than that of Levitt in Freakonomics (legalized abortion), so having read both, it is hard to know whom to believe…What I came away from the book with was the conviction that communication is everything and that the very first slide or two of a presentation MUST absolutely create that “stickiness” for the idea to get transmitted. The other problem, however, I have is that with Facebook, Google, and Apple, each has definitely tipped but it would be hard to pin these to particular Connectors, Mavens or Salesmen. Perhaps, Apple can be explained by Mavens like myself using Macs but then, their astounding success is far more related to iTunes and the iPod and iPhone and I don’t see CMS playing here. Similarly, Facebook just came out of nowhere 7 years ago to dominate the internet. Google was just simple and incredibly humble in their pitch (selling words for cents a piece) but with earth-shattering results. If I may, Angry Birds in ONLY TWO YEARS has also tipped – $1B IPO planned for 2012 based on ONE SINGLE GAME! – but this was purely a word-of-mouth / Apple Store phenom. So, is there a new dynamic that needs to be afterword-ed on to The Tipping Point? What is the special chemistry for Rovio that made its game bigger than, say, Plants vs. Zombies or (one of my favorites) Infinity? Who were the Connectors here? Reviewers on the App Store? I suppose we hard-core iPhone addicts are the Mavens but the Salesman is merely the App Store? What is the lesson we can pull out of this? Perhaps we need another five to seven years to get a retrospective view for analysis. Or was Steve Jobs all three? Even then, that would partially explain Apple and Rovio’s success but how about Google and Facebook? It is certainly a brave new world.So, here’s an idea, I’ll write the sequel to The Tipping Point in 2015 for its 25th anniversary. Unless, of course, Malcolm beats me to it"
42,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21914765-ritaskeeter,3,"I really enjoyed this; it has that bashed together mish-mash of information from a range of different disciplines that I love. Unfortunately though, it is now very outdated - I think it was first published in ?2000 - long before the social media explosion we live with these days. When I think of tipping points, I think of those posts on FB that go viral; but that's just not something that even existed back then.As much as I enjoyed Gladwell's style, I found his arguments unconvincing much of the time. Is this because the societal context I live in now is so far removed from the context the book was written in? Or is it because there are flaws in Gladwell's presentation of the matter? Who knows. But what the book said to me, as I don't think this was Gladwell's intention, is that there is no me thing that creates a tipping point. There are lots of different things that contribute. Some is about smart analysis of data and intelligent planning; some is contagiousness; some is stickiness; some is salesmen, and mavens and whatever the other one is (I've forgotten because it wasn't sticky enough, clearly...).But despite this, there were interesting points to the book:- The discussion about emotional contagion and senders and receivers; maybe emotions are outside-in rather than inside-out.- The discussion around the study on how to get Uni students to have their tetanus shots, and what strategies helped them to follow through.- The contagiousness of suicides. I found this particularly interesting given a spate of teen suicides in my state a year or two ago. The information from this study came up in the Coronial inquests and the coroner was highly critical of media reporting of the suicides and made recommendations around that."
43,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60897821-nguyen-linh-chi,3,"Useful book for everyone, from marketers, sociologists to educators, strategists, etc. More applicable than Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, in my opinion.This book scrutinizes on how a small event can lead to an epidemic. Gladwell suggests an idea about the Tipping Point, a dramatic moment in an epidemic when everything can change at once. There are 3 factors that lead to The Tipping Point: The Law of Few, The Stickiness Factor and The Power of Context. Firstly, the Law of Few states that little things can make as much of a difference as big things. There are 3 kinds of people that can make it possible: Connectors, Mavens (a person that has a lot of information about different products) and Salesmen. Secondly, the Stickiness Factor proposes that in order to spark an epidemic, an idea must be memorable and lead people to action. Lastly, the Power of Context holds that an epidemic can be tipped by tinkering a smallest detail of the environment. The Rule of 150 suggests that at this size, it is easier to manage people. The author has given an example in marketing: by utilizing a book group, readers can share their opinions about the book with other group members."
44,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,3,"As with other Gladwell books (Blink and Outliers), the stories are engaging and the perspective is always fresh and insightful. However, the connection between the various anecdotes and the thesis is often flimsy. I think Tipping Point is the worst offender of the three books. I think he extrapolates too much from too little data and experimentation. But the book would deserve 5 stars if he could tone down his assertions a bit. Gladwell is inexplicably cool and I go straight to his articles whenever they are in the New Yorker. I really appreciate how he can take assumptions and turn them on their head and cast new light on history that seems settled. That's why I keep reading his books, but I am often frustrated by his disregard for journalistic etiquette. I am not even sure that's the right way to put it, but I think the book is a little bit incoherent and repetitive and the points he is trying to make are not fully supported by his anecdotes. However, I continue to be a loyal fan and will read any book he publishes and every article he writes for the New Yorker."
45,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"Social epidemics and why Sesame Street became so successful.In this book Gladwell examines tipping points: a single small action, an idea or information that rapidly spreads - going viral.As always he explains his thesis by telling compelling stories, which makes his books so vivid and enjoyable but also very inductive! He guides you through political revolutions, initiated by one man starting to spread the word. But he also tells how children watch television different from adults and how Sesame Street based their entire concept on those observations to make their content stick and cause their enormous success.One could criticize that this follows only one strict pattern, drawing conclusions from the specific case and stating it as a general fact, not pointing out contradictions or presenting cases that would collide, but that is nothing to criticize. He writes one sided argumentations on purpose and stays reflective but ultimately leaves it up to the reader to contradict and think for themselves! I love it and his way to tell stories makes him one of my favorite authors!"
46,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18695911-daniel-chaikin,4,"This is a great Gladwell book with lots to think about. Like most his books there is a sense of pointlessness to it, even as Gladwell pounds out its relevance... hmm, that's a pretty vague statement. What I mean is that there is nothing groundbreaking here. The basic message is that it takes a certain specific amount of skill in specific things, and certain specific kinds of luck (or ill luck) for societal changes to happen, whether they are about fashion or crime. That's not news. Anyway, regardless, the book leaves the reader thinking. And that's the charm of Gladwell. I had this sense that people like The Tipping Point more than other Gladwell books, so I had higher expectations for it. It's not any better than his other books, but only very much the same. Maybe even a bit less because it's pretty short (3 hours on audio). Perhaps it's just the first Gladwell book many fans read. As always, Gladwell reads wonderfully. "
47,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811928-forrest,4,"This is sort of a treatise on the butterfly effect on a sociological scale. While the examples used seemed to spread out in all directions, I think that Gladwell was able to keep everything under one theoretical umbrella, with some wrestling. I'd be interested to see if Gladwell's observations tie into Hierarchy Theory on some level, and I suspect they do. There may also be underlying elements of stochasticity that effect the outcome of tipping point dynamics, though James Gleick would be a better judge of that. All-in-all a very interesting read about outliers, word of mouth, and epidemics."

Maybe it was the Norwegian translation, it felt completely off, particularly in regards to the most important concepts. The one thing this book does very well is explain the importance of context and the fact that human beings always tend toward fundamental attribution error. That is, we over-estimate personal factors and underestimate situational factors. ""Behavior is a result of social context"". Nicely put! There wasn't anything here that I hadn't heard before though."
49,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2310290-kevin-xu,2,"I thought the whole idea of the tipping point did not need to be expanded as it was ordinary written as an article. All I needed about the tipping point was the idea, but books like this likes to give in the idea in the introduction then the rest of the book is basically filled with examples done with extensive research helping to explain to the overall reader the author's idea felt pointless to me."
50,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26548178-amber-foxx,5,"I kept thinking about the concepts in this book long after I put it down. While the examples from epidemiology were familiar to me, the application of similar analysis to the spread of other types of epidemics, from fashion trends to the sales of a particular book, was enlightening. A few days before I finished reading it, I heard on the radio that the West Antarctic ice shelf has reached its tipping point. It’s crumbling and melting and it can’t be stopped. The message that climate change is real and urgent has never reached the tipping point for Americans, though. Why not?  According to Gladwell, writing back in 2000, a message or a trend needs to be what he calls “sticky” if it’s going to spread. There needs to be something about it that adheres easily in our minds. We respond to human, social cues more than anything else. I related that back to this depressing news. Ocean temperatures and weather patterns and CO2 levels are not human and social. The message is complex and full of mathematical models. I used to live in Norfolk VA, and I felt sad for it when I heard about the tipping point for the Antarctic ice shelf. Sea level rising ten to fifteen feet will damage or drown so many places I’ve loved: friends’ homes; 18th century cobblestone streets; parks where I saw concerts and watched fireworks and ran; the beautiful waterfront Taiwan-American Friendship Garden; and the minor league ballpark where I watched the Tides play. The water may rise two or three feet in my lifetime—and parts of my beloved Ghent district already can flood in a thunderstorm. Why did I digress into all that in the middle of a book review? To illustrate that a personal story is stickier than an impersonal abstraction. That’s how our minds are wired. Anyone who wants people to remember and care about something has to make the message about people. Another feature of social epidemics and their tipping points is that message has to be translated. Innovators may start an idea, but it’s often inaccessible to the mainstream. Gladwell illustrates translators by describing how fashion trends are spread. They may start with outsider teens, but they are observed by savvy adults who adapt them, modify them just a little, and sell them. And then, of course, the edgy outcasts do something new to identify themselves, and fashion translates it and spreads the next cool thing. It takes more than translation to make something tip. Personalities matter. Some people, according to Gladwell, are Connectors. They specialize in the art of acquaintance. Not necessarily friendship, but “loose ties.” It’s natural to them to collect people and weave social webs, not with any end in mind but because they enjoy it. Social epidemics need these influential and widely acquainted people. Epidemics also need Mavens. These are the informal experts in their social circles as well as professional experts, people who relish the collection of information and love to share it. Another necessary link is the Salesman (or woman, obviously, but Gladwell says Salesman). This is a person whose persuasive power is as natural as the Connectors’ social breadth and the Mavens’ fascination with knowledge. Gladwell describes the importance of face to face relationships when he talks about all of these people, and how their genuineness is what makes them effective. Word of mouth from spreads from them because they care. They don’t share because something is in it for them, but for the person with whom they are speaking. When you read the book, you see all of these types in action and understand how hard it would be to acquire their traits if you aren’t one of them by nature, especially the Salesman. Gladwell doesn’t discuss social networks online, because of the age of this book, but the relationships he describes are qualitatively different from having friends on Facebook or followers or Twitter. I suspect such relationships are now supplemented but not replaced by virtual ones. The section of this book on the effects of facial expressions examines the power of nonverbal communication, which reinforces the importance of in-person connections as well as the influence of television. Another principle of social epidemics and effective communication is the importance of small groups. Research and experience have repeatedly found that one hundred and fifty is the maximum membership number for a group to have social coherence. After that, the possibility of members really knowing each other is diminished, and the interpersonal influence of the group weakens. A group of two hundred loses the warm but loose social ties that allow good communication. Word of mouth is how social epidemics spread, and we can only listen to so many mouths. Gladwell’s analysis of smoking contagion and addiction tipping points should be of interest to anyone concerned with smoking prevention and cessation. Negative epidemics spread the same way positive or harmless ones do. Anything can be normalized and adopted if the message is sticky. Its contagiousness is enhanced by being spread by small groups, started by innovators (cool people, often) translated into acceptable terms for others, and shared by Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen. That’s what makes it contagious. One thing I learned from this book that was new to me was how “tipping” may apply to marketing a book. The public health promotion material was not new, since I keep up with the research in that field for professional reasons. The principle that “dogged and indiscriminate application of effort,” as Gladwell puts it, is ineffective in making an idea or a message tip is well established in community health. A good health educator doesn’t just throw programs at a community and hope they work. Writers, however, are often urged to have a massive social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google Plus and everything else, and to get a lot of likes and shares and retweets. I think it’s meant to make a writer tip, based on the idea that if you have enough Facebook friends and enough Twitter followers, people will know your name and buy your book. I have never heard a writer say this works. Even the ones who encourage others to do it say they aren’t aware of getting new readers that way. To me this sounds like “dogged and indiscriminate application of effort.” This book has also made me think about what makes the world change, and why major social change is so slow and difficult and can take decades to tip, and yet small changes can spread rapidly. I have summarized a lot here, but such a compacted version is in no way equivalent to reading the book. Think of this as a professor’s lecture that will help you find the key points in a textbook, except unlike many textbooks this book is deeply engaging. Gladwell blends research with illustrative anecdotes in a way that keeps a reader curious and turning the page. I didn’t touch on his analysis of children’s television, teen suicide, needle sharing programs, STD epidemics, the rise and fall of crime, or other topics. You may puzzle over how these connect with trendy shoes, best sellers, and effective health promotion messages, but when you read Gladwell’s discussion of them in terms of the tipping point concept, you’ll see it all come together. He connects diverse fields of study and intriguing individuals to make an abstract idea come alive.	"
51,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2638200-bjbernis-bernis,1,"I felt very ""meh."" about this book, which I read in an applied psychology class. And BOY do I have a mouthful to say to Malcolm Gladwell. First of all, the ""Tipping Point"" term itself was a simple reiteration of other pre-existing terms such as ""the turning point,"" ""the critical mass,"" etc. Secondly, I felt it provided little new information nor was it presented in an applicable context. One can retrospectively point out the ""straw which broke the camel's back"" per se, but this in no way indicates how an individual can predict which changes those are going to be in a new situation. Yes, ""little things"" can make a big difference, but that is only because we perceive them to be little either due to a lack of knowledge or due to the inherent nature of the situation. If I owned a coffee shop, for example, a lack of electrical outlets may sound like ""one"" small thing, but the result is that people won't be able to use their computers, which results in them finding another shop with more outlets. It isn't that it's a ""little"" thing that makes a big difference, but that it's ""one"" thing that makes a big difference. The idea that ""one"" thing isn't big because of a lack of quantity does not have an effect on it's quality or importance to a specific outcome. One pound of weight can tip the scale, yes; but that's the nature of a scale. Some phenomenon naturally require a specific amount of energy to occur (boiling for example), but it isn't fair to claim that the final amount of heat is what caused the boiling. It's the synergy of all the heat involved that causes the boiling. A better book would be titled ""synergy"" and would detail how the component parts of a phenomenon are in themselves insufficient, but their combination results in a new phenomenon that could not exist otherwise, e.g. an ecosystem, machines, cellular biology, etc. To remove just ONE of the necessary items from each of these examples will lead it to cease functioning. Why this idea is better is because, although it's the same concept, it details the entirety of the phenomenon instead of focusing arbitrarily on the particular point in which things changed. Every piece of the puzzle is important, and this book glosses over that in order to make ""small things"" appear in and of themselves powerful. I also hated his book ""Blink."" I think I have a personal grudge against this guy. I'd love to box him, 6 rounds. Bare-knuckle. Fisticuff-style. On CSPAN. "
52,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/656942-david,4,"I found this book interesting from at least three different perspectives.First, there's the basic story of the book itself. It's interesting to think about how people work, and the idea that social networks have strong leverage is very appealing. Gladwell lays out the idea in a neat, coherent package, and writes entertainingly enough that I sat in the cafe and read it cover to cover (instead of just reading the first couple chapters as I'd originally intended).Second, there are many questions that come to my mind from listening to this talk shortly after hearing two great lectures on the mathematical analysis of social networks. There are clear ways to identify Gladwell's ""Connectors"" just from looking at the structure of a social network. Are there similar structural effects that would make it possible to identify ""Mavens?"" It seems like the book recommendations on Goodreads would be an interesting place to study this, because there's enough information about the dynamics (who recommended a book to whom, or in what order were reviews posted) that one could reasonably attempt to identify Mavens a priori, then try to figure out if there are structural clues about who they are. That seems much more difficult to attempt in many other networks, where the structure is much more accessible than the dynamics.Third, there is the nature of the book itself: a very popular book on a sociological topic. What makes this book so popular in itself? There are other very good books out there that discuss aspects of small-world phenomena; parts of Strogatz's Sync come to mind, for instance. I think Sync is as compelling as Tipping Point, and as well-written (better written, perhaps, in my admittedly biased view -- it shows in little ways that Strogatz is a professional mathematician and Gladwell a journalist). And yet Sync has not seen nearly the same level of popular success. I think a large part of Gladwell's success comes not just from the ideas, but from the way he packages them: the description of Connectors, Mavens, and tipping points, for example, each attached to a surprising story that the reader can relate to. Probably the fact that I'm thinking of this at all comes from reading Made to Stick so recently.In any event, it's an entertaining book. Good fun."

It validates mylifelong express, ""act the way you want to feel & soon you'll feel the way you act.

This is some serious brain candy. While reading it, you get the sense that you and Malcom are just about to solve one of the ultimate questions: why do crowds do what they do? And he does offer several valuable insights. He breaks things down very simply and establishes what to me, seemed like undiscovered first-principles of sociology. Unfortunately, the book does veer off-topic a little bit throughout and especially at the end. My only wish was that the book would have been a little more rigorous toward expounding on the first principles established in the first quarter of the book. I DEMAND A NONFICTION SEQUAL!

60,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,5,"It's official. I'm a Malcolm Gladwell fan. I find his insights brilliant, and his presentation absorbing. I didn't like this book quite as much as Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, but that may be because it depressed me slightly. I hoped, as I'm sure most of its readers did, to figure out how to apply his ideas to create epidemic popularity of my own creative efforts, (ie my writing) and my employer's (Rabbi Berel Wein's Destiny Foundation). According to Gladwell, it takes three kinds of people to spread an idea or a trend like an epidemic: a social connector, a maven, and a salesman. I'm a maven about a few things, most notably about Rabbi Wein's audio lectures, but I'm definitely not a connector or a salesman and I can't see myself transforming into either. So that was not encouraging. But Gladwell has an answer about what to do if you're not one of the three: come up with a ""sticky"" idea. Yeah, if I could do that - write something that just sticks in people's minds - it would be my dream come true. So now I'm looking forward to getting hold of his book Outliers: The Story of Success, so I can develop the persistence I need to keep at writing until I hit upon that ""sticky"" idea. Writing fanfic is just being a creative maven with someone else's epidemic idea. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I'm still hoping to create one of my own. But I can point to one concrete change this book made in my life, which is one of the reasons I'm rating it a 5. Surprisingly, it's in the area of parenting, and I wasn't even reading this as a parenting book. But if cleaning up graffitti can reduce crime in NYC, as Gladwell proves with statistics and studies, then perhaps a cleaner house will garner better behavior from my kids. So I guess I'll go clean up now. But someday, with Hashem's help, I hope I can get back to writing, too."
61,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,3,"Through his stories and the studies he references, Gladwell provide an insightful perspective about how ideas spread and reach critical mass. Of the three rules he explores, I was most interested in “The Law of the Few”, about how Connectors, Mavens, and Salesmen are the ones who start sociological “epidemics”.In the afterward, Gladwell explains that word-of-mouth has become increasingly important in the information age. There’s so much information out there that people need help sorting through it, and they look to mavens for recommendations. I’m a small business owner (a self-employed web designer: OptimWise) who relies on word-of-mouth, so this topic was particularly relevant.I also liked his point that when it comes to providing new ideas, weak ties (such as acquaintances) are more important than strong ties (such as friends). Strong ties inhabit the same “world” as we do; weak ties don’t, so they introduce us to new ideas.I found it interesting that Gladwell said that although much-maligned, Band-Aid solutions aren't bad; they're cheap, simple, and effective.I liked the heavily abridged audiobook enough that I later listened to the unabridged version. Both are narrated by Gladwell.Three RulesThe Law of the FewConnectors, mavens, and salespeople start word-of-mouth epidemics.Connectors know a lot of people and introduce them to others.Mavens introduce and provide information to a lot of people.Salesmen charismatically persuade and negotiate.Six degrees of separation doesn’t mean that we’re all linked in 6 steps, but that a very few people are linked to everyone else, and everyone else is linked through them.The Stickiness FactorChange the way you present information to make it more sticky.The Power of ContextWe’re influenced by our surroundings and the people around us.Changing the size of a group can make it more receptive to ideas.The rule of 150: most people can have about 150 ""real"" social relationships."

He zooms in on microscopic people, aspects and conditions that spread those trends. It was fascinating read full of detailed examples. In a nutshell, it's not just a book it's a place where unexpected becomes expected."
63,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4751497-tania-lukinyuk,5,"I read all Malcolm Gladwell’s books five years ago or so. So I thought. Yet, I missed this one, and it is a pity. I value non-fiction books for being clear, straight to the point and useful. Malcolm Gladwell’s books are exactly that. I generally like Mr.Gladwell’s easy and informative style, which keeps a reader engaged even through repetitions and restatements. This is already an achievement for non-fiction. The Tipping Point describes how small things become big, how fashion trends begin – in other words, how word of mouth and opinion leaders work. Book introduces the Law of the Few which suggests that certain human characters - Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen – are required to start the change. Then you need to add the message itself (the ‘Stickiness’ factor) and when it is made (the Power of Context). The book was written 15 years ago, and unlike many business books has not lost its relevance at all. Power of opinion leaders has never been stronger than today.The book does not guarantee that you will reach the tipping point with your product, but definitely provides you with practical ways there."

It was a great start to understanding why some community projects fail and others succeed :).I like Malcolm Gladwell's ideas pretty much all the time, in his other books as well. I will say something in the book's defense now, because I used to get this objection all the time when presenting our research back then. As long as you take all social theory in the way it is meant, which is as a starting point for understanding people better, and not as an all-encompassing explain-it-all macro-theory, it's great. But if you object to it along the lines of 'but people don't actually behave this way', then you don't understand what a theoretical model is, and why it should only be used as an illustrative point, without any claims of painting reality for what it is.If you want an interesting read, in layman terms, which is also exciting and fun to go through, this is a nice book for you.

71,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,4,"The Tipping Point as it applies to the classroom. I’ll first say this is a good, quick read. Gladwell’s writing style is informative yet digestible, managing to tell you facts while remaining comprehensible to the average person. I am always in respect of writers who make their abstract ideas accessible, and in terms of non-fiction writing Gladwell seems to be carrying that torch pretty well. In this book I think he presents his idea a bit more convincingly than the idea itself (put another way he’s a bit too slick, not quite academic enough this time around). For example, I’m not buying this you need three types of people to start a trend idea (seems like a clever but not convincing attempt at classification), and I think that the internet has vastly changed how the process of tracking trends works (reading about someone who calls all the cool kids she knows in different areas of the country seems outdated), but it’s still an interesting read and a commendable example for making the abstract intelligible. This paragraph offers a weak praise / knock on education, then I’ll get to classroom application. Another thing I enjoy about writing geared towards the business community is that it’s speaking to a brighter audience than books by educators. If that sounds offensive consider that over 50% of teachers graduate in the bottom 33% of their college classes. Most writing about education leaves me (sadly) intellectually wanting for more. So business books provide this, and I read these books with a lens towards the classroom. I read these books while thinking how is this applicable to teaching, and how can I use it to improve professionally?Three points jump out from this book. One is stickiness, two is context, the last is group size. Stickiness means how easily you can remember an idea. The stickier, the better. It’s another way of saying engagement. If you can capture attention slash engagement, then you get results. Stickiness. A lot of teachers focus on mastery, but their attention may be better spent on making their lessons “sticky.” Here’s what I mean. Put yourself in their shoes, would you like your lesson? Would you pay attention, take notes? Track how many students took 100% of the notes, track feedback on how they are enjoying class, capture their fucking attention, and the mastery will follow. Engage students learn, and you can accomplish greater learning by focusing on making content engaging. I am semi obsessed with ever tinkering the structure of my lessons, how long I speak versus how long I wait for responses, when certain movements should occur etc. The lesson from this book is minor tweaks to presentation, simply moving certain things around or adjusting your wait time per your audience age, can lead to excellent results. Stickiness. Make it happen in the classroom. Period. I’ve had trailer park thugs pumped about Shakespeare, there is no group that you cannot excite about a content if you teach it with passion. Teach with passion, insist on engagement / stickiness and that leads to mastery. Comprende?Two. Context and how environmental factors influence behaviors. Gladwell talks about the Goetz shooting in 1984 on the NYC subway, and then segments into the Broken Windows theory. The basic message is this, crack down (hard) on the little things and there will be no big things. Refuse to be called “Mr.” or “Ms.” (take it from someone who has taught in “El Profe” countries, when them youngins in America say just Mr. or Ms. they are NOT being respectful.). Crack down on the little things and there will be no big things. Being insistent on those points also leads to structure and order which (this next statement shouldn’t be controversial but many an educator disagrees with me here) leads to learning. Wait, a predictable, reliable, and neat looking setting leads to learning? Yes. Wait, having students rearrange the room to extremely picky standards, and pickup trash around the classroom helps mastery? Yes. That's a good use of class time? Yes.Three, group size. Gladwell talks about the maximum group size being 150, based on our evolutionary capacity to remember slash maintain relationships. He mentions that in school reform, a number of small schools would probably be more effective than a couple huge schools. There’s a lot to this idea. A lot. You want to make change, especially in hard area (or with a hard group such as minority males) keep the size small. I like this concept, I like several concepts in this book, so I tuck them away and put them in my intellectual quiver and when the time comes, it’ll be time to roll.Quotes:Census Bureau has defined as “high status” [noncriminal, high income earning people] – has on the lives of teenagers. He found little difference in pregnancy rates or school drop-out rates in neighborhoods of between 40 and 5 percent of high-status workers. But when the number of professionals dropped below 5 percent, the problems exploded. For black schoolchildren, for example, as the percentage of high-status workers falls just 2.2 percentage points – from 5.6 percent to 3.4 percent – drop-out rates more than double….the rates of child bearing for teenaged girls – which barely move at all up to that point – nearly double. 13Economists often talk about the 80/20 Principle, which is the idea that in any situation roughly 80% of the “work” will be done by 20% of the participants. In most societies, 20% of criminals commit 80% of crimes…epidemics, though, this disproportionately becomes more extreme: a tiny percentage of people do the majority of the work. 19The Stickiness Factor says that there are specific ways of making a contagious message memorable; there are relatively simple changes in the presentation and structuring of information that can make a big difference in how much of an impact it makes. 25Wen people are in a group, in other words, responsibility for acting is diffused. 28The strength of weak ties. Acquaintances, in short, represent a source of social power, and the more acquaintances you have the more powerful you are. 54The content of the message matters. The specific quality that a message needs to be successful is the quality of “stickiness.” Is the message – or the food, or the movie, or the product – memorable? Is it so memorable, in fact, that it can create change, that it can spur someone to action? 92 In other words, what the tetanus intervention needed in order to tip was not an avalanche of new or additional information. What it needed was a subtle but significant change in presentation. 98Sesame Street was built about a sing, breakthrough insign: that if you can hold the attention of children, you can educate them. 100[Blue’s Clues] the pace is deliberate. The script is punctuated with excruciatingly long pauses.111Commercials don’t tell stories, and stories have a particular salience and importance to young people…you teach kids how to think in the same way that kids teach themselves how to think – in the form of the story. 118An adult considers constant repetition boring, because it requires reliving the same experience over and again. But to preschoolers repetition isn’t born, because each time they watch something they are experiencing it in a completely different way. 125The lesson of stickiness is the same. There is a simple way to package information that, under the right circumstances, can make it irresistible. All you have to do is find it. 132Broken Windows theory and the Power of Context are one and the same. They are both based on the premise that an epidemic can be reversed, can be tipped, by tinkering with the smallest details of the immediate environment. That is, if you think about it, quite a radical idea. 146"
72,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"Published in 2000, Malcolm Gladwell’s The Tipping Point is the most important book of the century. Gladwell’s brand of explaining counter-intuitive studies from the social sciences, peppered with dazzling cultural details (my favourite here were the 1996 Airwalk commercials) and interviews with eccentric but compelling individuals, continues to dominate non-fiction twenty years later. Journalists, academics, and many podcasts (probably also some television shows) imitate the style and structure of The Tipping Point, even if, like the Beatles, Gladwell is never matched by his followers. The book's structure and approach are influential, and its exploration of how things ""go viral"" is still relevant. Gladwell focuses on the spread of ideas and behaviours, often referring to this dynamic as an ""epidemic."" He discusses rumours and conspiracy theories, and it's not hard to apply his ideas here to websites like yelp and to people who call themselves influencers. There is something annoying about Gladwell’s writing (“an X by the name of” appeared often enough to irritate me) and I dislike how when I look up the studies and theories he cites, I too often discover simplifications or distortions in his summaries. I am more skeptical of broken windows policing than he is here, but I'm inclined to agree with the broad point that we exist within structures and cultures that have a powerful influence on us. Gladwell has become famous, which often leads to a countervailing takedown reaction but, in this work at least, he remains underrated. My favourite idea here was channel capacity as a descriptor for limits on our ability to take in information."
73,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10505847-mary-soderstrom,4,"	How many people who really want to change the world give a good god damn what shoes the coolest teenagers are wearing? Probably not very many, which is a mistake.	The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (Little, Brown and Company, 2000, paperback edition 2002) by Malcolm Gladwell is the outgrowth of a series of articles originally written for The New Yorker. One of them ""The Coolhunt"" caused a sensation in pop culture circles when it was published in 1997, and helped win Gladwell a seven figure advance for the book. The article focused on the way fashion industry gurus track what the coolest of the cool young are wearing, and how that's translated into mainstream clothing for kids everywhere.	""A must read for any marketing professional"" says its lead review on Amazon.com, but Gladwell's game is far more subtle. and, yes, subversive. His basic concept is that ideas, behaviors and trends often go through society like epidemics, starting slowly and then flaring suddenly, non-linearly, to infect a sizable segment of the population. A few people propagate them, just as only a few carriers at first come down with a disease. What makes the difference between a full-blown change (the equivalent of an epidemic) and some adjustments on the margins of society (a few people with the sniffles) is the ""stickiness"" of the idea or behavior, how well connected and persuasive are the people passing things along, and the social context in which all this takes place. 	While many of Gladwell's examples do indeed come from merchandising, at the heart of The Tipping Point lie such tough questions as how to cut down urban crime, make schools better, and get a revolutionary message out. 		To illustrate this last point, Gladwell turns to the beginning of a real Revolution, the American one, when the legendary Paul Revere spread the word that the British were coming. Because he knew key people Revere's message rippled through in the villages around Boston in a few hours as friend told friend. When the British arrived they found armed rebels lying in wait. Another, now-forgotten rider set out in another direction, but because he didn't know whom to tell, his warning wasn't heard and the British surprised the villagers. 	Messages must also be tightly focused and tested for effect, Gladwell says: the producers of TV's Sesame Street and Blue's Clue discovered their assumptions about what reached kids were blown away once they started testing whether their educational messages were getting through to pre-schoolers.	And the social context matters a lot. Taking examples from industry, religious communities and military history, Gladwell argues that groups no bigger than 150 are the best size for setting up ""epidemics"" of positive change. A major conclusion he draws from this is that if we want to ""develop schools in disadvantaged communities that can successfully counteract the poisonous atmosphere of their surrounding neighborhoods."" building many small schools might be better than building large ones.	It's no accident that this sounds like a partial answer to questions raised by Judith Rich Harris in her book about influences on children, The Nurture Assumption: “How do some teachers, some schools, some cultures, manage to ...keep the kids united and motivated?” Gladwell profiled Harris for The New Yorker, and he's drawn on her ideas to come up with his own take on the Tipping Point. The term, itself, was first used in the 1970s to describe what happened in many white neighborhoods in American cities when African Americans started moving in. When the number reached a certain point--around 20 per cent in many neighborhoods, Gladwell says--the community would ""tip,"" with most of the remaining whites moving away.	In this book there's no indication that tipping points are something that Gladwell may care about a lot on a personal level, any more than there is mention of the fact that his father is a white Englishman and his mother, a black Jamaican, or that Dad is a mathematician and retired professor of civil engineering at the University of Western Ontario and that Mom's a family therapist. But all this lies behind Gladwell's readable, statistically sophisticated articles about wildly diverse i topics from the Spanish Influenza pandemic of 1918, through differences between blacks and whites in sports to why crime dropped precipitously in New York in the mid-1990s. They may also account for the mission which Gladwell has set for himself: show others how we can change the world.	But to judge from the reviews of Gladwell's book, it seems that marketing people are the only ones who have been listening. While an academic reader may be put off by Gladwell's pop psychology approach, anyone who worries where Canadian society is headed should read this book. At no point does he tell us what kind of changes we should work for, but he gives us what's necessary to start planning for change. Not the least of this is the encouraging conviction that the most modest of changes can bring about enormous effects.	Part of the variety in Gldwell's writing comes, friends say, from his great curioistiy, and quick boredome level: once he's got a handle on an idea or a topic, he's off chasing down the next. His quick, synthesizing intelligence allows him to put many disparate bits of information--sociological studies, mathetmatical ideas, police annual reports interviews with marketing people, you name it--together so that events can sbe seen in a new light. 	In the Tipping Point, he leads us through a maze of anecdote and study, stopping along the way to briefly explain statistical and epidemiaologicl concepts. The result is easy to read--and applicable in many fields. But the way Gladwell's ideas can be applied in mrketing and business, shouldn't keep people who want to make the world a better place from delving into the book for tips on how to make things, like schools work or change attitudes.

74,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8055573-louis,4,"In reading The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference by Malcolm Gladwell, I now view the world differently than before reading this book. This is common when I read his work. He opens my eyes to a different view; my attention is called to aspects of our world that I didn’t know were right in front of me. Using the model that resembles the spread of a disease, he explores “that magic moment when an idea, trend or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips and spreads like wildfire.”It’s fascinating in how he categorizes different groups of people that play a role in this process. The Connectors, the Mavens and finally the Salesmen. He looks into the Stickiness factor of a “message.” In showing examples of this in action he also touches on when and why it may fail. He shows us people that are trying to understand and control this process to sell a product of theirs, or to push for a change in our society. While interesting, I do feel it’s important (as does he) to understand how we can use this understanding for good. What is the best way to negate young people’s desire to smoke? How can what we have learned be used to reduce crime?Like his other works, it’s a quickish and easy read on a very interesting subject. He keeps the pace moving and doesn’t bog down under too much data or details. He hits that right balance to make his point and keep you engaged without wondering if you had accidentally picked up a scientific journal. "

There are a few times when his examples become a little too descriptive, thus the book loses its cadence. It's kind of like when you're talking to someone about blah blah blah, which reminds you of something else, and then you start talking about it. Then two minutes into talking about whatever you were reminded of from what you were originally talking about, you all of the sudden stop and say, ""What were we talking about?"" So, the information presented in this book is great. But sometimes his examples are a little too long, and you ask yourself, ""What was he talking about?"" I wouldn't let that stop you from reading the book. It will change your mindset on how you look at business. I would simply beware of it and prepared for it."

However, when it came to how it affects me, I can only think of how the booked talked of spreading ideas or products to a mass audience. Obviously that's what the book is about, but that isn't something I'm looking to do. I'm not looking to market ideas or bring awareness to anything on a global or even national scale. I realize I'm also being marketed to and am affected by the culture around me like the book dives into. It's a solid look into both sides of what is going on. However, Im intrigued by much smaller relationships between people and the world around us."

He talks about why Paul Revere's ride was so successful, why Hush Puppy shoes took off, why suicides and school shootings seem to go in groups, why word of mouth is so successful why you talk to the right people. Minor alternations can make a product or social situation tip (which means expands greatly) to be popular. The growth of Sesame Street and Blue Clues entertain and teach children. All sorts of interesting stuff. I want to read the rest of his books"
79,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26991877-mario-mj-perron,5,"Man did I ever geek-out on the stats Gladwell used to explain the trends of contagion. Have you ever wanted to know what makes an idea go viral? Well, there's a little magic to it, but mostly it's the secret strength of going small first. Build the followers in small groups first, they will become your connectors, salespeople, and mavens. Encourage many small groups to grow and then watch as it explodes.Of course, there's much more explanation in the book, but you'll have to read it to see it. Gladwell's writing style is easy to follow and deeply satisfying and enjoyable. I can't wait to dive into Blink next... it's on my ever growing list! But first, I think I'm ready to tackle Tribes by Seth Godin now."
80,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2095173-traci-at-the-stacks,4,Malcolm Gladwell is so smart and such an interesting thinker. I love How expands my own ability to think. He explains his process incredibly well. I sometimes lost his connections to seemingly disparate things but overall I enjoyed this one. 
81,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48613421-lawrence,5,"What an incredibly intuitive and interesting read! I’m actually going to go back and read again. There are a lot of insights given as to how trends and epidemics are started, spread, and ultimately ended. As a creative person who is constantly looking for outlets to express my creativity, this book speaks to my misguided approach of simply being creative in my own space. When actually I should be categorizing my creative strengths and to employ others to who meet the criteria to help either mature or disseminate those strengths into impactful waves of influence. This was pretty awesome. Good book. "
82,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79131617-nathan-kornegay,5,"Fantastic book about what makes an idea, product or actions into an epidemic and how little we as humans control things we think we have control over! Learn about how circumstances are much more powerful indicators of how/what we do, than “who we are”. Fascinating book that breaks down what you think you know and provides insight into what is actually happening in the world around us."

85,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13384265-moshe-mikanovsky,4,"Like always, Galdwell’s work is a great read and eye opening! Highly recommends. "
86,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31867012-kerry,4,Another great audio book by the incomparable Malcolm Gladwell. I recommend him to anyone and everyone! 
87,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80310601-hpmasih,4,"I’m about 17 years late to read this book and we often forget how freakin fast everything is changing, maybe some ideas in this book need to get adjusted and polished for today but yet not far from reality. Nevertheless the Ideas and the researches which support them are still valuable and I enjoyed learning from them."
88,0316346624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43811188-jacob-wighton,4,This book explores the idea of social epidemics. It’s filled with some really interesting ideas and entertaining anecdotes. Plenty of relevance to marketing.

I enjoyed The Tipping Point even more than Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. Both books follow the same format: using various case studies, theories, and studies to support a thesis. But I felt that The Tipping Point had a deeper impact. It seemed to have a more profound sociological message. More than being just a business or psychology aid, The Tipping Point can easily be applied to so many everyday situations. And it is written in such a way that it can be readily understood by most people even if they don't have a background in business or psychology.Gladwell is definitely a talented storyteller. But he isn't telling fiction. He wades through countless interviews, case studies, research papers, and psychological studies to present the most relevant and interesting items to prove a larger point. And he tells it all in an easy-to-read and captivating way. What could trendy shoes, STDs, religious movements, or children's shows possibly have in common? In The Tipping Point, Gladwell explains how ideas, trends, and even diseases move in similar ways. He discuses how to promote the good things (such as a brand) or reduce the bad ones (disease). He also discuses why some ideas fail to catch on or ""stick."" I always loved reading case studies in school. That's probably why I enjoy Gladwell's books so much. The most interesting cases have been plucked out and lined up in a nerdy buffet for me to ponder. The book covers such a wide range of topics (rather than focusing tightly on one area the way many similar books do) that I never lost interest.My one critic is that sometimes Gladwell gets a little caught up in the details of interviews. This usually happened when he was describing what an interviewee was wearing or the room they were in.My favorite parts were the sections about character in context and apply the ideas of The Tipping Point to social change. About the first, Gladwell sites psychological studies about how a person's character is a much more fluid thing than we usually want to think. Just the word ""character"" indicates something rock solid and stalwart. But when you think about it, people do act differently in different situations. They behave differently around family than around coworkers or strangers. They also behave very differently in stressful situations. Gladwell said, “Character isn't what we think it is or, rather, what we want it to be. It isn't a stable, easily identifiable set of closely related traits, and it only seems that way because of a glitch in the way our brains are organized. Character is more like a bundle of habits and tendencies and interests, loosely bound together and dependent, at certain times, on circumstance and context.” Which would explain how one person can act so differently yet not be being fake. Or in the extreme, how a seemingly decent person could get caught up in mob mentality or resort to cannibalism in a dire circumstance.The latter idea about using these theories for social change was also very interesting. Small actions, such as cleaning up graffiti, can actually decrease crime for instance. Gladwell considers how small actions or ideas can be ""tipped"" one way or the other to influence anything from teen smoking rates to suicide. I really like the quote, “A critic looking at these tightly focused, targeted interventions might dismiss them as Band-Aid solutions. But that phrase should not be considered a term of disparagement. The Band-Aid is an inexpensive, convenient, and remarkably versatile solution to an astonishing array of problems. In their history, Band-Aids have probably allowed millions of people to keep working or playing tennis or cooking or walking when they would otherwise have had to stop. The Band-Aid solution is actually the best kind of solution because it involves solving a problem with the minimum amount of effort and time and cost.” Don't underestimate those Band-Aids!This review fulfills the ""Nonfiction Book"" category of the Popsugar reading challenge. http://www.popsugar.com/love/Reading-...
