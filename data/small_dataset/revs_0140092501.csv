Instead he focusses on giving a poetic account of the scientists who first stumbled on it -- and their great surprise and their struggles form the narrative crux of the book.While some may say this makes it a less informative book, for me this made it one of the most intriguing non-fiction books I have read. Gleick's way of telling the stories makes the reader share in the wonder and incredulity of each pioneer as he stumbled upon this hitherto unguessed truth of nature. Each stumbling step, each misguided attempt and every remonstration expected in such a new endeavor is traced out in loving detail and these scientists come alive as insecure dramers daring to step beyond the realms of the possible. Gleick makes heroes out of Mandelbrot Benoît and the others and weaves an otherworldly charm around their ideas. This made the book pure poetry for me.The amazing pictures and illustrations and the quotes accompanying each chapter all add to the feeling of reading an art text book rather than a science book. And this ultimately was the real achievement of Gleick in writing Chaos - He manages to convey to us that this is the first foray of science into the realm of art - not just of explaining art but of being art. But ultimately none of this is going to be the lasting impact of this book. The reading pleasure and the hero worship of these daredevils is transient after all. For me, the real impact is that it has changed the way I look at the ordinary everyday world - the leaves, the trees, the pebbles, the pattern on the peels of an orange - everything is strangely magnified and beautiful now. I see the poetry of constant motion and evolution everywhere and I can feel the science of Chaos intuitively as I take my long walks. I can see Strange Attractors and Fractals and unstable equilibriums in the most mundane places. And this is the greatest gift of the book.P.S. Don't miss out on the exhaustive endnotes. They are indispensable."

The force living just beyond the push. I'm not alone. Many of my favorite authors (Cormac McCarthy, Thomas Pynchon, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe) and musicians (Mahler, Beethoven, etc) all dance around this same wicked fire. This burn of the natural world, this magic of the unknown, is what draws me to read physics and philosophy as an absolute amature. There are pieces and fractures in these books that actually DON'T escape me. They hit my brain and spin and keep spinning forever. I imagine this is something felt also by Gleick, one of the top tier science writers out there. My big grievance with this book is it falls too short. His narrative is compelling, yes, the stories are interesting, sure, but he doesn't grab the central characters as well as a new journalist like John McPhee does. He floats too far above the actual science and complexity. He shows you pictures and dances around the pools of chaos and clouds of complexity, but never actually puts the reader INTO the churning water or shoots the reader into energized, cumuliform heaps. This is a book for an advanced HS senior or an average college Freshman. It is pop-science and definitely has its place. This is a book that is more about translating the story of the science (not the science) for NOT the layman, but really the lazy layman. That is probably one of the reasons it did so well. Anyway, I'm glad I read it, but just wish it was deeper, thicker, and way less predictable. "
2,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"I'm totally in love with this book. Like, totally.Why? Because it GETS ME, MAN.Just kidding. I'm not anthropomorphizing a breakthrough in science. Although, if I was, I'd DEFINITELY be cuddling with this stream of seemingly random information that keeps repeating in regular ways, forming order from seeming chaos.Give me a seed and I will make you a universe. Or one hell of a trippy fractal.I think I'll leave butterflies out of this.Small changes affect great extrapolations. Our physics generators in video games relies on this. So do aeronautical research, weather forecasts, stock market prediction, presidential elections and the resulting public outrage, and the fluid dynamics of my creamer swirling in my coffee. Not to mention galaxy formation, fingerprints, shells, coastlines, or the thing that made the little dinos get the upper hand in those movies. :)Truly, though, this book does a great job at explaining and giving us the unusual history of the science that brought pure mathematics out of the clouds and back into the real world, dealing with our observable reality. Newton was okay for some things but all these new equations describe just HOW little uncertainties can create huge chaotic messes... and still be reduced back to first causes. :) Neat, huh? I'm totally stoked by these bad boys. Of course, we're all, yeah, we use those equations all the time now and it's old hat, but not so long ago, they were totally in left field and none of the big boys wanted to play with them.So, yeah, it's like a total paradigm shift, man. I'm FEEL'N it."

It sounds terribly difficult, but really it isn't. This book gives a wonderful explanation of the Butterfly Effect - one of those ideas in science that everyone thinks they know and understands, but that generally people have upside down and back to front.I really do like popular science books, particularly if they are well written, relatively easy to follow and don't leave me feeling like I've been looking over an abyss for hours. Gleick never makes you feel this and takes you through some very difficult concepts with care and assurance. A wonderful guide through what would ordinarily be a very difficult and frightening landscape."
4,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,5,"This book, over two decades old now, is one of the great classics of science popularization. It was a blockbuster bestseller at the time, and it's still well worth reading, a fascinating, enjoyable introduction to one of the most important scientific developments of our time--the birth of chaos theory.One of the compelling features of the chaos story is that this scientific breakthrough wasn't a physics, mathematics, chemistry, astronomy, or biology breakthrough; it was all of them. A mathematician turned meteorologist, Edward Lorenz, builds a ""toy weather"" on what's still a fairly early computer in the early 1960s, and in working with the parameters, concludes that long-term weather forecasting is doomed--a simple deterministic system is producing unpredictable results. Mitchell Feigenbaum, a theoretical physicist at Los Alamos in the early seventies, and two other scientists working together independently of him, are working on the problem of turbulence and.discover that it doesn't, as anticipated, build up gradually in an orderly manner. Reach the tipping point, and there it is.Beloit Mandelbrot, an IBM mathematician working with an equation that produces fractals, arrives to give a presentation to an economics class and finds ""his"" equation already on the board; the patterns he's found in pure math also apply in economics, the reproductive rates and numbers of animal populations, and countless other places.In each field, also, the initial work was most often either resisted or ignored. Precisely because chaos was popping up all over, with just a few people in each of many different scientific fields, it was easy for scientists in any field to notice a paper or presentation, note the fact that is was completely different from the methods, logic, math that had relevance for their own work, that much of the work was in fact being done in other fields--and dismiss it. For new doctoral students, there were no mentors in chaos theory, no jobs, no journals devoted to chaos theory. It completely upended ideas about how the natural world worked. It was heady, exciting--and much harder to explain than to demonstrate. Much of what the first generation of chaos scientists did is incredibly easy to demonstrate with a laptop computer today--but most of these chaos pioneers were working with handheld calculators, mainframe computers with dump terminals and limited and unreliable access for something so peripheral to the institution's perceived mission, computers whose only output device was a plotter.Gleick very effectively conveys the science, the excitement the early scientists working on it felt, and the challenges that faced them.Highly recommended."

I'm moving the rating up a bit after my re-read (on audio) because it wasn't that bad, although I still think it's a bit overrated.-----------------------------------------------------------James Gleick's Chaos is possibly one of the most overrated books ever written. The first two pages are quite good, before rapidly declining to dullness and staying there. The content consists of a few badly written half-biographies, a few pretty pictures and vignettes of science, and no worthwhile mathematics whatsoever. The result is neither interesting nor informative."
7,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52763346-farhana,2,"My interest in chaos theory and butterfly effect has been purely philosophical. I guess the idea of alternate reality always intrigues me. May be fueled by its implication in popular culture, movies, or books. First time, when I read Ray Bradbury's ""A Sound of Thunder"", I was really moved by the idea how something very small might eventually affect something greater at later phases.I also like two scenes from movies, one from ""Mr. Nobody"" that rain scene which washed away the address : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOCoJ...And the car accident scene from ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldoHL...And I have one favorite comic story ""Daytripper"" which depicts so many alternate deaths a man can die in his life. Actually, really we never know, how many alternate lives we are living every time we have been able to cross one of the busy roads successfully ! I know this implication of butterfly effect in popular culture is often erroneous. Because it's almost always impossible to know what factors actually tipped off a particular system. But there are always chances that changes in initial condition might accumulate into something different. Or they may not - maybe things happen inevitably. However, we have no way to learn! And somehow I have developed my own version! I don't know when I started this thing, quite unconsciously, I guess. From time to time, on rare occasions, I would form a binary event tree of life and would try to figure out the initial events that accumulated into current condition of life. Obviously, there is no way to know! And obviously I am not trying to figure out what else could have happened! Maybe I am just trying to figure out the initial conditions of a Hidden Markov Model with life's current visible outcome. It's kind of fun! And there is no fixed rule. And you would always end up with a different answer based on where you decide to stop! You could stop looking for answers at personal level or at an impersonal level. It's just fun! However, apart from all these philosophical implications about life, I really wanted to learn a bit of science behind chaos theory. This is my 2nd attempt at this book almost 2 years later and the book is still uninteresting as it was before. I believe this is one of the most ""overrated"" books out there. The book is hugely popular, always comes at first when you are looking for recommendations about chaos theory books. So, first time I really had doubts about myself. I thought maybe I am not doing justice to this book. I still had my doubts this time. So, I spent substantial amount of my time behind this book. And I think I have done enough and cannot do anything more for this book. This is not actually a science book on Chaos thoery, rather a scientific history book about people who worked on Chaos theory. Bits of biographies from here and there and merged in little chapters which actually don't tell you anything useful/ informative about the science of chaos theory. The book is not rigorous at all! And it's really a disappointment! That's it."
8,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4384303-brad-lyerla,2,"I enjoyed this quick read, though in the end I did not like CHAOS very much. It is a breezy history of two decades of mostly disconnected work done by a number of different researchers in widely divergent areas of science. In an apparent coincidence, a small number of unrelated people became interested in studying aperiodic, non-linear problems arising in various fields of science all at roughly the same time. Their research had not advanced very far by the time this book was written in the mid-80s. CHAOS was probably a little premature. It came too early which is reflected in the imprecision and shallow quality of Gleick's discussion, which can be frustratingly confusing at times. In any event, there is no reason to read it now. It is out of date. I picked it up now, only because it has been on my shelf forever and I have long meant to read it. It was very successful with a general audience back when it was new.I don't know if the leading thinkers on the subject would agree with this, but 'chaos theory' feels like a narrow slice of 'complexity theory'. For an elegant and comprehensive discussion of complexity theory, read Stephen Wolfram's ground-breaking work A NEW KIND OF SCIENCE published a decade ago and still making the news. It's the real deal."
9,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6020795-jim,4,"When reading science books, it's difficult to know whether what you're reading is current or not. Gleick's book was first published in 1987, so I imagine by now there have been many developments and modifications to the ideas and theories presented here. That being said, this felt like a good introduction to the early history of scientists' efforts to understand and explain nonlinear systems and the apparent chaotic behavior observed in natural and man-made systems.If you haven't studied science or mathematics beyond the basics taught in U.S. high schools, this book will be a challenge, but if you have an understanding of equations, geometry, and scientific research methods, you should be able to understand everything Gleick discusses here.I enjoyed this investigation of the order underlying what we perceive as disorder, especially fractals. If I had the time, I'd like to run the calculations myself, as they seem within the reach of anyone with a laptop. Maybe this summer.... "

11,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44824883-paul-e-morph,4,This was an interesting read. As much about the history of chaos theory and the scientists who pioneered it as the science itself. Contains the obligatory Jurassic Park references (in case you were worried).
12,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80316998-howard,4,4 Stars for Chaos: Making A New Science (audiobook) by James Gleik read by Rob Shapiro. I find it fascinating to see how science is progressing. Such a new idea is changing the way we look at the world.
13,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6332218-bruce,2,"This book was a disappointment. The author spent too much time in repeating the same terminology and concepts like 'strange attractors' and 'sensitive dependence on initial conditions' and not enough time making it tangible by using real examples that would have made it more meaningful. For instance, what does chaos theory/nonlinear science mean for weather forecasting, predicting asset class returns, crime statistics, economic growth, timing of natural disasters? The author mentions these concepts but without going into lucid examples of what chaos theory implies for them. Because of this, I found the book frustrating - both too complex to really grasp, and too superficial to really provide useful insight into the concept.In fairness, there was a long gap where I put this book down after having read the first half, so I recognize that I lost the continuity of the narrative. And maybe, just maybe (highly doubtful!!)I'm just not smart enough to get it. Still, a whole lot more could have been done to illustrate the application and implications of the subject. I also didn't care for the tone of the brief profiles of the various physicists and mathematicians - it felt like name-dropping to me.The few things that kept being used as examples were the motion of water in a stream (fluid dynamics), or air tubulence. The most interesting chapters were the final two, about the possible application to physiology and then a summary of the concept. Maybe those should have been the first two chapters. "
14,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13682064-donna-woodwell,5,"When this book came out in the late 80s, I remember eating in the college cafeteria while my physics teacher and fellow students chatted about this mysterious thing called ""chaos theory."" When I finally picked up my own copy, I wished I'd read it sooner. The mathemetics of chaos (and order) has literally remade our moder world. From weather prediction to materials production to medicine, there's not a realm of technology that hasn't changed with our new understandings of the patterns that connect us all.Though a popular science book can only gloss a highly technical subject, Gleick does it well. But I found this book even more engaging for the narrative tale of a moment in history -- a virtual paradigm shift in mathematical thought -- that happened in our lifetimes. It's a case study in political factions and egos, sometimes cooperation and always wonder at seeing the world in a new way."
15,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,2,"Not so much a new science as an old obsession of a few mystics... :(Gleick gives an unorganized overview some fun mathematical concepts like fractals, strange attractors, and chaos theory.But he exaggerates the importance of these topics, presenting them as a holistic revolution in physics, overthrowing reductionism, which just isn't the case.The last chapter was incomprehensible hippie mysticism, then the book just ended leaving me wondering what the whole point was.It seems to me like this book represents a time in history before people had gotten accustom to handling complexity and information theory in computers. Having grown up with a computer, I found most points argued in this book painfully obvious common sense."

23,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172572-lemar,5,"“The only things that can ever be universal, in a sense, are scaling things.” That idea is at the heart of James Gleick’s book, and if you zoom in, there it is again!  Gleick is great at capturing the excitement of new discoveries, mainly be introducing the quirky contributors who wouldn’t shut up, play nice and stay in their lanes. These men and women crossed academic disciplines of math, physics. biology and meteorology (is that a thing? oh, sorry) because the seeming chaos they all encountered in real life situations started showing eerily similar patterns. “They had an eye for pattern, especially pattern that appeared on different scales at the same time.”  So what’s so exciting that a person should read this whole book? It’s optimistic and trippy! Newton’s depressing 2nd law of thermodynamics, which says ‘well eventually we’re all fucked because everything cools off and moves inexorably toward disorder’ is not the whole story. In that dissipation new forms are born. “Pattern born in amid formlessness: that is biology’s basic beauty and it’s basic mystery.” “Of all the pathways of disorder, nature favors just a few.”  It’s life on the edge, on the boundaries, where “chaotic and near chaotic systems bridge the gap between macro-scales and micro-scales, chaos was the creation of information”, “randomness with its own underlying order.” So in place of Newton’s death spiral, (sorry Newt) which btw gives no insight into how order, life, people got appeared in the first place, Chaos Theory reveals that, “at the boundary, life blossoms”!The ambitious move to use math in describing irregular shapes like leaves or human arteries meant going beyond the bounds of math that worked only on the kind of nice clean polygon shapes that, actually, never occur in nature. This is nonlinear geometry. It turns out that math, which has hinted that it is the pathway to understanding (insert name or concept here) when used in nonlinear geometry, equations that iterate rather than resolve, that math is on the fruitful path because, “odd shapes carry meaning.” “Evolution is chaos with feedback.” - Joseph Ford, a quote Jimi Hendrix might have dug. I suggest putting on some Jimi and a video of the Mandelbrot fractal set. There’s meaning there. And, not coincidentally, it’s fun! "
24,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42757570-chaitanya-sethi,4,"4.5 starsJames Gleick's Chaos is an introductory text that takes you through the development of this field of scientific inquiry from its origins to its current state in 1987, when the book was written. To be fair on Gleick, this subject feels so vast that one doesn't know where to start and how to start talking about it. With that in mind, this is a brilliant effort in *trying* to make a relatively new subject accessible to a large audience.At 300+ pages, it is suspiciously dense. I could only read 20-30 pages at a go, even lesser sometimes. So what works against it is that the language isn't as easy to follow as it could have been. For those who don't have a background in Science, it will be hard to follow as it employs technical jargon that it could not avoid. Some descriptions and concepts are written in a dry manner which makes you lose interest.Why am I ranking it a 4.5 then? Well, firstly for ambition. It does an appreciable job of introducing a fascinating idea. It is successfully able to spark joy about the subject. Secondly, it treats the scientists involved (over 200, as mentioned in the notes) as people and not just prodigies. It is able to highlight the ups and downs of charting a new field. Thirdly, for what it emphasizes - that knowledge, and discovery of knowledge, is an iterative process that builds on itself over years and years of effort. That Science doesn't exist in a vacuum, in labs and equipment. It may be understood there but it exists in the world around us. In the sky above, the water dripping from the faucet, the heart beating over a billion times just to keep you alive, the snowflake forming as it falls, epidemics withering and boosting populations. It exists as complex behaviour in simple systems, as simple behaviour in complex systems. Generations of human curiosity birthing knowledge.It's hard to call a book eye-opening without coming across as cheesy or over-the-top but this subject really makes you look at the world with a fresh eye. It's not an easy read and by all means, I will immediately move to other resources to understand this topic better. But to be able to spark that curiosity - that is an achievement in itself. For that, it deserves to be read."
25,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,5,"Wow, this book was epic! Chaos can be a tricky concept, but author James Gleick writes in a very effective way; conveying complicated ideas in an easy-to-understand manner. I can only imagine how difficult this book would have been to follow, if it was plagued by the long-winded and dry writing that befalls many science books... Thankfully, it does not. The author relates conceptually complicated ideas in an easily-accessible style. Gleick conveys the importance of Chaos early on: 
""The most passionate advocates of the new science go so far as to say that twentieth-century science will be remembered for just three things: relativity, quantum mechanics, and chaos. Chaos, they contend, has become the century’s third great revolution in the physical sciences. Like the first two revolutions, chaos cuts away at the tenets of Newton’s physics. As one physicist put it:“Relativity eliminated the Newtonian illusion of absolute space and time; quantum theory eliminated the Newtonian dream of a controllable measurement process; and chaos eliminates the Laplacian fantasy of deterministic predictability.” Of the three, the revolution in chaos applies to the universe we see and touch, to objects at human scale. Everyday experience and real pictures of the world have become legitimate targets for inquiry. There has long been a feeling, not always expressed openly, that theoretical physics has strayed far from human intuition about the world. Whether this will prove to be fruitful heresy or just plain heresy, no one knows. But some of those who thought physics might be working its way into a corner now look to chaos as a way out""
Chaos theory has been instrumental in modelling. Before chaos theory, engineers were unable to model things like friction and turbulence, instead using perturbation theory.Gleick talks at great length about the founding of chaos theory and the butterfly effect, by meteorologist Edward Lorenz.
""One day in the winter of 1961, wanting to examine one sequence at greater length, Lorenz took a shortcut. Instead of starting the whole run over, he started midway through. To give the machine its initial conditions, he typed the numbers straight from the earlier printout. Then he walked down the hall to get away from the noise and drink a cup of coffee. When he returned an hour later, he saw something unexpected, something that planted a seed for a new science.THIS NEW RUN should have exactly duplicated the old. Lorenz had copied the numbers into the machine himself. The program had not changed. Yet as he stared at the new printout, Lorenz saw his weather diverging so rapidly from the pattern of the last run that, within just a few months, all resemblance had disappeared. He looked at one set of numbers, then back at the other. He might as well have chosen two random weathers out of a hat. His first thought was that another vacuum tube had gone bad. Suddenly he realized the truth. There had been no malfunction. The problem lay in the numbers he had typed. In the computer’s memory, six decimal places were stored: .506127. On the printout, to save space, just three appeared: .506. Lorenz had entered the shorter, rounded-off numbers, assuming that the difference—one part in a thousand—was inconsequential.It was a reasonable assumption. If a weather satellite can read ocean surface temperature to within one part in a thousand, its operators consider themselves lucky. Lorenz’s Royal McBee was implementing the classical program. It used a purely deterministic system of equations. Given a particular starting point, the weather would unfold exactly the same way each time.Given a slightly different starting point, the weather should unfold in a slightly different way. A small numerical error was like a small puff of wind—surely the small puffs faded or canceled each other out before they could change important, large-scale features of the weather. Yet in Lorenz’s particular system of equations, small errors proved catastrophic.""
Gleick continues on with explaining fractals, and talks at great length about The Mandelbrot Set:
""The Mandelbrot Set is the most complex object in mathematics, its admirers like to say. An eternity would not be enough time to see it all, its disks studded with prickly thorns, its spirals and filaments curling outward and around, bearing bulbous molecules that hang, infinitely variegated, like grapes on God’s personal vine. Examined in color through the adjustable window of a computer screen, the Mandelbrot set seems more fractal than fractals, so rich is its complication across scales. A cataloguing of the different images within it or a numerical description of the set’s outline would require an infinity of information. But here is a paradox: to send a full description of the set over a transmission line requires just a few dozen characters of code.""
The Mandelbrot set:He also dives deeply into strange attractors, Universality, and many other related topics. All super-interesting and highly informative!I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in chaos theory, or even the sciences in general. It is exceptionally well-written, researched, illustrated, and delivered."

It was hardly their fault. Living in the age of slide rules and tables (or before), they can't really be blamed for focusing on phenomena that were predictable, linear, and led to stable outcomes, and ignoring those that seemed too noisy, erratic, and error-prone to be represented with an equation.Yet, as the age of computers dawned, it became clear that the ""noise"" in many natural systems wasn't error at all, but held its own elusive underlying order. The feedback loops in these systems would magnify initial discrepancies over time, but they would also perform a sort of self-correction, giving rise to repeated patterns and patterns-within-patterns -- similar, like the shape of clouds, but never exactly the same. It's now apparent that this complex dance between coherence and instability, between the macroscopic and the microscopic, drives many of nature's most interesting phenomena, from the branching of blood vessels into smaller ones, to how particles of smoke curl around each other, to the way a snowflake's shape reflects its journey through the atmosphere. Human consciousness itself seems to be an example of a chaotic, endlessly self-referential system.Chaos, the book, though written in 1987, still does an excellent job of connecting the discoveries that opened the door to Chaos Theory. Gleick introduces us to figures like Edward Lorenz, whose work in weather prediction revealed that tiny differences in input in even simple mathematical models could lead to vast differences in output over time; Robert May, who discovered chaotic patterns in population dynamics; and Benoit Mandelbrot, now considered the father of fractals. Along the way, he touches on fundamental concepts like strange attractors, fractal dimension, bifurcation, complex boundaries, and the Mandlebrot set (whose astonishing visual representation you've seen if you’ve set foot in a poster shop in the last 25 years).This is one of those books I'd recommend to people who already have some familiarity with the topic. While its purpose is introductory and there's little math, per se, I think the underlying profundities will be more obvious to readers who have taken a college-level math course or two or three. That disclaimer aside, I found Gleick's writing articulate, and seldom had much trouble visualizing what he was talking about, even listening to the audiobook. It's worth having the print edition on hand for the pictures and diagrams, but if you don't, the internet should suffice.Despite being 25 years old, Chaos remains an invigorating read, offering a sense of discoveries and inventions yet to be made, and demonstrating that separate fields like physics, chemistry, biology, information theory, computing, cognitive science, climatology, and economics aren't as separate as we might think. As bonus, a 2000s-era afterward in the audiobook provides a brief update of progress in some areas since the book's original publication, and some thoughts on its cultural impact."
29,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1653329-gayle,3,"Although I truly enjoy the way James Gleick can take a complicated subject apart for the inexpert, I did not enjoy this book as much as I did The Information. I caught myself skipping, counting pages to the end of the chapter, even yawning and dropping off. Not a good sign for me. Some chapters had me on the edge of my seat, or thinking ""Ah ha! That's how that works."" The overall sense that chaos has a sometimes deeply hidden pattern (that applies to all things) is interesting, but I didn't need to be told that over and over.It is obvious that Mr. Gleick enjoys the subjects that he writes about and it is difficult to not become affected with his enthusiasm. However, in Chaos, his excitement about the subject, tends to cause him to wander, attempting to get every single detail in that he can. When the first sentence of a chapter tells you that so-and-so showed up at the front door of someone's lab, I like to know who that person is and why he might be there fairly quickly, not 10 pages later. By that time I'm rereading pages thinking I must have missed who this person is and why he's standing at the door of someone's lab. I've also forgotten whose lab! Overall, I did enjoy the book and will probably watch for more by this author. But  The Information is my favorite so far."
30,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12698787-trav,3,"More a biography of an idea than an explanation of a theory.Gleick's examination of the emergence of chaos theory is well written, and relatively easy to read (relative when one compares it to the technical and academic articles on the subject upon which he draws). However, his focus is not so much on explaining the theory of chaos than on telling the story of chaos's transition from the fringe to the mainstream. In this, his work is an excellent complement to Kuhn's work on the The Structure of Scientific Revolutions upon which he draws heavily.Though I would not call the book ""exhilarating,"" as the reviewer from the London Review of Books apparently thought it was, but it was a useful introduction to the subject pitched at the mathematically aware non-scientist reader. You could not put the book down believing you now understand chaos theory, but you should have a better idea of its relevance, basic tenets, and, most importantly, where to look for a more focused examination."
31,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672076-jake-leech,5,"Absolutely astonishing. There were times reading this book when I felt giddy. Part of it was the writing; I'd expected a book on chaos theory to be either dry, or daunting, or too smug, but this was quite straight forward. The other part was the subject matter itself. I'd heard of chaos, and that it had some relationship to fractals, but I'd dismissed the chaos part as pop-math and didn't really understand the link between chaos and fractals.Instead, the book was very accessible, and the subject really amazing. At times I felt like a college student who has some philosophical idea for the first time, and it's mind-blowing (even though other people have hashed out the idea quite thoroughly). The only let down was that, after describing very well what chaos is, and the idea of universality, Gleick really fumbles on the link between chaos and the Mandelbrot set. It was pretty easy to look up online, but that might not have been the case when this book was published.I'd definitely recommend this, especially for the first few chapters, if you've heard of chaos and fractals and would like to get a pretty good introduction to them."

Not because he gave bad information, but because chaos is a lot more difficult to prove in any particular case, especially outside of the physical sciences, which he does not reveal. This could have been because back when it was written a lot of researchers assumed the applicability of chaos theory to any thing that smelled of it. It takes experimental evidence to show that chaos theory fits the particular phenomenon under study.I did lift the Mandelbrot set equation from the book, and went on to developed a computer program which produce fractal art with it. Some of the images were actually shown in juried art shows."

It's another journalist writing about mathematics, though this one anticipated the Wikipedia Age by two decades. While he does exhibit a fair degree of sloppiness (``unbounded'' is not a synonym for ``infinite'', ``infinite'' does not mean ``quite big''), Chaos actually isn't all that bad as a fairly shallow introduction to chaos theory. It's not what I was looking for, but exactly what I expected, and a complete layperson could realistically enjoy it."

If one is keeping up with physics for last decade or so, the content of Chaos doesn't offer anything new. With the introduction to chaos theory, Gleick gives a wide variety of historical anecdotes involving various scientists across borders and scientific disciplines who have observed the phenomenon but haven't been able to nail it. Chaos brings these stories together and puts them under an umbrella. The narration becomes easier to follow and the scientific disciplines converge."

From that perspective, the book served me well. It also gave me a fresh perspective to the look at the world around me with the lens of chaos. At the same time, I feel that this book is for people who are well versed with science and mathematics beyond the high school level, and have a basic understanding of non linear systems. Wish the author would have explained the math a little bit instead of just glazing through it. But hey, you can't have everything. The chapter about Mendelbrot Set in has sent me through the rabbit hole of Set Exploration on YouTube, and a few bizzare but fascinating philosophy."

38,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/693262-huyen,3,"in the spirit of chaos, JG writes this strangely attractive book in an unpredictably aperiodically chaotic fashion, I never understand the messy structure of this book. sometimes he follows through the development of an idea very thoroughly, sometimes he randomly introduces something and then moves on to another guy who seems to be totally unrelated to the previous guy. There's not enough math for my liking and too much rambling about the scientists rather than what they actually did. Although I still like this one a lot, I think I've read better books on chaos theory. Chaos theory started with Poincare's investigation into the three-body problem when he realized that no exact formula exists beyond Newton's differential equations for making predictions of the three body problem. Not much was taken up from there till the 1970s, when the computer revolutionized this new field of mathematics, allowing mathematicians to do complex iterative calculations and do experiments. chaotic dynamics started to emerge everywhere, in fluid mechanics, population biology, climatology, theoretical physics, astronomy and even economics. Non-linearity can no longer be ignored. This might well be another revolution in science, like quantum mechanics and relativity half a century earlier. It's difficult to summarize this book, but some remarkable and thought-provoking statements to take away: ""An almost-intransitive system displays one sort of average behavior for a very long time, fluctuating within certain bounds. Then,  for no reason whatsoever,  it shifts into a different sort of behavior, still fluctuating but producing a different average. [In climate models:], to explain large changes in climate, they look for external causes-changes in the earth's orbit around the sun, for example. Yet it takes no great imagination for a climatologist to see that almost-intransitivity might well explain why the earth's climate has drifted in and out of long Ice Ages at mysterious, irregular intervals. The Ice Ages may simply be a byproduct of chaos.""""The phenomenon of chaos struck me as an operational way to define free will, in a way that allowed you to reconcile free will with determinism. The system is deterministic, but you can't say what it's going to do next. The spontaneous emergence of self-organization ought to be part of physics. (quote Doyne Farmer)""Any object can be tiled by a fractal shape. ""Fractal shapes, though properly viewed as the outcome of a deterministic process, had a second, equally valid existence as the limit of a random process.Nature must be playing its own version of the chaos game. The Mandelbrot set obeys an extraordinarily precise scheme leaving nothing to chance whatsoever. I strongly suspect that the day somebody actually figures out how the brain is organized they will discover to their amazement that there is a coding scheme for building the brain which is of extraordinary precision. The idea of randomness in biology is just reflex. (Quote John Hubbard)""Many other scientists began to apply the formalisms of chaos to research in artificial intelligence. The dynamics of systems wandering between basins of attraction appealed to those looking for a way to model symbols and memories. Their fractal structure offered the kind of infinitely self-referential quality that seems so central to the mind's ability to bloom with ideas, decisions, emotions, and all the other artifacts of consciousness. With or without chaos, serious cognitive scientists can no longer model the mind as a static structure. They recognize a hierarchy of scales, from neuron upward, providing an opportunity for the interplay of microscale and macroscale so characteristic of fluid turbulence and other dynamical systems.""and his brilliant joke""Theorists conduct experiments with their brains. Experimenters have to use their hands, too. Theorists are thinkers, experimenters are craftsmen. the theorist needs no accomplice. The experimenter has to muster graduate students, cajole machinists, flatter lab assistants. The theorist operates in a pristine place free of noise, of vibration and dirt. The experimenter develops an intimacy with matter as a sculptor does with clay, battling it, shaping it and engaging it. The theorist invents his companions, as a naive Romeo imagined his ideal Juliet. The experimenter's lovers sweat, complain and fart."" "
39,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul,2,"Another personality-driven popular science book, about as I expected. This seems like a good way to build up hype around chaos to get people to get interested in figuring out what it is, but I feel like I do not understand chaos and its implications any better now than when I started, and I think that the use of sort of vague language to describe fundamentally mathematical concepts is probably misleading.Even if I didn't get an understanding of the mathematics involved, I'm also not sure he's gone into so much detail about how chaos and nonlinear dynamics might be used. I don't think some of the ""weather is completely unpredictable 3 days out"" stuff really jives, to me, with the attractor stuff in the later books. It seems more like Gleick was trying to position chaos as a crazy anti-establishment movement outside of science rather than looking at studies of nonlinear dynamics as a new tool in the toolbox of modern scientists, which doesn't help me get a view of how it might be useful. I'll do some more reading about Chaos theory in general - maybe if Gleick got some of the descriptions of math dead on I'll bump this up to a 3-star rating, but I'm not optimisitic."

Today I finished a cover-to-cover reading (including a 2008 afterword by the author) and it was pretty darn good.The book begins and ends with Edward Lorenz, a weatherman who understood why we can't have long-term weather forecasting. Along the way we touch on Mitchell Feigenbaum and his constants, and Benoit Mandelbrot and his fractal dimensions. Utilizing computers to plot what early mathematicians and physicists suspected was a fantastic breakthrough.The last few chapters cover some of the fascinating ways an understanding of nonlinear systems translates to cardiac arrhythmia, eye movement and crystallization. The newer afterword barely touched on these, and I want to read more on how the math was applied to these and other facets of modern life (and perhaps quantum mechanics?). I would especially like to read more on turbulence.Highly recommended for the history and background of this most compelling mathematical work."

Engineers have fooled ourselves by linearizing things for so long. We've basically pretended nonlinear responses are linear, so that we can deal with them. It turns out there is some extremely surprising and interesting behavior which is predictable in a general way, even if unpredictable in an exact way, that we've overlooked up to the last decade or so when Chaos as a science began to yield so many interesting results. It's really important to understand the whole butterfly effect thing, that even very simple and well-defined nonlinear systems have long term behavior that's basically unpredictable because even miniscule differences in initial conditions (differences too tiny for us to measure) can quickly snowball into large scale macro phenomena. It's one reason why the future is unknowable (in our current understanding of physics.)"

His use of short, attractive chapter titles like, “The Butterfly Effect”, “Inner Rhythms”, and “The Geometry of Nature”, gives testimony to the man's successful attempt to keep it simple.If you really want to at least partially peel back the mysteries of the world in which we live, this book will do just that.The author finishes up his book with great supporting information in end notes and he makes his work easily accessible with a well constructed index."

Gleick dives into the discovery and emergence of Chaos Theory and understanding, and through that, you learn what makes up Chaos Theory and what it is. I'm glad I picked this up to listen to on my drives to and from work. Even zoned out, I was able to follow along and not feel lost.The pictures weren't described in audio, but I was able to go back to my paper copy every night and leaf through.

The process of chaos theory, developed from weather through to biology, is outlined clearly and generally accessibly.

He had a very high regard for this book and states it had a tremendous influence on him.For me, I had to struggle reading this book. This introduces the field of Choas and presents the story and anecdotes of about 200 scientists who were involved with Choas. It's a challenge to present a cohesive story when someone is dealing with 200 investigators. I felt frequent disconnects between one paragraph after another. I could not follow the trail of the story, and in fact, I wondered if there is any story at all here. The book tries to lay a case that even after understanding Classical physics, and Quantum physics, the scientists discovered new ways to reason about nature using non-linear equations which depended upon the initial conditions. The later part, the system of non-linear equations which depend upon the initial conditions is called as the Chaos Theory.I noted down the following interesting quotes from this book.“John Hubbard, exploring iterated functions and the infinite fractal wildness of the Mandelbrot set, considered chaos a poor name for his work, because it implied randomness. To him, the overriding message was that simple processes in nature could produce magnificent edifices of complexity without randomness. In nonlinearity and feedback lay all the necessary tools for encoding and then unfolding structures as rich as the human brain.” “The Mandelbrot set obeys an extraordinarily precise scheme leaving nothing to chance whatsoever. I strongly suspect that the day somebody actually figures out how the brain is organized they will discover to their amazement that there is a coding scheme for building the brain which is of extraordinary precision.

This book sets to explain the underlying complexity of nature with the details of application in weather forecasting, fluid dynamics, biological systems,economic modelling,communications and practically every other field that uses physics and mathematical modelling. It is quite an engaging book detailing the challenges and the experiments that went into everything from the Butterfly effect,scale calculations, Mandelbrot fractals,Self-similarity illustrations, phase transitions,information theory to the physiological systems where giant strides in the field have helped uncover and provide possible explanations for conditions earlier unknown.By exploring feedback mechanisms from the complex dynamic systems of the body these realistic mathematical models have been able to recreate abnormal conditions and in the process have provided a lot of information at the microscopic and macroscopic levels.It is a great read on how the advent of the science of chaos has changed the perception of the world around us.It reads more like a fiction adventure,unputdownable.

Chaos was such an earth-shatterlingly big field that it apparently allowed people to become ""polymaths"" once again, teaching university level biology, economy, maths and engineering pretty much all at the same time. The book will keep you in its grip since the ideas it's presenting are relatively simple and quick to graps but their consequences are far reaching.Pretty much the only two issues I had with it were the date of publication - come on, it's past time for an updated and vastly extended edition for my reading pleasure - and the fact that I believe the only woman that makes an appearance is the authors mother, who is thanked for reading the manuscript in the acknowledgements.

The book has some fascinating history in it and effectively communicates some general ideas about chaos. However, I believe the book gives some specifics that would be easier to understand had I taken more advanced mathematics courses- as my degree is in English in Linguistics, I’m sure you can work out how far I went in math. It also helps to have a decent understanding of climate/ meteorology, though I didn’t struggle with that element.

I don't know much about poetry, but like a good NP-hard problem, I think I might be able to verify that something is excellent poetry were it to smack me in the face, ideally repeatedly but not regularly, like an aperiodic pendulum about to enter a Chaos boundary perhaps. This book is poetry of the highest caliber. 1. The language is beautiful, evocative, and even the chapters, anecdotes, and theoretical layers are organized with a (purposeful or intuitive) view to meter and rhythm; 2. That nebulous quality of 'soul' which separates it from prose, the scientists are 3-dimensional (+0.5 fractional dimensional since all of their fates and epiphanies are so incestuously interleaved) humans with motivations and personality which add emotional depth to the science they helped create; 3. Metaphor: Across the book are some quotes talking about how numbers are metaphors, representational reality, the metaphors that help us perceive things we otherwise don't see. This book is packed with metaphors that can just directly be applied as mental models to unpack, comprehend, and even see for the first time, so many real-world situations. I daresay a huge portion of 'what if X is like Y' posts on r/Highdeas or r/StonedThoughts can somehow find a 2-degree of separation link with this book; 4. Truth: The Goethe prism experiments are a great reflection of this book itself, a high-minded intellectual pursuit of philosophical holistic truths rather than neat, correct, explicatory science. There are some subjects that lend themselves easily to sounding profound, spacetime, quantum physics, consciousness, infinity math, and of course turbulence. But it takes a certain poetic excellence to focus the jaw-dropping philosophical multitudes contained within any single concept from these subjects, and the vertiginous possibilities hang as equal parts abyss and stormcloud inside every discrete concept in this book (phase transitions, energy-mediated turbulence, periodicity vs stability vs chaos, fractional dimensions, self-similarity, attractor diagrams, iterated functions and differential equations, topology manipulations).NotesAlong with relativity and quantum mechanics, chaos theory is part of the 3 nails in Newtonian physics’ coffin, all in the 20th century. Von Neumann thought complex dynamical systems had points of instability where intervention could have a large impact - like a ball balanced on a peak. Thought computers could model it.Lorenz guessed the link between aperiodicity and unpredictability, that weather/epidemics/populations follow rhythms that seemed to defy pattern and therefore forecast.Weather forecast after 7 days is useless because of the butterfly effect, this is necessary because otherwise as soon as the system approaches steady states it will not deviate. Sensitive dependence on initial conditions: for want of a nail.Lorenz mapping convection found some energy produces smooth circular motion (hot air rises, gets cooled, drops), but increasing heat introduces wobbles in the circle, until soon there is just turbulent behavior. Real-world applications in geodynamo magnetism, why poles have reversed.Waterwheel fills buckets. At a certain speed of spin, there is a steady state, increase speed a little and it becomes turbulent, buckets can’t fill up entirely or empty entirely, so it slows down then reverses spin, like the magnetic field. No predictable patternPeople assumed chaos was unstable, but instead Lorenz found it was stable, that outside force (like pushing a balanced ball or pendulum) didn’t take away the irregular chaotic state. Stephen Smale, Fields medal for Poincare conjecture, brought his topology background and phase space transformations to reenvision chaotic systems in phase space, squeezing, folding. Robert May studied fish populations on a logistic curve rx(1-x) modifying r. Too low and the population goes extinct. Higher and higher, and it bifurcates constantly, before becoming chaoticPopular line was “Period 3 implies chaos” because they couldn’t construct any system with regular periodicity of 3.A different way of looking at math was that equations don’t represent truth, but are metaphors. Literally, a metaphor is to equate one thing to another unrelated thing. Before, it was thought that deterministic system was predictable, and unpredictable systems were chaotic. But now it could be shown that deterministic system could become chaotic. Mandelbrot studied cotton price fluctuations and found a symmetry in scaling between daily fluctuations and long term trends. Coastline analysis. If quantity keeps changing based on frame of reference, then there is something else that is constant and can be studied, this was what he found to be fractional dimension which stayed constant. Mandelbrot compensated for lack of formal algebra with geometric intuition. Convert analytic problems to shapes, then instead of functions, transform them, alter symmetries, make them more harmonious, to come to the solutionBourbaki society in post-war France was opposite of Poincare philosophy: formal austere math without geometry. Wanted the purity of extreme abstraction.IBM had problem of random noise in transmission, overcome by boosting signal to drown out noise. But Mandelbrot found noise was fractal, periodic like Cantor dust, but at irregular periods. Use moderate signal instead, and redundancy to overcome loss, rather than uniformly boosting signal for no reason (many periods without noise). Random yet not random.In nature, there is a constant push pull. Noah effect: sudden transition, vs Joseph effect, effect persistence (paradigms and paradigm shifts?)Koch snowflake takes constant surface area, but infinite length by fractal. Same thing seen with blood vessels, lungs, biliary ducts, urinary collection. DNA can’t be coding for every single alveoli, but iterated fractal bifurcation is easy to code for.Go up close to a Talus slope and see all the indentations. Fractional dimension. All surfaces have this property, there is no perfect joint. Imperfections everywhere. That’s why broken teacup can never be put back together such that the imperfections line up.How come animals aren’t fractal collections, like an elephant is 10,000 mice, the way clouds and earthquakes are fractal? There is an element of directed design?Los Alamos Manhattan Project main problem wasn’t nuclear physics, that had already been solved. It was turbulence. Heisenberg wanted to ask god why relativity and turbulence, and he’ll have the answer for relativity. Chaos as more energy in system. Bow a violin very hard and dissonant frequencies accompany the primaries. Turbulent flow is stable but not periodic. On the attractor, the lines never intersect, infinite yet bounded by a finite box. Fractal bifurcation, separate dimension. Systems that lose energy are dissipative (friction for instance). Astronomical systems are Hamiltonian, or conservative. So no chaos? Since phase space doesn’t fold or contract and make a binding finite box? Globular clusters change scale when binary stars have outside force that knocks off one star, but conserve self-similarity. Phase transition/Magnetism not understood: there is a general trend, but each element in the metal also needs to be magnetized, where is the communication between them? Divide into many boxes, like a Cantor set, each talks to next box, iterate fractally. Quantum Field Theory needed a way to get around Heisenberg uncertainty, invented Renormalization Group Theory, where mass is not constant but changing based on a frame of reference. Like Mandelbrot’s fractional dimension, they changed mass and kept something else constant instead, making calculations possible despite presence of infinities.Goethe had a more holistic view of light than Newton’s reductionist. His own prism experiments were held upto his eye, to see that color only came when there were shadows or objects blocking pure white light. Interested in subjective experience of light, that depended on a degree of darkness, allied to shadow, to find a universal phenomenon of ‘seeing red’ Qualia?Newton’s total shot in the dark that colors were based on different frequencies of vibrating ‘corpuscles’, totally unjustified and miraculously brilliant. Lorenz asked if there is such a thing as ‘average climate’. Iterated f(f(f(x) for quadratic difference equation. Maybe climate is periodic. If not, maybe it is intransitivie, ie it has multiple equilibria but needing a push to go to next (White Earth, reflecting 70% of sunlight, is a forever-cold equilibria that computers quickly converge on. Why don’t we have it then?). Else, maybe it is ‘almost transitive’, Unpredictable, Chaotic, switches equilibrium randomly. Feigenbaum studied how parameter changed bifurcations and periodicity, found beautiful constant of geometric convergence which implies something is scaling. Blew his mind that it was the same for quadratic or trig function or anything, equation was irrelevant. If you weigh snakes and find all of them = 4.66, then weigh bears and find all of them = 4.66, you know you’ve found some constant that isn’t weight but nonetheless universal. Artists understand the irreducible boundaries between stuff. Leaves, hazy, definitive lines combine to give correct perception. Drawing of turbulent fluids. Flow is shape+time. Abstracting shape into its more platonic form, all possible shapes it can take across space or time. Goethe thought physicists only studied static phenomena, missing out on ‘transformations’.

Entire surfaces interleaving spatially.D’arcy Thompson: Physical cause Vs final cause. Physics Vs Darwin/religion teleos. Most people do either/or.

Fortunately the reader doesn't have to be math-wiz to enjoy this amazing book (although the author does sneak a few equations here and there). Basically Chaos Theory studies the behavior of complex systems that are sensitive to their starting conditions; small changes can have a large effect on the outcome. (It's a little more complicated than that but also beyond the scope of this review). Journalist and science writer James Gleick has put it all together in this highly readable ""biography"" of the theory. The roots of Chaos go back to the early 20th century with some hints as far back as the late 19th century. Gleick traces the turbulent history of this new science and the people that made it happen. For as long as we've had Mathematicians and Physicist the two sciences have been butting heads and neither side wanted anything to do with Meteorology in general. Yet it was in an obscure Meteorological journal in the 1950s that we find one of the first papers that reference this chaotic side to Nature. For me, parts of this book were a tough read with some sections that were hard to get through. On the other hand there were other parts that went very fast, but whatever effort you put into reading this book is well worth it. While exploring Chaos's history the author introduces the reader to some unfamiliar concepts like: Strange Attractors, Nonlinear Fluid Dynamics and Phase Transitions. It turns out that Chaos has strong ties to Biology, Astronomy, Geology and, yes, even Meteorology. As a matter of fact just about any science you can think of that has a complex or nonlinear problem can be studied with Chaos applications. Some of the scientist mentioned in the text may be familiar to you while others are somewhat more obscure. One that stood out for me was Benoit Mandelbrot and his study of Fractals. The book has many illustrations of fractals, some of which are in full color. It's not just science that benefits from Chaos Theory but everyday life has elements to which the math can be applied; the stock market, population dynamics, medical research, wherever there are transitions from stability to chaotic conditions. When you watch a pot of water on the stove, there is a point where it changes from orderly to turbulent and in that instant when it goes from just hot to boiling something strange is going on, something chaotic but understandable if you take the time to look a little deeper and just work it out. Chaos helps us see the hidden turmoil that lurks in the universe around us. The Second Law of Thermodynamics tells us the everything tends toward disorder, we call it Entropy. But is there an underlying order to that Chaos? How do we recognize it's calling card and once recognized, what do we do with it? Even today the research goes on and our understanding of many issues can change overnight. So hang on tight ""It's gonna be a bumpy ride"". I'm not sure how much I got out of this book but I did come away with plenty of food for thought.I had no technical or formatting problems with this Kindle edition.Last Ranger"
75,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1673830-mac,4,"I don’t tend to read many books about science – not for lack of interest, really, but because they seem to be out-of-date almost immediately after printing. So this book, originally written in 1988 about a “new” science from the 1960’s and ‘70’s, was one I looked at a bit sideways. However, it had an afterword for the 20th anniversary in there (which, of course, is now four years out-of-date), so it can’t be so behind the times that it was swept under the rug. However, since I’m very interested in complex systems theory and chaotic behavior in complex systems, but at the same time have a complete fear of mathematical equations, it turns out this book was pitched at exactly the speed I was looking for.Gleick knows that his audience is full of non-specialists, and so the focus is on the narrative of how chaos theory and its many parts arrived on the scene. Unsurprisingly, it was met with not a little resistance, especially considering the overlap so much of it had between various disciplines. Physicists should not be studying biology; mathematicians should not be studying the weather, &c., &c. Of course, if something as pedestrian as common sense were to be applied to “science” as a whole, one might immediately assume that these disciplines overlap, to a very considerable degree, in what we like to call “the world.” Biological processes are employing chemical reactions which are related to physical behaviors of atoms and all of these come together to form a complex system that does not really care whether its behavior can be described by a physicist at UC Santa Cruz or a meteorologist at MIT – it just happens. And chaos theory appears to be a solid way of understanding how these happenings come to be.Aside from the personalities and narrative histories of the chaoticians whom Gleick describes (I’m told he’s unfairly tight-lipped about several important Soviet researchers, but in 1988 that hardly seems to be his fault), we do get a solid yet non-technical explanation of the many ideas lumped within the general term “chaos” – sensitive dependence on initial conditions, strange attractors, fractal geometry, and so on. The explanations here tend to be considerably more useful than the bafflingly stupid discussion Jeff Goldblum has with Laura Dern in ‘Jurassic Park,’ and have real-world implications for how to think about all of the science we’ve ever learned in school. (Remember how everything in physics class was worked out in a friction-less environment? Well, there’s no such thing, and maybe we should actually consider that.)I didn’t walk away with any better understanding of a deterministic system or how a non-linear equation can be solved – some of the explications of these things could get a little heavy and dull, but I do feel like this is something important and exciting – it is, of course, very dangerous to make metaphors out of technical scientific ideas, but in many of these concepts that Gleick describes, you can almost feel the sense of them before you understand them intellectually. Whether you grasp all of the math or not, it’s clear that these guys are on to something."
76,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40159364-moses-hetfield,4,"EDIT (after second read)This book really changed the way I thought about the world, and I found myself thinking about it a lot over the past year and ultimately decided to read it again. Chaos theory is such a beautiful, powerful framework that allows for deterministic randomness, connecting rigorous math and science with the intuitive (but often ignored in math/science classes) idea of sensitive dependence on initial conditions, i.e. that small changes in inputs can result in vastly different outputs. After all, one can easily imagine (as many of us do) that the world could be quite a different place if a certain person had not (e.g.) uttered the phrase ""basket of deplorables"" in Fall 2016. Only with chaos theory, however, can one provide an adequate explanation for those vast differences in outcomes from a seemingly small, random event in a way that is mathematically rigorous and deterministic rather than reliant on luck.I had heard of the ""Butterfly Effect"" well before reading this book, but I always assumed it was metaphorical. It amazes me to realize that it is intended fairly literally by the scientists who developed the theory. I hope to be able to read and learn more about chaos, fractals, strange attractors, and the other related subjects addressed in this book.Original ReviewI was assigned part of this book for class and enjoyed it enough that I decided to read the rest of it as well. The subject matter is a really interesting and novel (for me) way of looking at the world through the lens of fractals and deterministic unpredictability.This book lost a star because a few of its chapters are a bit dry or not explained as clearly, but for the most part Chaos is engaging and well-written.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in math or the physical sciences who wants to explore topics that are not covered in standard K-12 math education."
77,0140092501,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34811556-bernhard-geiger,2,"The book is exactly what one of the reviews said: A good history. If you want to learn something about chaos, you will probably be disappointed. Gleick has a way of jumping around between topics that never satisfies the curiosity of the reader. To give one example: In one chapter he starts out with a story of some scientist submitting results to a journal only to get rejected because his discovery -- Julia sets -- have been discovered 50 years before. Gleick then continuous with fractality of the Newton algorithm, goes over to Mandelbrot and his set, which he developed with the goal in mind of indexing Julia sets, and ends the chapter with several nice and interesting anecdotes about fractals and their discoverers. At the end of the chapter one neither knows one single thing about Julia sets (other than they are fractal), one does not know whether Mandelbrot succeeded (and there is a relation between the Mandelbrot set and the Julia sets), nor does one know how the story about the rejected manuscript ended.To summarize: If you are interested only in scientists rather than in science, this book is good for you (it has all the famous names in it: Mandelbrot, Feigenbaum, Lorenz, Ruelle, Yorke, May, etc.). If you know NOTHING about chaos theory, then the book might give you something, too: The concepts are explained in a very superficial, non-mathematical way to give you enough material to talk about during cocktail parties. If you already know concepts like strange attractors, sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and fractality, this book might not be the right one for you (unless you are interested in the history behind these concepts)."

A must read for anyone into any of the sciences, they all apply equally well and are all a part of the history of chaos.In a nutshell, chaos is a state brought about by deterministic equations (think about that) that do not settle into an equilibrium and do not display a coherent pattern. An example frequently cited is the weather. Basically, a normal equation, like one designed to show population growth and decline over a period of time, is fed a value much higher than is practical and (under the right equations) the system does something strange, it appears chaotic, never finding equilibrium and never settling into a reapeating pattern. What follows is a journey down a scientific rabbit hole where chaos becomes a pattern in and of itself, found in all sorts of non-linear systems.Strange Attractors and the Mandelbrot set are some of the most fascinating demonstration of the result of this science. Reading this book can be enlightening, it gives you a far greater appreciation for the chaotic phenomenon we experience everyday and rarely notice. A must read."

From the coastline length concept to Mandlebrot Sets, Feibengaum constants to Lorenz attractors, Julia sets and Cantor sets, the world of non-linear mathematics that is even at the fringe of linear mathematic is deep and beautiful (literally). The concepts of fractional dimensions, bounded areas with infinite perimeters, mode-locking, bifurcations, Newton fractals - the list of new things here is staggering.A perfect book - partly because the subject was so new to me. That said, it is a subject that is at best where physics was some three millenia back. There are infinite non-linear differential equations and the humankind is perhaps gasping at the wonders of the first few dozens. This funky math begins a proper science when some part of it can at least be mapped to a single snow-flack let alone describe water flow for a few seconds or go further to cure heart diseases or predict stock prices.So all in all, the useability of this new science is likely to be limited in our lifetime but it is a must learn subject and this book along with Wiki opened a whole new world to me.

The mathematicians proved that any segment - no matter where, and no matter how small - would, when blown up by computer microscope, reveal new molecules, each resembling the main set and yet not quite the same. Every new molecule would be surrounded by its own spirals and flame-like projections, and those, inevitably, would reveal molecules tinier still, always similar, never identical, fulfilling some mandate of infinite variety, a miracle of miniaturization in which every new detail was sure to be a universe of its own, diverse and entire."" - pg. 228Here's a lecture on this book (and Chaos theory in general) given by a Stanford professor: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_njf8j...

As a forewarning: at first, I started to read this book as I'd become friends with an actual Astrophysicist for whom specializes in both Chaos and Non-Linear Dynamics. In retrospect, for the past few years I've been a bit too obsessed with String Theory to care about any other theories, but now I feel that Chaos theory is probably more so within both our everyday lives via biology, astronomy, and or within all QM on this construct we call life here in the now and or also on a whole other larger scale within everything. I might even argue that this theory has changed my mind about 'The Theory of Everything' and that of The Big Bang (for which had been faltering in my mind for a while now).On the minus side, this book and or knowledge has since ruined the silliness that was that terrible 2003 movie: The Butterfly Effect. Although the actual theory of the Butterfly Effect is now so much clearer in my mind as it doesn't just cover all that is known, unknown, and or better yet all-that is unobserved and or unobservable.Take your time when reading-don't be afraid to re-read any of this book as there are so many gems within so many pages, chapters and or ideas as a whole.

I read Gleick's book for my First Year Seminar in college. I know that many of the students in my class were put off by this book and thought it was too technical. However, I can remember two students (one of which was me) that were at least a little inspired. I went on to study physics, the other went on to study the philosophy of science. I can't speak for that individual, but I speculate that he must not have hated the book/class if that is where he ended up. At least he was scared off by it. Disclaimers aside, Chaos is an excellent record of the history of the development of chaos, covering such topics as period doubling, fractals, strange attractors, Poincare sections, and many more. It also introduces many now famous scientists such as Mandelbrot, Lorenz, Poincare, Smale, and Feigenbaum. Many others are probably referenced, but I can't recall off the top of my head.

Complex systems with applications in biology was the field where I wanted to do a PhD but ended up in some extremely experimental lab. But life is so interesting that one of my thesis committee member is doing exactly this kind of science that I wanted to do, and he is a close collaborator with Steven Smale. I told him that I was reading a pop-science book that had a lot of stories of Steve Smale, and he sent me some papers they wrote together on some type of bifurcation... :) I should read them... As far as the book goes, I think it is a little bit too descriptive, but probably perfect for pop-science book. At least I see the beauty of chaos the author tried to present in front of us and want to read more and understand more. Often times, pop-science books focus more on the biography of scientists.

The front cover had a quote from the New York Times that said ""Almost every paragraph contains a jolt."" I wasn't feeling it. But I plodded onward and kept reading, and I did start to find some fascinating stuff. Chaos theory--you know, the butterfly beats its wings in China and causes a hurricane in the US? Actually, it is more than that--a lot more. The book got into a section on fractals, and that is the first portion that caused me to perk up and take notice. I had some interesting conversations with family members about some of the things I had been reading--measurement, patterns, patterns in the seemingly unpredictable. I learned some things, even if just at a very high level, that gave me new outlooks on science. Once I hit that section and found some stuff that did seem new and exciting to me, the rest of the book was much better. The book succeeded for me in outlining how a new science has come into being--and has done so very recently."

Gleick explains even complex mathematical concepts in an accessible way, so that the reader can focus more on the way the different theories flow into one another than on the details. I am sure that some things get oversimplified (I have read amateur science books that delve deeper), which may be frustrating if you are a hard-core science-y kind of person, but it doesn't bother me one bit.Now that I have finished the book, I would say that the author jumps around a bit too much for my taste. Since he is trying to integrate studies performed at disparate times in many different places and fields, this is understandable, but it is hard to get a sense of how the field has evolved, and who is influencing whom. Nonetheless, a fascinating read that makes me wish I like math more than I do."

I found it while actively searching for some authentic content on non-linear science (if there's any written, and Voila!). Somehow, I related to those scientists whose account has been given in this book, in a manner ever-so-poetic. The linear systems and all the ideal approximations, hardly ever satisfied my intuition and curiosity, even in undergrad courses. The book is not at all mathematical. In fact, it is a compilation of biographies of scientists who chose not to follow the mainstream science, and thus went places no one else ever did before. I bet, even a layman can grasp the material of this book. Thanks to James Gleick, for not complicating the stuff, even though it advocates for non-linear dynamical systems, which are rather very complex. A rightly acclaimed work of non-fiction! "
