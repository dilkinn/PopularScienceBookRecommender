1,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7344787-arleen-jenson,2,"Coming out of pre-veterinary medicine and a slew of genetics classes, I can say that nothing in this book is particularly mind-blowing... except the hubris. The author has drawn up a laundry list of assumptions about all of humanity and left out a good deal of its subjects. As a scientist or, at the very least, as a lover of science... the references were interesting enough to keep me reading. But as someone with sexual awareness, a hesitancy to polarize gender and sexuality, and my own idea of what a woman might think or want... this was a very difficult book to swallow. In fact, it's akin to dry Kool-Aid.If you are satisfied with the hetero-normative, monogamous, anglo, male-dominated definitions of sex and partnership (and if you are going to read this book as popular literature rather than as complete and well-founded scientific conjecture) go right ahead. It's a fun book.But if you are someone who is easily irritated by flawed logic and narrow surveys used to prop up wobbly theorizing, skip it.The good news is: Ridley doesn't care. As all great scientists do, he spent a good deal of time throwing his name in with philosophers, sociologists, and naturalists and saying that he, too, was capable of flaws. Just like them! Moreover, he expects a lot backlash from the less-thans who can't comprehend the magnitude of his reasoning. So go ahead and say that you don't like his book. Ridley is one step ahead of you. He knows you're coming; you predictable sap. Despite that lovely manipulation, I still didn't like it. It gets two stars for all of the awesome material his book used (badly) and referenced."
2,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4582869-katja,2,"What could have shaped the human mind is an endlessly interesting subject, no question about that. Speculating about contributions of the genes, nature, nurture, culture is fun, as much as getting a new perspective on what has always seemed ""obvious"". Still, I did not like this book as much as I probably would, had it a bit less of sheer speculations. Some readers praise Ridley for objectively presenting to them so many different and often contradictory theories. When discussions are heated, it is indeed a virtue. But flaws in some of the ""theories"" are evident even before the argument is over, so why include those if a few paragraphs later Ridley admits that the theory does sound pretty wrong? An example: attractiveness of slender women nowadays supposedly signalizes their wealth because not every woman can afford a healthy diet. Furthermore, certain claims are given as well-known widely accepted facts while they may not even be true. One example is Chomsky's hypotheses about Universal Grammar and language innateness. It is far from true that all linguists agree with Chomsky. Pinker, whom Ridley cites a few times, surely does but there are more linguists in the world. Another example: neural networks have recently had a huge comeback, researchers have very big hopes for ""deep learning"". Obviously Ridley dismissed them as incapable of learning far too early. A few times I was wondering where Ridley got his facts from. For example, describing ""highly sexed emperors"" he states that the ancient civilizations we know of were all ruled exclusively by ruthless men with hundreds of wives and thousands of children (mostly sons). One of his examples is Akhenaten who in fact is known as a loving husband and father of a dozen of children. There are numerous depictions of him playing with his daughters. Also, apparently Ridley never heard of successful female pharaohs. His knowledge of the ancient civilizations seems to be based on a cartoon about an evil pharaoh and his poor slaves.Finally, what annoyed me most is the plasticity of Ridley's ""evolutionary"" arguments. If there is a trait which he states is characteristic of modern men, he simply says that it was obviously advantageous for males in the past. Usually he throws in a thought experiment or some bizarre example from the animal world and off to the next section and a new trait. But this is not what is needed to prove a hypothesis. First, the trait may be not as characteristic of men as he wants it to look like. For example, he says ""boys are better in math than girls"", or ""girls are better in linguistic tasks"" although even at his time there were studies showing that it very much depends on how boys and girls are treated at elementary school. In fact there are countries where girls are better in math (Iceland). Second, for a evolutionary argument to apply, there must be a gene, so why not name it right away? Third, why should this particular gene be gender-specific, why wouldn't it reveal its power in the other gender too? Wouldn't men benefit from better language skills (something he claims women are better at)? I doubt so. Finally, if the gene has not yet been discovered, why not show a mathematical model which would at least demonstrate that the benefit of the trait is real and would affect the reproductive success of its carrier. What happened with females who were not so eloquent? Were they and their children killed by better versed women? Surely I do see a benefit in being a good talker and I can imagine why this quality could be more important for women than men, but it still does not explain why this supposedly genetic trait should propagate. There is a big difference between ""soft skills"" and traits like ""fear the snakes"" or ""lactose tolerance"" for which reproductive advantage is obvious. To summarize, an interesting read but with far too many annoying errors, logical flaws and sloppy arguments."
3,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897899-jason,4,"Well, I had hoped to write this review closer to having read the book, but I'll write this anyway, just without some of the examples I was hoping to remember.Roughly the first 1/2 to 2/3 of the books covers the different explanations for why sex arose and the mating habits of various non-human species. One thing that is great about this book is it will relate a theory, then an insufficiency in the theory, then a counter theory, then additional findings, and back and forth and so on. If there isn't a consensus it just leaves the question open and for you to ponder yourself. For anyone interested in how science is done, numerous examples ideas blossoming, be attacked, rediscovered, etc. are recounted. Also, lots of different case studies are recounted. All the stories of different species behavior is entertaining in and of itself.In the last part of the book, humans are closely examined. As long as you repeatedly the disclaimer at the beginning of that section, that you may be able to say something about males are more X on average and females are more Y on average, but individual instances of men and women, of course, may run counter. Also, that evolution has primed certain tendencies for each sex, but tendencies are not fate and thus, again, you can only talk about averages or generalities. If you remember that, and don't get your undies in a bunch, the discussion of how human nature is/was shaped by evolution is illuminating.So I recommend this to everyone, especially those interested in how the brain works, how people work, and/or how science works."
4,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/802619-bree,1,"This was one of those books that I bought because I was sucked in by the title and the cover. Plus I thought, hey that's kinda out of my comfort zone, I'd like to push myself to read something new and possibly difficult to understand.I couldn't make it past the first chapter, so I read the end in hopes to find what his conclusion is and its we are all apes in the end. I find that rather depressing and quite hard to believe. I find it hard to swallow that we are only biological animals who are driven only by the need to find a way to better our species by sex with those chosen for their perfection. I look at all we create and imagine and I see so much more than that. He does grant that we are creative, but still underneath it all we are just creative apes. We are such a diverse species full of such hate, but also so much beauty. We can be blindingly compassionate and also completely clueless and self absorbed. There are so many variations that it is hard to explain them all through sexual Darwinism.I probably missed something there in the middle, but if his conclusion had been less crass maybe I would have been driven to read more of what drove him to that conclusion."
5,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28781546-ana,2,"This is really well written, but I just can't really wrap my head around the themes of sexuality in this book, especially as it concerns the idea of gender. Also I don't really trust men of science who can write things like ""boys are better in math than girls"" or ""girls are better at linguistic tasks"" as if they are universal truths instead of biased theories."
6,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6956062-nikolas-alixopulos,4,"I enjoyed this book and recommend it highly. Some may see it as a cynical view of human nature, however I found it to be an engaging and convincing one.  My favorite quote from this book sums up the totality of the text for me: ""...the choosiness in human beings in picking their mates has driven the human mind into a frenzied expansion for no reason except that wit, virtuosity,inventiveness, and individuality turn people on. It is a somewhat less uplifting perspective on the purpose of humanity than a religious one, but it is also liberating. Be different."" "

How much more generous it would be if, instead of writing parables about childhood wounds, psychologists were to accept that some differences between the sexes just are, that they are in the nature of the beasts, because each sex has an evolved tendency to develop that way in response to experience.
The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature is a very accessible book. It is easy to read, follow and understand. After reading this book, you will never look the same at a cheating spouse, a woman who had plastic surgery or a rich man."
8,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Ridley throws a lot of interesting hypotheses at the question of why there is sex & why/how we indulge without ever coming to a firm conclusion & admitting such. I liked that since I didn't find a lot of the studies or statistics he referenced too convincing. This is more a book with points to ponder rather than a definitive text. He writes this at the end of the book, Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong. The history of human science [in this regard] is not encouraging. But he goes on to quote Hume & mention how far we've progressed since his day. We're just not there yet & may never be since we're so good at deceiving ourselves.It's well worth the time to read. There are some good insights into why we act the way we do & I really liked his opinions on the differences in children of different sexes. I've long been angered by the way the education system treats boys & girls the same. They're not & his point that nurture & nature shouldn't be seen as polar opposites, but as part of a process was very well made.Table of ContentsPrefaceONE: Human NatureTWO: The EnigmaTHREE: The Power of ParasitesFOUR: Genetic Mutiny and GenderFIVE: The Peacock’s TaleSIX: Polygamy and the Nature of MenSEVEN: Monogamy and the Nature of WomenEIGHT: Sexing the MindNINE: The Uses of BeautyTEN: The Intellectual Chess GameEPILOGUE: The Self-domesticated Ape"
9,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,3,"I might have rated this more highly if I hadn't just come off a spate of reading very similar and slightly better works that incorporate much of its content in pithier form (Daniel Dennett's Darwin's Dangerous Idea and Steven Pinker's How the Mind Works, though those were both written afterwards), yet its central metaphor of sexual selection as arms race is compelling enough that I finished it alongside the superior Dennett and Pinker books anyway. The ""red queen"" of the title is derived from the famous character in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass who at one point tells Alice that in her world, you have to run as fast as you can just to stay in place. Life is similar, in that hard-won evolutionary advantages are obsoleted almost instantly as competitors adapt to keep up - the book is about how sexuality is used both on a macro level between species, as a gene-shuffler that can provide a leg up over parasites and asexual organisms that are forced to evolve a bit more slowly; and on a micro level within species, as males and females choose different game-theoretic strategies to maximize reproductive fitness. Obviously we're most interested in human sexuality, so the book does not disappoint in its exploration of titillating topics like adultery, incest, homosexuality, polygamy, promiscuity, age differences, dimorphism, fashion, and communication, with plenty of comparisons to analogous behavior in the animal kingdom. There's also plenty of pages on whether all this exciting behavior is due to nature or nurture, which I did not find to be as well-written as Dennett or Pinker's very similar sections in their books (strawmen start popping up in conjunction with loaded subjects like feminism, though this happened somewhat in Pinker's book as well); readers who aren't idiots will be unsurprised that Ridley falls into the sensible ""it's both, to some degree, depending on what you're talking about"" camp. I found the red queen idea to be a an illuminating metaphor and I enjoyed Ridley's take on sexual selection, even if as a work specifically on evolutionary biology it didn't rise to the level of Richard Dawkins' The Extended Phenotype, which I consider to be one of the best books existing on the subject, but since I read it right next to books that seemed to recapitulate most of its insights in fewer pages I'm not sure I would recommend it above either. It was a better-written treatise on human sexuality than your average porn, though, that's for sure."
10,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21906020-mark-colenutt,5,"Matt Ridley was educated at Oxford and is a journalistic scientist, which means he is able to translate the more complicated scientific breakthroughs and understandings to the wider public in a clear and succinct manner.Almost anything he has written, including his Guardian articles, are worthy of a reader's time. This particuar publication is a mind blowing look at evolutionary biology from the origin and end game of sex in our cultural and genetic lives.There are many books on this topic but few are as concise or lucid in description as this one. I have read it several times and my copy is smothered in annotations making it impossible for me to lend it to anyone.If you have ever questioned our bizarre mating rituals and the differing obsessions and motivations of either sex then this is the serious read that your questioning mind requires to set it at ease. However, just as one set of questions is answered you will only go on to formulate even more interrogatives but at least this time round they will be more meaninful inquisitions.This should be mandatory reading at schools for more mature students."
11,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5662520-davytron,2,"I really wanted to love this book. It was a fun and at times thorough overview of human sexuality. I do have some complaints about it, however. First, the author seemed extremely out of touch with society and came across as a very typical privileged white male in his views. It was painful to read sometimes when he'd go on about how women can do whatever they want these days with no limitations! Painful. Second, I especially disliked his lambasting of feminism as being completely wrong due to some feminists choosing to adhere to stricter ideologies than others. He never says something like ""Some feminists demand that men and women are equal"" but rather says something along the lines of ""Feminists demand that all men and women are equal."" He spoke in very finite terms even though the subject matter at hand should have been very context specific. He breaks down one extreme feminist view and then laughs from atop his phallic ivory tower without considering that feminism is kind of huge, dude. He didn't even bring up equity.Third, his chapter on sex differences (he used gender and sex interchangeably which I also didn't agree with) was a bit finite - he probably should have included the concept of degrees of difference rather than straight up black and white differences. Or maybe talk about ""in the most extreme cases, the differences may appear as follows"" kind of thing.Fourth, Ridley would get on a roll and introduce some cool ideas and then end the chapter. Sometimes the next chapter would carry on but I found myself really confused at the often abrupt halts and pauses in the discussion. It made for a choppy read at times and made it difficult to understand some concepts. Granted, not all concepts are entirely understood in science either but it still made for a difficult read. He included many basic and refuted arguments for the sake of breaking them down which often more than likely didn't need to be included. He also simplified some really complex ideas to the point that they sounded ridiculous. ""All linguists agree with Noam Chomskey"" haha nope! Nope they certainly do not. I found the book challenging because I had to disregard a lot of my ideas about culture in regards to human nature. Ridley is very keen on explaining that there is no nature without nurture (duh); but, he came across as harsh on people who leaned slightly more toward the nurture side and he didn't do it as effectively as someone like Dawkins would have. Even with my complaints, though, this was definitely an interesting read and I feel enlightened (and slightly emasculated due to the polarity of the sex/gender chapter). Check it out! (2 stars). "
12,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422276-mag,0,"I like Matt Ridley, but I’ve read this book too late. It’s been 15 years since its publication, and it’s too long for the science to be still groundbreaking. There is absolutely nothing in it that is new to me. Moreover, some of it feels already outdated and a bit too authoritarian on many issues which we now realize will have to be updated. Hence no rating.Ridley is intelligent enough to know it himself, too. I had to smile at his own comments on the book. ‘Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong. The history of human science is not encouraging. Galton’s eugenics, Freud’s unconscious, Durkheim’s sociology, Mead’s culture-driven anthropology, Skinner’s behaviorism, Piaget’s early learning, and Wilson’s sociobiology all appear in retrospect to be riddled with errors and false perspectives. No doubt the Red Queen’s approach is just another chapter in this marred tale.’Having said so, I have to add that the book is very well written and that majority of ideas are no doubt sound."
13,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12186085-david-joseph,1,This was like being in a work release program with an educated half-wit.Very questionable reasoning throughout.
14,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3136056-juan-pablo,4,"As I was reading the first chapter, I kept thinking I was embarking on something written by a geek giggling at the word ""sex""; I don't think I was entirely wrong, but if there was any giggling from the author at the mention of sex, it was for truly fascinating reasons.I disliked the first chapter: anything titled ""Human Nature"" in this day and age seems preposterous. I kept on reading, nevertheless, hoping I'd find salvageable bits from this.I was absolutely enraptured by chapter three, at which point Ridley was on his way in the dissection of one of the most fascinating concepts I've ever encountered. The first chapter was an overture, I'll stick to saying not particularly well written, but should just be understood as such; the opera begins in chapter two.Mental experiment: Say you have four people, two of them a couple, male and female, who reproduce sexually, and the other two asexually reproducing females (it's called parthenogenesis, bear with me). They reproduce, what do you have? The couple has one offspring, the asexuals have one each for a total of two offspring. Asexual reproduction seems to be twice as efficient as sexual reproduction, so, why sex?Because it's fun, some might say, but this book, which kicks off with the sex enigma, provides far more informative analysis of the matter, which has been a mainstay in evolutionary biology. Turns out parasites have a lot to do with this evolutionary device...Remember the Red Queen from Lewis Carroll's wonderland? She runs around but never gets anywhere because the world moves along with her. Well, that's where the title of the book and the name of a fascinating concept come from. A host and a parasite are entangled in a Red Queen situation, where the faster evolving parasite succeeds as he breaks the host's defenses and the host succeeds when he prevents the parasite from doing so, thus running but never getting anywhere because of the changing situation. This may be referred to as an arms race as well in military imagery, but I feel the absurdity of Carroll's character makes Red Queen preferable.This Red Queen concept, and I'm sure wikipedia will do a much better job of explaining it than me, holds sway in many of evolution's questions and beyond. Ridley is witty and entertaining in his exposition, creating a truly eye-opening experience in this book for anyone with an interest in the ideas that shape our understanding of the world around us and ourselves. The book explores evolution via sexual selection, never missing illustrative examples along the way, and does a fair job at presenting the different views that have historically shaped how science understands sex and its consequences.Ridley used to be science editor at The Economist, which leads me to believe adds to the conciseness and clarity in his writing. Throughout the final chapters of the book, he delves into human nature, having gained much credibility from the writing that preceded them. His treatment of such a debated subject is incredibly illustrative of the many forces usually ignored by the disciplines that usually deal with such a subject, and provides us with an extensive look at how evolution and the Red Queen can inform.I think I'll be coming back to this book many times from now on in my thought and in my understanding of everything around me."
15,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies,4,"This was an interesting exploration of the reasons for sexual reproduction in many organisms, as well as then discussing the science with relation to human sexuality and sociology. Ridley makes good thorough use of a broad range of research findings in the area, discussing these with (mainly) even-handedness and a breadth of illustrative examples. The central theme relates to the importance of sexual reproduction in protection from disease and in best perpetuating our genes. It's an educational and readable book, full of useful facts and insights - I would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject.Unfortunately for me, I found some of it hard going because much of the science was stuff I already knew about from my college and university education, and previous books I've read on the subject. I've read other Matt Ridley books before, and he seems to have honed his skills in later books - at times this got slightly bogged down and lacked pace and direction in the slower sections where I thought too many examples were given."
16,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"I learned a lot from this book.The thesis is that much of human intelligence is a result of a sex-selection arms race.As a background, we are asked basic questions like, ""why sex""?Ridley does a good job quantifying this question and providing an honest, if uncertain answer.The short answer is, the perpetual arms races with viruses and parasites makes sex worth the cost.That cost can be as large as the Peacock's tail feathers, or the giant human brain.In the case of the human brain, the battle of the sexes has resulted in an organ that is also directly useful for survival.Language and logic, according to Ridley, are byproducts of a brain suited for outwitting the opposite sex.There is much ado about cuckoldry, cheating, harems, etc.All this is actually quite disturbing, even for a dispassionate scientist like myself.But Ridley does a commendable job of disclaiming any moral interpretation of the science."
17,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122235--uht,5,"My God, I loved this book. Extremely accessible, yet very substantial. I don't think I can ever think about sex or human nature the same way. I feel that this is one of those seminal books that a person can't go back from.And it certainly does make it strange to go to a party and watch all the humans hooking up."
18,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7133444-sandra,5,"Excellent review of science (theories and methodologies for determining causes) of sexual reproduction, that passes the test of time (originally published in 1993!). Highly recommend. I will likely re-read this again.This book is far superior to Sex at Dawn: The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality. They are often paired and compared, even though they are not, and should not be considered to be, in the same category: The Red Queen is how proper science is done, while Sex at Dawn is a theoretical piece that provokes attention and satisfies readers' interest for reasons that are not purely scientific. It is important to maintain that distinction."
19,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/697412-jessica,2,"This is Evo Psych masquerading as hard science. It is sometimes dense and technical, sometimes defensive and condescending. There is some well-researched science, some reasonable observations, and some logical conclusions, but they are so inextricably tangled with sweeping generalizations, correlations misinterpreted as causations, and ambiguous data presented as certainty as to render the whole mess too annoying to read. I gave up with about 70 pages to go. Life is too short, and surely there is some more recent and more thoughtful writing on this topic by now. "
20,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/910324-trina,5,"an exposition of the basic idea that 'man is a self-domesticated animal', only far more interesting and accessible than that sounds. matt ridley tackles the question of why human beings reproduce sexually- you'd think the answer'd be 'because it's fun!', but you'd be wrong- when in the race for genes to reproduce themselves in mass quantities, asexual reproduction is more efficient and a more certain success, numbers-wise. the general answer has to do with parasites, and with the idea that like alice in wonderland's red queen, who is always running but staying in the same place because her surroundings are constantly moving too, creatures are locked into an evolutionary arms race where the sooner you evolve a defense, the sooner your enemies evolve a method to crack that defense, etc. etc. we have only to read the thousands of horrifying recent articles about new strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria cropping up everywhere to understand intimately that this red queen hypothesis makes sense and what it means for us.from establishing the red queen as the basis for sexual reproduction, ridley goes on to attempt to explain the existence of a universal human nature through the lens of the effects of sexual selection on evolution. we think our lives and natures are determined by our free wills, but what if free will itself is an evolutionary ploy? or, what if evolution, instead of pitting species against species for resources and survival, is actually a vicious competition between members of the same species- like between men and women, for example? he discusses everything from why men universally prefer young women, to the standards of beauty that govern young women's lives, to why monogamy- and subsequently, adultery (as well as the strictures against it)- is the preferred organization of sexual couples the world over. he also covers the long and colored history of polygamy in humans, and compares the way we organize our lives with how our closest relatives the apes organize theirs, as well as flies, pheasants, mice, and all manner of distantly related beasties.i'm not doing justice to the beautiful complexity of this book, but i enjoyed it a lot and felt that i learned quite a bit too. it is well paced to ensure the understanding of even the most scientifically-deficient reader, i think, and he establishes his hypotheses so well that each chapter feels very common-sense and revelatory. also, being somewhat of an amazon at times, i got a lot of laughs from his constant assertion that males are not useless, and in fact they serve such and such service which he would then elaborate upon. he assumes- and assumes that we assume- that males are an aberration, or a waste of genetic space, because they well, kind of are? genetically speaking, that is, and without factoring in the usefulness of sex and genders according to the red queen hypothesis. good stuff. i also appreciated being exposed to the idea that, contrary to what our moralizing society would like us to believe, many of the things that make us well adapted to survival and reproduction are not things that make us good or even basically decent people. and i liked that he makes that clear while also making it clear that just because something is 'natural' does not mean it is right or inevitable, and that our laws, which have evolved along with us like anything else, can be upheld and followed even in the face of our own natural impulses- towards violence or sexual injustice, for example. the idea of 'change without progress' is one that flies in the face of our onward and upward modern mentality, but all it takes is a quick look around at our complicated lives and the manifold ways we've fucked everything up or failed to properly understand anything in all the years we've been 'making progress' to intuitively know that while the red queen may not be the entire explanation for why we are the way we are, it goes a long way towards an answer, one untainted by our 'reason' or morals or politics."
21,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7075573-shellie,4,"The Red Queen theory stems from the Queen in Alice in Wonderland who runs and runs but stays in the same place. She never gets any further because the world is moving with her. Genes change their locks to combat parasites and parasites make new keys. They prey is always one step faster that the predator. “Sex, according to the Red Queen theory, has nothing to do with adapting to the inanimate world—becoming bigger or better camouflaged or more tolerant of cold or better at flying—but is all about combatting the enemy that fights back.”Genes are programmed (by who?) to replicate and mutate, so Ridley calls them “selfish.” And he talks about gene crossovers and then genes that are able to shield themselves from crossover, but more and more I’m thinking that this just proves even more that the genes aren’t what is thinking or strategizing. Yes, much of it is trial and error-- make enough keys and you’ll eventually fit one in a lock. So keep making different keys, but somebody is writing this key-making program.Ridley concludes that if genes are selfish and their top goal is to reproduce and ensure the survival of their strand, then why is there even the need for a male of a species?Now we get to the sex part. Many plants are hermaphrodite or multi-gender and some of these hermaphrodites’ genes “try to destroy their male parts. Male-killer genes have been found in more than 140 species of plants.” And so to prevent this runaway train full of “selfish genes” from derailing, some really smart overseer gene (Creator?) starts creating nuclear fertility restorer genes. Cool.And did you know that quite a few organisms out there have virgin births? And that bacterium can determine the gender? That not all animals have sex chromosomes and that lemmings have three sex chromosomes?“The Red Queen is at work. Far from settling down to a fair and reasonable way of determining gender, nature has to face an infinite series of rebellions.”As one who believes in a Creator, I took this book on to learn more about sexual selection. I did not pick it up to get into a creation debate. Funny, then, that I found the facts provided to be further evidence for my belief in God.I do believe in adaptation, survival of the fittest and genetic mutations and I appreciated the numerous studies about parasites, fungi and humans. However, when the author quotes Richard Hawkins in passages like this, “As life emerged from the primeval soup several billion years ago, the molecules that caused themselves to be replicated at the expense of others became more numerous.” CAUSED THEMSELVES? Okay, okay, they replicated, but where did the primeval soup come from? How did it cause itself? Anyway.. “Then some of those molecules discovered the virtues of cooperation and specialization, so they began to assemble in groups called chromosomes to run machines called cells that could replicate these chromosomes efficiently” and so on—“the chromosomes then discovered that several kinds of cells could merge to form a supercell, just as villages began to group together as tribes. This was the invention of the modern cell from a team of different bacteria. The cells then grouped together to make animals and plants and fungi—“ WAIT, WHAT!?! CELLS THAT ARE REALLY JUST MOLECULES THAT DISCOVERED HOW TO COOPERATE THEN DISCOVERED HOW TO CREATE SOMETHING AS COMPLICATED AS PLANTS, ANIMALS AND HUMANS !?! NOW, THAT IS A STRETCH THAT I CANNOT BELIEVE! Look at an armadillo, a sand dollar or The Grand Canyon and tell me there is no Creator!Funny, how science has to exist in the absence of a powerful creator-scientist.Great scientific examples in the book despite the religious-bashing."
22,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,4,"I didn't give five stars because I found this book something of a slog in the beginning.To make his case, it's necessary for Ridley to give an account of what has been found true of animal behavior before moving on to relate it to the most familiar animal, man. These accounts of the sex lives of birds and mammals and so on are rather dull to me.But stick with it! The book gets more interesting until it becomes absolutely fascinating with the chapter ""Sexing the Mind"". From that point on I was hanging on almost every sentence. The conclusions the author reaches are surprising, enlightening, exciting, because they are so reasonable in view of the evidence for them.The idea that prompts the title is drawn from the Red Queen, a character in Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, who must keep running faster all the time just to keep up. Evolution demands the same.The natural environment puts demands on every living thing. The most demanding thing for animals that have separate sexes, is for each sex to keep up with what the other wants - sexual selection.We can't reproduce by ourselves, so we must be able to come together with at least one member of the opposite sex to provide a future for our genes. The success of the individual in doing this determines his/her influence on future generations - what they will be like, how attractive they will be. Thus, each sex is in a contest with others of it own sex in being the most attractive to the opposite sex. It's a race that never ends.The parallels between other animals and man are remarkable. Just as remarkable are the unique characteristics of man. Why do we have such huge brains for our body size and so intelligent? Whey are we so accomplished in music and the arts and even sense of humor? Why do we have such a highly developed consciousness? Why do we have two sexes when other forms of life may have many more, or no sex, or both sexes on the same individual? Why are we monogamous and are we necessarily so?The book is driven by the question - ""what is human nature?"" - what is it that defines us, that we have in common with each other regardless of our individual differences?The Red Queen is going straight to my bookshelf because I know I will want to read it again. I just wish it were available on the Kindle so I could use the wonderful note-taking feature of that gadget.I shouldn't forget a warning - Ridley is no fan of the social sciences. If you think culture makes us what we are, you won't find any support for it here. He's got no time for Margaret Mead or B.F. Skinner and Freud, though he had some good insights, was off to outer space with his theory of the unconscious oedipal drive. For Ridley, evolution is in the driver's seat."
23,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6468380-taylor-pearson,4,"An interesting book about human evolution, and the sciences around it. I read it for the first time maybe ten years ago and found it just as thought-provoking the second time around.Evolution is a process of survival and reproduction, but most evolutionary theory focuses on the survival side of things. The Red Queen argues that, in fact, the action is on the reproduction side of things.This book offers a take on how sex, not survival, has been the primary driver of evolution, and more importantly, what drives sex. It's well written, with a bit of humor and lots of great stories."
24,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"This was an absolutely fantastic book. I love this author! The questions posed in the work are terribly to the point. Why do we have two sexes? Why not perform Asexual reproduction as many plant species do? What are the genetic, and social functions of sex from an evolutionary standpoint? I remember wondering about this very thing when studying botany in college. How did we evolve to be a diplontic species? (I want to be a dikaryotic fungus by the way... yes I did go there). Basically if you love biology and genetics this book is going to be a rollarcoaster of fun. "
25,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,The payoff in this book is in the last 1/3rd of the book. The beginning is really really dry and academic. The theories are fascinating and some were mind-blowing. Ridley himself admits that they are just theories and probably half of them are wrong. But it's just a fascinating way to view human behavior through sexual selection and evolutionary advantage.
26,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4176715-mckinley,1,Since this is a science book it is troubling that this doesn't follow the scientific method. Frequently topics are not developed logically leading to confusing and odd sentences. Some interesting propositions -- read for a lark.

29,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1033111-liz,2,"This was the July selection for my bookclub, and came highly recommended at a talk that one of the members went to. However, I really didn't like it and it set off my ""wishful thinking"" meter throughout. There is very little hard data about genetics included in the book. While there are interesting studies referenced about the mating habits of different birds, we don't have many studies done on the evolutionary mating habits of people. That is called evolutionary psychology, and most theories included in that area are not widely accepted and considered to be highly speculative. The author seems to choose theories that fit his viewpoint, and ignores others. I'm not an expert in many areas that the book covers, but I have taken many courses in language development and linguistics. The chapter on language development is occasionally just plain wrong, and facts are blatantly misinterpreted. The author marvels at how when an infant first labels a cup, they ""instinctively know"" that all different kinds of cups are cups, and they don't have to be told. Completely ignoring the fact that 1) before a child starts saying a word, they have heard it 1000's of times and 2) a child who has a dog in the house will call ALL furry animals ""doggy"" until corrected. The cup over-generalization is not corrected by the parents, but the doggy one is. You can't use the cup example and ignore that the same things happen in areas where the child is wrong.Also, the author uses Chomsky's 1950's theory of a ""language organ"" in the brain that is used for language development regardless of language, and reports that the theory ""is widely accepted by linguists."" This is just wrong. Not only is the theory of a ""language organ"" not widely accepted, Chomsky himself has revised the theory. The author referenced a 1957 book by Chomsky and ignores a later work from the 1970's. The book was in 2003, and I don't really feel there is a good excuse for only finding older work by an author.While I recognize that it is not really possible to be an expert in all areas, you can get chapters proofread by people in those fields. Also, when he is wrong, either in error or deliberately, in an area that I know very well, it's hard to accept anything that he says is true. He put facts in about language development and linguistics and they were selective, not analyzed and are not accepted by experts in the field. How am I to know that he didn't do it else where?"
30,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,4,"Would you like to more thoroughly understand why people are the way they are and why they do the crazy shit they do? If so, this book would be a great place to start. It's one of those ridiculously insight inducing reads. It's also one of those books that you absolutely can not judge by its cover. Or by its first and last chapters. Curious? Than by all means read on. One of the things that put me off of the book (before I actually read it) was the title The Red Queen. I'm dreadfully embarrassed to admit that I assumed it had something to do with menstruation. Not that there's anything wrong with menstruation. I just wasn't particularly motivated to commit a decent chunk of my ""one wild life"" to a long form exploration of that particular subject.When I actually read the book, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't about menstruation at all. The title is actually a clever reference to Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from Through the Looking-Glass, a character who has to keep running to stay in the same place. Matt Ridley's hypothesis is that sex is essentially an organisms strategy for outwitting its constantly mutating internal predators (e.g. parasites, viruses etc.), a process he likens to an arms race. The point being, that in any sort of arms race, both sides work their asses off just to maintain their relative positions against the other. Essentially running in place. Hence ""The Red Queen"" analogy. Another reason I was reluctant to read the book, before a I actually read the book, was that I was sort of convinced that sexual selection (as opposed to natural selection all red in tooth and claw) was the lesser feature of Darwin's dangerous idea. After actually reading the book, I have essentially experienced a 180 degree change in perspective. I now view sexual selection as possessing awesome explanatory power. The Red Queen bravely attempts to address dozens of difficult questions regarding the otherwise mysterious workings of human nature and culture. Far form perfect. Provisional and dated. But nevertheless less brilliantly written and entertaining as all get out. The Red Queen offers an extraordinarily generative approach for interpreting the human condition and how it has evolved.I highly recommend actually reading this book."
31,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book one star deducted because of the long-winded introduction. I almost added it at the end though, because that was so brilliant. This is a lucid, immensely readable book about the evolutinary foundation of human nature. It starts out with animals and covers much the same ground as ""the Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins that I read not long ago. However, it as soon as it moves into the deeper waters of human nature it becomes vastly more interesting.Humang beings are just another animal species. We're not very special - other species have culture and language too, although not as finely honed as humans'. We run on instinct too, as learning is costly and dangerous. Language learning and a fear of snakes, for example, are hard-wired in our brains. Speaking of brains, why are ours so big? Matt Ridley presents the thoughs of Miller, who thinks it's selected for. Human beings are very keen on wit and humour (come think of it, so am I) and this has been sexually selected for. To keep ahead in the ferocious inter-species competition, men had to be ever smarter and this lead to an ever-increasing brain size for both genders. We live on gossip and deception and the most succesful of us tend to be the best ""mindreaders"". ""The choosines of human beings in picking their mates has driven the human mind into a history of frenzied expansion for no reason except that wit, virtuosity, inventiveness and individuality turn other people on"". It's an interesting theory at any rate! Anyone interested in human nature and why we are as we are should read this book. Fascinating! This works well as an introduction to both human nature and evolution."
32,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1641357-alexa,4,"I was wrong: Upon completion I'd say this. This started out so dry that I almost gave up, but I ended up really liking it. Very scientific review of why humans have 2 genders and aren't hermaphrodides, what advantages procreating through sex rather than one of the many other ways has etc. Once you get past the first 1/3 it becomes much more understandable and interesting. Rule 1 for all humans, ""success in life equals having grandchildren survive to adulthood"" (read - pass on your genes). Approach for men, that translates into the quantity of sexual partners Approach for women, that translates into quality of sexual partners. And the rest are fascinating deductions from that rule and those approaches. Just jump over the first chapters. Reminds me of one of my all time favorites. That is ""Brain Sex"" which surely has a better name, but is no more intersteing in the end."
33,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"Sex and evolution -- always fun topics and even more fun when you throw them together. I must becoming centrist in my old age, because I found Ridley's approach to strike just the right tone between authoritative and skeptical. Nothing is certain, but certain theories seem to hold more sway. Ridley's narrative also makes it clear that the answer is probably in the middle of conflicting theories, human nature being as complex as it is.My two favorite takeaways from the book: 1) Sex is most probably an evolutionary response to dealing with disease. 2) The human mind is the equivalent of the peacock tail -- a quirk of human-ness that evolved to attract mates. Now I know why creativity is so sexual."
34,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6601778-parker-f,4,"A fascinating book on my favorite topic. The author refreshingly acknowledges that half of the theories he espouses in the book are likely to be wrong; for instance, I am highly skeptical of Ridley's theory that human large-brainedness arose from runaway sexual selection favoring cute, disproportionately large heads. Nonetheless, I have no good reason to doubt this, and, as Ridley notes, all arguments of runaway sexual selection involve somewhat circular reasoning. I was fond of Ridley's literary allusions to illustrate the primalness of our evolutionarily-shaped motivations. Finally, this book is highly motivational with regards to my life's goal of acquiring a large harem. "
35,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32369480-loki,3,"Thought provoking, but less than entirely convincing, look at how genetics effect psychology. The author is quick to clarify, but often writes in a style that seems to deliberately generate an overlarge need to clarify - this is a book of meandering thoughts for the most part. Ridley strives to sound neutral, but always gives the impression of having an agenda (although if it's any more developed than 'hey, use my cool metaphor', I missed it). Still, it raises some interesting questions, for all that it pretends to greater certainty than is really warranted in such a rapidly evolving field of study."

My uncle sent it to my daughter, so I wanted to read it first. I'd let her read it, but I don't know why she would want to. He states a theory, and then loves to say, but, wait, in the black tailed, orange-rimmed sage grouse, the opposite happens. It's annoying how he picks out a totally obscure animal/insect/bacteria to prove the theory has flaws. Clearly, he has done an amazing amount of research - but to what end? I'm going to need to read some 4 & 5 star reviews to see what the point of this book is. "
37,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7506759-anthony-bello,2,"The author attempts to avoid heteronormativity and sexism and fails outright. Only the first half of the book is worth reading; I got to learn about all different strategies that nature uses for sexual and asexual reproduction and different biological applications of game theory.

41,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2775247-alexander-tomislav,5,"This book sets a case that sexual selection is the reason, as for the peacock's tail, so for the human intelligence as well. The title comes from Lewis Carroll's ""Alice through the Looking Glass"" character of Red Queen, who, the faster she goes, the more she stays in place. This is related to the evolutionary phenomenon of ""locked"" development, such as between parasites and hosts. The more parasites adapt to hosts' defenses, the more defenses will be evolved in the hosts.Drawing on many a research, the author starts with examples from the animal world, examining clues and evidence from a geneticist's, evolutionist's and ecological points of view. Biggest clue is how many features of animals (long tail feathers and bright colors in some birds, for example) serve more for the organism to breed, than to survive. Indeed, driven by the genes' impetus to replicate, it's more ""Breeding of the fittest"" than survival.One of the biggest problems that evolutionary science faces is the attitude, common in humanistic sciences, that male and female brains are identical. Not so, claims the author, and the reasoning is compelling and sound - just as different environmental pressures caused male and female bodies to be different, it did the same to our brains. No amount of wishful thinking or political correctness can make that different. However, he's quick to point out ""Give men an inch of inequality and they will claim a mile of bias."". The human body blueprint is female, and only through two testosterone bursts (in womb and at the start of puberty) does it become masculine. Environment plays a big role in gene expression and the author demonstrates in multiple places how nature and nurture aren't opposites, but work together. As a reason for explosive development of the human brain, the author shows how the competition between members of the same species drove that development. We didn't become smarter to make tools, or to hunt, or to develop language and society. Many animals hunt, have complicated social dynamics, use tools and rudimentary communication. We evolved big brains to outwit each other.Until humanity accepts what it is, instead of vainly focusing on what it should be, we can't advance as a species. Selected quotes:""Human nature is a product of culture, but culture is also a product of human nature, and both are the products of evolution."" [pg 6.]""Humanity is, of course, morally free to make and remake itself infinitely, but we do not do so. We stick to the same monotonously human pattern of organizing our affairs. If we were more adventurous, there would be societies without love, without ambition, without sexual desire, without marriage, without art, without grammar, without music, without smiles— and with as many unimaginable novelties as are in that list. There would be societies in which women killed each other more often than men, in which old people were considered more beautiful than twenty-year-olds, in which wealth did not purchase power over others, in which people did not discriminate in favor of their own friends and against strangers, in which parents did not love their own children."" [pg. 7]""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animal’s descendants more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this."" [pg. 31]""Nicholas Humphrey, a Cambridge psychologist, was the first to see clearly the solution to this puzzle. We use our intellects not to solve practical problems but to outwit each other. Deceiving people, detecting deceit, understanding people’s motives, manipulating people— these are what the intellect is used for. So what matters is not how clever and crafty you are but how much more clever and craftier you are than other people. The value of intellect is infinite. Selection within the species is always going to be more important than selection between the species."" [pg. 34]""Sex is about disease. It is used to combat the threat from parasites. Organisms need sex to keep their genes one step ahead of their parasites. Men are not redundant after all; they are woman’s insurance policy against her children being wiped out by influenza and smallpox..."" [pg. 86]""The goal for every female animal is to find a mate with sufficient genetic quality to make a good husband, a good father, or a good sire. The goal for every male animal is often to find as many wives as possible and sometimes to find good mothers and dams, only rarely to find good wives. In 1972, Robert Trivers noticed the reason for this asymmetry, which runs right through the animal kingdom; the rare exceptions to his rule prove why it generally holds. The sex that invests most in rearing the young— by carrying a fetus for nine months in its belly, for example— is the sex that makes the least profit from an extra mating. The sex that invests the least has time to spare to seek other mates. Therefore, broadly speaking, males invest less and seek quantity of mates, while females invest more and seek quality of mates."" [pg. 132]""Murder is “natural” in the sense that our ape relatives commit it regularly, as apparently did our human ancestors. Prejudice, hate, violence, cruelty— all are more or less part of our nature, and all can be effectively countered by the right kind of nurture. Nature is not inflexible but malleable."" [pg. 181]""Lesbians, free of constraints imposed by male nature, do not suddenly indulge in sexual promiscuity; on the contrary, they are remarkably monogamous. None of this is surprising: Female animals gain little from sexual opportunism, for their reproductive ability is limited not by how many males they mate with but how long it takes to bear offspring. In this respect men and women are very different."" [pg. 218]""[...]the ban on polygamous marriage does not prevent the males from seeking polygamous matings. Adultery is common. It is most common between high-ranking males and females of all ranks. To prevent it males try to guard their wives, are extremely violent toward their wives’ lovers, and copulate with their wives frequently, not just when they are fertile."" [pg. 234]""The noble savage, far from living in contented sexual equanimity, was paranoid about becoming, and intent on making his neighbor into, a cuckold[...] Cuckoldry paranoia is deep-seated in men. The use of veils, chaperones, purdah, female circumcision, and chastity belts all bear witness to a widespread male fear of being cuckolded and a widespread suspicion that wives, as well as their potential lovers, are the ones to distrust[...] Jealousy is a “human universal,” and no culture lacks it. Despite the best efforts of anthropologists to find a society with no jealousy and so prove that it is an emotion introduced by pernicious social pressure or pathology, sexual jealousy seems to be an unavoidable part of being a human being."" [pg. 235]""There has been no genetic change since we were hunter-gatherers, but deep in the mind of the modern man is a simple male hunter-gatherer rule: Strive to acquire power and use it to lure women who will bear heirs; strive to acquire wealth and use it to buy other men’s wives who will bear bastards. It began with a man who shared a piece of prized fish or honey with an attractive neighbor’s wife in exchange for a brief affair and continues with a pop star ushering a model into his Mercedes. From fish to Mercedes, the history is unbroken: via skins and beads, plows and cattle, swords and castles. Wealth and power are means to women; women are means to genetic eternity."" [pg. 244]""Testosterone is an ancient chemical, found in much the same form throughout the vertebrates. Its concentration determines aggressiveness so exactly that in birds with reversed sex roles, such as phalaropes and in female-dominated hyena clans, it is the females that have higher levels of testosterone in the blood. Testosterone masculinizes the body; without it, the body remains female, whatever its genes. It also masculinizes the brain."" [pg. 254]""Baby girls are more interested in smiling, communicating, and in people, boys in action and things. Shown cluttered pictures, boys select objects, girls people. Boys are instantly obsessed with dismantling, assembling, destroying, possessing, and coveting things. Girls are fascinated by people and treat their toys as surrogate people. Hence, to suit their mentalities, we have invented toys that suit each sex. We give boys tractors and girls dolls. We are reinforcing the stereotypical obsessions that they already have, but we are not creating them."" [pg. 256]""The Israeli kibbutz system has proved to be a large natural experiment in the persistence of sex roles. Men and women were initially encouraged to drop all sex roles in kibbutzim: Haircuts and clothes were unisex; boys were encouraged to be peaceful and sensitive, while girls were treated like tomboys; men did household chores and women went out to work. Yet three generations later, the attempt has largely been abandoned, and kibbutz life is actually more sexist than life in the rest of Israel. People have returned to stereotypes. Men politick, while women tend the home; boys study physics and become engineers, while girls study sociology and become teachers and nurses. Women manage the morale, health, and education of the kibbutz, while men manage the finances, security, and business.[...] Women clean house in a kibbutz because, like women everywhere, they complain that men would not do it properly. Men do not clean house in a kibbutz because, like men everywhere, they complain that if they did, their wives would say it had not been done properly."" [pg. 260]""The bizarre thing about this assertion of different natures is that it is a thoroughly feminist assertion. There is a contradiction at the heart of feminism, one that few feminists have acknowledged. You cannot say, first, that men and women are equally capable of all jobs and, second, that if jobs were done by women, they would be done differently. So feminism itself is anything but egalitarian. Feminists argue explicitly that if more women were in charge, more caring values would prevail. They begin from the presumption that women are by nature different beings. If women ran the world, there would be no war. When women run companies, cooperation, not competition, is the watchword. These are all explicit and firm assertions of sexism: that the personalities and natures of women are different from men. If women’s personalities are different, is it not likely that they will prove better or worse at certain jobs than men? Differences cannot be appealed to when they suit and denied when they do not."" [pg. 261]""The assertion that “culture” explains human variation will be taken seriously when there are reports of women war parties raiding villages to capture men as husbands, or of parents cloistering their sons but not their daughters to protect their sons’ virtue, or when cultural distributions for preferences concerning physical attractiveness, earning power, relative age, and so on show as many cultures with bias in one direction as in the other."" [pg. 275]""Somewhere in our education we unthinkingly absorb the idea that nature (genes) and nurture (environment) are opposites and that we must make a choice between them. If we choose environmentalism, then we are espousing a universal human nature that is as blank as a sheet of paper awaiting culture’s pen, that humans are therefore perfectible and born equal. If we choose genes, then we espouse irreversible genetic differences between races and between individuals. We are fatalists and elitists. Who would not hope with all her heart that the geneticists were wrong?"" [pg. 317]""If you want to understand human motives, read Proust or Trollope or Tom Wolfe, not Freud or Piaget or Skinner. We are obsessed with one another’s minds. “Our intuitive commonsense psychology far surpasses any scientific psychology in scope and accuracy,” wrote Don Symons. 39 Horace Barlow points out that great literary minds are, almost by definition, great mind-reading minds."" [pg. 333]""Robert Trivers has argued that to deceive others well, an animal must deceive itself, and that self-deception’s hallmark is a biased system of transfer from the conscious to the unconscious mind. Deception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious."" [pg.335]""Mankind is a self-domesticated animal; a mammal; an ape; a social ape; an ape in which the male takes the iniative in courtship and females usually leave the society of their birth; an ape in which men are predators, women herbivorous foragers; an ape in which males are relatively hierarchical, females relatively egalitarian; an ape in which males contribute unusually large amounts of investment in the upbringing of their offspring by provisioning their mates and their children with food, protection, and company; an ape in which monogamous pair bonds are the rule but many males have affairs and occasional males achieve polygamy; an ape in which females mated to low-ranking males often cuckold their husbands in order to gain access to the genes of higher-ranking males; an ape that has been subject to unusually intense mutual sexual selection so that many of the features of the female body (lips, breasts, waists) and the mind of both sexes (songs, competitive ambition, status seeking) are designed for use in competition for mates; an ape that has developed an extraordinary range of new instincts to learn by association, to communicate by speech, and to pass on traditions. But still an ape.""[pg.348]"
42,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"In a frenetic effort to stay interesting, Matt Ridley unconsciously finishes his book with a terrific built-in summary by introducing Robin Dunbar's ""Scherazade Effect"" which is the frenetic effort to stay interesting, with sex and hence reproduction and life itself at stake.The book's a little like that: Matt's a consummate researcher and very good at explaining, and he's scraped together a mountain of anecdotes in support of his thesis which is, what exactly? It's kind of a little bit lost in all the stories but basically looking for the reason we are people instead of ordinary animals, he finds sexual selection and the need to be attractive as causal in the case of neoteny, big brains, language, tools, dominant men and sexy women, everything you want.There are a million uncomfortable moments wherein simple circular dynamics diverge in unstable fashion to a new set point, like a peacock's feathers or human brains or a whale's (two ton!) gonads. Like Ridley, I couldn't resist a teaser there, but the  point  is that like so many, Ridley has a hard time wrapping his brain around recursive iterative dynamics. Since that's my JOB, I'm ok with it, but remember being frustrated and tied in a mental knot by the chicken / egg / chicken problem of feedback in physical systems. I do feel the analogy's apt though. There doesn't have to be a driving reason for everything, if a tiny nudge can suffice to loose an avalanche of consequent evolution. I find that believable.One thing he might have missed, in trying to explain us (humans) in an area cosmologists have long since overcome, which is the ""we're not special"" or ""duh, because WE're here"" explanation as to why the sun is just the right temperature or the boltzman constant just so: the reason is that the people in that potential universe or on that potential planet just arent. They aren't there, they entirely aint. I'm doing a horrible job explaining that, but basically SOMEBODY had to be on the top of the food chain and I'm personally glad to be lucky enough that it's me. Why am  I  thinking about evolution? My answer? ""Because if I were an ant I couldn't."" I think Ridley misses that he doesn't have to go searching for some reason why WE in particular are special. We're just lucky that way; ~ somebody had to be.Ahh, never mind all that. In summary, it's hard to dislike a guy who calls both Freud and Skinner misguided. This is a fun book and certainly has a lot of truth in it. Ridley wants a main theme and maybe hasn't got one, but he doesn't need it anyway. Bravo.-------------------------------Here's a long postscript on why there's a 50:50 ratio of the sexes.Gina asked why males aren't rare, since it wouldn't seem so many are necessary. I re-read a whole chapter & wrote this reply...The answer, in the Red Queen, lies around page 100. It's long and complex and, in case you want to cut to the chase, finally an unsatisfying answer.First I think I noted that male and female as different genders are an idea organized around using organelles (mitochondria) from just ONE parent. Apparently otherwise competition between them within the cell is destructive, so it's better to just pick one parent from which to get 'em. (It's the female: the sperm is stripped of all but its nucleus in the catharsis of fertilization.)Why not hermaphrodites came up next and the answer was that in a hermaphroditic population, there would be instabilities, for example a tendency to kill off your male parts would make more resources available to the female nature, which would be thereby advantaged. Ultrafemmes would outperform hermaphrodites as mothers, and in so doing, make sperm scarce. Female killer genes could also then prosper, these making a new offspring hypermale. So an instability is encouraged by the basic idea of commitment: by being ""all in"" in one's choice of sex, you have a better chance of success than playing both sides & thereby hedging two bets badly.So far we still don't have any reason why the numbers should be so easily balanced. There are plenty of creatures where that's not the case, and there are ""driving"" genes that cause sex ratio distortion. Ritter he documents one human family wherein only girls were born. Why wouldn't such a thing, this parthenogenesis, catch on, at least in some proportion? All these different causes seem like tendencies that ought to swing towards some optimal ratio which would (obviously?) benefit from a male percentage << 50%. ...and that's your question, still unanswered. Lemmings actually solve it with a third sex chromosome that biases the odds towards females, a seemingly better system. Are we just unlucky vs lemmings?He delves briefly into other systems, as when unfertilized eggs become male (a clearly stable situation) or my favorite, when ALL the fish in the school are female, save the biggest, who changes teams to fulfill his duties. I guess the point is, there are plenty of exceptions to the rule. Ridley delights in these digressions.Then there were many more anecdotes, sort of diffusing away into a fog of confusion, doubtless why I forgot this next point. ""Munching a burrito"" with some scientist, he notes that dominant women & monkeys (& cows and chickens) have more sons, that female hormones not genetics tend most (and there are many factors) to bias the sex ratios, and a shortage of men makes for dominant females. It doesn't seem to ""tend"" towards exactly 50:50 or even be strongly supported, certainly not convincingly so in the face of the profligate polygamous male hypothesis. So the question goes down as being self corrected by mysterious and non genetic means. Unsatisfying. More theories then follow, but many of these have to do with social criteria pertinent only to humans (you can always marry a beautiful daughter up-caste, but not a son) but these theories do not answer as to why farmers have failed to breed female only lines of cattle, however hard they try. That last observation was a quote from Dawkins, and seemingly his last word. I have to suspect Ridley should have accepted this as unknown and ended the chapter there.At least, I will."
43,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature by Matt Ridley“The Red Queen"" is the very interesting book about how human nature evolved as a result of sex. According to the author, human beings were “designed” to reproduce and that without understanding competitive reproduction we will not be able to comprehend the human psyche and nature. Well known journalist, scientist and educator; Matt Ridley, brings us a well-rounded science book that deals with many fascinating topics involving sexual evolution. The first third of book or so starts off a little dense and may put off some readers but once it picks up it really takes off and rewards readers with invaluable knowledge. This 416-page book is composed of the following ten chapters: 1. Human Nature, 2. The Enigma, 3. The Power of Parasites, 4. Genetic Mutiny and Gender, 5. The Peacock’s Tale, 6. Polygamy and the Nature of Men, 7. Monogamy and the Nature of Women, 8. Sexing the Mind, 9. The Uses of Beauty, and 10. The Intellectual Chess Game. Positives:1.	A well-written and well-researched book. 2.	The fascinating topic of sexual evolution in the hands of a master.3.	The book was originally published in 1993 but it holds up generally well and it’s still worth reading.4.	Good use of the best that science had to offer at that time.5.	Thought-provoking and refreshingly honest and witty approach.6.	Provides compelling arguments in support of a universal human nature.7.	Explains the reasoning behind the title which is a metaphor in evolution for “the faster you run, the more the world moves with you and the less you make progress”.8.	Some great analogies, “The fashion in evolutionary science now is to scoff at progress; evolution is a treadmill, not a ladder”.9.	What sex is. A look from three different kinds of scientists. Great stuff.10.	The unbelievable world of sex in both the animal and plant kingdom.11.	Some great facts and perspectives, “The ‘great war” of 1914-18 killed 25 million people in four years. The influenza epidemic that followed killed 25 million in four months”.12.	What drive the evolution of sex.13.	Understanding what evolution is in a practical sense.14.	How science works to address a problem.15.	Understanding gender in terms of “genetic lottery”. Or leave it to the environment.16.	Some great anecdotes, “Anaxagora’s belief that lying on the right side during sex would produce a boy was so influential that centuries later some French aristocrats had their left testicles amputated”. Ouch!17.	The nature of “choosy” females.18.	The two warring factions in sexual selection: “Fisher” and “Good-genes”.19.	Testosterone and its relation to disease.20.	What men find attractive in women.21.	The impact of human culture.22.	An honest look at the roles of the sexes.23.	An understanding about homosexual behavior.24.	Game theory and how it plays out between males and females. Always interesting.25.	Human evolution always fascinating.26.	The growth of our brains.27.	Understanding the evil practice of female infanticide.28.	Power as a tool for sexual success. It’s good being the king.29.	Marriage, understanding the institution of.30.	Adultery and how it shaped human society.31.	Fascinating look at what societies favor daughters over sons and vice versa.32.	The differences of mental features between the sexes.33.	A look at social statuses.34.	The innate instinct of learning language.35.	The evidence for neoteny.36.	Links to notes worked great! Negatives:1.	The first third or so of the book was a bit dense and may have put off some readers.2.	Despite holding up generally well (book was published in 1993), some topics are outdated. For instance, free will is an illusion. I will provide a list of suggestion that offers more up to date information.3.	Animal altruism is not a myth.4.	Some topics are fairly logical. We all have a basic grasp of sexual selection.5.	Some topics may irk feminists. Let me leave it at that.6.	The author purposely sidesteps the issue of morality and the little that is here is inadequate.7.	“Deception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious.” – Trivers Really?In summary, I wished I had read this book when it first came out in 1993. The book started off a little dry but once it gets going I wasn’t able to put it down. Many topics of popular interest in the hands of an accomplished author make for good reading. In spite of its age, I learned some new things and have a much better grasp of why human nature evolved as a result of sex. If you have the patience to make it through the early chapters the book will reward you with wisdom, worth reading! Further recommendations: ""Human” and “Who’s In Charge?” by Michael S.

The experience is much more amusing if you pause and reflect - and try to devise your own explanations - before reading the main theories.That's why it gets a 5/5.OBS: In order to better enjoy the book, I recommend reading ""The Selfish Gene"" first."
47,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13334219-ralph-hermansen,4,"""The Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley. A review by Ralph Hermansen.I would buy Matt Ridley's next book without hesitation, no matter what the topic. He is one of the few authors who thoroughly researches his subject and understands the science underlying it. He then delivers the information to you in an interesting way. You certainly get your money's worth in his books.""The Red Queen"" is about the evolutionary forces which has shaped us as human beings. The significance of Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from the book, ""Alice in Wonderland"", is that we have to run just to stand still. So it is with evolution. We have to improve our survival skills over the generations to keep pace with the other plants and animals which are also advancing in their survival skills.Much of what we are as humans has to do with sexual selection. Charles Darwin introduced the concept of natural selection in his book, ""Origin of the Species"", but he devoted an even greater deal of space to his concept of sexual selection in his book, ""The Descent of Man"". No matter how superior you are in survival abilities, it is all for naught if you do not pass those traits on to your offspring. Therefore mating is vitally important. You must be attractive to the opposite sex and this manifests itself in diverse ways amongst the animals. Moreover, sexual selection may create traits that seem to work against survivability. The peacock would certainly be better served with a smaller, less ornate tail, which makes him a more obvious target for predators.Ridley picks up where Darwin left off and explores the sexuality of humans as they have evolved from apes and gradually became a big brained animal over millions of years of evolution. He has incorporated most of the ideas of modern scientists related to this subject. Men are attracted to beauty and women are attracted to powerful men, who can provide for them. In the animal kingdom, the female selects the male with the best traits and the males are willing to mate with most any female in heat. The case has become different for modern humans because human babies are helpless far longer than in normal in the animal kingdom. This is a consequence of out massive brain, which must continue developing outside the womb.One part of the book did leave me surprised. Ridley got so caught up in his analysis of what women would do in selecting men that he surmised that women would rarely engage in opportunistic sex as it is against their self interest. Mr. Ridley, if you had been single and dating in California in the 1970's, you would soon realize how very mistaken you are. Many women had decided that they were now equal to men and could enjoy the same pleasures and they did. A few years later, fear of AIDS put an end to this libertine period. Alas!Aside from that mistaken projection, the Red Queen book is excellent and I think you will enjoy reading it. Ralph Hermansen 10/04/08 "
48,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47841182-myrto-smyrilioy-zerva,5,"This is a book targeted at biologists and not, alike. It consists of a, not completely unbiased review of our knowledge on the subjects of a human evolution and inherent nature beautifully stated by a superfluous pen with a deep understanding and fiery passion on the subject. It is an educational read but the wit and humor is not secrificed in the altar of scientific accuracy or logical argument. I found this book both stimulating, informative and entertaining. This is also helped by a fantastic audio."
49,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1052384-nicholas,3,"I feel like I really missed out on what this book had to offer. I don't think that I had the requisite background for it at the time. Reread.This book is about the effect of parasites on sex and culture. Sex is the caused by the need to fight off parasites that have a much faster generational cycle than we do. Our culture is a product in large part of this sexual dynamic.Quotes:""Evolution is a treadmill not a ladder.""""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animal's decedents more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this.""""Parasites are in constant battle with hosts, a battle that is fought by switching from one resistance gene to another; hence the battery of different versions of genes. None of this would work without sex.""""If the goal is to have the sexist son in the next generation, then one way of doing that is to mate with the sexiest male; a second way is to prevent other females from mating with the sexiest male.""""We are designed for a system of monogamy plagued by adultery.""""What caused the sudden and spectacular expansion of that one ape's head, from which so much else flowed? Why did it happen to one ape and not another? What can account for the astonishing speed, and the accelerating speed of the change? These questions may seem to have nothing to do with the subject of this book, but the answer may lie with sex. If new theories are right, the evolution of man's big head was the result of a Red Queen sexual contest between individuals of the same gender.""""Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong."""
50,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1251066-andy,3,"I've been meaning to read this for years, after an old flat-mate told me about it while studying for his BSc in the psychology of attraction. Finally found it in a charity shop in Tunbridge Wells and decided to finish of the year with some evolutionary pondering.Matt Ridley freely states that the first third may not be as interesting to some as he details the background of evolutionary theory in relation to sexual activity and behaviour in animals. Dry perhaps, may be a better term. It's the later parts of the book though where things get interesting, looking at how human nature (if indeed humans can be said to have a specific 'nature') may (or may not) have been shaped by evolutionary pressures. There are many fascinating examples and case studies, compiled expertly by Ridley. As he again mentions, he has compiled these mostly from the work of others, trying to tie a lot of individual theories and evidence together. Generally he manages a good job and it's eminently readable.Whether or not you agree or believe is entirely another matter and really, books such as this should be read to educate and promote discussion. He doesn't (and shouldn't) attempt to claim a definitive conclusion and many avenues are left open to debate. I personally found it compelling. My biggest issue is how out of date much of the evidence (and some occasional clumsy discussions, particularly around homosexuality) is now, having been written almost 20 years ago. I would certainly be interested in reading a more up to date discussion of the state of the field.Still, a well recognised and deserved text, worth reading."
51,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,5,"Excellent book. Definitely worth reading for everyone, particularly followers of any religion.Summary is that Human Intelligence, just like a peacocks feathers, are the result of Sexual Selection. The more intelligent, the more able to outsmart other humans, and the more able to mate --- this especially applies to men.Few aspects of human nature can be understood apart from sex, since human nature is a product of evolution, and evolution in our case is driven specifically by sexual replication.The book begins with an evolutionary account of sex itself, defending the theory that sex flourishes, despite its energetic costs, primarily because a sexually mixed heritage confers to offspring a defensive ""head start"" against parasites received from and originally adapted to the maternal host environment.Human intelligence is largely a result of sexual selection. Human intelligence far outstrips any survivalist demands that would have been placed on our hominid ancestors, and analogizes human intelligence to the peacock's tail, a trait widely believed to be the result of sexual selection. Human intelligence is used primarily to attract mates through prodigious displays of wit, charm, inventiveness, and individuality.Next I should read The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature."
52,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619806-veronica,2,"Okay, so the good points of the book: when the author discusses the up to date and relevant research of scientists, he does so respectfully, succinctly, and accurately. He does not both too much with alternative perspectives, but for the most part, while sometimes unpalatable information, I tend to agree with the information. The worse points of the book: his own opinion is often absurd. His methods of making the information relatable is, in my opinion, stupid. He lacks the creativity to make a compelling story out of facts, and frankly, the theories are often so elegant and beautiful, it's unnecessary anyway. Finally, in his final depressing notes, he not just criticizes, but attempts to entirely discredit pioneers in many different fields, none of which he is an expert in. Even if some of the theories are no longer considered accurate or represent our world model, they paved the path for future endeavours which have enhanced our knowledge of the natural world and our place within it. Finally, several of the individuals he attempted to discredit are still at the forefront of their fields and are still considered accurate and representative of present day findings. Following this, he gives us his own uneducated opinions on where he thinks the future will take us. The only reason he got two stars at all was because of the research he did present and do justice to. I'm shocked this book has such high reviews. I was so looking forward to reading it. "

Matt Ridley manages to handle the subject with such an elegance, concision and property quite difficult to find among ""entrepreneurial"" scholars nowadays. This book is really informative and not just another idiot trying to make some extra-money by spreading pseudo-science.A must read if you want to get acquainted with the ways of modern Biology and Human Sciences in general; yet, you will find a lot of ingenious answers to common misconceptions and useful knowledge to understand the wonderful intricacies of social interaction at an animal level.And yes, it is an easy replacement for bad literature; for you see, It'll make you feel better with yourself, get you laid more often or just serve as a good excuse to keep your fidelity."
54,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/689670-joanna,1,"My review of this book can be summed up in a quote from the very end of the book, ""Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong."" That's probably a generous estimate on the author's part! I would also add ""sexist"" to ""wrong."" If only I'd read the end first, I could've saved myself a lot of frustration.A sampling:""The best [men] can hope for now is a good-looking younger mistress and a devoted wife who is traded in every decade or so. We're back to square one."" ""Inject all pregnant women with the right dose of hormones, and the result would be men and women with normal bodies but identical female brains. War, rape, boxing, car racing, pornography, and hamburgers and beer would soon be distant memories.""Then he talks about how women with Turner's syndrome are born without ovaries. ""They are exaggeratedly feminine in their behavior, with typically a special interest in babies, clothes, housekeeping, and romantic stories.""This book is bad science based in sexist stereotypes. Ironically, I read it for my feminist book club!"
55,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22176981-olivera,2,"Even though Matt Ridley said in his epilogue to this book that he doesn't regret including animals in this book I found it to be a flaw that can't necessarily be overcome. This isn't a book you will enjoy unless you are a fan of biology and the behavior of animals (which I in fact am not).I went into this expecting exactly what the title promised: the evolution of human nature, yet there was more talk about birds, insects, apes and snails than there actually was about humans. While I do understand that giving a kind of background for this topic is necessary, to me it seemed like it was overdone. Only in the last third did it actually focus on the theme it was supposed to focus on, but the 200+ pages that took me to get there weren't really worth it. There were some very interesting theories here, but I found a few facts being repeated over and over again. I don't really know what to say. I'm just pretty disappointed in The Red Queen and I'll be hesitant to pick up anything regarding this subject in the future, even though I am interested in it."
56,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4948409-samantha-sean,4,"In The Red Queen, Matt Ridley asserts that sexual selection is more prominent a factor of survival of a species than natural selection in its general form. Ridley cites Darwin, multiple fascinating biological studies, and psychological experiments. The findings of all his data verify his assertion well, though somehow I feel jilted. There is so much more to life than reproduction and procreation of the species. Attraction is not as simple a matter as genetic predilection and instinct, or generalizations in psychology. Ridley covers deviations very little, and explains why they exist (as byproducts or mutations). Overall, I vastly understand the world of sexual selection as a major contributor to our present customs and inclinations as a species. The rant on evolution at the end felt out of place, but the conclusion was concise. The value of the Red Queen is its compilation of data to support the relevance of sex in our evolution. "
57,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8739994-darrel,4,"Matt Ridley is a consistently good science writer and he does not disappoint in The Red Queen. The research and writing are solid. I should have read it many years ago when it first came out. My main criticism is that it is somewhat dated. It appears that he wrote nothing of the Bonobos in the original edition then threw in a few paragraphs in the later edition. Unfortunately, the information about Bonobo sexuality is important and should have informed his conclusions more. I do recommend it, but read with the knowledge that the original was written over 10 years ago and new information and research has emerged which is not taken into consideration. I don't think his conclusions would be radically changed, but certainly would be better nuanced.Dr. Darrel Ray, author of Sex and God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality, and The God Virus."
58,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75567-nils-samuels,3,"Consolidates ideas from anthropology and biology, arguing most interestingly for significant evolutionary differences between males and females, applied first to other animals and then to humans. First half of the book sets up the more homocentric second half. The summary: men are naturally polygamous, women naturally monogamous. Men like youth and beauty. Women like wealth and power. Civilization works for the greatest good when monogamy rules, since polygamy favors a select few and leaves many others partnerless. Otherwise the rich men in their sports cars would steal all the thunder and the lightning as well. And many more men would kill each other for beauty, literally not just metaphorically. "
59,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,4,"It's important to understand that evolution is not a process of improvement. Natural selection simply asserts that species change as they adapt to ever-changing environments. Evolution is not a process by which human beings or societies become better. Those organisms best able to survive in a challenging, shifting environment live to reproduce. The environment can change at any moment, thus neutralizing any advantage of any species.Sex provides the necessary variation that keeps evolution going, and without constant evolution, competitors and environmental change would lead to extinction of all species.

60,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7432477-jenny,2,"The ""Red Queen"" theory of evolution is really fascinating, and is one of those concepts that is probably best formatted in a Ted Talk and not a 200+ page book. The more examples he gives, especially around gender roles, the role of beauty, infidelity and polygamy, the more he starts to really broadcast his ""white, Northern European, straight cis male"" views of the world and the scholarship starts sounding preachy and heavily biased. Not to SJW up this book review but it's such a single, narrow view of science and evolution and social relations that it's hard to be too convinced of its universal applications."

72,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1383849-patrick,3,"I like the humility that he brings to the table as he himself shoots down various evolutionary theories, he says that time and scientific discovery can similarly shoot down his theory of The Red Queen and his theory of evolution. I give this book a 3.5 since a lot of the book are things i already knew from my anthropological classes though there were interesting pieces of knowledge such as it is parasites that causes genetic diversity in humans instead of the usual external pressures that gets recycled over and over again. I also think he is correct in stating it is both nature and nurture that makes human being the way they are instead of the usual dichotomy between both.Ridley, a man with libertarian leanings, assumes that there are more things that unite humanity than divide us as a surgeon or a psychologist can attest. Whereas biological anthropologists looks for our human commonalities via evolutionary theory, cultural anthropologist look for the uniqueness of a certain culture. The book looks at sex as the bedrock of evolution and in turn is the key to universal human nature. Evolution works through competitive reproduction. Free will allows one to have initiative and thus ambition in order to reproduce; in this biology supports religious doctrine. For Ridley, the forbidden fruit that Eve partakes in is carnal knowledge. Evolution works in the level of individuals in which they choose their own mates and thus their own genetic destiny. Sex ensures that individuals are unique yet do not stray too far from the mean. Men compete for access to female which means that they need to be more aggressive than the opposite sex. Sexual selection favors people who are healthy, fit, and powerful. Men prefer pretty young female prettiness combined with youth is a sign of female fertility.The Red Queen's quandary is that despite her constant movement she essentially stands still. Ridley says evolution and progress essentially follows the same rule no matter how fast a person runs, ones environment catches up to make the previous advantage no longer an advantage. The universal imperative of life is a balance between competition and cooperation. In terms of survival versus sexual selection, sexual selection always trumps survival this is the reason men have a high testosterone despite a higher susceptibility to infectious disease because risk-taking and being competitive in battle leads getting the better looking women.Unlike the famous thinking of geneticist of the evolutionary adaptive nature of sexuality as away to introduce adaptive random mutations to the gene pool, Ridley favors the Red Queen hypothesis of why sex is necessary. Ridley thinks that natural selection happens at the individual level not the population level thus sex has to be explained to what the individual gets out of it. According to Ridley, the Red Queen hypothesis favors multiple genetic polymorphism of a certain gene gives an ""arms race"" advantage against infectious disease. So sex evolved to counter infectious disease. Everything being equal asexual reproduction wins out but once infectious disease is introduced then sexual reproduction wins out over asexual reproduction. Evolution is more about reproduction of the fittest rather than the survival of the fittest. ""There is no nature that exists devoid of nurture; there is no nurture that develops without nature... Every behavior is the product of an instinct trained by experience."" Nature is not inflexible but malleable. Ridley states that gender was created due to genetic competition. Ridley states that gender was created as bureaucratic answer for the sake of the offspring. That is, since the egg provided all the mitochondrial energy, the sperm could specialize to only contribute its nucleus so it could make itself small, plentiful, and mobile. It turns out that in rigid social caste system, higher caste favor males because they are more likely to have harems while lower caste prefer females because if they were beautiful they could marry into a higher social caste. In general in the animal kingdom, females look for the quality of their mates while male look for quantity because females have to invest more in raising their young than males do. In species in which there is no paternal investment in raising their young, the female look for the best looking. Hence the animal that has become synonymous with female sexual selection is the peacock. Males can either ""win"" their female by doing battle with other males or seduce the female by looking good. In the art of seduction, males exaggerate their genetic potential while females look for the ""truth"" about the males genetic qualities. Low postulates that men prefer women who have more fat in their breast and butts because it makes them seem capable in siring and caring for their children. Andrew thinks a chance mutation in a male that appeals to the sensory bias of a female get passed on. The Fisher effect then takes over as the trait and preference get exaggerated through time. After awhile when all males have similar qualities, females no longer choose based on looks but rather what the looks represents in terms of genetic benefits of male animal. For humans, sex and power go hand in hand. We are designed for a system of monogamy plagued by adultery. Men seduce multiple women because they have less at stake in caring for a woman's young. Male homosexuality exposes that men are promiscuous if their is no female nature to check their natural proclivity to have sex often whenever possible. Infidelity is greater in male gay marriage because men's need for variety in their sexual partners. Anti-polygamy laws are as much for men as it is for women since it ensures each men will have at least one sexual partner in their lives. The more egalitarian the society is such as foragers the more likely that it practice monogamy whereas a pastoral/agricultural society with its fixed accumulation of wealth increases the chances that that society becomes a polygamous society. Until the renaissance, people who were the wealthiest were also the people in power with the most political allies so they were the once who had harems. Males seek alliances to dominate the opposition. Alliances were not only formed among relatives but also on the promise of reciprocity if males lived long enough. The more intelligent the species, the more fluid the coalitions were. ""Wealth, cunning, political skill, and experience lead to power among men...men gain power by putting coalition of allies. In mankind, wealth became a way of putting together such alliance of power.""In the past, despotic leaders had harems of concubines meant for breeding but they also had one Queen who alone produced legitimate heirs. Roman nobles freed slaves from their household with money given to them because they were their illegitimate children by slaves. While in Christian medieval Europe, polygamy went underground in siring numerous offsprings by their servants. Christianity was obsessed with sexuality not because of its immoral grounds but because rampant adultery can cause mayhem in society in which revenge killings can ensue. Wars were fought for loot which included captured enemy women. In resource rich places, preliterate society fought for access to women. Even today, the military commanders turn a blind eye to rape of their own women when it is done by victorious soldiers. Forager societies and current democracies places checks and balances on power including polygamy.Marriage exists for child-rearing purposes. Even husbands who chronically cheat, stay in their primary marriage most of the time. So if women need marriage to raise children, then why do some women cheat? For humans, women cheat to get superior genes from a well-chosen man while marrying a mediocre husband who helps her raise her brood. For the most part, women will choose monogamy and are not interested in variety of men per se, but they will seek adulterous affairs with a man she usually knows especially if he is genetically superior to her husband in some way. Interestingly, a cuckold man develops sperm that is defective in order to block the female vagina with dead sperm so no other sperm can take place of the primary donor after insemination takes place. For birds, the more good looking the bird the less of a good father he is going to be. Thus, it is better for females to choose mediocre males who are good providers but have sex with the stud next door to get his superior genes. This is known as the Mme Bovary effect who wanted to keep her wealthy husband while having an affair with her handsome lover. It turns out that women who were having affairs were having them around the time of their ovulation and were having better and more frequent orgasms with their lovers. In forager societies, not only were women cheating with men of a higher rank but cheating occurred when the marriage was going badly as though the women were looking for plan B in case their marriage did not work out. The cheating female increases sex with the husband while having more orgasms with their lovers thereby protecting her marriage while ensuring the love child is that of her lover.Interestingly, cuckoldry makes men ejaculate twice as much in their wives when they have not seen her in a few days to compensate for her lovers sperm that is probably in her. (Perhaps, this is the reason why seeing another man with his wife is an aggressive turn on for some men) Sexual jealousy is a universal human emotion. Adultery is common with high ranking men and all females. Men try to prevent infidelities by guarding their wives, acting extremely violent to their wife's lover, and copulate frequently with their wives to prevent the chance that their children is not theirs. Decreased visible ovulation leads to an increase in sex by both genders which peaks when women are ovulating. Adultery is a sin of property, protection of women is code for sexual protection of women, and infidelity is a legitimate provocation towards violence. Even though love is a cherished emotion and jealousy is universally scorned, it is really two sides to the same coin. Jealousy is more common in men who have low self-esteem because they have more fear that their wife will leave him for a man who is superior to him in some way. Laws used to punish wives who committed adultery but not their lovers were universally common until recently because it had the potential to disrupt the fabric of social life by introducing a child that was not the husbands. While it is obvious to most that hormones makes boys body different from girls, it is also evident that testosterone makes male brains different from female brains. For male brains to develop normally, testosterone haas to exist 6 weeks after conception if it doesn't spike in the right levels during that time; the male fetus becomes effeminate. Exposed to testosterone during this period, boys tend to like objects and action while girls are more interested in communicating and people. In school, boys are more likely to have ADHD, dyslexia, or other learning disorders. While girls are better at linguistic forms of learning, males are better at math and visual-spatial forms of learning. Despite these mental differences, the sexes are fairly equal until puberty hits. Women's mind and bodies evolved for child bearing and rearing and gathering plant food while males minds and bodies evolve for rising in male hierarchy, fighting over women, and providing meat for the family. There is a sexual division of labor in which males seek food that is mobile, distant, and unpredictable while females seek food that is static, close, and predictable usually plants that is close to their children. In an average human, females are better at verbal skills, males better at math, visual-spatial skills and are more aggressive. Men are better at reading a map and using landmarks to orient themselves while females are better judges of character, mood, and can recall the location of specific objects better. Gay men interestingly may have this skill too. Twin studies prove that there is a biological basis for being gay. A hypothesis is the lack of testosterone during the 6 week post conception period contributes to people being gay or if the mother is stressed and cortisol takes the place of testosterone may also contribute to people turning out gay. As adults, men seek power and independence whereas women seek to serve society above all. While women natures of being more cooperative would perhaps make them better in running Congress, the lack of status-seeking ambition to run precludes them from doing it. That is, winning politically does not mean they are better at ruling. While women look for men who have wealth and power, men look for women who are young and healthy. As women become higher in status, they look for men who are even higher in status to them in order to be part of a power couple (Dyn&Gabe). While men's sexual fantasies visually having multiple women, women fantasizes about having sex with a familiar partner; they tend to need context, emotive, and intimacy in their fantasies. Females tend to read romantic novels with the focus of the fantasy on how the woman is feeling. Beauty is culturally defined within the limits of biology. For example, all men like a larger hip to waist ratio no matter if culturally men like fat or thin women because the pear shape signals that the woman has female hormones for bearing children in them. Beauty is a trinity of youth, figure, and correct average facial symmetry. If men were to have a life-long pair bond it is important for them to marry someone young who could have multiple babies. ""The physical attractiveness of a woman was far better predictor of occupational status for the man she married than any other indicator in her background."" As for women, they universally prefer men who are taller than they are. Women prefer men's personality and status. Personality is a proxy for future status for men; thus females are better judges of character than men. Dominant male body language matters to women in what they look for in men. Women are impressed by signals of status that varies only according to when and where they live. Fashion is a competition between women to be noticed by their desired men. ""Uncomfortable realism shows us how we measure our own relative desirability from others' reaction to us. Repeated rejection causes us to lower our sights; an unbroken string of success encourages us to aim a little higher."" So the question is did Bachelorette Desiree settle for Chris because he was the best she could do?Incest are avoided by having children raised together in the same home. ""The instinct not to mate with childhood companions is nature, but the features by which you recognize them are nurture."" Just like language acquisition, incest avoidance is learned in the young. The law against marrying ones own cousin was enacted so power would not concentrate in a family excepting the king who naturally wanted to consolidate his power base.Ridley champions sexual selection and not natural selection as the cause for bigger brains and thus intelligence in people. Miller states that big brains were made by sexual selection since people like to mate with people who are articulate, brilliant, fascinating, and entertaining companions. After all, both sexes want intelligent people who have a sense of humor, creative, and have interesting personalities as consistent desirable traits for both sexes. While males needed to be entertaining to get females, females needed to be equally entertaining to keep males around to help raise the increasingly dependent offspring because the bigger brains needed to be cared for a longer time. The need for entertainment explains why dance, music, humor, and sexual foreplay are hard-wired to be entertaining for humans. Both men and women are highly selective when looking for pair-bond opportunities.While sexual selection may have started the ball rolling for giving us bigger and bigger brains, Ridley thinks our brains grew to compete with our relatives in a game of intellectual chess knowing what they think by being self-aware of what we would do in a similar situation. Competing with smart relatives essentially makes us have to have a larger brain. We are obsessed with what goes on in one another's minds. Great literary minds are also great mind-readers. The object of oratory alone is not truth but persuasion. Ridley thinks that human communication is present so we can manipulate other people to our way of thinking. People respond to games of logic better if the game is made of a social contract and looking for those who cheats in the contract. The habit of calculated deception is common in humans. ""Deceiving and detecting deception would be the primary reason for intelligence. They suggest that the great apes acquired a unique ability to imagine alternative possible worlds as a means for deception."" I disagree with this premise after all foresight requires one to think of things that are not currently in existence in order to allow them to exist in the future. According, to Ridley, the ability to have an optimistic foresight means an ability for self-deception to think of a world that does not yet exist. Men have more learning capacity and instinct because learning is based on innate biological assumptions. All language come with similar grammar because it is pre-programmed in the brain. The evolutionary part of man is instinctive while the moral code is learned. Learned behavior is built on instinct. For example, babies instinctively fear snakes for good reason."

The nature of human nature is the theme of the book, how it evolved, how human sexuality evolved. CHAPTER 1: HUMAN NATUREReproduction is the sole goal for which human beings are designed. Human culture is a product of human nature, not just of our free will or invention. Richard Dawkins 1970s argues that the body is merely an evolutionary vehicle for our genes--the genes force the body to do things to perpetuate them. There is selective competition for genes. The human brain developed its current form and capacity on the African savanna. The differences between individuals are attributable to individual variation (85%), tribal/national variation (8%), and racial variation (7%). People are attracted to people of high reproductive potential, the consequences of which are sexual selection. We are descended from men who preferred fertile women. The goal is not just to survive but to breed. The human intellect itself has evolved to contribute to reproductive success.Ch 05Sex is a source of individual variability furnishing material for the operation of natural selection. Collective effects could flow from the actions of self-interested individuals. A creature would evolve to help its species only if its self-interest coincided. The main purpose of sex is to repair genes but probably not the entire purpose of sex. Sex breaks up the linkage of one gene with another, helping to get rid of bad mutations. Ultimately, there is no purely genetic explanation of sex.CHAPTER 3: THE POWER OF PARASITESIt pays to diversify. The Red Queen hypothesis: species do not get any better at surviving, their chances of extinction are random. Sex is all about combating parasites, predators and competitors. The advantage of sex can appear in a single generation when it comes to parasites. Variation arises from heterozygosity and also from population-derived polymorphism. Heterozygosity can improve survival, making the Red Queen only a part of the explanation for why we are sexual.CHAPTER 4: GENETIC MUTINY AND GENDERGenes are active and act to enhance its own survival by finding the right balance between cooperation and competition.For genes, sex is a way to spread laterally as well as vertically. Genes are full of half-suppressed mutinies, selfish chromosomes. Gender was invented as a means of resolving the conflict between the cytoplasmic genes of 2 parents.We are we not hermaphroditic as it is in our genes best interest to specialize.How gender is determined: (1) Chooses gender appropriate to sexual opportunities. (2) Leave it to environment (3) Mother determines sex of each child.Trivers-Willard theory: parents in good condition probably have male-biased litters while those in poor condition will have female-biased litters. Cultural variation in preference for boys versus girls: Daughters are preferred in poor cultures because they are more likely to lead to grandchildren, can marry up, etc. The ability to choose preferably the male sex would benefit the individual but would be a tragedy of the commons.CHAPTER 5: THE PEACOCK'S TALEThe showy tail is the peacock's way of attracting the peahen. Sexual selection has selectively bred this trait. Beauty arose to satisfy the Red Queen contest.Dichotomous sexual selection theories: (1) Sexy-son Good-taste: females prefer beautiful males because the heritable beauty will be passed on to sons who will attract females.(2) Good-gene good-sense healthy-offspring: peahens prefer beautiful males because beauty is a sign of good genetic qualities incl. diseases resistance. Successful males are not necessarily truthful, sometimes just more persuasive.Female taste is idiosyncratic. In humans, attractiveness is not just about appearance but also wittiness, cleverness, etc.CHAPTER 6: POLYGAMY AND THE NATURE OF MENWe are designed for a system of monogamy plagued by adultery. Powerful men have always had more than one mate, though usually only one legitimate wife who produces the heirs. Males are usually the seducer, women the seduced (exception: jacana, phalarope).Homosexual promiscuity: Homosexuals are generally more promiscuous than heterosexuals. Male homosexuals are acting out male tendencies unfettered by the pressure of women toward monogamy. Lesbians are rarely promiscuous. Harems and wealth. There is a polygyny threshold in which a suitably advantaged male attracts more than one mate, even in humans. Men seek power and building or dominating male-male coalitions. Men can always increase their reproductive success by philandering. Equitable sharing of hunted food is reciprocal altruism.Chimps rise to alpha male status with cunning and coalitions as well as physical prowess. Coalitions in species can be based on reciprocity or relatedness.Emperors have large harems. The more polygamous societies have male inheritance. Christians equated sex and sin probably because of the trouble it leads to. Monogamy reduces murderous competition.CHAPTER 7: MONOGAMY AND THE NATURE OF WOMENPolygamy is infrequent in hunter gatherers. Marriage is a child rearing institution. Women are not interested in overt polygamy but are often unfaithful.Women seek monogamous marriages, lesbians are not promiscuous. Women are sometimes unfaithful.Human females have concealed ovulation, forcing males to mate regularly, exhibit continual sexual interest. This helps to prevent infanticide--neither the husband nor the lover knows if he is the father. Women use perpetual sexual availability to seduce philanderers in exchange for gifts.Males may hold 2 territories, each with a committed mate. Men deceive their wives, not their lovers.Jealousy is deep seated in men, a human universal. The absence of jealousy in a husband is worrisome to a wife. Couples who exhibit occasional jealousy are more likely to stay together. Men are less accepting of infidelity in their wives. In the American South, the effort was to keep the wealth in the family. Incest laws are in part an effort for rulers to prevent wealth concentration in other families (and are not always followed by the rulers).Men want to acquire power and use it to lure women who will bear heirs, and to acquire wealth to buy other men's wives who will bear bastards. Wealth and power are a means to women which lead to genetic eternity. Women want a husband who will provide care and food for her children, and a lover who will give them first-class genes.CHAPTER 8: SEXING THE MINDMales evolved to fight in the male hierarchy and hunt. Men are more violent, women more nurturing. Male apes that show aggression are rewarded.Girls are better at verbal tasks, boys are better at mathematical tasks,  boys are more aggressive, boys are better at some visuo-spatial tasks (e.g., rotation, throwing spear at moving target, making tools), and girls are better at others (spotting mushrooms, berries, plants)...The first pulse of testosterone in the uterus primes the male, the second during puberty develops the full male effects.Baby girls do more smiling and communicating, boys do more playing with things. Boys are more fidgety, inattentive, girls better at linguistic forms.Male homosexuality is fixed before adulthood. LH may have to do with it. Prenatal deficiency of testosterone increases likelihood of being male homosexual, as are XXY and men exposed intrauterine to female hormones or conceived in times of great stress. Homosexuality is more common in left handed males.Rich men marry beautiful women. Women pay attention to cues of wealth and power, men pay attention to cues of health and youth.Sexual fantasies are greater in men, more ubiquitous, visual, specifically sexual, promiscuous, and active, often involve strangers--in women they are more of familiar partners, more contextual, emotive, intimate, passive. Men like pornography, women like romance novels.Marriage has a natural period of c. 4 years. Men often seek younger wives. The racial differences between men are minimal compared to the differences between men and women. Sexual role playing is universal: men pursue and acquire while women are protected and bartered.CHAPTER 9: THE USES OF BEAUTYIf an identical twin is gay, the other twin is gay 50% of the time. Is there a gay gene? The genes of mitochondria may carry the gay gene.Incest taboo may consist of dislike of mating with those we grew up with and knew well in childhood.Victorian women were not thin. Most tribal peoples prefer plump women. Thinness is now a sign of status.Waists matter because men prefer women whose waist if much thinner than her hips--the ratio matters more than the absolute measurement. Choosing broad hipped women allows babies to have largest brains at birth--men are left with the impression that a hourglass figure represents large hips and better childbirth potential.Role of blond hair--found mainly in young women, leading to a sexual preference for blondes.Facial symmetry is a key to beauty. Face is information dense.Women are attracted to men for their personality and status more than for their beauty and figure. Height however is universally considered attractive. A man must be taller than his date. One inch is worth $6000/year in salary; height contributes to self-assurance. Body language contributes to male sexiness. Character is important in male stars. Male handsomeness depends on skills and prowess.Women are impressed with symbols of status, fashionable clothes. Men think women care more about male physique than they do, women think men care about status cues more than they actually do.Fashion is obsessed with novelty, conspicuous display. Fashion is change and obsolescence imposed on a pattern of tyrannical conformity.CHAPTER 10: THE INTELLECTUAL CHESS GAME Brain growth occurred because of Red Queen sexual selection.Sexual practices were largely the product of nurture.18% of our energy goes to the brain. Evolution of intelligence is not neutral.Value of gossip. Man applies his intelligence in social situations. Consciousness operates on a need-to-know policy.Deceiving and detecting deception are the primary uses of intelligence. Deception is the reason for the invention of the subconscious.The neocortex is largely a courtship device to attract and retain sexual mates.Dance, music, humor, and sexual foreplay are unique to humans. Sexual fascination of music is obvious.The head is the human equivalent of the peacock's tail according to sexual selection theory, but this connection is tenuous. Wit, virtuosity, inventiveness, and individuality turn people on. Be different."
74,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101821112-darya-zorab,3,"This book is interesting, but slightly flawed biology book. Ridley's thesis is that sexual selection (in animals of all sorts, not just humans) is responsible for the development of many important traits, rather than pressures from the environment such as the needs to find food, traverse the landscape, avoid predators, etc.... The importance of sexual selection can be easily overlooked, as we seek some sort of environmental advantage in every evolved trait. But the most powerful drivers of evolution are ""Red Queen"" races- instances where the goalposts keep moving, like an arms race, so you have to keep changing in order simply to maintain your genes' commonality from generation to generation. Predatory/prey and organism/parasite are two such relationships, but arguably, an even more acute one arises from competition between members of the same species for mates, and in particular, for the highest-quality mates, whose genes or nurture will give one's offspring the best odds of success.Most of the book focuses on non-human animals, and this is where the book is strongest. Ridley builds off of the gene-centered view of evolution first brought to prominence by Dawkins' ""The Selfish Gene,"" and some of Ridley's best content focuses on the ways whereby what promotes the commonality of a gene differs from what helps the organism to survive and reproduce. (Perhaps reading Dawkins' book would provide more detail on these things.) Another good part of Ridley's book is his discussion of why sexual selection persists and became common, even though it carries a tremendous, 4x penalty over asexual reproduction in terms of passing a single organism's genes to the next generation (half as many children, each of which has half of a single parent's genes).Ridley shows that humans, like all animals, have been shaped by the pressure of sexual selection as an evolutionary driver. However, Ridley doesn't spend much time on fairly simple examples like height, which would seem to be comparatively easy to prove (a preference for tall men is common among women across many cultures, and that results in taller children of both sexes, changing the goalposts for what counts as ""tall""). Instead, Ridley tries to explain aspects of ""human nature"" as results of evolutionary effects of sexual selection. He may be right to varying degrees, depending on which trait one is considering, but the connections are more tenuous, and it's harder to even measure the strength and commonality of various parts of ""human nature."" He also gets a little overly-defensive about his views, apparently out of a fear that someone might accuse him of promoting sexism, racism, or provide backing to eugenics (each of which he explicitly disavows).My favorite part of the section on humans concerned not human nature per se, but the development of intelligence. Ridley points out that the levels of intelligence achieved by homo sapiens are vastly in excess of what is required to solve any of the problems or challenges people encountered in prehistoric Africa. The most likely explanation, Ridley claims, is that intelligence was helpful in securing mates (whether via being charming, good at judging others' character, trickery, etc.), and only the challenge posed by the need to compete with and outwit other humans could explain the relentless march toward greater and greater intelligence in human ancestors. (He does not address why other animals, many of whom also compete for mates, might not face the same pressure for intelligence.)Overall, I found the book to be interesting, but some of the best parts felt like a trailer for Dawkins' ""The Selfish Gene,"" and some of the other parts felt like a bit too much speculation, leaving me uncertain of what actually is the cause of various biological features. At the least, the book does a good job giving you a feel for the terrifying complexity of disentangling the reasons behind the evolution of a particular animal: you have to understand what happens over vast time scales, at the level of proteins and genes (sometimes orthogonal to or even contrary to the organism's interests), at the level of survival in the environment, and in the context of a competition for the best mates with strongly cultural aspects. It makes me feel that one must be humble when espousing a theory purporting to explain the workings of evolution: though the core concept of survival and propagation of genes seems simple, it is anything but.For those readers interested in a look at evolution outside the context of biology, as a substrate-independent algorithm for finding niches, optimizing, and seeking out new local maxima of welfare, I recommend ""The Origin of Wealth"" by Eric Beinhocker. Beinhocker's book is far superior to ""The Red Queen"" and provides a very helpful framework for understanding the effects of evolution without respect to biology. This then makes biology an application of a more general principle, which may be more intellectually satisfying."
75,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66276739-adam-marischuk,2,"Leave it to a British Lord to make sex boring.I went into this book with relatively high expectations, hoping for something like 'The Naked Ape' but with a focus on what is inherently attention grabbing. However, the first half of the book (literally chapters 1-5 out of 10 chapters) were excruciatingly boring with numerous rather interesting references to fish and bird reproduction. But the sum of all these anecdots is more than the whole five chapters. It was only my stubborn determination to continue that made me finish the book.And I'm glad that I did.Though the first five chapters are dominated by the (boring) question of why sex, as opposed to other forms of reproduction such as asexual or autogamy, the subsequent chapters cut more to the heart of the matter. The evolutionary drives to sex are interesting. Why do people find certain traits appealing? Why and how do people find partners? How long do these parings last? Why?I am inherently sympathetic to much of the theme, namely ""that there is also, in the same way, a typical human nature"" (p. 3) and that evolutionary biology can help explain much of the phenomena we experience each day with regards to sex, behaviour and beauty. Especially as this relates to sexual preferences and attraction and differences between males and females. But for all that agreement, the first half of the book is painful reading.It is a little amusing that he starts the book with the dismissal of those who opposed evolution (religious extremists) and the hope of convincing those who oppose human nature (sociologists): To those who believe that the world was made in seven days by a man with a long beard and that therefore human nature cannot have been designed by selection but by an Intelligence, I merely bid a respectful good day. We have little common ground on which to argue because I share few of your assumptions. As for those who protest that human nature did not evolve, but was invented de novo by something called ""culture,"" I have more hope. (p. 6)Only by the end to notice that the real opponent of science today is ""political correctness [that] will no doubt stifle inquiries it does not like, such as those into the mental differences between men and women."" (p. 349) Back in the early 1990s I suppose that there was a period of transition (even noted from the beginning to the end of the book), but perhaps today he sees that his allies do not sit in academic chairs in social science departments.Which brings me to three major criticisms. Firstly, and this is hardly Dr Ridley's fault, the section on homosexuality needs updating and quite frankly more research. But is wasn't the religious right which has bared such research from 1993 until today.Secondarily, in the numerous examples and parallels to animals priority needs to be given to those animals closest to humans for evolutionary reasons: It is the purest nonsense to abandon the perspective of comparisons with other animals just because of our hubristic belief that humans alone are learning creatures...I make no apologies for mixing animals and human beings together in this book.There is significantly less parallel value in the sexual habits of birds and fish than mammals and other primates but the distinction is rarely made when looking for parallel behaviour. Just because peacocks and peahens exhibit a certain behaviour doesn't carry the same weight as chimpanzees in an argument about sex and human nature.And finally, to misquote Oscar Wilde ""Everything is about sex except sex. Sex is about power."" I agree that reproduction is the driving force in evolution, but I am wary of any all-encompassing theory which claims to answer everything. Man, especially man, is motivated by sex, but not uniquely, solely or even majorly at certain times in life or even the day. Is sex (or reproduction) the end or the means to an end? Is there an end at all outside of our own creation?"
76,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1398873-frank-stein,4,"The central metaphor that animates this book is that most of evolution imitates Lewis Carroll's the Red Queen. The Red Queen runs very fast, but gets nowhere, because the landscape moves even faster. Matt Ridley argues that evolution is rarely about mundane issues of ""fitness for the environment,"" which can be easily solved, but about constantly making males (and, in humans, both males and females), more sexually enticing to their mates than their competitors. All species are constantly ""evolving,"" but often just relative to each other. Whether it be the peafowls feathers or the birds' songs, or, more interestingly, human intelligence and art, all are mainly about enticing the opposite sex, which is more important to evolutionary ""success"" than mere survival.Ridley speculates that sex itself arose as a way to outwit parasites, who tended to quickly evolve invasive proteins and attacks that could overcome hosts' defenses. Sex allowed constantly original combinations of genetic sequences that parasites would have more difficulty unraveling, and kept recessive and other genes in reserve in different populations that could emerge in case of epidemics. Much of mate selection was about finding resistance to disease. But much of mate selection also had to do with what other animals would think was ""sexy"" in the future, what is known as the Ronald Fisher ""sexy son"" hypothesis. Since, in most animals, males are indiscriminate (because they only gain from sex, and rarely lose more than a few moments) while females are careful (they must care and nurture babies for months or years), natural selection picks for females who themselves select males who will help them produce a sexually attractive male son. This sexy son selection can spiral out of control in a self-referential loop that ends with burdensome peacock plumage. Or, in humans, it can lead to the evolution of intelligence to entice men and women.Despite the title, humans don't really make an appearance until halfway through the book, and it is here that Ridley admits his ideas are sketchier than with the animals, yet he has many original and worthwhile insights. For instance, the very fact that human females have strong secondary sexual characteristics (developed breasts, butts, etc.), shows that human males, like many species of bird, are somewhat monogamous, since it shows that females have been selected to appeal to men for the long-term in a way that means males are fairly discriminating. At the same time, it is our combination of semi-monogamy (the tendency of humans to engage in adultery explains our relatively constant sex drives outside female fertile periods, both in order for women to either cheat on their male mates when they choose, and keep them busy when they're around), and large combined-sex group life, which leads to both sexes being selected for long-term intelligence and creativity, for what Ridley and others call the ""Scherezade effect,"" namely, to keep our lovers entertained with us.In the conclusion, Ridley oddly admits that maybe half of the ideas in the book are wrong. Unlike many evolutionary biologists, he admits that much of such work is based on speculation. Yet it is speculation based in the undeniable Darwinian truths about life (much as economic speculation is based on undeniable truths about human attempts at self-betterment). With frequent and instructive comparisons to the animal kingdom, he shows that any understanding of humans has to deal with the fact that the urge to reproduce has shaped us in every possible way. Our intelligence itself emerged in order to help us better understand and seduce our neighbors, but has led to all sorts of other, actually secondary, creative activity and thought. This book is a shining example of such evolved thought."

On the one hand, you have those who claim human behavior is solely attributed to cultural upbringing; whereas on the other, you have those who claim that the nature of human behavior can be understood as a result of animalistic forces. This book lies on the latter side of the spectrum.There is an intrinsic property in evolutionary biology, this property is called the Red Queen. The Red Queen is nature herself; in her kingdom you must keep moving in order to stay static. This book discusses human nature within the context of the Red Queen—that how different evolutionary forces shape it in a dynamic way—and discusses it with regards to reproduction. The first part of the book uses examples from the animal kingdom, even plants occasionally, to draw parallels between evolution and human behavior. The second part, which was more interesting to my liking, focuses solely on human behavior. All in all, I say this is an interesting book to read. I especially liked how it covered some asymmetric aspects regarding behavior of different genders and societal structures."

General principle: Things don't over-evolve, and they evolve for a reason, even if we don't know what that reason is. In physics, there is no great difference between a why question and a how question. How does the earth go around the sun? By gravitational attraction. Why does the earth go around the sun? Because of gravity. Evolution, however, causes biology to be a very different game because it includes contingent history. As anthropologist Lionel Tiger has put it, ""We are perforce in some sense constrained, goaded, or at least affected by the accumulated impact of selective decisions made over thousands of generations.' Gravity is gravity however history deals its dice. A peacock is a showy peacock because at some point in history ancestral peahens stopped picking their mates according to mundane utilitarian criteria and instead began to follow a fashion for preferring elaborate display. Every living creature is a product of its past. When a neo-Darwinian asks, ""Why? "" he is really asking, ""How did this come about? "" He is a historian.Just as parasites depend on their hosts and yet make them suffer, and just as animals exploit their mates and yet need them, so the Red Queen never appears without another theme being sounded: the theme of intermingled cooperation and conflict. Marriage teeters on the line between a cooperative venture and a form of mutual exploitation —ask any divorce lawyer. Successful marriages so submerge the costs under mutual benefits that the cooperation can predominate; unsuccessful ones do not:It is almost the definition of sex that it breaks up combinations of genes.He had discovered that the notion of a host-parasite arms race is one of the most basic and unavoidable consequences of evolution.""Arms race analogies are flawed, though. In a real arms race, an old weapon rarely regains its advantage.Evolution is good for species, and so they strive to make it go faster. Yet it is stasis, not change, that is the hallmark of evolution. Sex and gene repair and the sophisticated screening mechanisms of higher animals to ensure that only defect-free eggs and sperm contribute to the next generation—all these are ways of preventing change.The essence of sex in our theory, "" wrote Hamilton, ""is that it stores genes that are currently bad but have promise for reuse. It continually tries them in combination, waiting for the time when the focus of disadvantage has moved elsewhere. "" There is no permanent ideal of disease resistance, merely the shifting sands of impermanent obsolescence:'So you should have sons if you have reason to think they will do well and daughters if you have reason to think they will do poorly—relative to others in the population:'°The gender that invests the most in creating and rearing the offspring, and so forgoes most opportunities for creating and rearing other offspring, is the gender that has the least to gain from each extra mating. If many women chose to be second wives of rich men rather than first wives of poor men, there would be a shortage of unmarried women, and many men would be: forced to remain unhappily celibate. Far from being laws to protect women, anti-polygamy statutes may really do more to protect men.'If reproduction has been the reward and goal of power and wealth, then it is little wonder that it has also been a frequent cause and reward of violence. This is presumably the reason that the early Church became so obsessed with matters of sex. It recognized sexual competition to be one of the principal causes of murder and mayhem. The gradual synonymy of sex and sin in Christendom is surely based more on the fact that sex often leads to trouble rather than that there is anything inherently sinful about sex.Wilson and Daly reflect on the fact that love is an admired emotion, whereas jealousy is a despised one, but they are plainly two sides of the same coin—as anybody who has been in love can testify: They are both part of a sexual proprietary claim: As many a modern couple knows, the absence of jealousy, far from calming a relationship, is itself a cause of insecurity. If he or she is not jealous when I pay attention to another man or woman, then he or she no longer cares whether our relationship survives: Psychologists have found that couples who lack moments of jealousy are less likely to stay together than jealous ones:To a man, stopping to ask the way is an admission of defeat, something status-conscious males avoid at all costs: To a woman, it is common sense and plays on her strengths in social skills.Since the bane of all organizations, whether they are companies, charities, or governments, is that they reward cunning ambition rather than ability (the people who are good at getting to the top are not necessarily the people who are best at doing the job) and since men are more endowed with such ambition than women, it is absolutely right that promotion should be biased in favour of women—not to redress prejudice but to redress human nature.Humphrey suggested that mankind uses his intellect mainly in social situations. ""The game of social plot and counter-plot cannot be played merely on the basis of accumulated knowledge, any more than a game of chess can.""A person must calculate the consequences of his own behaviour and calculate the likely behaviour of others: For that he needs at least a glimpse of his own motives in order to guess the things that are going through others ' minds in similar situations, and it was this need for self-knowledge that drove the increase in conscious awareness.'Hypothesis: The choosiness of human beings in picking their mates has driven the human mind into a history of frenzied expansion for no reason except that wit, virtuosity, inventiveness, and individuality turn other people on."

I can accept why I am so drawn (unsuccessfully) to having sex with multiple women. I (like all men) am programmed for it by my genetics. The premises are not rocket science, and conform to all the old stereotypes (and reject postmodern explanations). They are just so well explained and make sense for me to be the way I am.It has also given me a clearer understanding of the motivations of women (which again conform to all the old stereotypes) from an evolutionary perspective.

He is a balding, bad toothed, aristocrat, who has been successful in business and writing. I will accept his expertise on that matter."
86,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59189347-ken-muldrew,4,"Matt Ridley’s “The Red Queen”, is a provocative look at sex and its influence on evolution, with a focus on applying insights from this investigation into an understanding of human nature. Ridley flatly rejects any notion that human behavior is solely a product of culture, a point that is trivially obvious to biologists but highly contentious among social scientists and many public intellectuals. The book, published in the mid 90s, is wary of the controversy but stands out for its willingness to tackle these subjects in a way that would be more difficult today, given the recently developed mechanisms of coordinated public shunning through social media. Often Ridley is deliberately provocative, only backing off to a position of scepticism after having presented a position as if it were factual. The lack of preceding caveats take some getting used to given that we are more conditioned to register instant outrage on the slightest pretence these days. More troubling is his continued use of reasoning from a particular view of evolution by natural selection to accept or dismiss hypotheses. This view assumes that genetic fitness is a linear quantity that exists in a never-changing fitness landscape; that one can determine the eventual success or failure of a genetic novelty by its relative advantage in a single generation. This is an absurd position that neglects co-evolution of species as well as ecological drift, and even collapse; processes that are inherently nonlinear and unpredictable. Ridley himself often shows why the flat fitness landscape is severely limited as an evolutionary heuristic—indeed, the Red Queen hypothesis itself is exhibit A—yet he continues to use that assumption throughout the book. This is frustrating but far from a lethal defect. The book is chock full of fascinating and unintuitive ideas, often with reliable evidence to support them, and is presented in a stimulating and highly readable format.The first question Ridley addresses is, why sex at all? Recalling that evolution is not a goal directed process, why would organisms that reproduce sexually be more likely to survive than those that reproduce asexually. Needless to say, the flat fitness landscape argues strongly against sex because it is rather expensive in terms of resources required for the number of progeny produced. The traditional explanation, that sex makes organisms adaptable and quick to change through genetic recombination (known as the “Vicar of Bray” hypothesis) assumes that organisms are predisposed to change so that progress may occur. Most of the time, however, a new generation faces exactly the same environment as its parents, so staying the same is a far better way to ensure survival than trying out some random changes with every generation. The handicap of sex, plus the additional handicap that most random changes are likely to be detrimental, has to persist until the environment does change (making adaptability an advantage). If this takes hundreds of generations, then sex would seem to be too costly.The answer to this dilemma comes from ecology, but surprisingly not from the long-term effects of ecological change. We are prone to overlook what we cannot easily observe and so we commonly see an ecological environment in terms of the larger organisms that inhabit it; the food chains and the predator-prey relations that exist in that environment. In addition, we also fall into the same trap that economists are predisposed to and see competition and efficiency as the dominant mechanism and goal of the system. A better way of looking at evolving systems is to consider a triangle where competition, cooperation, and parasitism are the generalized mechanisms by which individuals interact. Competition drives efficiency and scarcity creating a niche for cooperation, a process that drives novelty and surplus creating a niche for parasitism to skim off the surplus, a process that drives diversity, thereby creating a niche for competition. Parasites are the reason why the diversity provided by sexual reproduction can give a survival advantage in the near term that is sufficient to overcome the cost when compared to asexual reproduction. The Red Queen hypothesis (named after the character in Alice in Wonderland who has to run as fast as she can just to stay in the same place) states that parasites and their hosts are engaged in a process of mutual escalation (like an arms race) where strategies have to continually evolve for hosts to evade parasitic attack and for parasites to get past the host’s defences. Ridley presents several lines of evidence to support the hypothesis and an interesting look at an asexual organism that also provides support: the bdelloid rotifers are ancient organisms that reproduce purely asexually. However, their life cycle includes a “tun” form in which they become almost entirely desiccated. Desiccation also turns out to be an effective mechanism to get rid of parasites.With the reason for sex now revealed, the further question of why there are different sex-genders (I use the term “sex-gender” to refer to biologically male or female; Ridley uses “gender” despite it being controversial in the mid 90s but as it is now fully claimed as term for a social construct, I add the prefix “sex” for clarity. Clearly such a noun is useful and must refer unambiguously to physical reality and not social). Many plants are successful as hermaphrodites and there is no obvious reason why animals should not also be hermaphroditic, providing they are outbred. The answer would seem to be that having two (or more) sex-genders would add a new type of selective process to evolution—sexual selection, the topic of Darwin’s book, “The Descent of Man”. Since this is also the topic of the rest of this book, it is strange that Ridley is not more emphatic about proposing this as an answer; instead he pursues somewhat esoteric theories of competition between genes.With that somewhat weak segue, we take up the fascinating tale of the Peacock’s tail, and sexual selection as an adjunct to evolution. Darwin had originally suggested that sexual selection was based on aesthetics but was unable to offer any persuasive evidence. His contemporaries rejected the idea of female choice and instead favoured competition between males as the sole discriminant for mate selection. It took 60 or 70 years for Darwin’s ideas to be taken seriously once again, however the idea of aesthetic choice has been modified so that some underlying mechanism relating success with genetic fitness is behind sexual selection. One such mechanism is that the gaudy displays that males often use are handicaps to survival, therefore the signal is a costly one. The male who can not only survive, but also thrive with such a handicap must have excellent genes and is thus a good choice for a mate. Another idea is that gaudy displays are often colourful and pigmented tissues reveal the presence of parasites. Since the tissues are purely ornamental, the parasites are not severe handicaps to their hosts, but they nevertheless reveal a lesser genetic fitness to potential mates. One of the themes of sexual selection based on ornamental physical traits is that such selection drives the exaggeration of these traits to the limit that remains compatible with continued survival; a theme that Ridley returns to at the close of the book.From sexual selection in animals, Ridley then pivots to the most provocative and controversial section of the book, sexual selection in humans and the consequences of that for inherent human nature. In animals, to the extent that males invest less effort in raising offspring, they seek increased quantity of mates, while to the extent that females invest more effort they seek quality of mates. Ridley shows that the same principle is at work in humans with males being opportunistically polygamous while females are more firmly monogamous though seeking occasional adulterous affairs. This is a caricature of what is actually a lengthy exploration of observational evidence of human sexual preferences along with comparisons to animal preferences that might shed light on the evolutionary pressures involved.Ridley then proceeds into what is almost forbidden territory today, the differences between human male and female cognitive abilities (innate abilities, not those due to social conditioning). It is a simple fact that hormone levels affect growth and development of all tissues differentially and that males and females have different hormone levels. It is no less a fact that human males have subjugated females throughout recorded history, often justifying this inequality on biological differences. Ridley studiously attempts to avoid historical prejudice in his analysis, but he does conclude that sex-gender based roles have some basis in cognitive abilities shaped by sexual selection during the Pleistocene. He is utterly opposed to nonsense relating to “intelligence”, looking only at general notions of spatial or verbal orientation, but many modern readers will find this section to venture into the unspeakable, despite the relatively recent vintage.The final section looks at whether sexual selection can tell us anything about the evolution of humans from a rather ordinary plains-ape, found on the African savannah six million years ago. Noting that the exceptionally rapid increase in brain size has similarities to the ornamental displays that are the hallmarks of many traits subject to sexual selection, Ridley proposes that human’s immense brains might be no more than a decorative feature that females found attractive: a peacock’s tail. He ignores the facts that the trait is not sex-specific, nor is it a costly signal (just the opposite, in fact). Such evidence as Ridley does provide, supports the hypothesis that our large brains developed for doing counterfactual modelling of other humans’ reasoning far better than the sexual selection hypothesis. Nevertheless, he is not very committed to any particular point of view here. Ridley closes with the admonition that our hyper-social species has clearly been shaped by sexual selection to a large degree, so we will reduce inequality and subjugation to a far better degree if we understand it (and by understanding he means to use the scientific method to study it) than if we prevent investigation by insisting on equality by fiat."
87,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50614697-sb,5,"This book is incredible; if you would like to know the answer as to why there are only two genders, if men really are better at reading maps than women and what people find attractive in a mate then read on...This review is a mammoth, but unlike the mammoth will hopefully be around for a long time (insha’allah): Ridley starts off as describing the central theme of our evolution as sexual, ""everything can be inherited except sterility."" The book touches heavily on Richard Dawkin's The Selfish Gene and builds on his work, focusing on Dawkins' premise that as bodies (unlike genes) do not replicate themselves but are grown, they were clearly designed as an evolutionary vehicle for our precious DNA. Survival of the fittest is more applicable to our genes than to us as species, as our genes do things that perpetuate the genes (like eat, survive, have sex etc), in order to spread themselves. Ridley likens our evolution to the movement of the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland; the notion that we are constantly on the run but never really getting anywhere- referring to our constant battle with parasites and diseases that threaten our existence. Sex is the vehicle through which our genes are able to better defend themselves against enemies.Sexual selection means that whatever traits improve reproductive success will spread, even at the expense of survival (casual sex could be a good example; even though the body may die through STDs contracted, the genes will live on in another human being that may be born as a result of casual sex. Genes always see the greater good btw, they’re utilitarians like that). Testosterone is another good example of this as whilst it increases male virility, it also increases susceptibility to infectious diseases. Men are therefore more susceptible to infectious diseases than women, “it is as if male animals have a finite sum of energy, which they can spend on testosterone or immunity to disease, but not both.” This is also presumably why men don’t tend to live as long as women.Ridley also compares the progress of sexual vs asexual species, because whilst in theory, asexual beings can evolve and reproduce faster- they don’t need to wait for another being to have sex to reproduce, homo sapiens and other sexual species fare far better than asexual ones and are more resilient as a result of sex (and recombination). Asexual species also are genetically uniform, so if one being is susceptible to disease, then they all are. This is not the case with homo sapiens in which “reproduction of the fittest” takes place, e.g. the black plague and other epidemics that have ravaged large swathes of the population and left only those resilient enough to withstand the disease and reproduce. “Breeding asexually is like having lots of lottery tickets all with the same number. To stand a chance of winning, you need lots of different tickets.” Sex also increases randomness and variety, making a few creatures exceptional and a few abysmal, whereas asex makes them all average.As a result of sex, our intellects have evolved to make us individually more sexually attractive. Deception forms part of our intellect and within our species it matters not how smart, funny or witty you are, but how much smarter, funnier and witter you are compared to your rivals, “the closest competitor a creature is every likely to meet is a member of its own species.” The same goes for looks; in a society where everyone is beautiful, the standard of beauty naturally rises. The reason people find other people attractive today is because these people are significantly more attractive than other people. Ridley notes that sex has evolved from the processes of gene repair, noting that the processes in human cells are the same. Dealing with damaged DNA, “repair enzymes have no way of knowing what to repair the DNA to [...] they need a template of what the gene used to look like. Sex provides it [producing] the gene from another creature or from another chromosome in the same creature.” Ridley notes that “At high altitudes and high latitudes many plants seem to abandon sex…” he is referring to the fact that extreme temperatures seem to encourage asexuality, but I’d like to point out the similarities between plants and homo sapiens and how there are less people in the arctic and other high latitude countries, compared to countries closer to the Equator, meaning that the more extreme the temperature, the more asexual (or nonsexual) people become. Mm-hm. But I digress.”In big, long-lived, slow-breeding creatures in stable environments, sex is the rule.” That’s us by the way. Sickle-cell anaemia mutation is normally touted as a bad thing, but that is only if you have two copies of the sickle cell gene, which is fatal. On the other hand, if you have just one copy, you are actually immune to malaria and most cases of sickle cell anaemia occur in places with high occurences of malaria, showing the mutations our bodies have developed in response to a threat (though sexual selection, as with a lot of mutations can go too far and threaten our survival.) With sickle cell genes, presumably the cost of too much of a good thing resulting in a sick human, is better than getting sick from malaria. Additionally, though genes often have ‘identity interest’, i.e. ‘if I end up killing my host, then I die too’, genes continue to spread, even at the expense of survival. So, no gene wants to commit suicide or ‘bow out’ because it might kill the host, “fuck that man, if I die, you die,” is the gene’s motto. Evolutionary biologists tear their hair out at the idea of most people’s concept of evolution, which is contrary to what actually happens, “species do not change much, they stay exactly the same for thousands of generations and are suddenly replaced by other lifeforms.” The idea of a gradual evolution of a species from its previous forms only really happens on small island or in tiny populations. Ridley remarks that “it is stasis, not change, that is the hallmark of evolution. Sex, and gene repair and the sophisticated mechanisms of animals to ensure that only defect-free eggs and sperm contribute to the next generation- these are all ways of preventing change [...] There is no evidence yet found that any creature ever does anything other than try to keep its mutation rate as low as possible. It strives for a mutation rate of zero. Evolution depends on the fact that it fails.” Likening our survival to the movements of the Red Queen (constantly running but never actually moving), the probability of extinction has nothing to do with how long a group has existed; species do not get better at surviving; their chances of extinction are random. Hence, the constant recombination during procreation that produces varied offspring in the hopes that just one or two will make it through. Survival is a zero-sum game. Ridley points to physical factors rarely being the thing that kills animals (what about the ice age?) but far more often it is other predators and creatures that prevent them from reproducing; he uses the example of a starving water flea in a crowded pond, who is actually the victim of competition and not food shortage. Parasites are a far bigger danger to most animals than we think, partly because they’re so small (especially in relation to predators which are so large). Remember the bigger an animal, the longer it lives. Relative to their hosts, parasites are tiny and therefore have shorter lives and pass through more generations in a given time to their hosts. This gives them more time to recombine their genes and evolve, growing more resilient and designing mechanisms to overcome the defence’s of its host. “Parasites provide exactly the incentive to change genes every generation.”A woman needs a man, just like a fish needs a bicycle- except genetically (much as it pains me to say); “men are women’s insurance policy against her children being wiped out by disease.” Sex is all about disease. To many it may not make sense as to why there are only two genders; having two is far more limiting than one, as if one were so inclined, one could only reproduce with 50% of the population when there are two genders. Why are people not hermaphrodites, meaning that we could mate with 100% of people we meet?It is a curious statistical fact that all forty-two presidents of the USA (ok you can tell this was written a while ago) have between them ninety sons and sixty-one daughters. Royalty and aristocrats are also know for having slightly more sons than daughters. The inference is that animals have some degree of control over the sex of their baby, though it is unconscious and based on environment, “think of it as a competition to have the most grandchildren possible. If males are polygamous, a successful son can give you far more grandchildren than a successful daughter,” males obviously being able to impregnate far more women in the course of twenty-four hours and women having a chance slimmer than Victoria Beckham of becoming pregnant in twenty-four hours (which they can only do once by the way). Basically, you should have sons if you think they will succeed and daughters if you think they might do poorly- relative to the general population, that is. Ridley’s example of politicians and aristocats may be a bit misleading though, as we don’t know when these children were born (unless he wants to argue that people who get to the top have always been at the top and therefore are more likely to have more sons? I’m thinking of Obama who had two daughters, would Ridley be saying that he is NOW more likely to have a son (while in the White House) or that he’s always been more likely to have a son since he clearly has a presidential quality?! When were all these 90+ sons born, before during or after office?)In terms of polygamy, laws against it actually do more to help men than they do women. Many women might choose to become the second wives of rich men (amen!), rather than first wives of poor men and the additional family members would certainly help with child-rearing. Monies and honies would therefore be concentrated in the homes of extortionately rich men, meaning that many poor men would be forced to remain celibate and unmarried, due to the shortage of available women, who’ve all chosen to become additional wives of wealthy men. The chances of getting pregnant vary depending on conditions; women who do not orgasm or orgasm too soon retain very little of the sperm ejaculated into them. Late orgasms and orgasms experienced by women who haven’t had sex for a long time mean that most of the sperm stays inside, (presumably because they have less sex and so the need to get pregnant THIS TIME is high). In women who are faithful to their husbands, around 55% of their orgasms were of the more fertile type. In unfaithful women, only 40% with their official partners were fertile, but 70% of their trysts with their lover were fertile. This leads rise to the idea that women too are seeking the perfect set of genes for their offspring and conceding the fact that the man who is best suited to raise your children and the man with the good genes may not be the same man. , I mean the guy with the good genes- let’s face it- is hot, has a great body, is very funny and smart- but he’s unlikely to stick around to help look after your kids, hence the need to cuckold your partner and get him to take care of your children, after the dangerous liaisons with your partner have disappeared. It was also noted that the women who did cuckold their husbands, tended to have sex with their lovers during the times of the month in which they were most fertile. In the end they could have had twice as much sex with their husband, but were still more than twice as likely to conceive the children of the lover. Ridley also notes that men whose wives have been with them all day ejaculate much smaller amounts than men whose wives have been absent all day, “almost as if the males are subconsciously compensating for any opportunities for female infidelity.” This is due to competition between sperm in the uterus. “Cuckoldry is an asymmetrical fate. A women loses no genetic investment if her husband is unfaithful but her husband risks raising someone else’s child. As if to reassure fathers, research shows that people are more likely to say that a baby looks like their father, rather than they look just like their mother.” For these reasons Ridley argues that adultery committed by the female is punished more heavily than the male- for the risk to genes that it presents to a family. In terms of “keeping it in the family,” all humans are designed by default not to become attracted to anyone they grew up with, who, just by virtue of having grown up with them, is likely to be their kin. (Although strangely enough the opposite happens and there have been many stories of long lost immediate family members falling head over heels in love having met for the first time in adulthood. From a genetic perspective this makes absolutely no sense, as you both will share 50% of the same DNA and any genetic defects and mutations are more likely to manifest in your offspring, who will share something absurd like 75% of your DNA. Not to mention that we’re generally attracted to people whose immune systems are completely different to our own, making us more resilient against disease. Anyway.) Laws against incest have nothing to do with the business of genetics but were more about rulers “trying to prevent wealth concentration by families other than their own; they usually excepted themselves from such a law.”Ridley argues that men and women have completely different brains, but that there are not specific genes to be found in men to make men more aggressive and women more nurturing, rather the genes that survived were the ones that responded to gender, i.e. “if in a male, improve the sense of direction; if in a female, improve their social intuition.” These genes alter brains in response to male hormones (with the default brain being female until bombarded with testosterone) therefore, “the mental differences between men and women are caused by genes that respond to testosterone.” Other interesting bits:-The reason that women often don’t find men attractive upon first meeting then is because ‘a propensity to be aroused by the sight of males would promote random matings from which a female would have nothing to gain reproductively and a great deal to lose.”-Left-handed people are better at spatial tasks (i.e. map-reading)-The genes for height are really only genes for responding to diet by growing-Women who make more money on average actually pay more attention to a man’s salary-The physical attractiveness of a woman is a far better predictor of the occupational status of the man she married than was her own socio-economic status, intelligence or education-“Nurture always reinforces nature; it rarely fights it.” Nature= being left-handed, nurture= trying to write with your right hand and failing (or even if you do succeed, causing a lot of problems for your brain)."

However, I'd recommend his other book The Origins of Virtue on altruism and cooperation as a better starting point to his writings on evolution. Also, Robert Wright's The Moral Animal, which doesn't delve into the puzzle of sex, may be a better introduction to the consequences of sexual selection.The Red Queen often takes deep dives into the opposing theories in academia around both the function of sex and its consequences on animal and humans. This may be a little tedious unless are already quite interested in evolution.
Sex as a puzzle
Ridley embraces evolutionary psychology maintaining that understanding evolution (especially sexual selection) is key to understanding human nature. After establishing the importance of sex, Ridley presents its existence as an enigma. In fact, it was a major puzzle for evolutionary biologists for a long time. William Hamilton, even having conjectured several explanations of its function, described sex as ""kind of crisis at hand in evolutionary biology"". John Maynard Smith, another one of the leading members of the neo-Darwinism of the 1960s and 1970s, was also pessimistic: ""One is left with the feeling that some essential feature of the situation is being overlooked"". The reason that sex has been such a mystery is quite simple: it is twice as costly, in evolutionary terms, as asexual reproduction. Sexually reproducing only passes on half of your genes to your offspring. 
Parasites and The Red Queen
The key to the enigma is what Ridley describes as The Red Queen, a metaphor from Through the Looking Glass where Alice stumbles on a red queen chess piece who is constantly running but always ends up in the same place as the landscape moves with her. The Red Queen, which can be best understood as an arms race, is prevalent in evolution where there are living foes. The lion becomes a better at chasing but the antelope becomes better at running away. There is never any relative progress. The enemy that keeps fighting back that sex aims to keep one step ahead of is the parasite. As parasites will have an easier time if our genes remain constant they ""provide exactly the incentive to change genes every generation that sex seems to demand. The success of the genes that defended you so well in the last generation may be the best of reasons to abandon these same gene combination in the next."" 
Consequences of sexual selection: differences between the genders
Ridley then moves on to the consequences of sexual selection. He draws from Robert Trivers important insight in the early 70s on parental investment and sexual selection. Namely, the gender that invests more in creating and rearing each offspring has the least to gain from extra mates. An easy way to think about it is if a man is on an island with 100 woman he can have 100 offspring in a year. In the reverse situation a woman can only have one. Sperm is cheap, and eggs are costly. This results, as argued by Trivers and Ridley, in different optimal sexual strategies for the two genders: men care more about quantity and woman care more about quality. It pays more (in an evolutionary sense) for men to have more partners. As female's reproduction ability is scarce, males must do the courting and fight over them. This is seen throughout the animal world. There are even exceptions that prove the rule such as the sea horse where males invest more in offspring and the female is the one who courts. Ridley then extends this to humans attempting to explain attraction and mating preferences and how they differ between males and females. "

The author lost me as he discussed inborn preferences for women to prefer tall wealthy men and men to seek beautiful young women. (I am a professional woman married to a wonderful tradesmanwho I love deeply) He does redeem himself a bit at the end discussing how it may be our brains evolved to tempt each other with our wit and cleverness. Interesting ideas, but questionable conclusions."
90,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23706873-igor-faynshteyn,4,"This is the 3rd book I have read by Matt Ridley. The others were ""Genome"" and ""Agile Gene"". Matt Ridley is a fabulous writer, intelligent and very knowledgeable in the evolutionary science (Ph. D from Oxford in Zoology). His writing style is fluent, non-technical, and quick-paced. This is popular science written truly at its best.However, it is not without drawbacks. Although the narrative is very quick-paced, as mentioned earlier, it is also a disadvantage. Some concepts in the evolutionary science and in some of its more specialized branches, can be difficult to understand, even if technical jargon is omitted. And I say this as someone with a graduate degree in Biological Science. Therefore, sometimes a slower, and more prudent explanation is required in order for the reader to truly understand the concepts at a fundamental and deep level, rather than just superficially.This is precisely what I found missing throughout much of the book, due mainly to the fact that Ridley's page-turning narrative draws you in to read it quickly, and even skim on some material, giving one the impression that the material is easy and even common sensical. This was especially true in the first half of the book, where the various fundamental and core sexual selection theoretical concepts are explained, most of which apply to plants and lower and lesser complex organisms. Thus, I found myself frequently re-reading passages multiple times over. In this sense, Richard Dawkins is a much better writer and explainer of evolutionary science concepts and ideas (I would highly recommend reading Dawkins's ""Selfish Gene"" prior to this book).However, if one is patient enough to get through the preliminary material in the first half of the book, which proverbially sets the stage for the second half, the book gets better. This is so because in the second half of the book Ridley applies the concepts learned in the first half of the book to primates and humans. Many interesting and juicy topics are discussed, such as polygamy, homosexuality, sexual attraction and etc.Another somewhat minor criticism is that I found that Ridley did a mediocre job synthesizing the material. There are quite a few chapters, and sections within chapters, in the book. Most sections are on average 3-4 pages long, and are only loosely organized. It was difficult to find solid and unifying themes within chapters, as the material is somewhat loosely scattered throughout the book, including some redundancies (albeit not extensive). Clearly, Ridley read and got acquainted with many research papers, monographs and other material for this book, but did a mediocre job assembling and synthesizing the material. And to the extent that Ridley contributed his own originality to it, it was only superficial at best. He touches on some philosophical and cognitive science themes, linguistics and etc. But the he never provides in depth treatment of any. Nevertheless, if one is patient and interested enough in the material, then these relatively minor issues shouldn't take much away from the book.Lastly, this is a book strictly about science. There are no ethical, moral or religious issues discussed in the book (except only to the extent that some are related to evolution). It should also be noted that, even as the author himself admits, it is not the final word on the topic(s) covered. Many theories are solid and backed by much evidence; others are more speculative and supported by weaker and inconsistent evidence. Thus, one must be careful not to formulate very strong conclusions about every topic covered."
91,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7052966-sofia,3,"It took me a while to understand the connection in the title of the book. The Red Queen refers to the character from Lewis Carroll's book Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There, in particular the scene where she is running as fast as the wind but everything stays in the same place. This is - apparently - a popular analogy for evolution and progress which can be stated as: ""In reference to an evolutionary system, continuing adaptation is needed in order for a species to maintain its relative fitness amongst the systems being co-evolved with"". More detail here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Quee...How does this relate to sex? Well, it takes a while for the connection to become clear. The book starts off by covering the sexual vs assexual reproduction debate, going back to Charles Darwin, J.B.S. Haldane, Ronald Fisher, George Williams, John Maynard Smith, Richard Dawkins and other specialists that have debated this over the last couple of centuries. I'm glad he provided this background, the evolution (no pun intended) of the discussion is interesting. The author initially covers the three main aspects of the sexual vs assexual debate: biological, genetic and ecological. Some of the explanations offered here reminds me of The Selfish Gene, in particular the discussion of intra-species altruism and why this is a bit of a myth. This is a technical book but not overly complicated. The reasonings are explained and deconstructed clearly and, in my opinion, sufficient anecdotes are provided for those less versed in genetics and biology. For me one of the most effective was the lock-key analogy to describe the attack of pathogens and immune response of our bodies.The Red Queen comes in as the crowning glory (no pun intended - again) of this debate. After covering other arguments and demonstrating why they are not quite right, Ridley offers the Red Queen explanation for preference of sexual over assexual reproduction (i.e. overcrossing of multiple gene sources rather than fabricating copies): the evolutionary race of individuals against their parasites. I don't want to go into much more detail (that's what the book is for!) but it's an interesting take on the problem.He goes into some detail as to why there are (usually) two genders and reasons for difference in their interaction. The last half of the book focuses more on the human aspect of this and how all the points above have led to the type of society we have today. Other subjects were touched upon such as homossexuality and why it exists, why and how beauty is perceived, and even the evolution of intelligence as an attractive trait. In short, the scope is fairly large and ambitious. The second half of the book is more accessible as technicalities decrease significantly and logic-based arguments increase. Oddly, despite being more complicated, I liked the first part better (judging from other reviews, this is the opposite of what most people felt). I also appreciated the epilogue as it is extremely humble and offers the Red Queen as a contribution to the endless sex debate but recognising that it is by no means a final solution."

I liked engaging with the various arguments put forward, and it was certainly a lively read. I thought Ridley came across as arrogant and dismissive of other disciplines, but his writing is easy to read, and he was concise in articulating his arguments.I loved all of the chapters about non-human animals. The experiments were often amusing, and his obvious interest shone through. Later on, when he starts talking about humans, I felt he was arguing somewhat against strawmen. He didn't cite anyone for many of the points he was allegedly arguing against, so you just have to take his word for it that all the other disciplines are irrational and incapable of explaining human nature. I think that's poor academic practice and I wasn't impressed.There are a couple of sections about homosexuality where I didn't feel he explored the issue very well in terms of adaptational value. It's just assumed that there's a ""gay gene"". There's mostly only talk of gay men, none of lesbians, and it's assumed that sexual behaviour is binary (hetero/homo) when we know the largest sexual minority is bisexuals. I'd be interested to see a proper exploration of sexual fluidity and cultural comparison from an evolutionary perspective.This definitely made me want to pick up Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding again, which I had put down a while ago (I find hardbacks physically annoying to read, and always worry about damaging them). He cites Hrdy but I don't think she'd written that when he was writing this. Perhaps a lot of research couldn't be included because this book is 20 years old, so I have the unfair advantage of hindsight.He talks a lot about sexual selection of (human) female traits, but not so much about male ones. I think he could have gone more in depth with that, as it's a really interesting subject. Another book I'm partway through that's full of information on this is Sexual Selection and the Origins of Human Mating Systems. Again, it's published years after Ridley's book, so is much more up to date.Overall: enjoyable, definitely easy to read, sparks thought and debate. It does feel biased against other academic disciplines and the format didn't work so well for the explanations of ""human nature"", and I'd take a lot of what he says with a huge pinch of salt. Good springboard for doing your own research and making your own arguments."

This book presents a really fascinating in-depth examination of this question. New ideas to me that have ample scientific backing get 4 stars! Well written non-fiction and well presented.There are many, many parts of this exploration that I found interesting and informative. Here are a few.@ The general question [posed at the beginning of the book) -> if asexual reproduction is so efficient (one being producing twice as many offspring as two beings) why is it that sexual reproduction has dominated life on Earth's center stage?@ The section in chapter 3 entitled ""The similarity between sex and vaccination""@ The section entitled ""Gossip's Grip"" in chapter 10.""The Alexander-Humphry theory, which is widely known as the Machiavellian hypothesis, sounds rather obvious, but is could never have been proposed in the 1960s before the ""selfish"" revolution in the study of behavior or by anybody steeped in the ways of social science, for it requires a cynical view of animal communications. Until the mid 1970s zoologists thought of animal communication in terms of information transfer: It was in the interests of both the communicator and the recipient that the message be clear, honest, and informative. But as Lord Macaulay put it, ""The object of oratory alone is not truth but persuasion."" In 1978, Richard Dawkins and John Krebs pointed out that animals use communication principally to manipulate one another rather than to transfer information. A bird sings long and eloquently to persuade a female to mate with him or a rival to keep clear of his territory. If he were merely passing on information, he need not make the song so elaborate. Animal communication, said Dawkins and Krebs, is more like human advertising than airline timetables. Even the most mutually beneficial communication, like that between a mother and a baby, is pure manipulation, as every mother who has been woken in the night by a desperate-sounding infant who merely wants company knows. Once scientists had begun thinking in this way, they looked at animal social life in an entirely new light.""@ How modern male humans find female humans attractive in chapter 9's brief section entitled ""Skinny Women"". It's all breast to waist ratio, not actually skinniness. Hence the seemingly maladaptive practice of post-industrial men preferring the skinny women over the more Rubenesque girls.

However, but the skimming has given me new thoughts and insights into the human psyche and our relationship to relationships, as well as to the relationship to relationships amongst various animals. "
96,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2417840-jesse-b,4,"This is a pretty compressed but well thought out book. It attempts to point out and understand the mechanics in which people and all living creatures are ""hard-wired"" to through genetics. This gene-centric view of behavior was suggested ever since their discovery but was introduced to pop-science by Richard Dawkins in the ""The Selfish Gene (1974)."" Dawkin's argument, along with many, was that creatures DO NOT work for the good of the whole but are rather ""vessels"" in which our genes are the captains driving evolution through ever changing environmental issues and competition. For example: a male crocodile, even on the steady course toward extinction, will kill babies of another male so that his own genes are selected for the next generation of crocs. The more suitable thing to do in order to sustain their species would be to allow all babies to live and mate as well. If they were thinking for the good of the whole, this would be the case.Cooperation in certain species is looked at as an evolutionary adaptation in order to establish a system in which common goals within a species are met. Monogomy would be a prime example of this adaptation.Through all the in depth examinations on how genes operate and why, the main point that Matt Ridley is making is that evolution is a treadmill and not a ladder. He references The Red Queen from ""Through the Looking Glass,"" a sequel to Alice in Wonderland in which Alice encounters a character who must run in order to stay in one place. If she does not run, she falls behind. And of course, to move forward she must run even faster. Evolution to Matt Ridley and most evolutionary biologist is a chess-like stalemate.After finally reaching the last few chapters of the book, I realized that reading the first half was a waste of time because, while his thesis is claimed throughout these chapters, too many references are used for every single little idea that he presents. It was almost as if he was afraid of not using enough citations but got progressively relaxed as the book moved forward.As soon as I'm done reading this gem, I will leave a more detailed review about the specific ideas that are laid out. Stay-tuned and buy this book if you are interested in the nature of human relationships and are even wanting to improve the way that you interact with the opposite sex. It is even recommended by Neil Strauss (""The Game""). Don't buy it strictly for this cause as it mainly deals with the evolutionary aspect of human relationships."
97,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6742792-qasim-zafar,4,"The primary reason I picked up this book is because it seemed as though it would aid me in understanding r/k reproductive strategies. Though not the primary feature or goal of this book, it did so indirectly when discussing some related topics. Basically, this book describes the basics of evolution and how it dances on the floor provided by the genetics of various species in general and human species in particular. Everything in this book, as the title suggests is described in context of the theory of ""The Red Queen."" The term is derived from ""Through the Looking Glass,"" by Lewis Carroll, where the chess piece runs but doesn't get anywhere:  ""The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other things  round them never changed their places at all: however fast they went, they never  seemed to pass anything. ""I wonder if all the things move along with us?"" thought  poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed to guess her thoughts, for she cried,  ""Faster! Don't try to talk!""""  ---Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-GlassIn terms of evolution, essentially it is the evolutionary drive in species to not merely seek reproductive advantage, but also simply to survive. Both sexual and asexual theories are investigated as well as the roles of culture and gender. A great feature of this book, which I really liked, was the manner in which Ridley explains the differences in the male and female mind in an non-dogmatic way... unfettered by what is religiously or socially acceptable.Most people shouldn't have an opinion on evolution to begin with. This is a personal opinion but the reader will perhaps agree that, when some of the people who are coming from a religious perspective often seem to be too blinded to want to understand the basic premises and theories that the evolutionary scientists are trying to put forth and in doing so they betray their dogmatism; and on the other side even when there is a person who considers themselves a proponent of evolutionary theory, more often then not does not understand it well enough to explain anything in any meaningful way, and by not budging from 'established science' they betray their dogmatism as well. For both of these personalities the preacher or the scientist essentially serve the same function. But for the reader with an open mind and a longing to understand, this book will be well worth the time.End."
98,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8555967-shawn-dvorak,4,"A thorough and thought-provoking examination of evolution. The ""Red Queen"" in the title refers to the character in ""Through the Looking Glass"" who has to run as fast as possible just to stay in one place. As Ridley explains, evolution is not a progression to every greater complexity and refinement, but instead is a race where every organism has to continually adapt to competition between species and within its own race just to keep its place. The concept of evolution as a progressive improvement, where simple bacteria lead to multicellular animals, eventually producing its ""greatest"" achievement: man, is simply wrong. Each species evolves to best survive in its environment, not to become ""better"" or ""more evolved."" Species like the coelacanth and many reptiles (alligators and turtles, for instance) are little changed over many millions of years - the fact that they haven't ""improved"" isn't a failure on their part, but actually a sign of how well they've succeeded in competing with other species.Ridley builds on this background to lay out his most interesting (and probably more controversial) thesis in the latter part of the book. How man developed such a large brain is a bit of a puzzle. It grants us self-awareness and mental abilities beyond any other animal but comes at a great cost. We're born far more immature and helpless than other primates, primarily because our heads are so large that they make childbirth difficult. We then require far longer to develop and mature, to allow time for our bodies and brains to grow to adult size. Once mature the brain consume an inordinate amount of the body's total energy, forcing us to maintain a high-calorie diet. Although it does allow us to communicate, reason, and build tools, many other animals manage these feats (admittedly to a lesser degree) with far smaller, less expensive brains. Why did ours grow exponentially while other primates were able to get by with much smaller ones? Ridley proposes that our big brains developed, at least in part, due to sexual selection effects - they're our equivalent of showy peacock feathers! He admits that much of his theory is speculative (although he includes quite a few supporting facts and corresponding references), and I'm not sure I buy the entire argument, but it seems like a reasonable explanation."
99,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"The Red Queen begins with a question: why do creatures have sex? Why did it evolve? The answer, Matt Ridley believes, lies in the principle of the Red Queen. A character featured in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, she announced to Alice that in her world, it took all the running one could do simply to remain in one place. This characterizes the constant struggle for domination between species in the natural world, a struggle between creatures not only visible to us, but between parasites within our bodies and our immune systems. Every move is countered, every success overturned; such is the impetus for evolution. In The Red Queen, Ridley explains his reasoning, and demonstrates how evolutionary principles subtly drive the expression of human sexuality. There's a lot of tension in this work, first when Ridley makes his case and somehow incorporates aspects of evolution from disparate camps (gene-centered, individually-driven, species-based) , and in the heart of the book as he examines the implications. This is especially true in the chapters, ""Polygamy and the Nature of Men"" and ""Monogamy and the Nature of Women"": while it is true men have a genetic inclination to sow seeds and women one to invest in a partner, behavior as studied indicates that things are not to trite. In the last chapters of the book, Ridley looks at sexuality as a possible cause of advanced human intelligence (competition and tension between the sexes and individuals), which is amusing given the power sexual interest has to render victims dumbstruck and seemingly foolish.  Since its publication, The Red Queen has proven influential; I knew of it long before I read it because of its place in the literature, being cited often. That may attest to the science, which is is speculative but sensible based on what he presents. He certainly makes for an entertaining author, one whose arguments are open to virtually anyone regardless of scientific reading; he begins with a technical, biological edge before spending most of the book on behavior -- a softer, fuzzier realm for readers."

He is both an ardent suitor and an eager salesman: He has a product to sell—his genes, perhaps—and information to impart about that product, but he does not simply hand the information over and await the peahen's decision. He is out to persuade her, to seduce her. And just as she is descended from females who made a careful choice, so he is descended from males who made a hard sell."" - The Red QueenWhile much of the book describes the reasons organisms engage in sexual reproduction and details many species' mating habits, it is always illustrative of a greater point about human nature. The arguments and insights presented about human nature are endlessly interesting while maintaining intellectual honesty and objectivity. They are well worth it after working through the preliminary chapters. You'll find yourself at several points in the book setting it down to contemplate the richness of the ideas being presented; the Red Queen was one of the most fascinating, illuminating books I've ever read.Some interesting concepts:1. (crudely summarizing) your genes control you in order to pass themselves on--your body is the vehicle to do so and sexual human nature the means to do so.2. Humans are monogamous animals with highly adulterous natures; even rulers with over 1,000 women in their harems were devoted to a wife.3. After kindness and intelligence: Men are more concerned with a potential mate's youth and beauty; women are more concerned with a potential mate's wealth and status. Want to know the reasons? Read the book!4. In the name of sexual selection, males in a species will add on ridiculous ornaments for the ladies even if those ornaments make it more challenging for the males to catch food, fly, etc.5. Fashion is arbitrary. Females select males with X feature because other females select males with X feature.If you enjoyed this book, I highly recommend you read Sex At Dawn by Christopher Ryan and The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins."

The book is well written, but though it's science-based, it sometimes had thought experiments in place of studies and at the end of the book the author admits that half of the ideas may turn out to be incorrect. I was already taking the book with a shaker of salt since it's a bit dated, but this didn't take too much away. From the book:On Polygamy: it's assumed that polygamy favors men, and polygamy laws are in place to protect women. But presumably a woman isn't forced into marriage and freely chooses whether she'd rather be the seventh wife to the king or the only wife of a peasant. The first wife doesn't like the situation, but the king bribes her to keep her happy. The biggest losers are the ordinary men who face a shortage of available women and remain unhappily celibate. Limiting the number of spouses to one (at a time) protects the low status men by giving them a better chance at fatherhood.On Adultery: There's the disturbing fact that an unfaithful woman is more likely to conceive with her lover, even if she has twice as much sex with her husband. The book addressed the double standard in many older societies - old laws that call for the death of an adulterous wife while the husband can visit a prostitute and it is a minor crime if any at all. It pointed out that the effects on the family are different for a wife because she can ""introduce alien children into the family or even the uncertainty that adultery creates. Adultery by the husband has no such consequences.""Anyway, enough of the book was politically incorrect and uncomfortable, but that makes provocative reading."
102,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48243177-austen-signalz,5,"While much of the book describes the reasons organisms engage in sexual reproduction and details many species' mating habits, it is always illustrative of a greater point about human nature. The arguments and insights presented about human nature are endlessly interesting while maintaining intellectual honesty and objectivity. They are well worth it after working through the preliminary chapters. You'll find yourself at several points in the book setting it down to contemplate the richness of the ideas being presented; the Red Queen was one of the most fascinating, illuminating books I've ever read.Some interesting concepts:1. (crudely summarizing) your genes control you in order to pass themselves on--your body is the vehicle to do so and sexual human nature the means to do so.2. Humans are monogamous animals with highly adulterous natures; even rulers with over 1,000 women in their harems were devoted to a wife.3. After kindness and intelligence: Men are more concerned with a potential mate's youth and beauty; women are more concerned with a potential mate's wealth and status. Want to know the reasons? Read the book!4. In the name of sexual selection, males in a species will add on ridiculous ornaments for the ladies even if those ornaments make it more challenging for the males to catch food, fly, etc.5. Fashion is arbitrary. Females select males with X feature because other females select males with X feature.If you enjoyed this book, I highly recommend you read Sex At Dawn by Christopher Ryan and The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins."
103,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1310120-lisa,3,"First two thirds of the book were good, although its date is starting to show in places. (Twenty years is a long time in science.) Then I got to the chapter 'Sexing The Mind' and almost threw the book across the room. Plenty of fallacies, mostly having to do with the invisibility of the female experience to male scientists who are, consciously or not, invested in preserving the status quo- in which male access to enormous amounts of unpaid female labor in childrearing, cooking, and cleaning is enormously beneficial to males. (At one point I felt like screaming at the author that spatial navigation skills would be just as important to gatherers as to hunters. You still have to know where things are to bring them home. This is just common sense!) The author also plays down the influence of culture- nature is clearly the driver, not nurture, in Ridley's worldview, and he pooh-poohs the ongoing debate as overblown. Girls don't try to break into male dominated professions (to borrow one of the author's examples, auto mechanics) because they just don't like those things, not because men would ever be dicks when defending the boys' club. The author's assertions fly in the face of both personal experience and more recent investigation into the often subtle and invidious effects of gender bias in the workplace. In short, when the author is on firm biology ground, the book is fairly good. When he strays into sociobiology, pyschology, or worst of all evo psych, things become far more dubious."
104,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11360232-pris,5,"A well-researched, educational, intellectually convincing book on the intertwined, circular relationship of evolution with sex based on the Red Queen evolutionary hypothesis that states living organisms must continually & constantly evolve to gain reproductive advantage & survive alongside other species that are likewise progressively evolving in a volatile changing environment. Human evolution is made possible by sexual reproduction, & Ridley contends it is hard to understand human beings' sexual nature & motivations without understanding how sexuality evolved. Courtship/dating rituals, marriage, sexual habits, and family creation are partly the result of the choices & decisions we make in who to make love with or to marry. These ""choices"", in turn, are partly determined by genetic imprints that have been present in the brain for millennia (nature), & partly by learned cultural behavior (nurture). I appreciated this book for its honesty & refusal to separate inherent/innate biological behavior with outside environmental forces that collectively shape individuals and make human beings the varied yet homogenous species that it is--as opposed to many sociologists & biologists (in all their varying categories & sub-specialties) that insist on separating several human behaviors/characteristics as merely the product of nature (genes) on one side, or nurture (culture, society, & environment while growing up to adulthood) on the other. Engrossing book that suffers a bit from dry writing."
105,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2435064-riley-holmes,4,"Ridley gives many interesting examples and counterexamples of how reproduction works in different species in the animal kingdom. Water fleas are all females, but pop out a male every few generations. Fungi have dozens of different genders. Strawberries and corals spread clones in the surrounding area, but produce sexual seeds which are carried away. Elms and oysters produce millions of young to escape their saturated living space. Testicle size in all species corresponds to the level of polygamy observed in the species.He ties it all back to our own behavior and attractions. Sexual selection is the idea that we all have traits that were attractive to ancestors in the past. Even basic human cleverness and communication skills can be explained this way. ""One is conscious of what is possible to report to others"".In consideration of what forms our criteria for attraction, he proposes an unethical experiment. 1 population is kept ignorant of the opposite gender so that their existence comes as a suprise. Another population is exposed to imagery of hideous/obese people admiring each other and reviling the attractive. What will each group ultimately find attractive?Overall this book is an enjoyable overview of the evolution of thought on the subject over the last few decades."

If you think it's not all about sex, you're mistaken. Your sex genes, as are all animals', are evolving as fast as any other gene in your body and they are in strong competition with others' sex genes that are all striving to make it into future generations. All animals are subject to gene competition, but who knew that males and females are in competition with each other the second they begin courtship! The title of the book, The Red Queen, refers to the evolutionary hypothesis (taken from Lewis Carol's chess piece in Through the Looking Glass) regarding how genes compete so well with each other that they end up back at the starting line (the same place) to continue competing. As the parasite gets stronger, the animals protective ""lock"" against that parasite gets more clever (evolves) and neither is really ahead of the other as they both struggle to adapt best for the future environment. Animals are still in a race against parasite and Organisms' sex genes are still in a competition with each other, which helps explain much of animal behavior and some of that other animal's behavior - humans."

It's very informative and does a good job of really getting at the roots of each theory. Lots of pros and cons as well as he explains his reasoning. He's a pretty clear author.As I've started to notice with many academic books, there comes a point when the author becomes increasingly interested in making conjectures about future work. These sections tend to be heavier on opinion. Some of those opinions I didn't like so much, like his small example of blondes near Stockholm and his tangent about the gay gene. I think this was just a bit too controversial for me and displays my own ability to be open about these theories. Maybe also, it displays my natural tendency to prefer those theories that are well established. The undertone might have not been to my liking.Other than that, it's a good book. Better than most of the books that get into the theories mentioned. Red Queen itself is something that many books don't really address well enough.What you'll notice in this genre is that the major theories tend to repeat themselves. So a lot of the book was stuff I had read before."

It is impossible to understand the social life of a phalarope or a sage grouse or an elephant seal or a chimpanzee in isolation. You can describe each in glorious detail of course: they are respectively polyandrous, lekking, harem-defending, fission-fusion. But only with the perspective of evolution can you truly understand why. Only then can you see the part that different opportunities for parental investment, different habitats, different diets, and different historical baggage have played in determining their natures. It is the purest nonsense to abandon the perspective of comparison with other animals just because of our hubristic belief that humans alone are learning creatures that re-invent themselves at whim.""Don't let the first half of the book deter you (as the author admits, it gets deep in the weeds on microbiology and genetics...thus my 4 stars). Second half is a read that will shed much needed light on who we are as humans, and how we got this way. "
109,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9226371-edgar,5,"Very interesting read. Basically how sexual selectivity has driven human instincts and evolution (i.e. bigger brains, universal mate preferences, etc.). One theory is how big brains are a competitive tool against other humans, since there is no fiercer competition than within your species. Also, that big brains were meant primarily for social purposes (i.e. judging character and intents of other people, building alliances/hierarchy) and for seduction (through charm, wit, eloquence, inventiveness) of the other sex. Red Queen theory refers to the fact that evolution is like a treadmill--every advantage eventually becomes ""normalized"" bringing every party back to where it was initially, e.g. immunity against one parasite leads to an advantage to that parasite, but then the parasite with the genes to counteract that immunity will rise to prominence, eventually eliminating the initial advantage of genes with that immunity. You see the same thing play out across evolution among all species and life forms. Definitely puts one in a more competitive mindset...Unlike a lot of ""fluffy"" mass market science books, Matt Ridley keeps things academic and logically rigorous where the book needs to be, and yet still manages to keep things interesting and entertaining. A great science writer!"
110,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"This is a very enjoyable read full of surprising questions and answers. Who knew there were so many ways to replicate, even sexually?Matt Ridley is clearly not a blank slater. In chapters 8, 9, and 10 and elsewhere he argues against blank slate dogma better than Steven Pinker did in his book The Blank Slate. I keep encountering evidence that that dogma is alive and well. Recently on National Public Radio a woman being interviewed took the view that girls simply must be as good at math as boys, therefore the data must have been skewed in studies that show otherwise. And, besides, she herself was exposed to language before she was exposed to math, so naturally she is better at language. I don't care if this woman is brilliant; she is clearly engaging in motivated reasoning and confirmation bias; she's twisting the facts to fit her conclusion.So what is it that made us human, and especially intriguing, what gave us our big heads--and everything that term implies? Maybe it was sexual selection. Maybe it was parasites (Parasite Rex by Carl Zimmer). Maybe it was cooking (Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human by Richard Wrangham). Maybe it was a combination of those and other factors still to be discovered."

112,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14858185-steven,4,"Excellent and thought-provoking book with interesting hypotheses -Our large brains evolved specifically because of sexual selection. Men and women needed to be wittier and more charismatic to attract mates, the wittiest and most charismatic had larger brains and produced more children. This selective pressure works in the same way that a peacock's tail feathers get larger and larger. Peahen's are attracted to the large tail feathers and each generation has larger and larger tail feathers despite these tail feathers becoming a handicap to the peacock.We age more slowly and live longer than other apes because men are attracted to younger looking women who will bear them more children. The people who age more slowly produce more children than those who age quickly, so each generation ages more slowly and is younger looking, as the neotony genes are passed on.There is a 0 per cent correlation in IQ for adopted children raised together. In other words, a shared environment has no effect on intelligence, whereas something like 50% of intelligence comes from genes, another 15% from the womb, another 15% from a good education and 20% from other sources. "
113,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28363483-heather-stowell,4,"Ridley gives a very comprehensive analysis of his journalistic endeavor to examine as many aspects of human sexuality and its link to evolutionary selection as possible. Using dozens of fascinating examples from the animal and plant kingdoms he uses these broad frames of reference to search for answers to why humans select sexual partners. It's more complex than the simple transfer of genes from one generation to the next. It has as much to do with keeping pace with our main competitors; parasites via selection of disease free partners, as it has to do with intellectual stimulation or novelty.Of course some of Ridley's examples are outdated, like the fact that there is no genetic disposition towards aggression, but he addresses this in his conclusion that he will probably be proven wrong as the science continues to prove new hypotheses.A very interesting read that not only looks at sex and evolution but as the title says it also includes the ongoing continuing and intriguing debates about nature vs nurture and cooperation vs competition. Ridley leaves these as evenly weighted arguments and does not end up favoring one over another"
114,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17170136-alice-luesley,4,"I have read a number of Matt Ridley's books and find a lot of the points he makes very interesting, if given the option I'd rate this book about 3.75 rather than 4. I found some of his points quite difficult to swallow, in particular when it comes to gender roles and gender vs. sexuality. However, just because I was uncomfortable with them doesn't necessarily make me right. I also appreciate books that look at the human species as what it is - an animal species with animal instincts, trying to understand it and how it works in complex human societies.I do think that some of his arguments could do with more evidence and some expansion on theories that Ridley himself may not necessarily agree with (which I felt he did well at the beginning of the book but not so well towards the end). Although I didn't agree with everything he said it has made me keen to go out and look for more theories and evidence myself which I think it a good outcome from reading a scientific book. I would also be interested to see if any of the author's view have changed with over two more decades of research into the subject of human sexuality available."
115,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7355902-soo,4,"This book, as many other reviewers pointed out, is one you have to fight your way into to get to the good stuff. I am fascinated by so-called 'human nature' and why there is the need to somehow separate our species from the rest of the animal kingdom. Ridley has got his feet, like mine, firmly in the camp that acknowledges we are another class of animal. I bought this when I was in a 'women's studies' phase and it led me into other areas that the author has covered. He has many theories that buck the trend; Government is parasitic, global 'warming' is just weather and just recently a blog post, of one of his articles for The Spectator, 'Tobacco denial and pesticide alarm'.I like anything that exists outside of the 'box' and this author is one of them."
116,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4278187-matt-mccormick,4,"A very well researched and thorough book. It was interesting in parts and a bit long winded in others. Upon finishing the book, I still didn't really understand the point the author was trying to make. There was never a clear conclusion but maybe that's how the author intended it to be. I suppose the main message is that everything we do is to leave more children and pass on our genes but yet the author just glosses over people who choose to remain chaste or couples who choose not to have kids. I think the down side about trying to write about human nature is that we have such a strong ability to choose and thereby override any ""human nature"" that we possess - at least much more so than any other mammal.There was a lot of information about other animals and how sex fits in with their nature. While it's interesting to learn about how other animals are, sometimes you can draw parallels to people and sometimes you can't. Nonetheless, it was interesting to learn about.Not a bad read for anyone who is interested in further understanding people and our motivations."

While Ridley makes most of the book accessible to the layperson, it clearly is aimed at the educated layperson. That is to say, this is not for the casual reader looking for easy tidbits of knowledge, as this feels further from the popular science side of the bell curve and closer to the academic writing end. As a result, while the book might be slow going and some section warrant reading more than once, the reader comes away with some fairly sophisticated concepts. The book is more than two decades old and it would be nice to see an updated version with newer scientific findings (including epigenetic findings). Nonetheless, much of the content is still relevant, invites deep thought, and disrupts some widely held beliefs (cultural rather than scientific) about sex, males and females, and humans as just another mammal."

It certainly has some great ideas but at the same time it's cripplingly incomprehensible at times, and woefully short of explanation when it needs it, and needlessly expansive in other places.Riddley 's clear exploration of the many theories on why sex might have evolved is a great set of chapters. He clearly states the merits and demerits of the important ones, and you're a convert to the theory he believes in (that sex evolved as a mechanism to combat parasites). I found his paragraphs on sexual selection, and polygamy to be heavy going though, for reasons stated above. He finishes with a flourish however when he states that the human brain might be a product of sexual rather than natural selection. I'd picked up this book to read more on this, but it doesn't have too much on the subject. Overall, a good introduction, but the book is too un-rigorously written for my taste."

However the interweaving of empirical findings and theoretical debates makes it an excellent summary of the deep questions, the evidence, and the raging battles between the theorists. Why do sexual organisms thrive, when asexual reproduction is so much more efficient? The answer seems to be that sex is a useful mechanism to fight parasites because it ""changes the locks"" of cellular defense mechanisms (the arms race again) without throwing away the mechanisms that were useful in the past and will be useful again in the future. There is also an elegant discussion of the importance of adultery for understanding the varieties of animal behavior, where the driving force is the variation in the female feeding habits.

I have read a couple other books, Selfish Gene and Why Evolution Is True on the topic of evolution but the perspective taken by Matt is unique and remarkable.The book can be vaguely divided into two parts. The first part talks about what sexual selection is and how sexual reproduction happens. There's a deep dive that talks about Meiosis mentioning Recombination and Outcrossing. This information is crucial to understanding many of the concepts in the book.The second part of the book is about how two genders of the same species differ and the reason for those differences - just as the title says 'Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature'.Chapters 6 and 7 are truly interesting and talk about polygamy in men and monogamy in women.

Galton's Eugenics, Freud's consciousness, Durkheim's sociology, Mead's culture driven anthropology, Skinner's Behaviorism, Wilson's Sociobiology and Piaget's early learning have, through the proper application of the scientific method of inquiry and research, dropped from the list of popular wisdoms.

This book was beautifully written in such a way that the average person can comprehend complex science while the expert scientist can gain something from it. Taking controversial topics such as cheating, polygamy, gender roles, homosexuality and intellectualising it without an political or religious agenda. If you're like me and came here from Niel Strauss' ""The Game"" - I'll tell you right now that there's nothing in this book that you can say to someone that will encourage them to sleep with you.

At the end he even suggests that they might be plain wrong because, well, who knows? I haven`t read that many science books that heavily emphasis research, experiments and documenting, thus I could easily have swallowed whatever evidence he presented. Ridley brings numerous correlations and indications to each case and debates thoroughly with previous and existing theories in all of the themes he mentions.

Thought provoking analysis and scientific inquiry supported the author's perspective, right up to the point where the focus of the book changed from biology to behavior. The author continued to argue that human behavior is biologically based, but the Red Queen scientific inquiry was lost in this part. Ridley stuck to his position that the Red Queen is working through human behavior, and while this is an interesting interpretation, I found this part of the book less and less interesting. While I agree with many of his assertions and interpretations in the latter part of the work, I did not find the final section scientifically based, and therefore, not as interesting as the first two thirds. Overall, I think it's a ""must read"" and opens my eyes to Red Queen theory."

This is a testament of the author's insights and logical rigor. It goes deeper into the genetic mechanisms at play in evolution than I had read before so that part was quite interesting. The writing style is comfortably authoritative and witty. While it gives a great basis for the arguments that led to new theories on human sexuality, much of the conclusions are more deeply explored in more recent books such as A Billion Wicked Thoughts (although A Billion Wicked Thoughts possesses less scientific caution than Ridley exhibited, in my opinion)."

Overall, a very solid research type read on a matter of sex, evolution and purpose of human kind. Life and sex could barely be more technical as it is after reading, fully realizing and living by the thoughts laid down in this book, though it is pretty hard thing to do in reality. Please note that the first half of the book concentrates on a quite peculiar topic of evolutionary fight, whereas the second one emphasizes more of an empirical and, thus, practical, human-like approach to the same phenomena, therefore, it is much faster paced and more enjoyable. It appears life is not that complicated after all, although the correct balance between the importance between 'nature' and 'nurture' is a matter of discussion, which is fascinating for me.Would recommend almost to anybody interested in psychology."
130,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69382264-emma,3,"Though informative, I feel as though this book fell short of addressing what it promised to. The Red Queen failed to address anything that would distinguish it from the material covered in a high school biology class. The revelatory points of several chapters (the majority) were comprised of information that really, was already fairly common knowledge. Furthermore, the information that built up to these points was often needlessly complicated. Taking the side of an argument disproved in antiquity is not necessary to maintain an unbiased narrative. I also felt as though the author's narrative style was far too personal for this particular genre of literature- and that the nuances of human sexuality were glossed over to befit simpler theories of evolution. This book is a solid three stars, it is soundly written and accurate (as far as I can tell) but it does not push any boundaries."
131,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10707-lee-drake,3,"Why sex? Why are there ""boys"" and ""girls""? If you look at life from the genes point of view, it will copy itself with 100% efficiency by cloning itself, but most animals and many plants have 50% efficiency by sharing reproduction with a member of the opposite sex. This book argues its way out of this problem by reflecting on the work by leading evolutionary biologists over the past 8 decades (begining with Fisher). The thrust of the argument: genetic diversity is butressed by sex and thus increases ""evolvability"" to new threats. From the genes point of view (except for the SDF gene on the Y chromosome) each gene travels through generations of boys and girls, ultimatley replicating itself better due to improved resistance. "
132,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/255822-halle,4,"Overall, the Red Queen is a great introduction (and coverage) of the Red Queen hypothesis in evolutionary biology/sociology. Ridley uses examples, research, and plain english to describe what others are unable to put in [understandable] words. At times, he's a bit too loquacious. One story is enough to pound home an idea. And the theory itself is a tad depressing, and discredits (or rather, forgets) any tenderness or love that works into the equation of reproduction. I suppose reproduction on a micro-level is far more romantic than macro-level analysis. Anyhow, for non-academics, The Red Queen is a perfect text book for understanding evolutionary theory in the context of how we live our every day lives. "
133,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3095594-susan,3,"Writing in 1993, Matt Ridley argues that much of human nature has been determined by the struggle of our genes to perpetuate themselves, in a never-ending contest against bacteria, parasites, and other humans. The analogy of the Red Queen comes from Alice in Wonderland, where the red queen had to keep running constantly to stay in the same place. Ridley summarizes the current state of knowledge and speculation at the time he wrote, quoting scientists in many fields. And he uses numberous examples of plants and animals to explain and/or to support his argument. The book is dense, but written for the layperson. I wish it were possible to get a short ""since-1993"" update, to learn what light current scientific research has shed on the issues Ridley discusses."
134,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1334545-david-s-t,5,"I read this book about the same time I was reading the Selfish Gene and it was a great companion book. Ridley seems to fully accept the selfish gene theory and uses that as one of his basis for the idea of evolution. I preferred this book over Dawkins book, Ridley is a far better writer and the book focused less on the concept and more on explaining things using good analogies and tons of scientific studies (and open ended speculation). I also really liked that right from the beginning Ridley doesn't attempt to spend any time arguing with creationists, it makes the book far better because I don't have to read the same creationist stuff again and again which seems to be a problem with so many evolution books. I think anyone interested in evolution and biology should pick up this book."
135,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2025878-kevin-zeck,4,"Meandering and unfocused for most of the book, but the last chapter brings the book together nicely. Main point of the book: sexual selection by humans has provided a much more significant evolutionary pressure than external conditions (e.g., weather, food supply, etc.). That is, men and women have been ""dog-breeding"" each other for 300,000 years. Women have selected traits in men they (women) desire and these traits have become more pronounced over time - much like the peahen's desires affected the evolution of the peacock's tail (i.e., made the tail extravagant, even to the point were it became a threat to the survival of the peacock for being too showy and thus attracting predators). The same holds true for men selecting traits in women. Very enlightening read."
136,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11627711-bob,4,"Full of all sorts of ideas about sexual selection and why so many forms of evolution are a Red Queen's race: primarily any predator-prey/host-parasite relations and any within-the-species conflict for limited resources, especially sex.Asks great fundamental questions that I as a non-biologist certainly never think of, like ""Why sexual vs. asexual?"" or ""Why precisely two sexes?"" or ""Why two different sexes, instead of all hermaphrodites?"" and gives the either the authoritative answer where it exists, or the author's best-guess answer to each.One minor frustration: This was a book from the early 1990s, and I'd like to know for some of the author's guesses were right or wrong.I had no idea what an important factor in our evolution the microorganisms living inside us are."

This is a book Dawkins mentioned that he wished he himself had written and definitely fills in many gaps. Ridley illustrates everything with examples from various species. It’s fascinating to see how evolution took different species on very different paths to reproduction. Ridley shines light on our sexual nature as humans, explaining in evolutionary terms why we are attracted to beauty, the relationship between men and woman, marriage and adultery and much more. Even an interesting theory as to why men prefer sons in one society and daughters in another.Overall a very enjoyable read though some early chapters get too scientific and laden with new technical terms."

However the basal level of human existence is very infuriating at times in this book only because the start of human existence was ruled by our genes and hardly any societal impact by our ancestors. Though it could be true, it was a little hard for me to digest the idea that men favor polygamous relationships because it is one way to offset the cost of male existence by having as many children as possible! Overall a good book and one that can either make you more frustrated with this innate level of human existence or make you more curious that we ever lived that way to describe why we live the way we do now."
139,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3334760-naomi,3,"As a ""scientific book"" this was overall quite disappointing. A very promising start to the answers of evolution that sadly digresses into loose science and wide assumption. Interesting case studies from different species, but unfortunately the chapter summaries often missed the point of the central theme. I felt more could've be written about Zahavi's handicap principle and Fisher's sexy sons rather than touching upon them very briefly. Many of the articles referring to human gender-based preferences in the last chapters of the book are known to be methodologically flawed (see: Delusions of Gender by Cordelia Fine) and I felt weren't necessary or totally applicable to explain the point of Red Queen."

However, I'm glad I stuck with it because the author does an excellent job of outlining how sexual reproduction is generally superior to asexual reproduction, and how that fits in to the evolutionary arms race.In the last few chapters the author asserts that humans are essentially peacocks and peahens when it comes to sexual selection, except our big brains are the peacock's tail feathers. Thought provoking to be sure, however it does bring up a lot of depressing issues. Do we really have free will or are we just robots being driven by our genes? I see why Richard Dawkins likes this book so much."

He makes a lot of heavily stereotyped, not pc statements that are not always scientifically grounded. But I guess that's why he apologizes over and over again, reminding us each chapter that he's not trying to prove what is morally correct but what could have happened.A lot of this book seems just to be a series of hypotheses that aren't super testable based off of what has been observed in nature. They could make logical sense and could work but they are just conjectures based off of a few case studies. But isn't that just how it because when asking ""why"" instead of ""how""--the author is trying to look for history from the present.But I will give him that he is remarkably thorough."

It ensures genetic diversity, protects us from parasites and even accounts for our tremendous intelligence. In these ways and many more, sexual attraction among humans is a key driver of evolution.Suggested further reading: The Evolution of Everything by Matt RidleyThe Evolution of Everything (2015) argues that the phenomenon of evolution – gradual change without goal or end – reaches far beyond genetics. Evolution happens all around us in economic markets, our language, technology and customs, and is what’s behind nearly all changes that occur in these fields."

Really interesting stuff about sexual selection throughout biological history. Turns out sexual selection, i.e. genders' preferences for their mates for various reasons, has shaped who we have become almost more so than who didn't get killed by stuff (natural selection). Helped me rest easier knowing many facets of my personality I struggle with are biological in origin... jealousy, competitiveness, attraction. Easy to read, Mr. Ridley has an excellent grasp on how to draw the reader in and build upon ideas despite it being a 'science book.' Highly recommended."

I still found it to be incredibly informative, and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about human nature, and the sexuality of humans and nature in general. The way Ridley incorporates the sexuality variances of different species to make his point keeps things interesting. His writing style keeps the subject matter engaging. Ridley seems to have done an incredible amount of research before writing this book, as he appears to have covered all his bases and addressed a lot of other research from the related fields."
145,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5363431-matthew-monk,3,"Ridley offers a very interesting take on the evolution of human psychology and survival. The main premise is essentially that sex has been the main factor in spurring all forms of human development, from the arts to technology, Ridley argues that sex is the root from which our modern society has been born. This is a must read for anyone interested in evolutionary psychology. For the average reader, this work might be too heavy with academic buzz words. Ridley's voice also comes off a bit pompous and didactic, presenting his studies as the end all of all end alls to answering every question of human existence."
146,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5553236-cake,5,"A very interesting book. The author tries to weave together a cohesive theory that explains the why of sex and how the evolution of humans has been deeply influenced by sex. The book is almost 20 years old and so some of the ideas, like men and women having different brains and skill sets, were not entirely foreign to me. The first part of the book focus' on genetics and the author does well in attempting to explain scientific themes to the average person, though I must admit I was lucky if I understood two thirds of this information. Still, it is a very enjoyable read with many interesting ideas."

The book is a bit dry and it was struggle to get into. But the content, theories and conclusins are fascinating. The book is now nearly 20 years old so I can't speak to the development of current knowledge or thinking on the subject since, but i will probably seek out more books on he subject.It contradicts the recent book I read -- Sex at Dawn -- in some critical respects."

This book goes on about differing evolved traits in animals for 3/4 of the book, then the last chapters are all about human evolution, specifically attraction. A lot of lucid metaphors contained in this book comparing human behavior to all different types of animal interactions. In the end it concludes eloquently how a peacock evolved bright plumage to attract, humans evolved complex and ever growing brains. This lead to advanced attractors not present in any other animal. The 4 are ""Sense of humor, intellect, creativity and interesting personality."" "
149,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6037248-bram,4,"The book discusses many very interesting questions: what is the evolutionary benefit from sexual reproduction as compared to asexual reproduction, why are there exactly 2 genders and not 3, why do men fall for younger women, ... The reasons are not always easy to understand.I believe the book contains a few logical mistakes. For example, ""By ceasing to breed once they have a boy, which those interested in dynastic succession might do, people would have male biased sex ratios.""This is incorrect, the probability of having a boy/girl doesn't depend on the gender of the first child, so this does not impact the ratio males to females.Overall, highly interesting book!"

This book can leave you in deep depression, as you'll realize you are just a product of evolution that happened to be conscious (so it can deceive fellow human and attract mates).On the other hand, Matt Ridley knows how to write an easy to follow book. He will take you on a journey through evolution of different views on evolution. He will describe and defend one theory, just to disprove it on next page, offering another theory in place. This process can have multiple iterations, arriving to something that makes most sense. Thanks to this special writing style, you'll make your own opinions a resonate with some views more than others."

My favorite chapters (and frankly, the main motivation for me to read this book) are the gender wars and beauty chapters. This sphere of evolution sparkled my attention already in Dawkins' immortal classics - ""the Selfish Gene"".If you felt like you wanted to know more about underlying forces that shape the relationship between men and women in their more simplistic form, this book will give you a food for thought. Insight on hormone functioning of the organism was also very interesting. "

However, this book was written in 1993 and I expected it to be... cringe-worthy on certain topics. But it wasn't! He did a good job at explaining that ""natural"" or ""selected for"" means nothing about whether or not it should be allowed in society - without coming across as trying to cover his ass by being politically correct. Overall, well researched and well written: a very cohesive book.I would recommend this book to biologists and critical thinkers - I'm sure there are many things that could be taken out of context in this book."

Of the first few chapters, the most interesting were the ones explaining where sex and gender came from in the first place; why we aren't all hermaphrodites or of thousands of genders, which seems like a better evolutionary strategy. The explanations of human behavior are interesting, but we seem to only be able to explain human *sexual* behavior by sexual selection; the arguments for spatial reasoning et cetera remain unconvincing."

Now, who clicks on pop ups? Noone. Marketing and scammy ads have moved on. The world appears to move forward by leaps and bounds, but in many senses we are in exactly the same place.

Matt Ridley adds to the support for the case by attempting to explain: Why sexual and not asexual reproduction? Why males and females? Why do some species switch sexes? Why is human behavior around sex so peculiar?The arguments are well composed and organized to build the case. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I especially enjoyed how others were interested in borrowing the book to read it themselves.

If you're in it for the human insights, as I was, you might be put off by the first 40% of the book, which is all non-human. If you persist, it will be worth it, and Ridley does build on the part about humans what he talked about with, you know, all them other critters, but if you're impatient then by all means skip the parts about birds and slugs and bacteria and get right to the fun stuff."

The Red Queen is a theory that is explained by a passage from Lewis Carroll's Alice Through the Looking Glass ""Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place."" This theory simply explains the hypothesis that evolution is necessary for an organism and its parasites to remain at a constant stalemate. A good example was that of bacteria evolving resistance to antibacterials."

Why does our concept of beauty take on its current form? Why are we mostly monogamous? How has sexual selection shaped out intelligence? My only gripes about this thought provoking read are that it's about a decade old (painfully obvious by the incorrect statistics on the human genome) and Ridley sometimes overstates his conclusions for the sake of the lay audience.

From the origins of sexual reproduction to why men treat a woman's vagina as their property, from evolutionary sexual selection to the psychology of sexual behavior, this book is a brilliant insight into the evolution of the genome by sexual reproduction. This is a great book for fans of biology and those with more than rudimentary knowledge as well. "

The theories are presented as true until the author points out what is wrong with them, which you might have been able to infer, or not, from reading them yourself. This makes the book a highly gratifying read and creates more than one line of dialogue between you and the book. The author is also wise and has a great deal of common sense and charisma, which makes this very academic book seem not at all like the typically dry academic read. "

The author justifies using examples from the animal kingdom to illustrate examples, and I wouldn't argue with that logic, since we are part of the animal kingdom.

The ""human nature"" part of the book is tucked away near the end and felt like it could be explored in more depth, and sooner.As far as a book explaining the tie between sexual reproduction and the ""red queen"" argument, it did an excellent job.

Every page made me a smarter man, or at least the way I feel. For those who sat beside me on a train, seeing me read this book and not asking - What's it about? - and then not reading it; he is a fool.For sure my life is short; maybe today, tomorrow or in twenty years to come my time to go. For the few books a man have read, for this is the few at least a man must read."

Good overview of the development of sex and the reasons for it, even if it did seem a little more confident in its conclusions than could be warranted. I imagine it would also get critisism from some quarters for suggesting that there are evolutionary reasons for differences between make and female behaviour in other species and we have no scientific reason for saying this can't be the same in humans."

The evolution processes are much more complex than we could ever imagine - propelled by the Red Queen phenomenon. Despite the fact our brains have not been designed to understand fully their own evolution but it is nice keep trying to learn more and more about it - and this is so awesome, the never ending story of science!"
182,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3557079-donna,5,Really interesting look at the evolution of sexual reproduction in general and the ways it has influenced human nature. One thing I really liked was that Ridley didn't have an agenda; he presented the prevailing hypotheses on each topic then discussed the evidence for and against each one. I'm curious to know where things stand now as this book was published in 1993. Fascinating subject and I learned a lot.

Also the idea of the red queen (constant conflict which spurs evolution but doesn't give any side a hude advantage) can be imaginativly applied to other systems. I'm happy i was introduced to this perspective and i think i need to strengthen my understanding of it with other books. Someone recommended me to read Steve Pinker."

It is a review & critique of more theories of why sexual reproduction is an evolutionary advantage than I knew existed.

This was wonderful to listen to for a month while I was walking the dog, although I'll admit it was difficult to keep the whole thread of the science actively in my head for the duration of the book.

Thought a bit dated now (written in 1993), it still offers a wealth of information about the ""battle"" between nature vs nurture.

223,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26089999-anu,2,Disappointing. Author's style is to throw some random hypothesis together and retrofit subjective research to suit the suggested hypothesis.

293,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Informative, witty and fun to readThis is the book that first demonstrated to me the power of evolutionary psychology to help us understand ourselves. Published a year before Robert Wright's The Moral Animal, which covers much of the same territory, this is to my mind a more sophisticated and more direct exposition. Both books are characterized by a sly wit and an incisive expression, but Ridley meanders less among the relics of Freud and Darwin and is less concerned about whether we're moral or not and more concerned with what's sexy and why. He had a lot of fun with this book and it shows.The ""red queen"" is a metaphor for an arms race. In an arms race both sides run as fast and as hard as they can to stay in the same place relatively speaking. In evolution the arms race is between parasite and host or between predator and prey. Both are running as fast as they can just to keep up, because when one gets an advantage, the other finds a counter. The red queen comes from Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There (1871) since that monarch ran as fast as she could but never got anywhere at all. The red queen is also a metaphor for the theory that there is no ""progress"" in evolution, that ""...species do not get better at surviving... Their chances of extinction are random."" (p. 64)Ridley covers a lot of territory here, ranging from sex to the handicap principle to gossip to why our brains are big (to figure out what the other person is up to!). The Red Queen answers the question, ""Why is there sex?"" Apparently we have sexuality rather than asexuality because of the arms race between microbes and our immune systems. Sex is a way of storing defenses against parasites in the gene pool of the species and then mixing them anew each generation to fool the microbes. Without the gene pool and the DNA mixing, the microbes would quickly evolve a way around the organism's defenses; but with sexuality the organism juggles its ""locks"" every generation and so is able to keep up with the fast-mutating microbes. When again the microbes evolve the keys to these locks, the gene pool is mixed again and the organism comes up with an old lock that the microbes again have to evolve a key to.Some of the fun is the incisive way Ridley presents the ideas, and the ideas he chooses to present. For example, note how effectively he demolishes Freud's naive incest taboo theory on pages 282-286. Also interesting is his presentation of the idea that it is not thinness in women per se that attracts men, but a low ratio of waistline to hip line that fetches them. There are chapters entitled ""Polygamy and the Nature of Men,"" and ""Monogamy and the Nature of Women."" In Chapter 9, ""The Uses of Beauty,"" Ridley goes into some detail on why men prefer thin and blond women. And on pages 217-218 he explains why women cuckold their mates: ""This is because her husband is, almost by definition, usually not the best male there is—else how would he have ended up married to her?"" She wants the parental care of her husband and some other man's superior—she thinks—genes.Ridley is rather modest and says that most of the ideas in the book are not his and at any rate many of them will undoubtedly be proven wrong. This is refreshing to read when I think about all the delusive ideas so proudly trumpeted by popular books on evolution and human behavior in the past. Desmond Morris's The Naked Ape (1967) and Elaine Morgan's The Aquatic Ape: A Theory of Human Evolution (1982) come to mind, both fine books, but now seen to be substantially mistaken.Written in an engaging and lucid style, The Red Queen really is the best of a number of books on evolutionary psychology to appear over the last decade and one that is a delight to read. --Dennis Littrell, author of “Understanding Evolution and Ourselves”"
294,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43215110-eric-novelo-galicia,3,"Matt Ridley’s Red Queen is an excellent book for people who had never heard of sexual selection, mating systems, evolutionary psychology and human behavior from the biological sciences perspective. It explains quite clearly why it is necessary to think of a “human nature” without the prejudice of the social scientists and “culturalists”, who tend to neglect human universals and genetic constraints. The book, in general, is easy to love and easy to dislike at the same time (in fact, I’m very glad I finally finished it, yet I’m sad I won’t have my daily night thinking). I loved it because it is a direct affront to postmodern thinkers, irrational feminists, early Freudians and social scientists in general. The author clearly despises shallow thinking and exhorts people to incorporate a wider view of human sexuality, letting moral judgements aside. The book was also a good review of behavioral biology topics, such as the evolution of sex (from group selectionists to modern individual selectionists, including Bell’s Tangle Bank hypothesis, Muller’s Ratchet and Van Valen’s Red Queen), Fisher’s and Zahavi’s theories of runaway selection and good genes/handicap, respectively, and the differences between male and female minds (including humans) that arises from the fact that we are competing with each other ever since anisogamy emerged.However, Ridley’s discourse feels sometimes a little messy, as if he wanted to explain many things at the same time (at least compared to Dawkins, for example). Also, he seems to be rather convinced about all Tooby and Cosmides evolutionary psychology arguments, which at present have been challenged by other authors such as Laland and Brown (advocates of an integral perspective, which includes behavioral ecology, cultural evolution and gen-culture coevolution as well). The book also ignores some fundamental issues when dealing with human minds, such as mental disorders and childhood maladaptive learning (Ridley mentions it very quickly at the end but in a rather disparaging manner). Finally, chapters 8 and 9 (Sexing the mind and The Uses of Beauty) present some debates which end up unresolved (a bit frustrating, I must say).The best ideas I got from this book were: 1)	Van Valen’s Red Queen theory can explain sex by giving a tremendous advantage for specimens who recombine their genes since there is a constant arms race against parasites, which otherwise would get quickly adapted to a specific set of genes.2)	Human monogamy is perpetuated by women, who benefit from not sharing paternal care and provisioning, but most importantly by men, because else many of them would not reproduce (polygamists would monopolize all females).3)	Young children DO behave differently. Boys tend to focus on objects when playing, whereas girls prefer to focus on people and language. Both sexes practice their best skills, and culture only reinforces such instincts.4)	Blond hair in adults may have arisen by sexual selection, rather than natural selection responding to climate pressures.5)	‘Nature’ and ‘nurture’ are so interdependent that almost any reasoning in favor of only one of this aspects is immediately wrong. Chomsky’s argument about language is the best example to prove it.The book gets 3.5 stars because, despite its great content and thorough explanations of human sex and evolution, Ridley’s writing style made reading a burden. I would have given it 4 stars but I absolutely hated that every subtitle in each chapter was just unnecessary (and everytime I ended a reading session, next time I had to re-read last two sections). Apart from that, the book is a very nice compendium of simplified biological knowledge (and a bit of psychological theory, too). Recommended."
295,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117042790-h-n,3,"The Red Queen hypothesis: species do not get any better at surviving, their chances of extinction are random. ""It takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that."" Ridley then starts tracing the evolution of sex, beginning with the question: why sex? We take sex for granted, so much so that the question 'why sex?', looks absurd. But for evolutionary biologists, it is a great challenge. Suppose, in a sexual species, one individual decides (i.e. mutates to behave that way) to forego sex, he would put all his genes into each of his offsprings. A sexual individual puts only half of it. Therefore, the asexual is at a huge advantage. The second and third chapters are devoted to this riddle and the possible solutions. One of the most convincing answers is that sex is an adaptation to resist parasites. Hosts evolve genetic mechanisms to resist parasites and parasites evolve mechanisms to overcome them. But parasites have a shorter generation time, resulting in faster evolution. This advantage to parasites is countered by the hosts using sexual reproduction. Parasites of sexual species have to face a new gene combination in every generation. The result is an arms race in which nobody wins. Like the Red Queen in Lewis Carroll's ‘Through the looking glass’, who has to keep running to stay in the same place, the evolutionary race continues. Good science does not stop at the question 'why?'. It asks further 'why not?'. The fourth chapter discusses why two and only two sexes exist - male and female. Why not three or more or why not only one, for that matter? This is followed by a discussion of sexual selection. The obvious, but not as simple as we believe, answer to the question, why peacocks have beautiful tails - is sex. Ridley, so far, is talking nothing but frontline animal behaviour. With this background, from chapter six onwards, he ventures into the question of how human behaviour is shaped by the evolutionary drive called sex. What are the origins of love and lust, faithfulness and adultery, family bonds, social status, political ambitions, arts, and almost every aspect of human behaviour? Evolution of the human brain and development of languages also have a strong component of sexual selection without which we wouldn't have been what we are. These chapters are a complex series of surprises, provocations, consolations but they might feel a bit out-of-date given the book was written in 1993, over two and a half decades ago, when the various divisions of social and biological sciences may have been more at odds.The book ends with a very mature commentary on human nature. The discussion on the old debate on nature versus nurture is remarkably balanced. Ridley defies the popular belief that animals have more instinct and humans have more learning, asserting that humans have both, more instincts and more learning. ""If we can free ourselves from the sterile- dogmatic dispute about nature and nurture, we can gradually uncover the rest (of the human behaviour map)."" Overall, I found the book to be interesting, but some parts felt like a bit too much speculation, leaving me uncertain of what actually is the cause of various biological features. I wonder if this is why I don’t read more non-fiction – I can trust the fiction to be fiction, but with non-fiction, I’m constantly asking myself “how does he know? And would I agree with his interpretation?” However, Ridley is a science journalist and not a researcher himself and has provided a lot of footnotes in the book to the actual research around many theories presented, in case anyone is interested to follow them up."
296,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54779881-prabhat-singh,2,"Poorly written and loaded with biology jargon, this one is really difficult to get through. The book delves into far too many theories on each and every subject it takes up, only to declare after a 3-page discussion that they've already been proven wrong. The metaphor 'The Red Queen' was overused and, to be honest, I didn't fully understand how the book came to its central conclusion - sex was invented to keep pathogens away. Only someone with a reasonably good knowledge of biology can appreciate it.Plus, it's highly European-centric. To the author's credit, he admits as much. However, he bases many of evolutionary psychology's conclusions on European trends - monogamy among emperors - which were far from the norm in other parts of the world. For instance, most Indian and Asian kings were hyper-polygamous, which puts paid to EP's claims of monogamy being inherent to men.European-centric or not, the book is riddled with flaws in its attempt to cement the primacy of nature over nurture, which is the central premise of EP. For example, to establish that men are inherently more promiscuous than women, it claims homosexual men sleep around more than their straight counterparts, a conclusion that is either strongly contested or simply wrong. Again, the books wrongly claims that there's something inherent about the appearance that men like in women (voluptuous and slim at the waist) and vice-versa (V-shaped body). This is demonstrably false, since men with big bellies were liked more during different periods of human history and anorexic women now have the upper hand over their voluptuous counterparts. Also, Greek male statues had small penises because these were indicators of culture, which is a U-turn from what we assume modern women like in men. The author struggles with a host of theories to explain these differences, but ends up avoiding the most obvious - what suits the eye is far more a function of idiosyncrasies and the prevalent culture than inherent nature.Having read this book and The Moral Animal back to back, along with a plethora of articles for and against EP, my conclusion is that no matter how fascinating and sometimes convincing, EP is ultimately much weaker a theory than what its evangelists would have us believe. Its two fundamental premises - procreation is the ultimate goal of every human action, and the human mind is biologically conditioned to follow instincts developed during the hunter-gatherer era - seem misplaced. I have discussed why the first is flawed here (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...).For a very good discussion of why the agricultural revolution and subsequent changes are a better explanation of current human behaviour, please see the following reddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates..."

Unfortunately it was in the wrong place at the wrong time, an run-time audiobook during a month of poor physical shape and an assortment of tragically dysfunctional earphones. Explains how little I've actually been able to take away from this, despite the inordinately high instances of perky ears, shiny eyes and vigorously nodding head all through the 10 or so spins it took me to get through this. For better or worse, the tone and philosophy with which he approaches the unique content matter isn't itself unique compared to, say, Genome, so at least I've absorbed an emergent wavefront of information that is his trademark epistemic and artistic bent, valuable understanding given I plan to read all his books now. Notes.. such as they are.Why sex? Maybe it is better at correcting wrong mutations. Maybe it is better at creating right mutations. But it seems to be connected with degree of change in environment. When environment changes a lot, it pays to have sexual reproduction. Aphids that travel farther, develop wings. Affirming the consequent: If A causes B, and you observe B, does not mean A was the cause. Need instead to do P(A/B). Most genetic theories are like this. Many parallel theories none of which contradict one another, explain the effect, but not really. Males are resource-intensive, so high-status individuals will tend to have males (only high status males will succeed in mating, whereas all females will succeed), low-status will hedge bets and have women.Why affluent, upper caste individuals more likely to abort female infants? Terns mate for life, male provides for offspring. Peacocks don’t. So Peahens are more demanding and choosy because all they are getting from males is genes. If you keep removing 10% cream of gene pool you will end up at some irreducible gene pool that cannot be further segmented. 2 camps to explain Peacock tail: Fischerians (good taste, sexy son), that a female knows female choice and therefore conforms otherwise it will produce a son that will be rejected. Good-gene theory says taste is a byproduct of good fitness. But if this were case, why would female choice in a Lek be influenced by what other females are doing?If better to be chief’s 2nd wife than poor man’s 1st, polygamy will ensue. Until existing wives themselves have a problem with it. Bribery is why there is a senior wife, and 1st wives usually get an average of 70% of inheritance across cultures."
298,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48319145-clive-f,5,"Four and a half stars for this one, I think. A clear and careful exploration, starting with why any creatures might reproduce sexually (since asexual reproduction is more certain of passing all your genetic material on to the next generation), then working through why there are almost always two genders, before tackling the thorny subject of gender differences in the animal kingdom. Finally, we get onto us humans, and the evolutionary story about behaviour differences between the genders. Even more than for many other animals, the evolutionary pressure in humans is to compete with other humans, rather than with environmental pressures: that's the Red Queen of the title. The faster we run, the faster others run, and the faster still we have to run to stay ahead. Today, even more than when the book was written in the early 1990s, this subject area is extremely fraught. Many would deny that gender differences are anything other than cultural, and the author goes to great lengths to explain the substantial evidence pointing to (a) their existence, and (b) their evolutionary origins, as opposed to cultural origins. I was a little worried that the 25 years or so since this book had been published would have produced new evidence that contradicted this thesis. Coincidentally, within a couple of hours of finishing the book, I came across well-reasearched current papers supporting the core points of the book: https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/13/...We can see through these arguments that women are driven by evolution to want different things in their partners than men: on the whole, women are genetically programmed to seek to mate with men of status, so their genes get a leg up the power hierarchy, as higher-status men generally have higher-status children, and generally more of them. Meanwhile, men are programmed to seek younger women, as they may father more children by them. But as the book points out repeatedly, we have the significant capability to rise above our ""programming"": murder is entirely natural, but it doesn't mean we want it ruling our current society. So the question can still legitimately be asked as to whether we want to be like this: if so, how do we wish to set up our culture, and then, how might we judge those who fail to meet our new (culturally created) standards.

He was funny, lovable, caring and just downright amazing.Now I probably should move on before I write three whole paragraphs on why Jack King is an amazing main character. The story was absolutely intriguing. I loved every bit of it. Towards the end it felt a bit repetitive but even then this book was already on my favorites list. I haven't laughed this hard in a long while. The book was witty, fun and heartfelt.Jack makes multiple attempts at changing events. Each attempt leaves something amiss in Jack’s life. The most important part of all this was him trying to find the balance between all the things that he holds dear. In a way this is about Jack’s love life but it also is a lot more than that. It also includes his friendship with his two best friends, Jillian and Franny, and his parents. I loved the mix of contemporary/romance/sci-fi vibes that I got.I loved Jillian and Franny just as much as Jack and Kate. Jack’s parents were also so very supportive and understanding, and the book just left me so warm and fuzzy. I loved the representation and I loved the whole dynamic of the story. I would recommend this to everyone! Every single reader out there to pre-order a copy of this wonderful book."
