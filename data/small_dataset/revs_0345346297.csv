0,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,5,"The most hauting question that this book poses is this : Chimpanzees can abstract. Like other mammals, they are capable of strong emotions.Why, exactly, all over the civilized world, in virtually every major city, are apes in prison? For a species that has proclaimed itself to be the rulers of Earth, this is not a very difficult question to answer for us. It is a single word : suppression. We humans never much liked competition from other creatures and history tells us that this was how we overcame all our natural predators through weaponry or guile in the eons past. A moment of reflection on our past brings up that question : why did the other humanoids not survive while our ancestors did ? How did they all gt wiped out ? Natural selection could not have been the only answer.This book is one that shook me out of cerebral complacency and like a good author, Sagan opens the cobweb laden windows of my brain and lets the light in.This is a book length introspection into the nature of human intellect. From the first tottering steps of our primate ancestors to today's technologically addicted life forms, how has the journey been for that mass of tissue between our ears ? This is what Sagan attempts to answer. In simple,lucid and easy to comprehend prose the author breaks down the story of how our brains assumed today's form and reflexes. It is a tour de force that mixes and matches history,paleontology, psychology and other branches of human understanding to come up with a fascinating study.The evolution of the brain and how the most primal fears in our psyche still rule our subconscious is a fascinating observation and forms the best part of this book. The aspect of the Triune brain and the R-complex's involvement in human behavior is what Sagan calls the Dragons chained away in the dungeons of our minds. Our basic aversion to reptiles and the dreams populated with snakes coupled with the dreams of a fall from a height are all speculated upon by Sagan in teh backdrop of our dreams. They were quire revelatory and while I might at a later point in time (with more reading)debate these points, they did rekindle my interest in the human brain's inner workings. I finished reading, put down the book and ran my fingers through my hair and muttered You are a rockstar to my brain. The kind of rockstar who you can never fully figure out is how it might react to that comment ! This book is highly recommended and it is no fluke that I rate all of Sagan's books so far as five stars. This is stuff that will genuinely interest the skeptical mind."

If we had two synapses, then 2^2 = 4 states; three synapses, then 2^3 = 8 states, and, in general, for N synapses, 2^N states. But the human brain is characterized by some 10^13 synapses. Thus the number of different states of a human brain is 2 raised to this power-- i.e., multiplied by itself ten trillion times. This is an unimaginably large number, far greater, for example, than the total number of elementary particles (electrons and protons) in the entire universe."""
2,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,4,"Dragons of Eden by Carl Sagan won the Pulitzer Prize for Non-Fiction in 1978Natural selection has served as a kind of intellectual sieve, producing brains and intelligences increasingly competent to deal with the laws of nature.There isn’t much discussion of dragons, beyond a short snippet on Komodo dragons, in this book but Sagan uses this metaphor as a catchy title to highlight that this fear may be part of our own mammalian evolution. The dragon concept is buttressed by so many old tales throughout numerous civilizations that Sagan implies there must have been a fearsome dragon or related animal in our distant past that shaped our evolution. I am not convinced per se but the rest of the book is much more serious than this topic. Carl Sagan is arguably the greatest science writer and educator of recent times. In this book his mind, through his theories, is on full display for all to see. He steps through various evolutionary ideas about how man (and his brain) has evolved. As has been stated in other reviews of this book, a mark against it is that some sections are now outdated. Science evolves. Yet, for me, it is remarkable even when discussing a mundane game of ‘Pong’ that Sagan is able to foresee many of our challenges we face today. He even talks about the danger of computers and video games pre-empting children from learning the proper fundamentals of math and science. As a parent, there is little argument from me on this point. At its core this is a thought provoking book that resonates. It is short at only nine chapters so I will review the chapters here — because many are true gems and the rest are pretty good.Chapter 1 — The Cosmic CalendarIn this chapter Sagan famously maps the age of the universe, nearly 14 billion years, into a single year. We see that if the Big Bang starts on January 1st at 12:01 am, then humans don’t arrive to the timeline until December 31st at 10:30 pm, and all of our recorded history can be confined to the final 10 seconds of the year! Powerful stuff.Chapter 2 — Genes and BrainsThe average human brain has 10^13 synapses. This means there are 2^(10^13) possible states of a single brain, a number that approaches the number of atoms in the universe. We also learn that “The simplest organisms on Earth today have just as much evolutionary history behind them as the most complex”. In other words even simple diatoms are well honed and efficient machines. Chapter 3 — The Brain and the ChariotHumans have a very high brain to mass ratio relative to any other animal on the planet. Sagan goes on to discuss sleep and posits a theory that land mammals sleep so much because they can hide and are less vulnerable than marine mammals. For example dolphins rarely sleep, sometimes only for a minute at a time. I will take it a step further and say that land mammals may also sleep so much because it is difficult for most, not all, mammals to find food in the dark. Isn’t it better to burn as few calories as possible through sleeping those night time hours away. Whatever the real reason, this trait goes back to the end of the dinosaur era.Chapter 4 — Eden as a Metaphor“paleontologists have deduced that “bipedalism preceded encephalization,” by which they mean that our ancestors walked on two legs before they evolved big brains.” It seems that hunting developed brains further in this regard. Chapter 5 — The Abstractions of the Beasts. My favorite chapter. It’s largely about how humans have developed verbal speech and a large part of our oversized brains are dedicated to this function. But it also discusses how incredibly smart chimpanzees are and how presumptuous humans are about or lack thereof intelligence in all animals. It seems that this view is because they don’t have vocal chords. Scientists have taught select chimps sign language and they have learned to use words correctly and in context (nouns, verbs and adjectives) to the tune of vocabularies in excess of one hundred words. The chimps can even sign curse words when humans introduce illogical steps into a food reward scheme. The average human uses just 1,000 common words in everyday speech and some mentally impaired humans don’t even reach that level. Sagan implies that due to the chimpanzee’s small brain volume it is unlikely they can ever achieve normal human level language. However it is clear that chimps (and many other animals) feel anxiety and think in ways that are much more in line with humans than I ever knew. The implication here is that the inability to verbalize word constructs, i.e. language, is what has kept other animals from evolving. Although dated, this chapter alone is worth the price of the book or a trip to the library.Chapter 6 — Tales of Dim EdenThis chapter primarily revisits the topic of sleep first broached in chapter 3 and talks a good deal about dinosaurs. Maybe this section should have been combined with The Brain and the Chariot.Chapter 7 — Lovers and madmenThis chapter is heavily focused on brain hemisphere functions and the tie-in to evolution. Very informative. “M. S. Gazzaniga of the State University of New York at Stony Brook suggests that hemispheric specialization occurs because language is developed in the left hemisphere before the child acquires substantial competence in manipulative skills and geometrical visualization. According to this view, the specialization of the right hemisphere for geometrical competence is a specialization by default—the left hemisphere’s competence has been redirected toward language.”Chapter 8 — The Future Evolution of our Brain.“In general, human societies are not innovative. They are hierarchical and ritualistic. Suggestions for change are greeted with suspicion: they imply an unpleasant future variation in ritual and hierarchy: an exchange of one set of rituals for another, or perhaps for a less structured society with fewer rituals. And yet there are times when societies must change.”Wow. This is such a well articulated statement. Most of us recognize this type of change is the fundamental impediment to solving many of our country’s problems and by extension in solving the world’s environmental and population problems. Sagan goes on to wade into the abortion debate as well. He also talks about tech and its benefit and possible detriment to children. Not a cohesive chapter by any stretch and outdated perhaps, but still thought provoking. Chapter 9 — Knowledge is our DestinyAn intriguing chapter where Sagan speaks of aliens. It is his belief that while their physical forms will be unfamiliar to us, their minds will be similar“Organisms throughout the universe should therefore be sensitive to optical and/or radio radiation, and, after the development of physics, the idea of electromagnetic radiation for interstellar communication should be a cosmic commonplace—a convergent idea evolving independently on countless worlds throughout the galaxy after the local discovery of elementary astronomy, what we might call the facts of life. If we are fortunate enough to make contact with some of those other beings, I think we will find that much of their biology, psychology, sociology and politics will seem to us stunningly exotic and deeply mysterious. But I suspect we will have little difficulty in understanding each other on the simpler aspects of astronomy, physics, chemistry and perhaps mathematics.”4.5 stars. The writing here warrants five stars. At 40 years and counting and the fact the book could have been longer, this is more like a 4 star book to me. Cosmos and Pale Blue Dot still remain my favorite Sagan books and are beautiful works. Sagan has long since passed away but I greatly miss his insights and his non-righteous quest for the truth. It really shines through in virtually all of his writing. Highly recommended."
3,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301054-stacey-mulvey,5,"I'd read this book a few years ago, and loved it. It's a great introduction to brain anatomy, consciousness/subconsciousness, and evolution. An ""easy"" read, if any book that deals with these types of topics can be considered as such. Sagan is good at presenting complex material in an interesting and palatable way. It made me want to start paying more attention to my dreams. (He also relates one of his personal experiences of smoking marijuana, and his theories of the effects it might have on the brain and consciousness.)"
4,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,3,"Carl Sagan is a big name, or at least he used to be. But other than the series Cosmo or the movie with Jodi Foster, he was known for his speculation in... everything. :) In this case, it's consciousness. By the title, he's referring to the lizard brain. And considering the fact that he was writing this out of the 70's and he disclaimed the hell out of it, it's meant to be a conversation starter for laymen.All good. And it's good, too. If I was reading this 40 years ago or even 30 years ago, I'd nod energetically at a lot of the ideas. The writing is good, the ideas sound, and the subject is still obviously open today.So what did I have a problem with?Actually, my complaint is rather prosaic. It's just dated. HEAVILY dated. It's like the line from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy where Prosser still thinks that digital watches are a good idea.There are better books that do the job of this one, but for the time I'm sure it was pretty fantastic. Not everything was dated. Philosophy and basic math and the broad strokes were good. But the fields of mental health, computers and computer games, the current development of cloning, AIs, and a huge extra list WAS.Alas. Time marches on."

6,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74816651-fran,5,"In this Pulitzer prize winning book, Carl Sagan, indubitably one of the finest scientific minds of our time, expresses his thoughts about life, most particularly about intelligent life, and its relation with the environment that gave it origin and shaped it.Aided by anthropological notions, evolutionary biology, psychology, and computer science, Sagan gives a well balanced perspective of how human intelligence evolved. However, notwithstanding Sagan's expertise in astrophysics, he warns us that in the neurosciences he's more of an amateur scholar than consumed expert. That, added to the age of the book, results in much of the book being speculative work. Interestingly, some of his assumptions have been latter integrated to the commonly accepted model for the evolution of the human brain.One of my favorite sections of the book takes on the biological function behind human intelligence. I particularly like when Sagan considers the complexity of biological life forms, putting in perspective the real significance of our cultural and technological advances. Anyone interested in human evolution will find this book exciting. The meaning of the evolution of extra-genetic intelligence (brains in animals and humans) and extra-somatic intelligence (writing, books, computers) in humans, the nature of instincts buried in our older ""reptilian brain"" regions, the conflict between the left and right neocortex and the purpose of each, this is exciting stuff that we can all see at work in our lives, giving evolution an extra layer of reality.After finishing reading, I was left wondering if the next evolutionary step would imply a complete detachment of our mind from the primate emotional instincts, and reliance only on the rational, more advanced brain. Is our brain on its way to become alike to Artificial Intelligence? I think Sagan did an extraordinary job with this book. His writing is engaging and easy to understand, even if you're not too much into the sciency stuff. Most impressive is how diverse, interesting and mind opening are the many well-informed topics contained in the ca. 250 pages of this book. A more recent book, ""Up from Dragons: The Evolution of Human Intelligence (2002)"" coauthor by Sagan and John Skoyles actualizes the concepts and hypotheses first presented in Dragons of Eden. But, don't get fooled, Up from Dragons is not a replacement reading to Dragons of Eden, it's a follow up for it will be a shame to miss Sagan's great original prose."
7,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3145526-traveller,4,"Interesting read, as long as one takes into account that it's quite old and outdated by now, so it's not exactly cutting edge. (I read it pretty long ago myself).Still, Sagan has a such a pleasant, conversational style, that even reading it for the speculations alone, makes reading the book a not unpleasant way of whiling away your time.I like the angles he chooses to speculate from, especially the bits about instinct and how myths most probably formed in the human collective subconscious."
8,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/545336-mike,4,Interesting questions on the origin and development of human intelligence. Still worth a read despite lots of progress since he wrote this. Gives a good description of left/right brain competencies. Has piqued my interest in evolutionary development. The guy was taken from us too early but sure made a name for himself in what time he had.
9,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3633-wilson,3,"This was an interesting book to read after all of the recent research and groundbreaking discoveries of the human brain. Clearly, Sagan smokes weed. However, there are times when he must be coming off his high that his insights are both subtle and poignant. Oxymoronic, to be sure, but so was most of Sagan's keen skepticism amidst his psuedoscientific platitudes.I use big words. That being said, some of the best parts of this book are the drawings related to studies conducted on patients with a severed corpus collosum. If you never read this book, I highly recommend you find it in a bookstore just to check out these studies. Here is a slightly-less technical version: http://nobelprize.org/educational_gam..."

This book is about intelligence, a topic both men dealt with, Gould most notably in his Mismeasure of Man. Sagan, however, deals with all intelligence, ending his book with a discussion of nonhuman intelligences, most particularly certain Cetaceans and primates. Noting that chimpanzees and gorillas appear to be intellectually comparable to human five-year-olds, he ends with a plea to extend some of the rights we afford our own children to members of other intelligent species.I read this book outside at the Ennui Cafe on Sheridan and Lunt in East Rogers Park, Chicago.

11,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56173179-ivana-books-are-magic,4,"I do read non- fiction occasionally, you know. When I do, these are the kind of books I want to be reaching for: educating and fascinating. Dragons of Eden: Speculations on Evolution of Human Intelligence is exactly what the title suggest. If you're interested in evolution, this book is a great choice. It is not very specific, it is more a series of essays but it is easy to read and understand. Indeed, what I like so much about this book is that it is so easily understandable. Sagan must have been a talented teacher; he clearly has a talent for transmitting knowledge. Plus, Sagan obviously had an interesting and curious mind. The way the book was written is simple, but the matters addressed are anything but. There are a lot of complex questions hiding in this book. Evolution as such, the human brain development and the intelligence are some of the topics explored. Since these are the all topics, I always found interesting, it is understandable that I quite liked this book. I don't have some great background knowledge about biology and evolution as such, yet there was not anything that I have not understood in the book. As I said, the book is easy to understand.Intelligence and brain evolution is a fascination topic. How did the human brain develop? However, what I liked most about this book was the question of intelligence in animals. That for me is one of the most fascinating themes. I something feel people invent definitions just to exclude animals from things we call ""human"". Who can claim animals don't have language when chimps are capable of using sing language? Nevertheless, in every linguistic book you'll find: “Language is a solely human accomplishment...."" I don't think it is. I really don't. I think that some highly evolved apes such as chimps and orangutans are perfectly capable of acquiring a language. There are apes that have learned sign language. You cannot take that accomplishment from them, not unless you want to say that sign language isn't a real language. It obviously is, and those apes are using it, so they are quite clearly, capable of mastering a language. "
12,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,4,"I read this one quite long back... and really loved it at that time. I only remember two things from the book, however.The first one is where Sagan speculates that God's curse on Eve, ""you shall bring forth your children in pain"", refers to the increased cranial size of intelligent homo sapiens. It is common knowledge that childbirth in humans is much more painful than in animals because of the larger size of the head due to an enlarged brain: thus, could the story of Eden contain a veiled reference to evolution?The second is a sentence: ""The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."" Spoken in the context of missing fossil records, I remember thinking at the time that this could also be applied to God!"
13,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/270879-robin,4,"I feel strongly that this book should be included in mythology courses because better than any textbook I've ever encountered it addresses the connections that exist between mythology and science. Not to say that mythology is scientific, but rather the ways of viewing the world, both contemporary and historical, that human beings seem to return to again and again often are the way they are for very sound biological reasons.

""To write a book in a subject so far from one's primary training is at best incautious. But...the temptation was irresistible.""
That quote, found in the acknowledgements, sums up both the problems with this work, and also it's ironic charm. You must read this early work of Sagan not as definitive science, but as a prime example of his inimitable ability to connect science to other intellectual concerns such as myth, religion and history, thus stimulating thought in the process.At least Sagan is completely honest: the subtitle itself indicates these are ""speculations"" which presumably have not been verified. In fact, the book represents a kind of popular science (really, science itself) not seen much anymore. It takes confidence and a willingness to take criticism and the harsh judgement of history, to produce such a work. It's value is of the highest order: that of creative thinking.""This book itself is an exercise in pattern recognition, and attempts to understand something of the nature and evolution of human intelligence, using clues from a wide variety of sciences and myths. It is in significant part a right-hemisphere activity; and in the course of writing I was repeatedly awakened in the middle of night or in the early hours of the morning by the mild exhilaration of a new insight. But whether the insights are genuine – and I expect many of them will require substantial revision – depends on how well my left hemisphere has functioned."" [italics mine]The writing is the usual poetic Sagan style, highly readable and yet capable of conveying deep thoughts. The difficulties, however, are serious. It's hard to know what is speculation, what was accepted as fact in 1977, what has been proved true, and what's been superseded. Read the book to marvel at Sagan's mind, not to learn current knowledge on how the brain works.I could list many factual things wrong: excessive reliance on the triunal brain (putting too much emphasis on the brains's ""reptilian-complex"" as a driver of aggressive behavior and everything else anti-intellectual, for example), offering up the wrong theory for the extinction of the dinosaurs (he says it was a supernova explosion: hard to believe that Sagan, himself a planetary scientist, had not even considered in 1977 the now generally accepted asteroid impact theory!), and I could go on at length. But...there really is no reason to point out the errors. Again, the purpose of this book is not to serve as a textbook, but to stimulate thought—to speculate.The core of the book is his ideas on evolutionary memory, those experiences of proto-humans which to assure species survival were recorded in DNA. This is controversial, for sure, but it's curious how he links several creation myths—Greek, Genesis—to ""dragons,"" which he defines as now-extinct larger, more dangerous reptiles which preyed upon mammals, including humans. ""We are descended from reptiles and mammals both. In the daytime repression of the R-complex, in the nighttime stirring of the dream dragons, we may each of us be replaying the hundred-million-year-old warfare between the reptiles and the mammals."" Maybe he's suggesting these were actually dinosaurs, maybe not, but he is suggesting some sort of evolutionary survival memory preserved to assist success, such as fear of snakes. This following should give you a flavor of the book. He's stretching mightily to merge poetry with science:""The pervasiveness of dragon myths in the folk legends of many cultures is probably no accident. ... Is it possible that dragons posed a problem for our protohuman ancestors of a few million years ago, and that the terror they evoked and the deaths they caused helped bring about the evolution of human intelligence? Or does the metaphor of the serpent refer to the use of the aggressive and ritualistic reptilian component of our brain in the further evolution of the neocortex? With one exception, the Genesis account of the temptation by a reptile in Eden is the only instance in the Bible of humans understanding the language of animals. When we feared the dragons, were we fearing a part of ourselves? One way or another, there were dragons in Eden.""Only Sagan could get away with this poetic image and remain scientific: from almost any other it would be pseudo-science; here it is rational speculation, although certainly offered without any proof.Less seriously, it's fun to read Sagan's view on computers—as of 1977. In almost every book he wrote, he couldn't resist gushing about them! It's possible to string these parts together from his thirty-year-long book publishing career and have a respectable history of computers and their affect on culture and scientific research. Dragons of Eden is a humorous gem in this regard, as, for example: ""The computer terminal is a commonplace on the Dartmouth campus. A very high proportion of Dartmouth undergraduates learn not only to use such programs but also to write their own."" I remember very well the vast rooms full of terminals which all the students used, it felt almost like prison at times!I intend no criticism, but the extended excerpt below is, shall we say, embarrassing in its outright geekiness. You probably won't be able to resist laughing at his amazement with the invention of computer games, now so completely endemic:""Computer graphics are now being extended into the area of play. There is a popular game, sometimes called Pong, which simulates on a television screen a perfectly elastic ball bouncing between two surfaces. Each player is given a dial that permits him to intercept the ball with a movable ""racket."" Points are scored if the motion of the ball is not intercepted by the racket. The game is very interesting. There is a clear learning experience involved which depends exclusively on Newton's second law for linear motion. As a result of Pong, the player can gain a deep intuitive understanding of the simplest Newtonian physics…""Although his book won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1978, Dragons of Eden can no longer be recommended to the general reader. It has aged far too much to be reliable. Still, it retains much interest and beauty for the dedicated Carl Sagan fan."
15,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,4,"Any book on the brain written in the 70s is going to be outdated. For example, Sagan wasn't sure if different parts of the brain affected different things. But an enjoyable read. He does make one important point clear early on: the ""mind"" is just a function of the brain. Dualists who think they are two different things are flat out wrong. I have had people look me straight in the eye without even blinking and say that if a person's brain were destroyed, their mind would still function normally. That's always an end-of-discussion comment for me. "

19,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27248823-vishal,5,"Carl Sagan was a planetary scientist with primary interest in exobiology and extraterrestrial intelligence. He was perfectly aware that speculation, study and understanding of extra-terrestrial intelligence would require a thoroughly comprehensible understanding of terrestrial human and non-human intelligence such as primates and aquatic mammals. If emergence of intelligence is convergent end point of many different evolutionary histories, as evident in our expectations of intelligent aliens, then some universal aspects of intelligence will transcend the evolutionary and biochemical differences. In other words, some features and characteristics of intelligence would be similar in intelligence emerging throughout the Universe. He knew this and he spent considerable time in studying evolution of intelligence on Earth. This book is an outcome of his research, intended to present his insights, speculations and related findings for a reader with enthusiasm in Science, and for the young readers who wish to pursue Science it can work as a book stimulating their interest and teaching them to draw insights.Carl states the premise of the book to be ancient myths which turn out to be remarkably in coherence with modern scientific findings. One of the examples he states is the constant mythological depiction of arch-rivalry of dragon and the man. Now this myth is found to be consistent with findings regarding the fierce competition between Reptiles and Mammals in the early emergence and evolution period of the Mammals, which the Mammals won because of their smarter brains, co-operation and protection of the young; behaviors significantly in contrast with those of the Reptiles. Another is the constant conflict of motives and interest between aggressive R-complex, part of the human brain inherited from our reptilian ancestors, and rational Neo-cortex which is unique to primates. It must be noted that vague correlation of ancient myths with current scientific findings doesn't imply that ancient myths contain any iota of rationally obtained scientific truth in them, but rather the fact that myths are just representations of our vague intuitions and casual observations of our surroundings. This intuition could have been supported by the observation that infants of human and non-human primates are born with an inherent fear of snakes, and this fear could plausibly be related to perennial rivalry and hostility between reptiles and mammals, and consequently giving rise to the aforementioned myth.The book begins with a rudimentary introduction of evolutionary theory, mutation, accretion and propagation of favorable mutations, information content of the DNA and how it manifests itself in living beings and their apparent complexity; eventually arriving on the evolution of brain. He explains the various parts of brains in different taxonomic divisions, their functions and redundancy in the terms of pisces brain, R-complex(reptilian brain), limbic system(mammalian brain), neo-cortex in humans and other primates. He explains the origins of our aggressive, ritualistic, hierarchy and sexual attitudes by attributing them to R-complex and cynically remarks upon his observation that our political and social conditions are predominantly controlled by our reptilian instincts. Then he elaborates upon the origin of our emotions such as love and fear in the limbic system, which is also associated with recognition of smell and keeping of our short-term memories. With examples of different experiments by neurobiologists, he shows the effect of electrical stimulation of different parts of brain to determine their functions and how electrical stimulation gives output that is consistent with the phenomena of perceiving from external stimuli. A remarkable conclusion derived from his intuitions in this book, after comparing working principles of artificial intelligence and biological intelligence, is that free-will can be completely disregarded; and if someone denies consciousness to a fairly intelligence machine on the grounds of ""just being a metallic machine"", then we should disregard the intelligence of machines made of Carbon as well.Next, he embarks on the intelligence of non-human primates, their lifestyles, their symbolic languages and scientific experiments performed on them which show them to be as much intelligent as our ancestors, the Homo Habilis. Then he raises questions about imprisoning and maltreatment of the apes by us, whose level of rationalism and consciousness is shown to be comparable with microencephalic humans and aquatic mammals such as dolphins and whales. He demands compassionate and ethical treatment of our fellow sentient beings, so that we can undo the harm caused by our ancestors who had wiped out all the species from the face of Earth which showed even slight upsurge towards intelligence. Neanderthals, Cro-Magnons, Homo Erectus, Australopithecine robustus and many other species contemporary to our ancestors were brutally massacred by our ancestors in their quest for survival. We can compensate for that harm by ethically treating our fellow sentient primates and helping them develop intelligence, efforts to teach symbolic languages to Chimpanzees can be considered as the first step towards that. We can also cherish in the fact that common communicative language contains about 1000 words and many lab Chimpanzees easily learn around 200 words, they seem capable of abstract reasoning, sense of humor, asking questions, creating new phrases and forming expletives as well.There is a brief account on our interpretation of dreams in a manner consistent with neurobiology, after a brief but lucid interlude on explaining the evolutionary origins of dreams and sleep. The logical incoherence, strong emotional content and fantastic element of our dreams are associated with, respectively, turning off the rational left brain, free reign to limbic and reptilian complex and free association induced in intuitive right brain. It is observed that, during sleep, our left brain indulges in memory buffering and stacking of information which disconnects it from our conscious brain and then right brain shows us patterns without any coherence or correlation while our limbic system and reptilian complex give rise to strong emotional and fear content of our dreams. This phenomena is also explained with help of metaphors and myths which can be considered as aid to our intuitive understanding of these ideas. Then we arrive at vivid descriptions of right brain, left brain and their connecting link: corpus callosum. Corpus callosum works as link to connect our intuitions with our reasoning and is pivotal to almost every advancement in the fields of Science, Art, Humanities and Literature. Our civilization could be said to be a product of corpus callosum. Conclusion resides on the speculations about advancements in association among humans and various artificial intelligence, to enhance our extrasomatic information content as well as develop a sophisticated retrieval system if we connect our brains to the artificial aid. This kind of association may be very crucial to our survival considering the upheaval of dangers posed to our civilization by our emotional immaturity and short-term vision, where swift and rationalized decisions are imperative to our success and prosperity as a species. Developing and associating with artificial intelligence can help us grasp the universal aspects of intelligence, speculate about what kind of non-human intelligence could exist and devising prudent and efficient means of communication with them; these lessons will help us greatly when we acquire messages from any extra-terrestrial civilization because only an intelligent entity comprising of human and artificial intelligence would be able to sift through it and arrive upon comprehension. With remarkably rapid advances in human enterprise and its facilities, the problems caused by it can only be solved with more knowledge and better understanding of our ethics and possible courses of actions which are not possible to be devised by slowly evolving human intelligence. Aid of rapidly evolving artificial intelligence is required to help us in our moment of peril caused by our adolescent technology and our immature civilization whose most of the individual brains are still governed by reptilian brain, with the instincts inherited from billions of years in past."

Each player is given a dial that permits him to intercept the ball with a movable ""racket"". Points are scored if the motion of the ball is not intercepted by the racket. The game is very interesting. There is a clear learning experience involved which depends exclusively on Newton's second law for linear motion. As a result of Pong, the player can gain a deep intuitive understanding of the simplest Newtonian physics - a better understanding even than that provided by billiards, where the collisions are far from perfectly elastic and where the spinning of the pool balls interposes more complicated physics.This sort of information gathering is precisely what we call play. And the important function of play is thus revealed: it permits us to gain, without any particular future application in mind, a holistic understanding of the world, which is both a complement of and a preparation for later analytical activities. But computers permit play in environments otherwise totally inaccessible to the average student."""

Sneak this text into Red State high school libraries! It is still in print despite being dated: a time capsule snapshot of the then state of evolutionary science, primatology, computers and brain science. Despite Sagan’s leaps into speculations it is well written and is still a fine appetizer to the study of the brain and evolutionary psychology. Sagan also tries to tie in the myths of Genesis—esp. the Garden of Eden—into the development of the human mind. Refreshingly naïve, sure. Sagan entertains theories of genetic memory—wouldn’t this be Lamarckian?—to explain the persistence of Western religious myths. Not convincing, but nice try. Note that a movie about genetic memory, Altered States, came out the same year."

26,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49049055-parth-agrawal,4,"""Science is only a Latin word for Knowledge and Knowledge is our destiny""- Carl SaganI'll be honest, initial 50 pages of the book gave me all the reasons to give up this and start anew. The credit goes to the biological backdrop of the book but with time, I realized that my age old belief of biology, being an enigma and a damp squib, was based on all wrong perceptions.As the name suggests, the speculation on human intelligence by the author largely consists of the evolution of mankind from Homo Habilis to Erectus to Sapiens and, to be more specific, of the human brain. Evolution on Earth includes the whole spectrum of intelligence from stupidest to the most intelligent organism but one of the biggest revelation to me in this was the fact that the Brain mass has nothing to do with intelligence. A human Brain roughly weighs 1375 cubic centimeters and the deviations from the average number varies from as low as 1230( Einstein's brain weight) to as high as 2000 cc. The better metric to determine the relation between intelligence and brain mass is the ratio of brain mass to the body mass of the organism. When graphical analysis of the ratios of various organisms was done it was found that the human beings topped the charts with the nearest organism to humans being the dolphins. Considering the individual evolutionary cycle of the family homo, it has been observed that there has been a substantial growth in this ratio from habilis to sapiens. No wonder that artists paint the future depicting humans as people with huge heads, small hands and feet which me may appear horrendous, but in the hindsight, I feel the remoteness of that happening isn't that low. Old historical conflicts. This is what human history majorly consists of isn't it? Who defeated who and whose dynasty went on for how many years. What's funny is that even their evolutionary history is rife with skirmishes forcing them to mold their very lifestyle in such a manner that it ensured safety of their kind from the environment. Mammals and Reptiles have been age old enemies and during the time of dinosaurs, reptiles were known to be diurnal animals. When intelligence was not the primary weapon of the species; as it could never directly be used as a weapon of offense or defense against the perpetrators; the primary weapons were claws, teeth strong muscles basically any physical aspect which could guarantee that either you could fight off the threat or run away from it. This helped the reptiles to win the battle most of the times against mammals as they were gifted with these weapons. Well as the dinosaurs were wiped off the face of the Earth, mammals started to flourish as they transformed from nocturnal to diurnal animals, their nature of protecting their young ones helped them to increase their populations and they started to use their gift of intelligence in a more constructive manner. All the story above was to highlight the significance of sleep in mammals, need of which until now has been inexplicable. We don't really know why do we need sleep. But shouldn't it just be about resting and getting recharged? No, because if that would've been the case, the average sleeping hours wouldn't have shown such large deviations. But some of the sleep related activities can be explained like when we sleep we are at our most vulnerable state and that's why we are protective about our young ones sleeping as they won't be able to defend themselves, like we loose our sleep when we are stressed as that alarms the R-complex part of the brain that some distress is overdue which is perceived by the brain as life threatening. The latter half of the book elucidates on how do we juggle between the two hemispheres of brain. The left hemisphere of the brain is known to be the rational part whereas the right side of the brain is the intuitive one. We all love the right part don't we? it hardly believes in rules and regulations, it's free creative and promotes doing whatever you feel like. Actually what you feel like is controlled by this right side only. It is good with patterns, shapes, creativity and innovation but the most important activity that it has a role to play in is dreaming. When we dream, the right hemisphere shuts down the left hemisphere and that's why we have so many stories that so many famous people found the solution of their problems through a divine manifestation in their dreams. Actually what happened was the right brain has a tendency to form patterns with anything it has got. So it is not always necessarily true that the patterns of that sort exist. Now, here comes the functional requirement of left brain as one of the most important characteristics of human beings which consists of writing and reading resides in left brain and it believes in nothing unless it checks out the validity of that pattern by continuously doing experimentation to validate the hypotheses. Carpos Callosum is the name of the nerve which connects these two sides and helps the two parts to collaborate but as the saying goes:""Carpos Callosum is the charioteer who is trying to direct the chariot to its destiny with the left and right horses pulling the chariot in opposite directions."" I used to equate Science with rationality and by that logic, science should be all about left brain. But the pattern founding has been and will be done by the right brain only. What left brain does is that it just verifies whether the pattern really exists or not. How do we make our right brain more observant you ask? It gets exercised by arts, music, painting-in short, by creating something new. Well that's not so cool isn't it? Owning something something shining and commenting something flashy is the new sexy it seems. Well, it's debatable and who am I to judge.On that note, I should really get going with my guitar classes it seems;);)"

29,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35218012-anirud-thyagharajan,5,"Carl Sagan mesmerizes the reader with his impeccable research abilities, kneading key focal points in neuroscience with a beautiful literary fabric. He gives an educating tour of evolution and its repercussions on our intelligence, and how it impacts everything we do today - technology, lifestyle and possibly even our dreams. Sagan also has the innate ability to speculate about the future in absolute detail, most of the time chillingly accurate (eventhough it is not his primary field of research!). Let me hopelessly attempt to follow his style of quantifying the human brain intelligence, by saying that very few other books will be as useful for the 250 pages that this book enthralls you with. "

Here he examines humanity from a lot of different interesting angles, everything between cosmology, history, biology and morality. Here is something that will touch everyone. In my case i was especially fascinated with the chapter on cross species communication, but every single chapter is insanely intriguing. "
32,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46878-james,1,"The copy of the book I got was published in 1977 and what isn't out of date is wrong. The subtitle is ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"",  but little in the book is about that topic. The book rambles from from one subject to another,from cute drawings by everyone's favorite: M.C. Escher,to the chemical composition of distant stars. Perhaps the most interesting part is the chart that shows  Brain mass vs. Body weight. On that chart moles rate quite highly.Probably not the point the author was trying to make. The next time I see a mole I'll watch for signs of intelligence. There are many tidbits of trivia, one is the fact , that the average person has a 10% chance of having a genetic mutation that can be passed on to the next generation. Needless to say, almost all of these are harmful."
33,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10445368-kevin-kelsey,4,Very good considering that Carl Sagan is writing outside of his field. Great speculations on the evolution of human/animal intelligence. Minus 1 star for being heavily outdated (originally published in 1977). I'll definitely be reading a more recent book on the same topic; written by a neuroscientist rather than an astrophysicist.
34,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33235645-ankan-paul,5,"A concise and exhaustive book of 250 odd pages depicting the exhilarating tale of the evolution of human intelligence, brachiating to exciting topics exploring the ""Cosmic Calendar"", the need for brains to evolve out of limitations in the gene pool, the fascinating abilities and amazing qualities of the human brain, the siphoning of the human brain to its pristine form with layers formed over ages on the reptilian brain, the hidden truths behind us emerging via evolution by natural selection as the dominating species from our arboreal ancestors, the promising thought process of our cousins- the chimps, the significance of dreams in the survival of our species, the striking differences between the two halves of our brains in information processing, the importance of extra-somatic knowledge storing (writing books!), a symbiotic future of human intelligence and machine/artificial intelligence, and finally ending with humanity's search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. Who will say that Dr. Sagan wrote a book on a subject so far from his primary training, when every page is as replete with facts and contemporary neuro-science as it is with Dr. Sagan's profound speculations and conjectures? There is a reason why Dr. Carl Sagan is regarded as the teacher one always wished one had. I felt the same when I read the Cosmos, and since then made it my goal to read all his books. The Dragons of Eden is my second Carl Sagan read, and I must say I felt the same exhilaration while turning the pages that I felt while reading the Cosmos. To me, he is as good an artist as he is a scientist. His prose vividly portrays that. His own love for art, music, philosophy and every field that the human brain has produced is evident in his writings. And his appreciation is not just limited to the human species. His admiration encompasses the whole of the biodiversity on earth. And it is not just limited to the earth, it is for the whole cosmos. His writings have such a universal nature. When he writes, it seems he is writing for the whole species, on behalf of the whole world. Such a visionary! His writings makes one feel how small one's problems are in the grand scale of the ever expanding universe (or multiverse...who knows!).This book is no different. Subtitled ""Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"", the book does justice to the same. It is a fascinating tale of how we reached where we are today, with our connection to the reptiles (""dragons"") being embedded in the innermost core of our brains (the R-complex). Our brains have developed outwards since then, with more human like features being added in layers over the crudest core. There are exciting facts of how walking on two legs freed our hands to make tools, and to make better tools (hunting tools mostly, as that is only how we could have survived) better brains were a necessity. How our species massacred other primate species which showed signs of language (and hence a slight glimmer of intelligence) to ensure its survival. How our brain size is limited to the size of the pelvic cavity during child-birth. How there is a separation of functions in different locales of the brain and yet how our brains tend to be redundant with self-healing abilities. How there is a fight between the intuitive right half of the brain and the analytic/skeptic left half, and how that has led to the bias for the ""right""! I could go on listing all such beautiful stories put forth in the book. Besides recounting such tales and presenting the then recent developments in the field of neuro-science (split-brain experiments, experiments on understanding the localization of functions in the brain, those on deciphering the phenomenon of dreams, effects of neurotic drugs, surgeries on epileptic patients, studies on brain lesion of war soldiers, experiments on rat brains, etc), there are ample references to the myths and historical stories on the subjects, not to mention, the author's own rich and creative speculations, strewn all over the book, which grips the readers imagination and sends one spiraling down the ""what-if-that-is-true"" lane. The speculations were meant for contemporary and future scientists to work on. My favourite chapter from the book is ""The abstractions of beasts"" where Dr. Sagan presents all evidences of chimpanzee intelligence. Chimpanzees do have human like features, but how do you feel about human-like intelligence! Yes! I was really fascinated by the way Washoe, Lana or Lucy (the chimps) grasped the sign language taught to them and used it to communicate so effectively in such human-like manner. Imagine the idea of being able to talk to someone outside your species! The tales of the experiments that the author recounts is bound to touch your heart, make you really feel them. Language binds! The book is truly a gem. Dr. Sagan ploughs through the then recent developments in brain-studies, saturates the existing body of knowledge on the subject, lets loose his creative imagination, all the while weighing his words on a skeptic's scale, and brings forth this rich harvest for us commoners to enjoy. He stresses on the fact knowledge (""reason alloyed with intuition"" - the intelligence that has been so crucial in the survival and dominating nature of our species) is going to be the sole determinant of our race in the future, both for further development and to prevent self-destruction."
35,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57946842-ricardo-ari-sequeira,5,"Em comparação com os últimos livros que peguei, atrevo-me a dizer que as expetativas para este livro eram mais baixas. Considerava-me um fã de Carl Sagan porque conhecia o seu trabalho mas nunca lera nenhum livro da sua autoria nem vi ainda a famosa série Cosmos (cuja recriação brilhante de Neil DeGrasse Tyson é uma das minhas séries preferidas). Esta foi, portanto, a minha primeira experiência com um 'legado' de Sagan e que legado... Sinceramente, acho que não estava pronto para um trabalho tão genial como o que acabei de ler. Depois deste livro, acho que poderia ler Sagan explicar o ciclo de vida das minhocas com o máximo interesse imaginável. Quando dizem que ele é um apaixonado, um inspirador, um génio, um iluminado, um poeta... tudo isso é verdade e eu tive o prazer de comprovar nesta obra. Digo com toda a certeza (e tenho de pedir desculpa a Stephen Hawking neste aspeto, sem querer menosprezar a sua obra-prima) que este é o melhor livro de não-ficção que já li. Dei por mim a absorver todas as ""especulações"" de Sagan, a pensar nelas quando não estava a ler e a chegar a casa e escrever sobre o que havia lido e a fazer as minhas próprias ""especulações"". Tinha mesmo muita coisa para comentar sobre Os Dragões de Eden mas não me quero alongar nesta review.Quanto à escrita, especificamente falando, nada neste livro é muito técnico e o que se aproxima disso é explicado de forma transparente e de todo compreensível (com imagens esclarecedoras). É um trabalho de divulgação científica exemplar e inigualável.Queria deixar um excerto de um dos meus ""diários"" enquanto lia:""Eu estou a devorar e a adorar este livro, porque não é uma resposta a perguntas existentes, bem pelo contrário - é todo um conjunto de novas perguntas, teorias e suspeitas pertinentes sobre a inteligência humana (e animal). Perguntas que nunca teria imaginado que existiam e que eu tinha até ter lido este livro. Para mim esse é o maior legado com que fico. Já Neil DeGrasse Tyson dizia que, se pudesse perguntar qualquer coisa a uma entidade superior (que teria resposta qualquer que fosse a pergunta), a questão seria uma que ele ainda não conhecia neste momento porque questões mais fundamentais irão sempre surgir no futuro, questões que não imaginamos agora. (...) Vejo também a leitura deste livro como uma jornada de auto-conhecimento pois é de facto o nosso cérebro que é retratado nestas páginas. Este é tipo de livros que vale completamente a leitura e valerá uma releitura no futuro."" Por fim, deixo também um excerto do livro que me marcou desde logo e que demonstra também toda a capacidade de comunicação de Carl Sagan e a sua paixão pela ciência, vida e humanidade:""Como consequência das enormes transformações sociais e tecnológicas dos últimos séculos, o mundo não está a funcionar bem. Não vivemos em sociedades tradicionais e estáticas. Mas os nossos governos, ao resistirem à mudança, actuam como se tal acontecesse. A menos que nos venhamos a destruir totalmente, o futuro pertence às sociedades que, embora não ignorem o lado reptilineo e mamífero do nosso ser, permitem um desabrochar dos componentes caracteristicamente humanos da nossa natureza. Sociedades que encorajam a diversidade, e não o conformismo; sociedades que estejam dispostas a investir em recursos numa diversidade de experiências sociais, politicas, económicas e culturais, preparadas para sacrificar vantagens a curto prazo a benefícios a longo prazo; sociedades que tratem as novas ideias como vias delicadas, frágeis e imensamente valiosas que conduzem ao futuro."" (Carl Sagan, 1977)---Compared to the last books I picked up, I dare say that the expectations for this book were lower. I considered myself a fan of Carl Sagan because I knew his work but had never read any of his books or even seen the famous series Cosmos (whose brilliant recreation of Neil DeGrasse Tyson is one of my favorite series). This was, therefore, my first experience with a legacy of Sagan and what a legacy ... Honestly, I think I was not ready for such a brilliant work.After this book, I think I could read Sagan explaining the worm life cycle with the maximum interest imaginable. When they say that he's a passionate, an inspirer, a genius, an enlightened, a poet ... all this is true and I had the pleasure to prove it now.I say with certainty (and I have to apologize to Stephen Hawking in this respect, not wanting to belittle his masterpiece) that this is the best non-fiction book I have ever read. I absorbed all of Sagan's ""speculations"", I thought of them when I was not reading and I would get home and write about what I had read and to make my own ""speculations."" I had a lot to comment on The Dragons of Eden but I do not want to dwell on this review.As for writing, specifically speaking, nothing in this book is very technical and what comes close to it is explained in a transparent and comprehensible way (with enlightening images). It is an exemplary and unequaled scientific dissemination work.I wanted to leave here something I wrote about the book while reading it:""I am devouring and loving this book, because it's not a response to existing questions but quite the contrary - it's a whole set of new pertinent questions, theories, and suspicions about human (and animal) intelligence. Questions I would never have imagined existed and that I would never had if I didn't read this book. To me, that is the greatest legacy I got. Neil DeGrasse Tyson said that if he could ask anything to a superior entity (which would answer whatever the question was), the question Would be one he did not know at the moment because more fundamental questions will always arise in the future, questions that we can not imagine now ... I also see the reading of this book as a journey of self-knowledge because it is indeed our brain Which is portrayed in these pages.This is kind of a book that is worth reading completely and will be worth a re-reading in the future.Finally, I also leave a quote from the book that marked me from the beginning and also demonstrates all the capacity for communication of Carl Sagan and his passion for science, life and humanity:“As a consequence of the enormous social and technological changes of the last few centuries, the world is not working well. We do not live in traditional and static societies. But our government, in resisting change, act as if we did. Unless we destroy ourselves utterly, the future belongs to those societies that, while not ignoring the reptilian and mammalian parts of our being, enable the characteristically human components of our nature to flourish; to those societies that encourage diversity rather than conformity; to those societies willing to invest resources in a variety of social, political, economic and cultural experiments, and prepared to sacrifice short-term advantage for long-term benefit; to those societies that treat new ideas as delicate, fragile and immensely valuable pathways to the future.” (Carl Sagan, 1977)"
36,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"Carl Sagan's on a tear again. He can't stop himself, and you can't help cheering as you watch him go! He's a one man demonstration of evolution as a model for scientific method: cook up a whole lot of crazy mutant ideas and set them all free, unleash them on the World, and see which ones survive. ***Right now, he's working on the Mesozoic, and I'm along for the ride: we've got moronic dinos hunting mammals, which probably sleep all day as a defense mechanism ('cause they're too stupid to be quiet whilst being hunted) and cause ""the demise of the dinosaurs...by nocturnal predation on reptilian eggs. Two chicken eggs for breakfast may be all that is left... of this ancient mammalian cuisine."" This is classic Sagan, with some tenuous but imaginative hypothesis stretched to it's logical conclusion, and an insightful connection to bring it all home at the end. ***A stretched premise is one hallmark of science fiction writing, and I think Sagan's book fits the bill. He is Larry Niven and your favorite high school biology teacher rolled into one. But at the end what we get from Carl is a lot of fun stories and little more. Most are in the common cultural background (too many episodes of ""Cosmos"" perhaps?), but everyone is sure to come across a few delightful new anecdotes they hadn't previously heard: monkeys learning sign language, the endearing stupidities of midget brains,a naked Dr Louis Leaky outrunning his antelope, cannibal insectuous sex, Freud's work as a metaphor for our triply evolved and layered brain, (the reptilian hind brain naturally associated with the corporate board room: I liked that one!), the dad, divorced for cause of insomnia who retains custody of his genetically similar daughter, list goes on. This is all really good stuff and fast fun reading. ***But for all his fecundity, Sagan is not careful about the details of the ideas he sprays over the pages. His evolutionary reasoning is uncareful. Factors of 10 and 100 slip easily in and out in his calculation of brain power, the ratio of brain to body mass vs pure brain volume is a two edged sword he cuts in either direction as it suits him in different chapters, and so forth. He'll pause for air and disavow everything with a hand waving caution, ""just a hypothesis, now,"" but then he's off again. Waiter, I'll have whatever he's smoking. ***I once was teased with a variation on ""boundless youthful enthusiasm"" that transposed to: ""boundful useless enthusiasm"" and it comes, unbidden, to mind now. As an example of excitement overcoming rationality, the idea that an 8 Tonne T-rex, couldn't rouse itself from its numb stupor to prevent feral warm blooded whatevers from eating it's eggs is just an impossible stretch. (And, we can't help imagining the clever whatevers are our very own ancestors. Yeah! Go mammals!) OTOH, just considering the size and surface area, it is hard to imagine such big animals were not kept warm merely through metabolic inefficiency. THEY would have been the nocturnes, while we would have curled into furry balls at night, scampering between moribund overheating dinos during the hot lazy afternoons. Also, fur absorbs UV light, protecting our genetic blueprints from the supernova disaster that eradicated our scaly skinned competitors. ***Ok, ok, that's not in the book, I made it all up, but HE does it too! Yes, I know, HE'S Carl Sagan, and I'm not. ***We miss you Carl, - R.I.P. ***--------------Matt responded: I am curious to know what you think of some of the ""stretched premises"" towards the end. They attempt to apply his 'theories' on intelligence towards attitudes on social issues (computer intelligence, abortion, education, dream theory) and it all culminates in a direct insult of ""right-brain"" ideas diverging us from a utopia-by-intelligence. (Where intelligence is left-brain dominant).-------Ok done now, and my reply (to Matt) is that the book seemed to go out with a whimper, and I was neither opposed to nor enervated by, any of the last of it. I wanted cyborgs and computer super-minds, silicon immortality, x-ray vision and telepathy. Instead we got a pitch to fund wired classrooms and SETI. Ok already! ...I was hoping for more.I was not opposed because I agree with his thesis. Sagan is the consummate vampire slayer; he repudiates mystics of all sorts. Remember Sagan was (we must use the past tense not because he's dead but because, already, he represents a bygone era) still fighting Galileo's fight, one we only THINK is over because we live here: the battle of science against irrationality. REmember, Sagan thinks our right brain is responsible for brilliant flashes of insight, and art. I don't think he means the insult you apprehend.This takes us back to ZaTAoMM. Picture the misty past! The Epoch is BG (before Gates) and nerds are tolerated but joyfully reviled. Technology's evil, computers are laughable. People Do Not Believe ETI is out there and they're sure God is. The World is ruled by USSteel and PONG is the best and only computer game for heaven's sake!. It is hard for you guys to believe this shit (I call into context, regretfully, my advanced relative decrepitude, to remind that I am able to speak to you from the past, before your birth.) My point? It's a *real* battle that really needed to be fought, so we should forgive Sagan any overzealous driving home of the points. You need only think on the Texas and Kansas school systems to worry if the serpent's really truly been slain.Comments on some excellent vignettes towards the end:Witches dreaming of flying by reason of tripping on nightshade ~~ don't get me started! That they ""flew"" using broomsticks, well it's all merely hinted at, but if you listen close you can hear Carl snickering at his own jokes.Computers are conscious, or soon will be. I thought this especially cool, because it will at least be true so far as I can tell, and you can do NO BETTER! I mean, I can't *know* that you are conscious either, (solipsism) only that you're clever. So philosophically, once machines are clever, we may as well ascribe consciousness to them: it's only fair. Carl is very comfortable with this, with the proposition that consciousness is no more than the result of mere complexity, taken to a sufficient extreme. That's very well adjusted of him: I'm somebody who *wants* there to be more to me than there apparently is. (...and I make a lot more of this point than he bothers to.)Another excellent anecdote was Thoth railing against hieroglyphics as the calculators and video games of the age, certain to corrupt young minds which, relieved of the requirement to memorize everything, would grow indolent and weak. At this juncture, Carl reminds us how great written language is with a taunt that it allows an author to leap remotely off the page and into your brain! ...and across the chasm of death, too, I thought: a form of eternal life. For that instant I was again impressed with how very imaginatively Carl Sagan is able to think. So I'll respectfully say, ""No, I don't think it really sensible to imagine that Carl Sagan's prejudiced against the right brain."" To the contrary, he's All About right brain; his own is probably 50% bigger than the left.---------------------post script: as a companion to the chapter on right/left brain thinking I warmly recommend ""The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"" as a closely related romp through even further stretched conjectures of how our brain structure and thinking may be related.*** added 'cause Facebook publishes these without separating the paragraphs."

See Robert Sapolsky's ""Human Behavioural Biology"" for a refutation of this.I also thought the book lacked a decent structure, and found its writing a bit rambing and unfocused.Thankfully, it wasn't that long...2 stars."

48,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9096819-simon,4,"I got around to reading this book after finding out that it's a foundational text for the SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) movement, which Carl Sagan himself had a huge role in popularising: In ""Dragons of Eden"", Sagan gives laypeople a detailed explanation for how intelligence evolved here on Earth and hence clues for what to look for if they want to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.This book is very, very 1970s in many ways: As other reviewers have pointed out, the results of scientific research into neurobiology since its 1977 publishing date have falsified some of the ideas Sagans present here. There are also chapters where Sagan gets all starry-eyed and optimistic about computer technology's ability to improve human learning, to an extent that feels outright ridiculous to someone reading this in 2020. Despite all that, I am grateful for Sagan writing this book since it's difficult to find other books that present the basics of evolutionary biology, genetics and how the brain functions in this accessible a way to people who do not have an academic background in those scientific fields. It's even more impressive an achievement considering that the author is writing outside his own field of expertise - I doubt that Sam Harris could write as well about astrophysics as Carl Sagan does about neuroscience here!Much of the information presented here is also completely new to me, like how the different specialised parts of the brain have wildly varying proportions in different animal species depending on the animal's lifestyle - or how much easier it is to learn chimpanzees sign language than spoken language, to the point that chimpanzees can master sign language as well as humans. For me, the most interesting part of ""The Dragons of Eden"" has to be Sagan's explanation for how dreaming evolved: He theorises it's an evolutionary adaptation to make sure mammals stay asleep when hiding from nocturnal predators, and that the omnipresence of dragons and vampires in folklore and mythology around the world can be traced back to instincts evolved to help us avoid predatory dinosaurs and reptiles as well as nocturnal predators.I also quite like the psychedelic cover painting of an australopithecine Adam and Eve in a Garden of Eden populated by dinosaurs, prehistoric rhinoceri and even scorpions - a painting that probably ended up spraypainted on quite a few VW Microbuses back in the 1970s."

51,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71398830-johnny-j,4,"This wasn't actually my first time reading Dragons of Eden, as I had to read it for a certain curriculum based assignment at a private school I attended a few years ago. I forget exactly why we read it, but I can remember that there was a focus on neuroscience and the early life of Earth in what we were learning. My teacher was also just a huge Sagan/popular science fanatic. I remember thinking the book was interesting, but I, more or less... skimmed it back then. Maybe I've matured (I don't really think so), but I wanted to pick it up again and actually process the information that Sagan blissfully bestows on the reader. There wasn't any pressing need for me to read Dragons of Eden, I just kind of saw it sitting on my bookshelf when I was making the reading challenge list for English class and thought it would be nice to re-read. Dragons of Eden is, more or less, chapters upon chapters of Carl Sagan's thoughts and discoveries on the brain and the human condition. From segments that literally give a calendar of the entirety of the universe's events, to chapters that focus solely on the learning capabilities of primates, to findings on the rare deformity of a ""split-brain"" in humans, Sagan provides an insane amount of information in a small book (there are exponentially more topics highlighted in Eden, those mentioned are just some examples). Each subject, while they may seem distantly related, builds on top of one another with various terminologies and fundamental concepts. His overall thesis is that human nature and the neural states of homo sapiens are filled with relics from the distant past, those relics still visible today. It's not often i'll go for something non-fiction, especially something in the field of neuroscience – the topic honestly being a little far removed from my interests. Despite this, found this book a joy to read (re-read), and it's actually made me more interested in neurology than I thought I could. Sagan makes the figurative tons of data in Eden extremely accessible and interesting, connecting each of his refined concepts to create a humble page turner. None of the information ever feels like it drags on at any point, as each chapter is short enough to get to the point without sacrificing any of the important details. It's really impressive how Sagan manages to create a book thats so jam-packed with information and still make it entertaining and accessible.One thing that is an obvious downside to this book is that some of the research and technological terms are outdated, and basically false at this point. This isn't to say that this book is all incorrect data, of course not, but having been released in 1977, there have definitely been some discoveries to prove some things in Eden wrong. This doesn't necessarily make Sagan's points less strong, however. His ideas and thoughts are still strong and poignant, even if some of the data is dated. Overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I think you'd be surprised at how much you'd enjoy it."
52,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13999805-greg-metcalf,5,"As I was reading this book again, since a first reading close to twenty years ago, a friend mentioned that if he was going to read a popular science book, he'd read a new one, not one from the seventies. That comment kind of got stuck in my head. It would certainly be interesting to read about how far sign language development with chimpanzees, for example, has come, which must have just gotten started when Sagan wrote about it here. But this book is Carl Sagan playing with possibilities. In a chapter on right and left hemisphere brain functioning, he suggests the possibility that the effect of marijuana might be to inhibit left brain reasoning giving the more intuitive right brain more influence over our thinking, which he compares to there always being stars above us but we need the dominant sun to set before they become visible. What a fascinating notion and how poetically stated. If anything Sagan writes about here has been disproven, he would be the first to say, Isn't this new evidence fascinating? We all wish Carl Sagan were alive and writing books about the cutting edge discoveries of today, but his creative thinking remains an inspiration. At one point, he was writing about how the written word manages to put the voice of someone else in your mind and wrote ""(Hello!)"" That alone made this well worth a second read. "

Expanding his knowledge from astrophysics to Biology, anthropology, evolutionary, history and upcoming scientific gadgets, Carl Sagan produces a wonderful literature on what may have been the case for the evolution of human intelligence. The book is a wonderful study of various aspects of human evolution and has given vivid and relevant examples for every point mentioned by Sagan. Not only Sagan is honest about the knowledge available at the time of writing the book, but predicts some wonderful future inventions for computer intelligence which we may see turning into reality today. His sharp predictions at the time of 1980s, which we may witness to becoming a reality, show that many of his speculations for the history of evolution may have many relevant points.The language is lucid and flawless, as is always in the case of Carl Sagan. He is not only one of the most significant science educator of 20 Century but is also a role model for many science enthusiasts. The voice that has ignited the minds of many scientists and engineers has proven through this book that people not from science background may become interested in Science, if science is presented in an entertaining and fun way!"

Not because it is dated, which it really is, but because the subtitle is utterly misleading. ""Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence"" do not actually occur in this book, which is far more concerned with the morphology of the human brain and the functions of its component parts; there is really nothing in this book about selective mechanisms or advantages, nothing about the huge metabolic costs of a 1400 cc brain, and little real discussion of the pressures driving the selection FOR increased encephalization. Nothing about evolution. Sorry, Carl ol' buddy, but this is a diatribe about brain function, quantitative measurements through vivisection experiments on all sorts of critters, and off-topic rambles about the ethics of abortion and extraterrestrial intelligence.

I also consider the book for its date written, and amazed Sagan could foresee so many things coming to fruition in technology (such as cloning and everyone having multiple computers). It must have been even more amazing 35 plus years ago to see how much information our genes contain. Tackles issues regarding human brain has developed over time, its components, the differences in the evolution of man, reptiles vs. mammals, sleeping in both, dreams, mental illness, the likelihood of aliens, etc. Very cool topics then and today, imagine they will be for millions and billions of years to come."

The evolution of the brain is the focus and Sagan talks a lot about the ""reptilian"" brain, the part that we had before we became human. Also the discussion of what really makes us human is so interesting. On the radio some modern researcher said that the brain is a record, a story of what has happened to that particular body. Anyways, this book is archaic compared to what they know now, so I am looking for a modern (post-modern?) read on the amazing human brain!"

I recommend this book if you are new to the topic, because if you have more experience in the field, this book may seem too basic, though it doesn't make it less great, I really enjoyed it a lot.

76,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,5,"Review“The Dragons of Eden” is a delightful exploration of intelligence – an examination of its evolution, its function, and its ethical implications. Carl Sagan explores a wide swath of topics: the informational content of both brains and genes; the evolution of the brain and its functional structure; animal intelligence; the evolutionary explanation for sleep and dreams; and the role of intelligence in determining the “sanctity of life.” Much of what is said is speculative, but Sagan is always crisply clear on distinguishing between speculation and science. His enthusiasm is contagious, and his prose is lucid. “Dragons of Eden” is the most accessible and enlightening books on intelligence I’ve ever read, and altogether a delightfully smart read. I’d recommend it in a heartbeat.SummaryNo Dualism HereSagan makes it clear from the get go that his “fundamental premise about the brain is that its workings - what we sometimes call the mind - are a consequence of its anatomy and its physiology, and nothing more.” Some argue for dualism by pointing to the fact that we have been unable to localize the ‘higher brain functions’. Sagan offers a nice response: “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.” This is a book about science, and not philosophy.On MemoryHow, and where, are memories ‘stored’ in the brain? Here’s an interesting study that sheds light on the question of ‘where’. Certain patient undergoing brain surgery reported visceral flashbacks of memory when certain parts of their brain underwent targeted electrical stimulation. Interestingly, when these portions of the brain were removed, the memories didn’t simply disappear. This indicates there’s a certain redundancy of memory storage in the brain, or at the very least that memories are distributed, and not simplistically localized.As far as the ‘how’ is concerned, there are – or rather were – two competing theories. The ‘dynamic’ hypothesis suggests our brain is similar to computer RAM, where information disappears the instant power is turned off. The alternative theory suggests our brain functions rather more like a hard disk, where information persists even in the absence of an electrical current. It turns out there is strong evidence that the latter is true. In one experiment, researchers taught hamsters to run a maze, and then froze them to a point where all electrical activity in the brain disappeared. The hamsters were then thawed, and it turned out they still remembered the maze. This indicates that brains store static traces of memory, instead of simply holding everything ‘dynamically.’The Triune BrainThe ‘triune brain’ model holds that our brain consists of three interconnected but evolutionarily discrete sections: The R-complex, the Limbic System, and the Neocortex.The R-complex, it seems, we share with our reptilian ancestors, and is responsible for much of our bodies’ unconscious regulation. Interestingly, it is also the part of our brain associated with ritualistic and hierarchical tendencies.Next, there’s the limbic system, which wraps around the R-complex, and enters the scene with the advent of mammals. The limbic system seems to be the source of altruism, emotion, and religious inclinations (those I’m a bit skeptical as to how that might be measured). Interestingly, it is here that many psychotic drugs are activated.Finally, we have the neocortex – that uniquely ‘human’ part of the brain (though to be fair, most mammals have a neocortex. The point is that in humans, it’s so much more developed that we can regard it as its own module). The neocortex is the seat of deliberation, of spatial perception, and interestingly, of bipedal posture - among other, vaguer functions. It seems there’s a striking separation of function in the neocortex – brain damaged patients can write, but not read; read letters, but not numbers, and so forth – despite the fact that we’d otherwise thing of these as very similar activities.Are Animals Intelligent?Yes, Sagan argues. He points out that there are chimps with working vocabularies of 100-200 words, and that some of these monkeys have gone so far as to invent their own words and phrases. Primate tribes also seem to develop and foster culture. Note that his is significant in that ‘culture’ is too fleeting a thing to encode in a genome. Culture must be transmitted extragenetically – in this case, from one brain to another.Sagan muses about the implications: “the cognitive abilities of chimpanzees force us, I think, to raise searching questions about the boundaries of the community of beings to which special ethical considerations are due.” I’m inclined to agree.Why Sleep?Our brains force us to sleep. Why? Conventional wisdom suggests that sleep has a restorative effect, but there is very little scientific evidence to support this view. Sleep is evolutionarily perplexing. It greatly increases an animal’s vulnerability, seemingly without any compensating benefit. It’s a lot easier for a predator to snatch a sleeping meal. Sagan turns this quandary on its head and suggests that the function of sleep is, actually, to decrease an animal’s vulnerability. It’s also a lot harder for a predator to find a sleeping meal. Sagan suggests that sleep evolved to immobilize the early mammals during the daylight hours. Presumably, mammals were able to obtain all necessary calories at night - a time when cold-blooded predatory dinosaurs were necessarily inactive. During the day, mammals were better off hidden, asleep and completely immobilized, than if they had been hidden awake – conscious, and instinctively skittish. Only after the extinction of dinosaurs, Sagan suggests, did mammals move to daytime ecological niches. It’s an interesting theory, though it’s (as the author readily admits) quite speculative.Why Dream?When it comes to dreams, Sagan again admits to speculation, and again his musings are fascinating. Here he suggests that “dreams are a spillover of unconscious processing of the days experience.” Sagan notes that dreams occur in the ‘subconscious’ regions of the brain - dreams have much more to do with the R-complex and the limbic system than they do with the neocortex. Note that reptiles, whose brain consists entirely of the R complex, do not dream. Another suggestion is that the dream state allows the R-complex – otherwise suppressed during the day in mammals – to roam (though I’m not sure why this would be either necessary or evolutionarily beneficial).Sagan concludes this section by wondering “if the waking state of the other mammals is very much like the dream state of humans… where we can recognize signs… but have an extremely limited repertoire of symbols… where we encounter vivid sensory and emotional images and active intuitive understanding, but very little rational analysis,” and where we experience “most of all, a very feeble sense of individuality or self.” A pretty crazy thought.Right Brain vs. Left BrainThere is a genuine difference between the two sides of our brain. Some crazy examples involve split brain patients, for whom sides of the brain can’t ‘share’ information. There are times these patients will see something they cannot convey in speech, but can in writing, and vice versa – altogether, pretty crazy stuff.And while the distinction between “left vs right brain thinking” is perhaps overemphasized in common discourse, Sagan confirms that to some extent, the right brain does indeed engage in intuitive thinking, whereas the left brain moreso performs critical thinking. He also notes that both ‘sides’ of the brain are valuable. The right brain extract patterns, real or imaginary; the left brain distinguishes between patterns and paranoia. The right brain provides creative insight; the left brain is distinguishes between genius and insanity. Indeed, the two sides have a sort of complementary survival value, and it makes no sense to make any normative claims about which is ‘better’ and which is ‘worse.’Ethical Issues: Death and AbortionsThis might be the most interesting and relevant part of the book. Firstly, Sagan speculates about a philosophical definition death, and relates the sanctity of human life to the presence of human intelligence. In particular, he suggest that a patient otherwise alive but exhibiting no signs of neocortical activity might be said to be dead. Under this interpretation, to be ‘brain dead’ means ‘to be dead as a human.’Sagan elaborates and examines the implication of this line of thinking by considering abortion. He readily admits that there is no question that legalized abortion would “avoid the tragedy and butchery of illegal and incompetent ‘back alley’ abortions,” as well as serve an important social need by slowing uncontrolled population growth. But then again “infanticide would solve both problems… yet by our laws and mores, is murder without question.” The question, then, is: what does it mean “to murder?”With respect to the other side of the abortion debate, Sagan points out that the phrase ‘right to life’ is a popular buzzword “designed to inflame rather than to illuminate.” We kill animals, destroy forests, and ruin ecosystems. Clearly, then, when we claim there’s a ‘right to life’, we really mean to say there’s a ‘right to human life’ – but even then, the wars we wage are starkly at odds with this presumed principle. Similarly, Sagan disregards the claim that ‘the potential to be human’ is sacred. After all, a single ejaculation contains enough sperm for hundreds of millions of human beings, and we’re almost at the point where we can clone a human from a single skin cell. Surely we shouldn’t outlaw masturbation and the shedding of skin cells?Sagan says “the key practical question is to determine when a fetus becomes human. This in turn rests on what we mean by human.” Again, here is Sagan’s proposal: the essential quality that makes us human is our intelligence. And if so, “the partial sanctity of human life can be identified with the development and functioning of the neocortex.” Along this line of reasoning, then, the cutoff for abortion lies somewhere near the end of the first trimester and the beginning of the second. I must admit I find this a compelling argument.Quotes“The main conclusion arrive at in this work, namely that man is descended from some lowly life form, will, I regret to think, be highly distasteful to many… For my own part, I would as soon be descended from [a] monkey… as from a savage who delights to torture his enemies, offers up bloody sacrifices, practices infanticide without remorse, treats his wives like slaves, knows no decency, and is haunted by the grossest superstitions.”“The receipt of a message from an advanced civilization will show that there are advanced civilizations, that there are methods of avoiding the self-destruction that seems to real a danger of our present technological adolescence.” "

79,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,4,"The human brain is an amazing, complex, and contradictory organ. It can think the lowest of thoughts one moment and dwell on the meaning of the universe in the next. In The Dragons of Eden, Carl Sagan lays out current theories of how our brains evolved, a bit about how they operate, and quite a bit about the ongoing fight between the different parts of the brain as they work out the “correct” way to deal with the world.The process of evolution has shown that a capable brain is an major asset in dealing with the world. How else could a weak, hairless, slow, mammal have become the dominate life form on the planet Earth?Evolution builds new onto old. Nothing is every thrown away, it is just repurposed, built upon, or pushed to the side. Because of this, our brains contain a lot of old drives and impulses that do not fit well into a modern society. Fight or flight does not work well on the subway at rush hour. Therefore we have developed ways of overcoming our innate behavior and controlling and/or overriding it with newer and better ideas we have thought up. My example is that saying, “excuse me, you are stepping on my toe” works far better than either fleeing off of the subway car or pushing the offender out of the door.This book was published in 1977 and there has been substantial progress in brain research since then. While all of the experiments and theories Sagan presents are fascinating, many have been updated or replaced in the past forty-three years. Despite that quite a bit of the information and ideas Sagan presents are still valid today. Most importantly, his presentation of how our brains evolved and what it means to be a “thinking” human are as valid today as when he wrote them last century.There are three things I love best about Sagan’s writing. The first is that is it clear and easy to read. The second is that he loves science and his enthusiasm comes across in everything he writes. The third is, like any good scientist he knows that his ideas are theories, not facts, and that they may change in the future. Thus this book has the subtitle, Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence.If you have never read a book about human intelligence, this is a great one to start with. Sagan gives an easy to read overview of the topic with as little jargon as possible. The book is dated so following it up with a more modern book is a good idea. Annaka Harris’ Conscious: A Brief Guide to the Fundamental Mystery of the Mind is one that I highly recommend. In the meantime, enjoy reading Sagan - which is always a delight."
80,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5649059-safaa,4,"A very interesting book I’d definitely recommend to anyone who is interested in the evolution of humans and especially brain and intelligence. I absolutely enjoyed reading it.Carl Sagan states that we are now living the last second of the last minute of the last month of the cosmic year: “All of recorded history occupies the last ten seconds of December 31. “The book starts with describing the anatomy of human brain and how it biologicallyevolved into the current brain, with focusing especially on the Neocortex. He compares the brain to body mass of the first humans with the current humans's and also with other mammals.Other topic mentioned is the evolutionary purpose of sleep and dreams and how they are different from other mammals. He explains some experiments on chimpanzees and their ability of learning Sign language.He also speaks about the connection between left and right hemispheres, how it works and what happens when there is a cut in Corpus callosum. Furthermore how that connection influences the tradition of tribes and cultures until now. For instance, majority of people prefer right over left and this surprisingly is an evolutionary leftover! The last two chapters particularly caught my eyes, because Sagan admires the intelligence of some computer games like Pong, Space war and hangman and predicts that machines will be intelligent and helpful for human. Interestingly these games are considered trivial according to AI capability nowadays. I really wish to see his reaction if he had got the chance to come back to life now. In the very last page he sums it up in this: “It is only in the last day of the Cosmic Calendar that substantial intellectual abilities have evolved on the planet Earth. The coordinated functioning of both cerebral hemispheres is the tool Nature has provided for our survival. We are unlikely to survive if we do not make full and creative use of our human intelligence.""We are a scientific civilization … and Knowledge is our destiny."" I tried here to talk about some points and definitely couldn’t catch all. It’s really hard to give a fair review to such a rich book, and it can be read more than once to absorb all its information and ideas."
81,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69348187-xavier,3,"Have you ever wondered how the brain works and how our intelligence evolved? If your brain has presented to you this question, then this might just be the book for you. Your brain wants to know about itself! Whoa.Firstly, this book was written in the 70's so its possible that some of the information contained here is out of date. Regardless of that fact however, Carl Sagan has that certain charm and special way of writing about subjects and makes it a joy to read. Although he does warn you that Chapter 2 gets super technical and jargon-heavy, the rest of the book is smooth sailing.Sagan writes about the triune brain model and how the brain has evolved into 3 layers; the R-Complex which is where our reptilian brain functions stem from (aggression and territorial behavior) and is the oldest part of the brain, the Limbic System (social emotions) and the Neocortex (sight, sound, knowledge absorption). He also speaks about the left and right hemispheres and how they interact with one another to absorb knowledge and to be able to come up with solutions and theories. There is information contained within these pages about our early ancestors like Australopithecus, Homo Erectus and Homo Habilis and show how the different sizes of the fossilized skulls show the progression of the size of the brain. Sleep and dreams are also talked about as well as how our distant cousins, the apes, can learn ASL and show some form on intelligence. It begs the question; If other mammals on this planet exhibit a form of intelligence, why don't we take better care of them and instead lock them up in zoos? The book was a bit hard to get into but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Sagan asks more questions than he gives answers so it turned out to be a great exercise for my brain (maybe that's what my brain wanted all along!) If you want to think critically and expand your horizons a bit, give this gem a shot!"
82,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,2,"I think that this book may have been interesting when he wrote it, but the vast majority of Sagan's ""speculations on the evolution of human intelligence"" have either been scientifically evaluated or are not really testable. Most of the interest of reading the book now is in the fun of seeing how people were thinking about things at the time the book was written. We've definitely come a long way! For instance, at the time the book was written, little was known about the function of sleep, how brains work, and the neuroscience behind many brain diseases. Sagan's speculations feel like a snapshot of a history of science class. Here was the time in history when Lashley's equipotentiality hypothesis of the brain was losing support, when Freudian psychoanalysis still had a strong presence in psychological thinking, when the triune brain model was strongly influencing how people thought about brains in the animal kingdom, and when scientists were starting to get giddy imagining how much easier computers were going to make everything.My favorite parts of the book were:1) Sagan is manically impressed with terrible computer programs that try to do clinical psychology. He proceeds to copy a script from one of these interactions between a ""patient"" and a computer to show how awesome the program is. It is not.2) Sagan relays a ""dad joke"" from one of Roger Sperry's parties. The idea that a stupid joke of mine at a colleagues party could some day go down in history tickles me to death.I would definitely NOT recommend this as a popular science book because a lot of the things he describes have lost support by subsequent experiments. It would be unwise to try to use the ""facts"" or models presented in this book to form your opinions about nature and society.I would recommend this book as reading in a History of Psychology class. It's quick, entertaining, and interesting from a historical perspective."
83,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80777016-mr-brightside,5,"Along with Jared Diamond’s The Third Chimpanzee, the Dragons of Eden has helped me understand our species. Carl Sagan is an excellent teacher and writer in that he conveys his ideas as simply as possible without academic arrogance or jargon. This book is truly accessible to nontechnical readers like myself. In a nutshell, the book talks about how our universe started, how life started and how homo sapiens came to be. It then talks about evolution, natural selection, language, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. This book was published in 1977 so it is curious to note how far human knowledge have improved specifically in the field of neuroscience and computing. As far as I know, there are no neuroscience theories shared by Sagan in this book that has been disproved by scientists today. Neuroscience today has added more evidence to what Sagan shares in this book like how the left/right hemisphere affect the opposite sides of the human body, how corpus callosum acts as a conduit for left/right hemisphere, how are reptilian brain affects the decisions of the neurocortex, and many more. It is also breathtaking how computing has exponentially progressed today. Sagan talks about games like Hangman, Pong, and Space Wars, how computer graphics has improved, how computers could be useful if bought by mass consumers. Today, we have phones that would let us play Call of Duty with excellent graphics, a far cry from Hangman. We can learn anything online via the internet. Personal computer are cheap that everyone can afford it. Computing has indeed come a long way since the time of this book’s writing. To conclude the book, Carl Sagan warns readers of pseudoscience like astrology that will derail the progress made by science. We need more physicists, mathematicians, chemists, that will help us understand the universe."
84,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4304479-iain,4,"Another remarkable book by the esteemed Carl Sagan. It is a book about human intelligence and how it emerged here on planet Earth, it is a story about us and how we came to be. Sagan uses the fields of anthropology, evolutionary biology, psychology, and computer science to give a perspective and highly interesting insight into why we can and do think. The book examines our past and our reluctance to change, Sagan writes, ""In general, human societies are not innovative. They are hierarchical and ritualistic. Suggestions for change are greeted with suspicion: they imply an unpleasant future variation in ritual and hierarchy: an exchange of one set of rituals for another, or perhaps for a less structured society with fewer rituals. And yet there are times when societies must change.” So change we must but where are we going and it is not without trepidation as, ""once intelligent beings achieve technology and the capacity for self-destruction of their species, the selective advantage of intelligence becomes more uncertain.” So we live in a world full of peril much of it of our own reckless doing but the future we must face, ""the price we pay for the anticipation of our future is anxiety about it.” That said, as your read this book you have the wise Carl Sagan as your guide who himself although has passed on into the cosmos his words live on. “And reading itself is an amazing activity: You glance at a thin, flat object made from a tree...and the voice of the author begins to speak inside your head. (Hello!)” A fine addition to the Sagan bibliography! "
85,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619806-veronica,4,"This is just a hard book for me to review. Carl Sagan is brilliant, and I was interested in this book because it falls under the umbrella of biological sciences and away from Carl Sagan's focal umbrella. Yes, I read the whole thing in his voice which made it that much more enjoyable. There were moments where you could see what we would probably consider now thinly veiled racism implicit in even what we would have considered the more enlightened areas of academia (psychology, anthropology, human biology, and neuroscience, etc). Ideologies and views that we know now are wrong and even though considered the anathema to racism was in reality just a condescending nod to the slightly less superior ""but still equal"" ""others"". I have to admit even though Sagan wrote it in the arena where these ideas were considered factual, that he didn't push back a little and question them. I understand I have the benefit of hindsight in this viewpoint, and again, he wasn't discussing topics he was an expert in, but dabbling in the playing field of others and having a good time feeding his intellectual curiosities in mostly their findings. It was great to read him playing like that. The book is so clearly written in the late '70s; it's fascinating to see where we are now in relation to the exciting new technology of Pong and Space War he discusses late in the book. Often we're far off his mark, but there were a few predictions he made that were right on the button (""We may be able to engineer genes before we are able to engineer brains"" as an example).Sagan can not fail for me."
86,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64956141-jason,3,"An interesting read on the evolution of the brain into a set of cooperating and competing regions: the R-complex, limbic system, and the left and right hemispheres of the neocortex. The basic idea is that the deeper into the brain you go, the more ancient the functions supported. For instance, at the low level of the R-complex, the ""reptilian brain"" supports ""dinosaur-ancient"" functions like aggression, territoriality, and establishing social hierarchy. This lower region seems to both cooperate and compete with the other regions in the sense that during the day, these reptilian functions are partially repressed by the neocortex, but during dreams, it seems that the some of neocortical functions are repressed in favor of the R-complex. This is coupled with the supposition that reptiles don't seem to dream or have REM sleep. Sagan speculates that life for many animals may be experientially similar to how we humans experience dreams. Overall fun, but as it is from 1977, much of the scientific research rehashes things I encountered in school, and has progressed since then. I can see how this book influenced other books I have read, such as Techgnosis by Erik Davis and The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzweil."
87,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37832424-obed-m-parlapiano,4,"This book is really great. I had read it when it came out back in the 1977 or in the 80s and 90s I would have been blown away and be made an acolyte of Carl Sagan. The book is that good. Sadly it was published in 1977, 40 (YES! 40!) years ago, proving some of Sagan's assumptions wrong and making the book miss a huge lot of more recent findings. This is by no means Sagan's own fault, the book feels really up to date regardless of its age, more importantly, it gives a sense of understanding to the human brain.The whole book is about the human brain and its evolution, if you're anything like me and you like science you might know a bit of neuroscience, however lately a lot of the ""we're not sure"" have been thrown around for every new finding. Sagan gives a feeling of ""we're quite sure it's this way"" or at least ""I think it's this way"", which is somewhat reassuring.Don't let the age of the book dissuade you off reading it though, it's a remarkably comprehensive guide to the findings and theories of the human brain's functionality and evolution, many of the theories proposed are still valid. Great book overall. "
88,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,3,"This book is fascinating more because of its author than its contents. In it, Carl Sagan talks about books as ways to hear long-dead people speak. Reading anything by The Sagan is always a treat.This book tries to be about the origin of human intelligence but it feels very, very dated today. If you want to learn about neurology and consciousness, read any book by Daniel Dennett. If you want to learn about evolutionary biology and the brain read anything by Richard Dawkins. This book tries really hard but, I'm sorry to say, fails to deliver on either of these topics.Sagan presents his own pet theories and speculative extrapolations from the preliminary science of his time. For example, he talks a lot about left vs. right brain in a way that is today understood as unscientific.There are a lot of biblical and mythological references in the book, which make it *sound* like a philosophy text, but it's rather thin on actual (sophisticated) philosophy.So I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to listen to the words of Carl Sagan. They're beautiful and poetic words. Personally, I found it difficult to enjoy for the lack of substantive science."

Educational and fun, beautifully written, it ranges over many topics to offer a wide scenic tour of what a mind is, how did the human mind get to its present state, and how its future evolution might be.Packed with data, it's not your average science book, in that Sagan proffers almost more questions than answers. The tagline is very appropriate indeed, for it's more about describing and then speculating and wondering about how things are than any actual explanation of any single theory. Popular science at its best.Accidentally, it also shows how fast science progresses. By the time this book was written, the most likely hypothesis for the extinction of dinosaurs (spoiler alert) was the radiation from a nearby supernova. Something so widely known today wasn't even hinted at just forty years ago! Impressive! (PS - disclaimer: don't you worry, the remaining 99.9% of the book has aged rather well!)"

It is, of course, an evolutionary argument, and one which Sagan applies to all the hominins (as much as he can, at least, for physical evidence is hardly exhaustive in some cases). The complex interaction of biology and environment has had a profound effect on our ability to think, and in consequence our bodies have developed some very strange characteristics. For instance, the left-hand/right-hand sides of the brain and how they process sensory information is delightfully weird, and the experiments and case studies which Sagan uses to help explain the science behind the history of the brain made the book clear and accessible."

His warning about intellectual carelessness being rampant in Western society is still true today, and perhaps more insidious than ever. Sagan ventures into many different fields in this book including evolutionary biology, neuroscience, cosmology, and computer science. I personally love these mixture of topics and he handles them masterfully. If you're willing to be patient with the fact that these sciences have advanced greatly since his time, there's still much to learn from The Dragons of Eden. His articulation of the fact that the written word has the amazing ability to implant the author's voice inside the viewers mind is just one of the many deep thoughts he shares in this book. It was a pleasure to have his voice come to life in my mind, even if only for a short time."
93,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11791850-sayer,4,"A very insightful read. Carl Sagan tries to talk about intelligence from different perspectives. He starts with the evolutionary point of view and ends with aliens. talking about everything that makes us human in between, he even interweaves literary references relevant to each chapter in the beginning.Some of the parts of the book that come to mind is when he mentioned that predators tend to dream a lot while prey tend to do the opposite, another point was the quote by Einstein ""the most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is so comprehensible"" which illustrates our large capacity for understanding complex concepts and simplifying them, maybe through analogy ON TO ANALOGY BOOKS"

(The -0.5 is for being “out of date” on computer technologies and neuroscience.)It’s hard to find nonfiction books that are decades old that I would consider a “classic” or must-read, but Carl Sagan manages to pull it off. Like any great scientist, Sagan demonstrates the balance between logic & creativity, which is exactly what evolution has provided us.As a human, it’s important to know our own history, recent and distant evolutionary past. The more I learn about evolution, the more I realize its intersectionality with politics, economics, sociology, psychology. And therefore, it must be learn by ALL humans regardless of belief. "

He is thrilled that our big brains are speeding up development otherwise done by painstakingly slow natural selection. Remembering us that creativity and problem-solving are our unique skills. I am writing this in 2018 (more than 50 years later) and there are dozen of books out there discussing the human brain. But Sagan is still very entertaining and original. For example, for him consciousness and intelligence are result of ""mere"" matter sufficiently complexly arranged (his own words). Therefore, there is nothing stopping us from building intelligent machines. Just our own intelligence!"

I would like to see this book with an updated appendix or footnotes where Sagan's theories have sinse been updated. From a cultural perspective, Sagan's views are very much products of his time. On a more scientific note, the sections on the interworkings of the brain are fascinating. My only worry is that they're dated.

Regardless of your background or depth of expertise at neurology, psychology, or cognitive science, Carl Sagan paves the way to an evolutionary and longitudinal understanding of the human brain that any intelligence seeking reader will come to appreciate.**This title was also the recipient of the 1978 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction"

When I first read Dragons of Eden in the late 70s I found the book compelling and brilliant. Certainly for the time it was and Carl Sagan was a master at getting common folk to warm to science. Through extensive research involving not only current (for 1977) day science but also mythology and Biblical studies, Dr. Sagan presented his ideas on the evolution of the human brain. Some of his thoughts have held up well, others not so much. The book is still worth a second read because it is always time well spent when you spend it with Carl Sagan. "
101,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26540144-maurice-frank,3,"Sagan was notoriously too optimistic and wishfully positive about human nature. Yet very harsh things sometimes get short mentions of slipped into his writing, including his view of life outside the technological age. Thus, in Dragons, he mentions whaling in a quick couple of words without dwelling on it. At more length, in his discussion of left handedness he tells us that without toilet paper, everyone who lived in all of preindustrial history and even ""in many parts of the world today"" have had to wipe their bums with their hands. Seriously, would you choose to do that or to leave it unwiped like animals have to? I know which is more hygienic, and it ain't carting a foul left hand around with you !!!It was an example of him taking a too stuck up harsh attitude in order to make us love space age society by a rather insulting message of ""how lucky you are, yah boo think of your ancestors"". Sagan was actually wrong about this, your common sense will be relieved to know. Archaeology has found many traces of leaves or mosses being used. If you visit Doune castle in Scotland, the audio by Terry Jones will tell you all about the use of old strips of cloth or clumps of plants as toilet paper. So, unless living in a desert with neither cloth nor plants available to them, nobody has ever needed to do it with their hands.While that is my second biggest gripe with Dragons, worse is how he dismisses mind-brain dualism in one half-sentence of the introduction without giving support or ""shred of evidence"" for his arbitrary claim that there is no evidence for it so he may as well ignore it. Reading on beyond there he has your acceptance that you are reading the thoughts of a rigidly doctrinaire brain materialist who believed mind exists only as a function of matter, you are not reading any case or argument to help you decide whether you agree with that. (Which I don't.) Still, obviously you can read around that. Despite it, he still gives a good detailed picture, at a layman accessible level, of the brain's layered structure, of its evolution of higher powers in new layers on top of the old ones, and of how the reptile inner brain might be a generator of instincts to aggressive and irrationally destructive behaviours. What he, and his favourite psychologist Maclean who he got the idea from, call the ""R-complex"", he turns into a simple target for the blame for everything bad in human nature. All our problems making society work he says come from the evolutionary war of reptile versus mammal being built into our own brains: our reptile brains are the dragons within us, the flaw built in from the beginning of our evolution, hence the Dragons of Eden. He hoped progress will win the day by us deciding we like the primate brain's intelligent behaviours best and by following that path we will make our primate brains (cerebral cortices) dominate over our reptile brains.You have to agree which brain's set of behaviours are better, if you are an intelligent science reader, but it stretches hope too far to imagine that every yobbo will make this choice. Curiously as he was such a hardened atheist and the book ends with a sweeping attack on the paranormal made with scant support, this whole idea about the primate brain is a path to future betterment offered rather like a religious path, a self-contemplating self-reforming one like Buddhism.Very poetic and dreamy writing when he contemplates human brain evolution, that makes for a feel good read. ""Tales of Dim Eden"" - wow what an incredible chapter title. But the too many mentions of ""lesions"" all through the book have a feel bad effect, as he never tells us lesions are not as painful as they sound, and he seems too eager on the science to realise he is being yukky. He relies on these lesions, it just means a bit or brain being damaged or cut off from the rest, for concluding where various brain functions must be located. btw he is wrong where he says we can't use words or language in dreams. Obviously he found that in his own dreams, but it is not the case for my dreams nor for other folks I have spoken to. He was trying to theorise that dreams are the reptile brain's cosncious life. How then do they contain intelligent concepts that only the primate brain, which he says is switched off during sleep, should be able to understand?His description of the experiment of teaching deaf sign language to chimpanzees also seems quite selectively pulled to fit into his own point of view. He only gives the side that is sympathetic to the chimps, he obviously wants to feel good about his evolutionary cousins and all the brain similarities he can find. Yes it is a good thought provoker to contemplate that chimps should not be kept in effectively jail cells in scientific institutions. But he only describes how close to human the chimps in the language experiments were able to get during their manageable periods, obviously earlier in their lives, when their trainers could relate to them with some physical equality. No mention at all in Dragons of how strong fully-grown chimps get and the danger of violence. Chimps can do terrible injuries, and that has ruined attempts to have them living together with humans.You have to take the book as a push for his own unusual biological political theory about reptile and primate brains, which is a challenge to thought and has some insights but we may also decide to retain some doubts. Remember he always approved of scepticism."
102,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4228228-luis,5,Carl Sagan is a boss! This book is 40 years old and some of his predictions on the future discoveries of the human brain and technology were spot on. This is my first Carl Sagan book and I loved it. He has an ability to take very complicated scientific concepts and ideas and explain them in a non-scientific manner. In particular the past of the book when he takes the cosmic calendar and fits it into a human year to show when certain events occurred or when human milestones were reached is AMAZING!This is a must read. 
103,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73377037-ian-feigle,4,"Very good and informative book––as to be expected from all of Sagan's work. Although I thought he would dive into the mythology of reptiles in our cultures a little more than it did, I enjoyed how it presented neurology and the evolution of the human mind. From the slow accretion of the R-Complex to the Lymbic system to our modern-era Neocortex, we follow the growing mental capacity of Sapiens through the millions, if not billions, of years. Really fascinating information on the links and differences between the left and right hemispheres. "
104,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20553112-julian-munds,4,"This book is classic Sagan. Informed speculation. Sagan is a master of weaving science with the human experience and where this book excels is when he ties scientific discovery to human myth. However, like many works of science, it shows its age. His view of psychology, especially Mental illness, is a dated view. There's mulch else that is presented that has been surpassed. But that doesn't change worth of the work. Sagan's enterprising passion of humanity and life drips from the book. And its worth it for that alone. "
105,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29820367-sarah-modak,3,"Although I really enjoyed the book, I did feel it rambled in parts a little bit. Nevertheless other parts were thrilling, especially the experiments with chimpanzees, wild speculations about Eden, Adam & Eve, & the almost universal myth of a dragon-like creature. The ending paragraph was my favourite & I think sums up the philosophy of the book really well- '""We are a scientific civilisation,"" declared Jacob Bronowski. ""That means a civilisation in which knowledge & its integrity are crucial. Science is only a Latin word for knowledge...Knowledge is our destiny.""' "
106,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120434057-ab-initio,5,"Apart from Carl Sagan's scientific expertise, he never shies away from incorporating his philosophical 'musings' within his scholarly analysis. As opposed to various 'celebrity scientists' who focus primarily on popularity, Carl Sagan deploys his knowledge in astronomy so as to address deep-rooted questions surrounding the nature of being and purpose of human existence. His venture into uniting philosophy and science is a daunting albeit fascinating one and this book of his is definitely worth reading so as to delve into these acutely intricate notions."
107,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2198250-nikki,3,"This book was first published in the 1970's, so I fully expected that much of the information would be out-dated, and indeed it is. Especially the information about computer processing and DNA. That aside, there were a lot of interesting tidbits in this book. As someone who has read Dawkins--and other modern evolutionary biologists--I was stunned by Sagan's respectful references to Biblical texts. This is something that is NEVER seen in current books about evolution. It was refreshing."
108,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38700998-joe-xtarr,0,"I don't think it's fair to rate this book because it serves too well as a valuable snapshot of a very particular point in our scientific and philosophical development (whether right or wrong). The contents seem outdated or assumed today, but I was still completely captured by its framing of a context in which it was written. Definitely worth reading, if only to see how appropriate Sagan's thought experiments would become well after his own time."
109,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2972494-shashank,5,"The first time I came across the concept of three kinds of brain.. reptilian, mammalian (cortex) and neo-cortex- a concept that explains so much about what it means to be human.. seemingly rational beings built on foundations of irrational impulses. This a view of mind that I find most elegant and so far there is nothing I have read that contradicts the basic essence of this book. Carl Sagan- you gem! "
110,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29099518-john-jaksich,5,"A great read- Although I had partially read the book a few years ago, I picked it up two weeks ago and finished it yesterday. Carl Sagan, a master in scientific narrative, weaves a story that makes us want to venture with him to understand the origins of humanity. We are left to ponder how human intelligence got its start. However, Sagan offers many roads to travel with him on that quest to what may be called -- the Holy of Holies, the origins of life and consciousness. "
111,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92060403-lawrence-dutton,4,Probably one of my favorite books. I'm not well-versed on any kind of biological concepts but I think Sagan does an excellent job of conveying these topics to laymen like me. It's well-written and has bits of dry humor interspersed; I can really see his personality in this novel. I would highly recommend as food for thought when considering where we've come from as a species and what really makes us tick.
112,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6262367-abby,4,"Even though many suppositions or ""new"" findings in this book would now be considered obsolete, it is still instructive and enjoyable to read a work like this: a summary of everything we knew, in 1977, about how human intelligence came to exist. Sagan writes nimbly, and his examples are far-ranging and memorable. "
113,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61690414-safwan-hossain,4,"This is a fascinating read on the subject of the development of human intelligence and how our species evolved morals, etc. The book is a very good summary of information packaged for the layman but with deep and thought-provoking insights that could serve to stimulate the thinking of experts in the field. Sagan's style is very humorous and engaging."
114,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1056629-clare,3,"This book was published in 1977 so some of the topics touched upon are a bit outdated, especially the chapter about computers (Sagan mentions Pong, for example, as something innovative at the time). Most of the book deals with his conjectures on the evolution of the development of the human brain. It was fascinating to read about how the brain works in all its intricate details. "
115,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98590078-kristin,2,"More like 2.5.There was a lot of good information in the book, but a remarkable proportion of the text was the author’s speculation. In addition to a lot of the assumptions and speculations (some of which were interesting, some were just kind of wild), a lot of the info was old and has now either been disproven or become knowledge that I’ve already learned, sometimes in more depth."
116,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3113344-joe,3,Very interesting. Can’t say I’d recommend this to just anyone. I enjoyed parts of it but how much I retain or am able to apply to my life is anyone’s guess. I’m still not sure if there was a point other than at the end where he makes the case to continue our intellectual and scientific growth as a society. 
117,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106010728-jens,0,"Considering this book was published in 1977, it remains as an inspiration. There are two points we must be aware of, first is how the definition of intelligence derives into the modern way of brain optimisation; second is Sagan's notes on psychology and sociology, which many have been experiencing great change in their milieus, which is hardly useful for valid criticism."
118,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44279752-lauren,4,"Sagan explains how the human brain evolved over time, how each section interacts with the others, and other ideas of how the brain functions…and doesn’t function. An interesting read and worth the $2 I spent to read Carl Sagan’s description of Pong!"
119,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53578735-steve,4,"4.25* ....Despite being written over 40yrs ago I found much of the content as relatable today, as I assume it was then. It is also interesting and entertaining to judge Sagan's many hypotheses for our future, that we find ourselves currently residing in now."
120,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42779388-ryan-sturgis,4,"I really enjoyed this book. However, it is a science book written in the late 70's. Some (a lot) of the things he is speculating about have been solved or new theories have emerged. That being said, many of his predictions are eerily close to home... (my home is in the year 2017). "
121,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63821926-logan-scoles,4,This books explains the evolution of our brains and why we think the way we do. A few chapter were a bit dry and I started to lose interest a couple of times. This book still gets my recommendation due to the uniqueness and insightfulness of the content discussed.👍🏻
122,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61564803-edgar-antioquia,5,"The book's synthesis of science and myth to explain the evolution of human intelligence is as gripping as any thriller and reads like a fantasy novel, only it's real. Sagan showed that science can be poetic and elegant, and not boring in the least."
123,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75825541-annabel,4,"A concise look at the progress of the human mind over the millennia. Some aspects are pretty dated, but Carl Sagan's fun to read because I too am obsessed with aliens and will drop them into unrelated conversation."
124,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52463001-angela-lewis,5,"Although decades old, this investigation into the human brain is a revelation. Thoroughly fascinating for someone like me who knows little about the subject. Written for the common reader and leaving us with a taste for more."
125,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92505840-lucia-mendoza-castillo,5,"An excellent book as an overview on main science issues, specially those regarding to the raise of human condition.

126,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63720524-rachel-umansky,4,"Don’t get me wrong.... I love Carl Sagan. The beginning was slow and super factually stuffed, but I learned a lot about evolution and our place among the many other species in terms of neuroscience and behavioral science in general."
127,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101243859-tyler-thompson,5,A book filled with insights on the emergence of biology's most fascinating creation - the human mind.

128,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5754491-jeff,5,"While the science is a bit dated, Sagan had the ability to simplify rather complex Neuroscience into something we can all understand.

130,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541568-raymond,4,"I really liked this book. I didn’t find it dry at all.

Written in Sagan’s iconic style, a mix of the poetic and academic, the book displays a few novel approaches to understanding our world. In particular, Sagan introduces the “Cosmic Calendar,” which encapsulates all the time of the cosmos into a single calendar year. In this framing, humanity’s time on earth only appears in the last hour of the last day. It really puts into perspective our place in the broader universe. Sagan would visualize this thought device in his legendary television series, “Cosmos.” I was also struck by Sagan’s willingness to explore our relationship with potential life outside of Earth. It’s no surprise that Sagan won the Pulitzer Prize for this work, as it is a classic of science communication. It’s still an engaging and worthy read after nearly 45 years since its publication. "
200,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51092272-sezgin,3,"As a ""disciple"" of Carl Sagan, I found this book still inspiring but less intriguing compared to his other works. Carl Sagan's way of connecting science and mythology made me remember his thoughts on religion in Billions and Billions; and his approach to Garden of Eden was fun to read. Especially the last part of the book, where Sagan puts forward his thoughts on the future of AI and organic intelligence, was farsighted and promising - or maybe optimistic. Due to the complexity of the topic which includes various subjects such as psychology, physiology, anatomy, biology with several sub-branches in addition to mythologic references (mostly European), I just had to shallowly read some parts. In general, The Dragons of Eden is a good example for Carl Sagan's creative and provocative mind. The book presents a basic understanding on how brain works and what consciousness is while discussing on ethical issues of today and the future."

It starts off with Sagan's iconic Cosmic Calendar, which is helpful when we want to put our early development relative to the cosmic time into comprehensible perspectives. Next, he discussed the basic understandings of complexity of the genes and brains of human and beasts.""If chimpanzees have consciousness, if they are capable of abstractions, do they not have what until now has been described as “human rights”? How smart does a chimpanzee have to be before killing him constitutes murder? What further properties must he show before religious missionaries must consider him worthy of attempts at conversion?""[...] ""Chimpanzees can abstract. Like other mammals, they are capable of strong emotions. They have certainly committed no crimes. I do not claim to have the answer, but I think it is certainly worthwhile to raise the question: Why, exactly, all over the civilized world, in virtually every major city, are apes in prison?""Each question is sharp enough for us to rejudge our intelligence and humanity, to reconsider where the position of chimpanzee is in our ""Intelligence"" table rank, and what we should do about the cruelty which is being done by their cousins, us human.""The argument about the “potential” to be human seems to me particularly weak. Any human egg or sperm under appropriate circumstances has the potential to become a human being. Yet male masturbation and noctural emissions are generally considered natural acts and not cause for murder indictments. In a single ejaculation there are enough spermatozoa for the generation of hundreds of millions of human beings. In addition, it is possible that in the not-too-distant future we may be able to clone a whole human being from a single cell taken from essentially anywhere in the donor’s body. If so, any cell in my body has the potential to become a human being if properly preserved until the time of a practical cloning technology. Am I committing mass murder if I prick my finger and lose a drop of blood?""[...]""The key practical question is to determine when a fetus becomes human. This in turn rests on what we mean by human. Surely not having a human shape, because an artifact of organic materials that resembled a human being but was constructed for the purpose would certainly not be considered human. Likewise, an extraterrestrial intelligent being who did not resemble human beings but who had ethical, intellectual and artistic accomplishments exceeding our own should certainly fall within our prohibitions against murder. It is not what we look like that specifies our humanity, but what we are. The reason we prohibit the killing of human beings must be because of some quality human beings possess, a quality we especially prize, that few or no other organisms on Earth enjoy. It cannot be the ability to feel pain or deep emotions, because that surely extends to many of the animals we gratuitously slaughter.""The above Carl Sagan's arguments are so far the most reasonably scientific ones I've ever read concerning standpoint on abortion. Yes, our emotional attachment to anything that comes from our species is understandable, but we must take it to another level: intelligence, which we relate to so much.The remaining topics of the book related to extraterrestrial intelligence and artifical intelligence don't surprise me as much the ones I described above since I've already read his other masterpieces, fantastically debating these issues. On the other hand, I doubt if I should feel guilty for skimming through some of the religions myths about human creation and intelligence since I think it's not really important to my further understanding. I haven't expressed my ideas much on this book, but I'm sure the statements I've captured already convince you how informative and intriguing the book is."

As best I could tell, the science explained in the book is largely correct, and the more speculative science explained in the book remains speculative.Some fun parts:Notes from page 42/43: ""If each synapse responds by a single yes-or-no answer to an elementary question, as is true of the switching elements in electronic computers, the maximum number of yes/no answers or bits of information that the brain could contain is about 10^ x 10^3 = 10^13, or 10 trillion bits (or 100 trillion = 10^14 bits if we had used 10^4 synapse per neuron) ... This is an unimaginably large number ... It is because of this immense number of functionally different configurations of the human brain that no two humans ... can ever be really very much alike.""page 64: [The proclivities of our baser instincts exist, but are not in total control] ... ""There is no way, for example, in which the Bill of Rights of the U.S. constitution could have been recorded, much less conceived, by the R-Complex. It is precisely our plasticity, our long childhood, that prevents a slavish adherence to genetically pre-programmed behavior in humans more than any other species. page 131: [After explaining how some of the contemporary cousins to homo sapiens had larger brain cavities than homo sapiens (implicating that they could have been smarter, albeit equal in technology)] ... ""we may have been the agent for natural selection in suppressing the intellectual competition. I think we may have pushed back the frontiers of intelligence and language ability among the non-human primates until their intelligence became just indiscernible.

204,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18480555-anonymous-writer,3,"	The dragons of the Eden-Carl Sagan- I was expecting a book about mythology, but I discovered a study about evolutionary biology/psychology. There is obviously a link between those, but the mythological aspect is not emphasized well enough. The most interesting idea of the book is the one of the triune brain, a theory which claims that the brain has three parts: the R-complex-the primitive part, the limbic brain-where our emotions reside and the neocortex-the rational side. According to this theory, humans have evolved from using the most lower side to the most advanced part that operates intelligently. Another intriguing aspect of it is the fact that those parts of the brain are shared with animals, from the most primitive ones to the most developed ones. The R-complex is also called the reptilian brain because reptiles also have it, while the limbic brain is shared with the mammals. The R-complex the center of fear, survival and basic needs. Metaphorically, it could be said that those two complementary and opposite forces that reside in the human consciousness-love/lust and death/destruction/violence, Eros and Thantos, whom Freud claims that they the two instincts of the human psyche, are practically triggered by the reptilian brain, also known as the R-complex. It's the archaic consciousness that can be observed at those primitive civilizations or tribes : magical thinking, superstitions, fear of the unknown, tribal mentality, the need of survival. What should be noted here is that ancient civilizations worshiped serpents and this cult can be found all over the world. This could be an interesting metaphor of the existence of the lower level of consciousnesses. Let's not forget that violence(human sacrifices to the gods, for example) and sex(orgies) were highly regarded in those ancient cultures. The story of the Bible- the fall of man- could be taken as an allegory of the falling to the lowest level of consciousness. Adam and Eve could me personifications of the limbic brain and the neocortex(the gray matter), while the serpent is obviously the R-complex. The knowledge of good and evil is the black and white mentality of humans that attempt to divide everything in two, according to their limited perceptions. As a side note, I'd like to mention that mental illness such as psychosis could be triggered be an over-activation of the R-complex- which is somewhat plausible considering the fact that there are similarities between people from the tribes and those who are mentally ill. Apparently, the tribesmen could be considered schizotypal. Furthermore, could the apparition of those saviors considered gods be taken as a metaphor for evolving and dominating the lower level of consciousness. A classic example is Christianity, where the never-ending battle between the serpent- which symbolizes fear, and Christ- the symbol of love, the antithetical feeling, is obvious. To conclude, I'd like to point out another well-known theories that are analogical with the one of the triune brain. It's the Jungian idea of the thee levels of consciousness: the unconscious, the subconscious and the conscious- and the Freudian idea of the thee parts of the personality:id, ego and super-ego- which can be linked to the three parts of the brain."
205,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24085447-mark,4,"I think you should read this book yourself. Demon Haunted World was good, Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors was integral, and Pale Blue Dot was a good supplement. However, Dragons of Eden was always one of the other more important Carl Sagan books, if you didn't read DHW to round off your general science and physics/biology education. Forget about Broca's Brain or Comet. This one is important because it talks about your brain, and the overall intelligence of man. This is one of those books where he talks about being as smart as possible for the greater sake of humanity and our future. The main theme is, that as a human, we use all layers of the brain, including the ancient parts. There's our spinal cord which has some brain stem on it and allows basic survival functions, and the R-Complex, which is the reptile part of the brain. There's some evidence that says we still use the reptile part of the brain in our daily behavior, which might not be obvious, or a popular known fact. There's also the corpus callosum which is the left and right brain. Marijuana can temporarily change the brain, so that your perception is different than your baseline. Marijuana might activate your right brain or suppress the left brain more. The second part of the brain is the limbic system and the newest part that evolved is the neocortex. If you cut some parts of brain out certain functions or motor abilities are reduced or impossible to do. The limbic system is the second part of the brain, and is said to be involved in emotions. When you stimulate it, it induces marijuana or symptoms like LSD, not to mention borderline psychotic. Videogames help people understand the laws of physics. All games are modeled after reality. Games help people in situations they aren't necessarily preparing for. Play is the exposure to those activities in which it is practice for any situation in which it might actually happen. So computers and access to the web are important for the further development of the brain of the human being. Even though they aren't smarter, certain lizards have the third eye and use it to regulate body and environmental information to make sure it maintains temperature. There's some indication that humans can stimulate their brain to activate the pineal, or thirds eye, again. This might include some transient perceptual changes. But maybe the brain reactivates it, or allows it to see again, so you can see more reality with plausible quantum interference. I'm not saying the lizards can see or think like that, but maybe some combination of that with our brain allows some complex information to be received. Or maybe it makes the brain so it's harder to process reality, making it look more mysterious and unfamiliar, which could more easily lead to death in uncivilized societies. This is the origin of the communal shaman, where they garner protection from the villagers while in those states to glean information and bring it back. No one knows the purpose of that function of the brain. Probably the best or most important Carl Sagan book so far, though I haven't read all his works yet."

This must be a consequence of the recent and continuing increase in cranial volume."" p. 97'Might the brain growth exhibited by Neanderthal man have been in the parietal and occipital lobes, and the major brain growth of our ancestors in the frontal and temporal lobes? Is it possible that the Neanderthals developed quite a different mentality than ours, and that our superior linguistic and anticipatory skills enabled us to destroy utterly our Husky and intelligent cousins?"" p. 107“There is today in the West (but not in the East) a resurgent interest in vague, anecdotal and often demonstrably erroneous doctrines that, if true, would betoken at least a more interesting universe, but that, if false, imply an intellectual carelessness, an absence of tough-mindedness, and a diversion of energies not very promising for our survival. Such doctrines include astrology, the Bermuda Triangle ""mystery""; flying saucer accounts in general; the belief in ancient astronauts; the photography of ghosts; pyramidology; Scientology, auras and kirlian photography, the emotional lives and musical preferences of geraniums; psychic surgery; flat and hollow earths, modern prophecy; remote cutlery warping; astral projections, Velikovskian catastrophism; Atlantis and Mu; spiritualism; and the doctrine of the special creation, by God or gods, of mankind despite our deep relatedness, both in biochemistry and in brain physiology, with the other animals. It may be that there are kernels of truth in a few of these doctirnes, but their widespread acceptance betokens a lack of intellectual rigor, an absence of skepticism, a need to replace experiments with by desires.These are by and large, if I may use the phrase, limbic and right-hemisphere doctrines, dream protocols, natural– the word is certainly perfectly appropriate– and human responses to the complexity of the environment we inhabit. But they are also mythical and occult doctrines, devised in such a way that they are not subject to disproof and characteristically impervious to rational discussion. In contrast, the aperture to a bright future lies almost certainly though the full functioning of the neocortex - reason alloyed with intuition and with limbic and R-complex components, to be sure, but reason nonetheless: a courageous working through of the world as it really is.""

207,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2404888-daniel,3,"The eponymous dragons are our primeval adversaries, the reptilian kimonos that stalked the steaming jungles of ""dim Eden"" long long ago. They are our biological progenitors. In their cold, reptilian gaze, we discern something of our most primitive selves. Sagan imbues the word, in fact, with all sorts of eerie meanings. The ""reptilian"" portions of our brain and psyche bear the stamp of what Darwin might have called our lowly origin. We still retain the reptilian segment of our brain, as Sagan shows--though millions of years of evolution have significantly complicated and expanded the neural structures that reptiles left our proto-mammalian ancestors some 200 million years ago. The word (""reptilian"") comes to acquire a special, if peculiarly derisive, meaning. It refers to those primitive characteristics we like to think have been thoroughly extirpated, but that lurk, unbudgingly, in the innermost cortex of our brains. Sagan re-examines the foundational myths of Western culture (the Garden of Eden, in particular) through the lens of an evolutionary biologist and anthropologist, wondering why these stories continue to speak so powerfully to us. In Eve's encounter with the serpent, he finds something deeply stirring; man's strangely reflexive encounter with his distant relative from the past.The best moments are those when Sagan delivers on what his title promises: ""speculations on the evolution of human intelligence."" Many of these speculations were impressively canny & inspired. Many are gorgeously written:""Human intelligence is fundamentally indebted to the millions of years our ancestors spent aloft in the trees. And after we returned on the savannas and abandoned the trees, did we long for those great graceful leaps and ecstatic movements of weightlessness in the shafts of sunlight on the forest roof? Is the startle reflex of human infants today to prevent falling from the trees? Are our nighttime dreams of flying and our daytime passion for flight ... nostalgic reminiscences of those days gone by in the branches in the high forest?""I enjoyed Sagan's startling speculations, yet I wish Dragons would've spent more time fleshing them out. There's too much general information and not enough of the ""speculations on human intelligence"" that he promised in his title. By the final two books, he seems to have abandoned this project altogether, launching into a full-scale argument on the political implications of human intelligence; the last chapter speculates about extra-terrestrial intelligence. There's lots of interesting stuff here, but the ideas are somewhat scattered, and the lack of focus inhibited Sagan from developing a more coherent and compelling thesis."
208,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734089-shanmuganathan,5,"I recently read ""The Dragons of Eden - Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence"" by Carl Sagan. I was inspired by his more famous book on the universe called ""Cosmos"" which I had read last year. I would personally rate this book more interesting and insightful than Cosmos. Cosmos was expected to be a great book as it was a product of one of the great space scientists ever. Human intelligence and neuroscience had never been Sagan's area of research, which he himself acknowledges in the book. In terms of explaining the basic human brain function, Sagan has topped even most of the present day neuroscience researchers.Though I have a masters degree through research in neuroscience (Hippocampus, in particular), I never had the access to the amount of in-depth knowledge which Sagan provides in this book. I have developed a new sense of love for neuroscience and human intelligence after reading this book. Sagan, being a strong supporter of evolution, provides ample evidences to support his causes. The beauty about Sagan's writing is that he accepts as mere speculations those ideas which he himself is not confident. This is indeed the true character of some of the top notch researchers, whose percentage is sadly dwindling over the years.I was amazed how Sagan uses the mapping of the entire evolution of universe to a single calendar year and explains evolution. Sagan provides credit to top researchers wherever it is due, which makes the book even more credible. I liked the sections of interaction of right and left brain hemispheres through carpus callosum. I could relate such ideas with the popular neuroscience texts I read over the past 6 years. Sagan even talks about the brains of other species and how the human intelligence is more to do with the evolution of a larger cortex region. Sagan also provides an analysis of what happens when one dreams and digresses at many places without getting the reader bored.This book is a real treasure for those who are interested in understanding the evolution of human intelligence through the words of the best popular science writer. I have already ordered for reading his another masterpiece, ""The Demon Haunted World"", which exposes pseudo and fake science. Sagan condemns such fake irrational ideas proclaimed as science towards the end in ""The Dragons of Eden"". I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in gaining knowledge of basic neuroscience, cognition, and evolution. I can guarantee that it will be an once in a lifetime experience of tracking own existence at present. This book is a must read for people of any age who can understand basic English. "
209,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34672471-rena-sherwood,5,"If you don’t read any other book by the late great Carl Sagan, read “The Dragons of Eden: Speculations of the Evolution of Human Intelligence” (Ballantine Books; 1977.) Although first published in 1977 most of the information is still up to date. It’s still the most readable and enjoyable book of “pop science” on the market. It probably was the biggest reason why Carl Sagan got the go-ahead for the award-winning “Cosmos” television series of 1980.The genesis of this book was from a lecture Sagan presented the very first Jacob Bronowski Memorial Lecture in 1975 held at the University of Toronto. Bronowski, like Sagan, also had a popular science-based television series called “The Ascent of Man” which aired on the BBC in 1973. Sagan, already a published author, got the nod to expand the lecture and this book was the result. What Makes This Book Special?Although lauded for his work in NASA and in making science cool, Sagan’s greatest gift was his ability to teach. Sagan was able to take a wide variety of sciences and synthesize them together to make an understandable narrative. This book touches on computer programming, art, biology, cosmology, anthropology, mythology and psychology. From all of these various sources comes one answer to the question, “How did we get here?”The book isn’t just large blocks of text but is broken up by charts, black and white photos and illustrations. Each chapter begins with a pertinent quote or two from such sources of wisdom as Aristotle, William Shakespeare, John Milton, Sigmund Freud and Lewis Carroll. It gives the book a nice continuity, as if the questions Sagan touches on in the book have been the same questions pondered all of our species’ existence.Who Won’t Like It?“The Dragons of Eden” will upset those who believe in God, Creationism and dragons. Sagan goes on to prove that none of those three ever existed except in our own imaginations. Those readers whose minds are already firmly made up about God, Creationism or dragons will probably not be swayed by Sagan’s logical and humorous approach.The title of the book is taken from a quote from the book of Job in the Bible: “I am a brother to dragons and a companion to owls.” Using a Bible quote may be seen as offensive by some religious people."
210,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4184187-nick,4,"I had not thought I'd be giving this book a 4 *s before reading it, aiming as it did to speculate on the evolution of the human intelligence - in 1977 ... Many things have been discovered since, many new theories have been proved and the overall technologies made new angles available to us. Science in the field had developped - and I thought the book will be a bore.Yet here I am, even more inclined to ignore the above (true, true facts, all of them, mind you) and give it 5 *s, now that I finished it.Well, what can I say? It is a brilliant book, that - I believe - can stand the challenge of time even in this field. I did appreciate some of the information the book provides, yet the most generous effect on me came from the author's personal insights, his opinions - which he advances carefully yet bold. Most of these resonate nicely with my own thoughts, and - although no novelty - help me better phrase my own ideas.The reptilian R-complex and the Limbic system, the new Neocortex with its Frontal lobe (STAND, MAN, STAND!!!) and the team work of the two hemispheres (the rational, logical left and the innovative, pattern seeking artsy right) - these things we could have found in a manual. But Sagan's own reflections on population control and his assessment of the present day's ""state of affairs"", his appeal to use our Neocortex (i.e. the reason) and his thirst (his hope) that the existence of other intelligent civilizations could demonstrate that it is possible for societies to live and prosper with advanced technology (the mathematical ""existence theorem"") - these insights are of most value.His open mind towards computers comes coupled with an invitation to continue to let our innovative brain work (i.e. the story of the Chinese translation machine ""out of sight, out of mind"" ==> ""Invisible idiot"" ... he he).His clear identification of our aggressivity as coming from the reptilian R-complex, his appraisal ""As a consequence of social and technological changes of the last few centuries, the World is not working well"" and many other examples in the book speak about a honest person, a professional who tries his best to present a balanced, candid picture."

Given that it was written in 1977, some of the science is likely dated (I don't know enough about it to say), but a lot of Sagan's commentary is based on studies that had been conducted at the time, many very recently as of its writing. While our understanding of the brain and of conditions affecting it have almost certainly gotten better in the intervening years, that commentary is still interesting to read, and I imagine that some if not most of the science still holds up today. Where the book really shows its age is in a section about where human intelligence will take us, where he discusses what at the time was modern computer science and even early electronic games. Obviously, we have the benefit of knowing where those things went, but it's still interesting to read his speculations and enthusiasm about them. On the other hand, there are other things discussed in this section that are still relevant today, such as decisions about when to use science and when not to and how society decides what things are objectionable, even delving into the difficult discussion of what stage of development a human is a human in relation to the topic of abortion, an argument which still carries on to this day. There are certainly more recent books to read if you're looking for information about brain science, but this one is still an interesting read if you want to hear about Sagan's perspective and opinions on the topic. This book was somewhat of an experiment for him and he admits as much, given that his primary expertise is astrophysics, but I think it succeeds in provoking thought nonetheless even today."
212,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38396339-bastard-travel,5,"A list of my interests are as follows: Carl Sagan, Dragons, Eden, Evolution, Human Intelligence. This seemed to have it all.After some entry-level neuroanatomy, we got right into the evolution, primatology, religious metaphor, even dinosaurs. Dinosaurs! How'd you work that in? I don't know. I don't care. Awesome.The casting out of Eden was analogized by the sudden expansion in the Homo braincase, which makes us the only animals who have painful births, as God promised we would after we snapped up that good knowledge apple. There's a poetry to the bigger cranium/Tree of Knowledge punishment mirror that the Bible writers couldn't possibly have been aware of. The dragon aspect was our primeval enemy, the gott-damnt reptiles. When they were dinosaurs we were creepy little voles, and they roamed in the day eating each other and us when they could find us. We crawled out at night and ate their eggs. Nowadays, all we have in terms of giant reptiles are komodo dragons, who are dying out. So we basically won. I also liked the bit about how the universal primate fears no matter how far up or down the evolutionary chain we go are heights, snakes, and darkness. Genetically transmitted terrors. Reptiles are such bastards that they got into the top three, next to falling out of trees (which is a big deal considering for much of our phylogenetic history, we lived in trees) and darkness, where murder lives. A good chunk of this book seemed like common knowledge, especially with how enamored I am of evolutionary theory, but there were little tidbits and confirmations that I feel more comfortable having received from Carl Sagan himself. He's also a fantastic writer, clear and concise without being pedantic, and not above throwing in the occasional dick joke. My kinda dude. If you can't work a dick joke in, what you're talking about isn't real science.R.I.P, High Prince of Wry Science. I'm sure you're screaming up at us right now. But, you know. Approvingly."
213,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8497896-mimansa-bairathi,3,"Carl Sagan is one of the most accomplished writers of his time and i picked up the book with a lot of expectations. This is a book about the evolution of human brain which takes us on a journey of our development from our ancestors. The book dresses various issues namely the development of our brain from those of worms, fishes, reptile, mammals to eventually its present state. Taking this hypothesis forward it goes on to explain the inherent R-complex (reptilian complex) and the triune brain that resides in the depths of our brain. These and the un-human behaviour arising due to them is what is referred to as the ""chained dragons in the dungeons of our mind"". The relation between these aspects and our basic aversion to reptiles, the dreams of falling through empty space are all speculated upon in a lucidly simple yet scientific manner. A whole host of other issues such as the typical functions of the left and right halves of the brain, the ""future"" development of artificial intelligence, the sleep patterns and their evolution over time, extraterrestrial life forms etc are discussed for the curious reader. Though ahead of its time, I found it difficult to appreciate this work fully coming as it did straight after a thorough reading of Norman Doidge's ""The Brain that Changes Itself"". As it happens quite a few of Sagan's hypothesis have been eschewed over time including ""localisation"" in the brain and the forms that alien life may or may not take. Also, at times the mumbo jumbo becomes a bit too much and the train of thought is lost from one chapter to another. A good book but certainly not a great one (not by modern standards atleast) , but still worth a read due to the range of topics it covers."
214,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21023536-m,3,"With The Dragons of Eden, Carl Sagan ventures off his usual themes by writing a book about cognitive science and how it relates to human evolution. This made me a bit uneasy because I have limited knowledge about neuroscience and cognition which means I have to take everything Sagan says at face value. I don't mind doing that because Sagan is a genius, but usually, I prefer to be knowledgeable about the subjects I read. At times, the arguments were technical and slowed down my reading, but other times they were enlightening and enjoyable. There were many times throughout the book where I would pause and go ""wow, amazing"", or something to that effect. In fact, this book is jam packed with interesting facts and even more interesting speculations about early humans and the future of the brain. This alone makes the book a worthy read. However, it goes downhill towards the later chapters. Since it was written in 1977, the computer chapter was dated (i.e. Pong was cutting edge), but I still got the idea Sagan was trying to convey even if it wasn't a fun chapter to read. Also, it was written with the theme of the Garden of Eden and Sagan ties in a few metaphors and anecdotes to his arguments relating to the Genesis myth. I didn't find these particularly interesting but it didn't detract too much from the reading. Finally, the illustrations in the book were of good quality but there were too many footnotes to compete with image captions. The combination of image captions, footnotes, and technical jargon created a distracting reading experience. Overall, a good book."
215,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7231894-chris-branch,4,"Sagan acknowledges at the end that ""To write a book on subject so far from one's primary training is at best incautious."" and it's true that a book subtitled ""Speculations on the Future of Human Intelligence"" might be unexpected coming from an astronomer. But Sagan was knowledgeable about science in general, which made him more qualified than most to engage in this discussion of how the mind has developed and how it works. These speculations were written in '77, so there's certainly been further work on many of the areas mentioned. Some ideas, such as ""This surely means there is a part of the brain which remembers sounds and images, but not thoughts."" (p. 80) seem likely to be true in some sense, and others, such as ""We may be able to engineer genes before we are able to engineer brains."" (p. 213) have proven to be absolutely correct.Sagan gets surprisingly (to me at least) philosophical for someone with a reputation as a hard scientist. After telling the story of rocketry pioneer Robert Goddard's inspiration for developing space vehicles, he asks ""Can it be an accident that this vision of voyages to the planets ... was glimpsed in the limbs of a tree?"" (p. 81) Well, yes, actually!There are some other points where his insights go a bit far - for example, the speculations on the origin of the correspondence between left/right and bad/good I think make some unwarranted leaps of etymology.But overall this is an informative and entertaining book by a master of scientific thinking and communication. Well worth picking up, even almost 40 years after it was written."
216,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26913484-zachary-littrell,4,"The original lecture, which Carl Sagan then elaborated into Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence, must have been wild. Despite biology lying a few meters out of Sagan's typical lane, he applies his keen analysis, rigor, and dry wit admirably to a big problem: what on earth is human intelligence? Sagan constructs detailed pictures of partitions of the brain, the interplay of language and intelligence, and some amusingly outdated descriptions of computers and the future of computing's role in our lives (and I'll hand it to Sagan -- his prediction of computing's future ubiquity proved correct).However, there is no getting around that nagging word in the title of the book, 'speculations.' Sagan's prose is so charmingly didactic, you walk away from his book feeling energized and educated. So it's disappointing to read a beloved educator propose a question and give the written version of a shrug as an answer; too many parts felt like My Dinner with Andre masquerading as science. But Sagan doesn't hide the speculative nature of the work, and I think it is a testament to Sagan's rational mind that many conjectures the book makes have largely survived over the decades, or at least aren't complete bunkum. So I would not say that anything in this book is paradigm shattering; a good deal of its insights, such as its centerpiece hypothesis of a triune brain, are old hat by now. But as a starting point for investigating the brain and its fascinating interactions with our evolution as a species, it does its job well. At worse, you get to go on a journey that Sagan was very clearly enthusiastic about."
217,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1079443-andrea,4,"There is something so marvelous about following the trajectory of how we humans have come to understand ourselves, and this has become another milestone in understanding its own subject in an even higher meta-narrative than that self-acknowledged in the book. Eminently readable and thought-provoking, even though I know scientific inquiry and theory have moved much further since 1977, and that much of this is outdated. Outdated as it is, much of this contains things I had never thought about, and I'm looking forward to following up on in terms of how much further we have advanced -- but from what I do know, the dominant theories of evolution and the chapters on paleontology and primatology are not immensely changed. I imagine the biggest revisions of what is written here would come from studies of the functioning of the brain, of which I know almost nothing. The coolest thing I think? That this was written when there were 200,000 digital computers in existence; that it seriously discusses the educational possibilities of pong; the distance we have come with computers, and how many dreams of the 70s were fulfilled and how many still lie in the future. Perhaps the most exciting are all of the things that have come to pass that could never have been imagined 40 years ago. It's like evolution in action. Now we are talking about how computers and the use of social media seem themselves to be rewiring the brain -- something you would have predicted from reading this. To me there can be no greater proof of lasting value."
218,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2138840-lolo-s,3,"Carl Sagan is goddamn smart, and boyishly optimistic about humanity ability to harness the power of our own intelligence for good. He makes compelling, if outdated, arguments supporting his theories. It helps that I've watched and re-watched so many old episodes of Cosmos that I can imagine Sagan's voice reading me this book.It's hard to summarize this book, because Sagan jumps around a bit. Generally, his aim is to use current science to elucidate the evolutionary underpinnings of human intelligence and to speculate about how human intelligence will interact with technology and alien lifeforms in the future. What I most enjoyed was his clear joy and optimism about current technology. Here he is describing the latest video game:A perfectly elastic ball bouncing between two surfaces. Each player is given a dial that permits him to intercept the ball with a movable ""racket""... The game is very interesting. There is a clear learning experience involved which depends exclusively on Newton's second for linear motion.Yup, Carl Sagan is describing Pong like it's a powerful learning tool, and he's being genuine. I think that sums up the book for me. Sagan is so smart that he can distill complicated ideas into their scientific fundamentals. The rest of us mortals see a screen with a ball flying back and forth; he sees Newton's second law. We see the world filled with people, and problems, and quotidian life; he sees the interaction of neural circuits, brain hemispheres, and the evolution of behavior patterns over millennia. "
219,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116317-kevin-orrman-rossiter,5,"For me, University was a time of intellectual awakening. In the first two years this was not so much from lectures and interminable pracs that I attended. Rather it was from the realisation of how much art and science and technology I had never come across before. In first year university we were required to study a non-science subject; I enrolled in Psychology. In amongst developing our paper plane skills, lectures on Skinner, perception, personality, emotion, were lectures on human consciousness and intelligence - subjects that I continue to find fascinating. Spurred on by these lectures I bought and read a profound, influential, new release by Carl Sagan: The Dragons of Eden.It is hard to convey how influential this book was for me. I still to this day have not read a science book so fascinatingly and simply written on such an easily misconstrued subject as the evolution of human intelligence. It was only when writing this review that I became aware that The Dragons of Eden was awarded the 1978 Pulitzer prize. Forty years on and ‘Evolution’, like ‘climate change’ have become the bête noire subjects of the conservative right of western democratic politics. As for ‘intelligence’, the self-help book-shelves have become replete with trite nonsense on how to define, measure, and improve your and your team’s ‘intelligence’. I recommend a small dose of Sagan-sense to them all.Read the complete review here: http://dragonlaughing.tumblr.com/post... "
220,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38361130-sam-bray,4,"I haven't come across any scientific writer as engaging as Carl Sagan. In a subject usually considered too banal and objective for the average person to be interested in, Carl has a knack for explaining complex ideas and concepts in a simple, easy-to-read prose. I thank him entirely for sparking my interest in science and setting me on an improved path of scepticism and critical thinking. Where was the Carl Sagan references in high school science classes? This was the third book of his I've read, after Pale Blue Dot and The Demon Haunted World. I would say this one was the most subjective of them all. He states at the beginning of the book that a lot of the ideas have little evidence or support among the vast majority of the scientific community (not in those exact words), yet I found his hypothesis' compelling and plausible in almost every case. One of these ideas proposed the notion that throughout history, humans have systematically eradicated all other primates that showed signs of intelligence, i.e Neanderthals and Hominids. This has become more prominent today with the forced inclosure of chimps around the world. I'm not going to do the book much justice if I try and rattle off all of the things that Carl explained so eloquently throughout, but he's such and amazing writer I just feel the need to spread the word! Essential reading in my eyes, Carl will surgically pick your brain apart and leave you with a better understanding of your inner workings. A lot of concepts can be hard to grasp, but the ones that aren't make it all worth while. "
221,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10035303-jenni,3,"One of the lesser points Sagan introduces is the analytical check our ""left"" brain must impose on our ""right"" brain's more intuitive connections. Ironically I would argue that Sagan's hesitance to check himself was this book's biggest failure. Often he excitedly drew out connections, usually preceded by a phrase such as ""I wonder,"" that do not stand his left-brained test of reason. With that said, I found the book worth the read. Sagan draws up a quick tour of human evolutionary lineage with a focus on our neocortical developments. He also always had a ready comparison to primates in order to morefully showcase what makes us ""human"". As always, the line is thinner and more vague than many more orthodox religions would like to believe. One major takeaway was the human ability, through the development of the neocortex, to have built-in ""intelligence"", I.e. analytical thinking, as compared to ""instinct"". Whereas instinctual information is programmed into tightly packed DNA (and is therefore limited in nature) and survives solely off adaptive selection, intelligence (or extragenetic info) resides in a larger brain capacity.. it is the ability to think on the fly and respond successfully to innumerable changing environments and situations. Sagan introduces many other varying ideas and usually does a good job supporting them scientifically. All in all, if you ignore anything he says about aliens or computers, it's a good read."
222,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26926631-saurav-sharan,5,"A delight to anybody who has a working neocortex. Carl has this gift to wind up theories and arguments to an extent where you seem to loose sight of the pretext on which the plot was built and suddenly he unravels the knot letting the beads of the joy fall to the feet of endless speculation and science. The books opens up by rating the human species on account of their intelligence and letting us know that we have come far but it was a ride very close to an abyss. Most of the fellow travelers had the ammunition to make it but only we persisted, we won. We should not let this journey from the savannas of Africa to being the dominant species on the planet, end up into nothingness. The book spectacularly dissects the human brain, human dreams, our humane possible interaction with chimps and a shows us a future with possibilities only limited by the limitlessness of our intelligence. I personally liked the arguments put up on the reasoning of human dreams-their meanings, their past, their purpose. Carl never believed in foretelling the future but incidentally he himself predicted the rise of computation to an amazing degree of accuracy. Accounting for the fact that in 1977, computers were limited to labs with loaded grants and high walled corporations, he accurately described the roles of computers in each human's life. I was thrilled to read this part as it gives me scale to measure the soothsaying capability of my hero.The book is strongly recommended to everyone. "
223,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4559248-felix-dance,4,"This book had been sitting on my bookshelf back at home, beckoning to me, for many decades. After listening to about three different podcasts going on about how great Carl Sagan in (yes, he is a Dude) and then finding this book (along with The Odyssey) at that Mumbai bookshop I could not resist. Also read during my long sea voyage I intersperced the chapters of this book with the audio book of Dawkins' Greatest Show On Earth (which I'd read and reviewed in paper form earlier). Since it came out in 1977 I basically discounted everything written in it as 'out-of-date', but it still came up with some interesting ideas. Basically the premise of the book is how our neo-cortex, the 'human' part of our brains, competes with the R-cortex, the reptillian part evolved hundreds of millions of years ago. There are some excellent anecodotes and factoids here but I found the book lacked a real focus or narrative - although maybe that's a result of my comparison of it with Dawkins' books. I'm a big fan of Sagan's ideas and it's written very well and was pretty enjoyable so I certainly can't critisise it too much - maybe my expectations were just set too high. I swapped this book, along with The Odyssey, with White Tiger and a book on Seneca left on the cargo ship by two disembarking cycle tourists."
224,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3793435-marko-santos,3,"This is the firs book I read from Carl Sagan, he certainly had a beautiful mind. I expected to read about hominids and how they started to use tools, and working in groups to gather food or hunt, instead Sagan spills his thoughts and knowledge about the human brain, things like the processing of language in the brain, the use of hemispheres, the development of abilities in the brain, even primates using sign language, and brain deceases. He then talks about machine intelligence (computers), and the possibility of evolved intelligent beings from distant galaxies.I'm always compelled when I read books from decades ago about scientific development, including discoveries, knowledge and technology. I read about a scientific breakthrough in a popular newspaper only to find out someone has been doing research or has proposed such possibilities decades ago, and to think that clever minds like Sagan have already pondered on these ideas a long time before.Sagan's tone is very friendly, it is a pleasure to find friendliness in science, but just as he was in his television shows he really enjoys wondering and traveling within his mind in the greatness of science, and he invites you to come along with him.PS. There a few amusing reference about marihuana, referring to the experiences of a user as an ""informant""."
225,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4473238-samara,5,"Reading Dragons of Eden is like having a conversation with the most intelligent person you've met as your friend meticulously explains how a vast array of sciences and art add up to his theory on life on earth, human intelligence, and the search for extraterrestrial life. I enjoyed every moment of it. Of course I learned a lot - did you know, for example, that by comparing the anatomy of our brains to, say, the brains of a lizard, we can surmise what a lizard thinks about? Did you also know that falling and snakes are the only two innate fears in a moneky, regardless of whether the monkey has ever been exposed to the dangers of either? But the best part was the logic of it all. Sagan has an ability to pull from his vast repository of knowledge and to ponder theories and possibilities as casually as someone might theorize over a drink. Except he's Carl Sagan and far more likely to be correct.Dragons of Eden was written in 1977, so many of his theories have since been expanded. I found his chapter theorizing that the next stage in human intelligence would involve symbiosis with the cimputer especially adorable. The final chapter, explaining how and why we would be able to communicate with extraterrestrials, should we find them, was absolutely brilliant and still poignant today.I recommend this book to anyone with a curious mind."
226,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5199524-anna,5,"""Dragons of Eden"" is of course way outdated (1977) and more speculative than scientific, but it is a very charming, amusing and thought-inspiring book which I've thoroughly enjoyed reading. Framed within the Big History of the Universe converted to 1 year to illustrate the relative time scales, it presents a bunch of fascinating subjects very well:- brain anatomy, the mind's conflicting operative systems, and the evolution of intelligence- prehistory with mammals and ""dragons"" (dinosaurs)- dreams and why we sleep- prehistoric suppression and (probably) eradication of other humanoids by humans, and the ethics of modern human society's continued imprisonment and exploitation of apes for scientific research- potential bases of mental illnesses- anthropocentrism (which Sagan is very much guilty of himself btw)- speculations about the future of humanity linked to space exploration and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (of course... as usual). - there is also a comically outdated chapter about computersI don't necessarily agree with Sagan's opinions or conclusions, and I don't expect the science to be entirely (or even mostly) correct, but Sagan has a knack for explaining complex subjects so that they are both easily comprehensible and fascinating, and help shed light on the complex evolutionary plot of Life and humanity. A lovely read."
227,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15032624-nataliya-piletska,4,"An insightful, thought-provoking book on the themes of evolution and intelligence. Honestly, I often felt the Eden metaphor was pushing it: sure, the connection between the pains of childbirth punishment and our increased brain size, as well as toiling the fields and our move from hunter/gatherer to farmer are clever and you get the feeling that you're uncovering a mystery as you read it, but the snake's connection to the dinosaurs, and metaphors of other religions - that felt more like reading an exercise in grasping at straws. I didn't realise as I was reading this how long ago it had been written. It was only when I got to the last chapter concerning Sagan's musings on the future of technology and computer sciences, and read his amused response at this newfangled games 'Pong' and 'Hangman' that can now be played on the computer, that I realised how old these musings were. It was interesting how accurate Sagan's predictions of the miniturisation of computers were, but there is still a long way to go, I'm sure, before the more shocking of his predictions come into maturation (which I'm quite convinced they will). The most commendable aspect of this book is perhaps its readability. Some of the theories he explains are very complicated, but instead of skimming over them, he wrote both eloquently and coherently, and that's a skill I think more scientists should practise."
228,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35079421-kevin-noto,3,"A little outdated, but a nice read. I have found Sagan to be truly one of the most insightful authors, and this book is no exception. Is less relevant and hits less heavy than his other works (Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors, Demon-Haunted World, Cosmos). Unfortunately many of the main ideas espoused have fallen out of scientific favor--mainly the triune brain and warring hemispheres theories. Sagan the populizer is caught oversimplifying the complex structure of the brain; perhaps to appeal to a more general audience, or perhaps because it is not his area of expertise. The section on computer interface was especially dull, considering how much scientific progress was achieved in the past couple of decades.I took special interest in the idea that as predatory mammals dream, they allow their ""R-complex"" to take control, in an environment where it can do no harm. This means that reptiles perception of reality could be very similar to our dream state (i.e. reptiles are literally ""livin' the dream""). The idea posited of Eden as an extended metaphor for human evolution is also very intriguing.The takeaway message ""knowledge is our destiny"" seems tacked on. The book is worth reading, but it doesn't build as well as Sagan's other works. "
229,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5786985-timothy-davis,5,"I had certainly heard of Carl Sagan, but only in terms of cosmology. I had no idea that he wrote extensively on the field of evolutionary biology-stimulated by his wife, the biologist Ann Druyan. My field is not science, so The Dragon's of Eden was my first encounter with the idea of the tripartite brain. The idea does not originate with Sagan, as he himself points out, but this slender volume makes the idea quite assessable for the lay person and, more importantly, it creatively explores the idea's possible implications. Although I read this book years ago, I have thought of it several times a week since then, as I speculate upon some of the biological causes of human behavior. Newer models of the brain have already proved some of the basic ideas in this book as a bit oversimplified, but if you are looking for an introduction to speculating about how the brain's evolution may shape human behaviors, this is great place to start. I found the book a ""mind blower""-and I always pick it up used when I see it to give to friends. Prepare to have your perception of perception itself turned upside down. "
230,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12269600-gary-patella,4,"It was interesting to read a book by Carl Sagan that deals with the brain and intelligence. I enjoyed it, but sometimes had difficulty picturing the processes of the left and right hemispheres of the brain. In other writings dealing with the brain (articles, text books) I see things like ""The language component of our brain resides in the left hemisphere for most of us."" Then there is a bit of acknowledgement given to the rare few (like me) whose language component resides in the other hemisphere. This book gives no acknowledgement to those with reversed hemispheres. Of course, this is not a major flaw, but I still see it as a bit of a flaw.When reading about the various parts of the brain and their functions, it is normal to imagine such things taking place in oneself. I had to make a very conscious effort while reading to note that I must picture the left hemisphere when the right is mentioned and vice versa. In summary, it is a good read and very interesting. The challenge I faced will not apply to many people. Nevertheless, it would've been nice if he acknowledged that some of us exist with reversed hemispheres."
231,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13184361-dodecahedron,5,"This was certainly not what I expected. Carl Sagan is primarily known for his television series Cosmos and his work in astronomy. So when I discovered that he wrote a book about the evolution of human intelligence I was intrigued. The fact I found a three dollar paperback copy at a used book store sealed the deal. Carl Sagan definitely managed to wow me again. The technical chapters about the construct and storage capacity of the brain was really fascinating. Also the last two chapters which speculate on the future of human intelligence is truly mind boggling. The book was published in the 70's and many of his predictions about the roles that digital computers would play in our lives have already come true. He is also unabashedly excited about the educational potential of computing resources, something that scarcely crosses my mind today but will from now on. The tail end of last sentence of the book, a quote from Jacob Bronowski, really hit it home for me. ""...knowledge is our destiny.""I've been trying not to give Carl Sagan 5 stars but I just can't do it. This book is too good and you should read it. "
232,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6034659-sam-catanzaro,5,"This book was written in 1977, so much of what Sagan writes about may be dated. This, however, does not matter. Despite any inaccuracies, this book is informative, but this is not what makes it a remarkable, Pulitzer prize winning work. Sagan is more than a really smart person. Along with clearly explaining complex things about the human brain, Sagan gives his own speculations and theories. Whether he is commenting on the future of human civilization or the relationship dreams and dragons, Sagan presents his theories in a manner that is hard to argue against. Because so much of the book is empirically based, Sagan gives himself a basis to make his claims. On top of this, Sagan himself admits that much of what he is saying is purely speculation, and should not be taken at face value. This in turn gives him a sense of modesty that is easy relate to. Throughout the book, Sagan references great thinkers like Plato and Aristotle, showing the utmost respect for them. I think years from now, Sagan may be regarded just as highly as Plato and Aristotle. He is a brilliant individual who presents ideas that are thought provoking and plausible. "
233,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28709674-nitya-kumar,5,"I cannot praise this book enough for its level of quality scientific information. Carl Sagan has not only put a remarkable effort into writing a book that is not within the realm of his own subject, but also delivers the information in such an effortlessly smooth writing style, that is not easy when dealing with dry scientific data. To top it, he has sprinkled the content with delightful tongue-in-cheek humor. The book presents forth, using the available evidence in several related fields like evolutionary biology, genetics & zoology amongst others, a powerful and intelligent theory on the evolution of the human brain and intelligence. Carl Sagan talks about the ""Triune Structure"" of the brain which took form because of subsequent accrual of various parts of the brain along the lines of evolution of till humans appeared. The discussion on specific functions of the components of Triune brain is is quite an eye opening experience. A richly informative piece that gives you new perspective on the social rituals & practices and will make you view them in a new light! A must read for everyone!"
234,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14456998-toby,5,"I was a fan of Sagan's before reading Dragons of Eden -- but somehow had not picked up one of his books. I knew him through his series Cosmos, which captured in my late teenage self the bulk of the wonder I felt about science, a feeling that has persisted into my career in medicine.That voice of Sagan's program, the sense of wonder, comes through perfectly in this title. I did not find much to expand my understanding of the subject here -- but this has, more or less, been my field of study all my adult life. The predominant explanations of the late 70s, when this was written, are in some cases no longer predominant. However, I was surprised at the prescience of some of Dr. Sagan's conjectures. While his fascination with Moore's ""law"" is kind of quaint (especially his amazement at a processor with a few thousand transistors), his extrapolation of brain-machine-interface work was just about dead on. In fact, one of his examples, of a closed-loop control of epileptic seizures, has only recently been brought to market, some 35 years later. That's pretty remarkable.Having dipped in, I certainly plan the read the rest of his major works in the near future."
235,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6323079-ivana,4,"What I really like about this book is that it is so easily understandable. Sagan is a talented teacher; he has a talent for transmitting knowledge... The way the book was written is simple, but the matters addressed are not. Evolution, the evolution of brain, intelligence...this is something I always found interesting. I don't have some great background knowledge about it, yet there was not anything that I have not understood in the book. (or so I felt)What I liked most was the question of intelligence in animals. That for me is one of the most fascinating themes. I something feel people invent definitions just to exclude animals from things we call ""human"". Who can claim animals don't have language when chimps are capable of using sing language? Nevertheless, in every linguistic book you'll find: “Language is a solely human accomplishment...."" I don't think it is and I don't like how humans think they are masters of the world. In fact it is possible that some other creature (monkeys, dolphins for example) will evolve and we will disappear."
236,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5916614-leland,0,"Difficult to rate, because the science described has moved on so rapidly since 1977, the publication date. I read it in order to feel re-acquainted with Sagan's friendly tone in his effort to popularize science ( live a few blocks from the old KCET studios from the ""Cosmos"" era). In that regard, it is very ingenious and concise. And frankly, the underlying scientific concepts still need popularizing. Appreciation of genetic science, paleontology, and even psychiatry is now extremely low - ""pop culture"" has eclipsed science and introspection for too many of the decades since the '70s - so Sagan's hopeful tone evokes nostalgia now. He aspired to be a polymath as well as a popularizer, so at the time of publication, I remember that he was knocked down for straying away from astronomy. But he asked good questions here, and not all of his answers are outdated. He responds to Julian Jaynes, in a fashion. He warns against pseudo-science, which has only proliferated and put national policy at risk, since. Glad to have picked it up!"
237,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39104897-alexis,5,"Dragons of Eden is a nonfiction book that takes the reader from the beginnings of man all the way up to modern days. He expresses his theories about evolution in a way that can be easily comprehended with some focus. Sagan discusses reasons for human behavior and how these behavior might have been beneficial to earlier man during the prehistoric ages. For example, our fear of heights. In Sagan’s opinion, humans are inherently afraid of heights because early humans swung from tree to tree like apes. The easiest way to die (at this time) was by falling to the jungle floor. Sagan also goes into detail about parallels between the Bible and human evolution. This part was most intriguing to me, as a Catholic, and I gained new insight into evolutionary concepts. Overall, the book was quite effective in establishing Sagan’s ideas. He used lots of concrete evidence and understandable language. I think that anyone with a basic understanding and interest in science or anthropology would enjoy this book."
238,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7620837-frank,4,"Read this Sagan study of evolution back in the 80sFrom Wikipedia:Sagan discusses the search for a quantitative means of measuring intelligence. He argues that the brain to body mass ratio is an extremely good correlative indicator for intelligence, with humans having the highest ratio and dolphins the second highest, though he views the trend as breaking down at smaller scales, with some small animals (ants in particular) placing disproportionately high on the list. Other topics mentioned include the evolution of the brain (with emphasis on the function of the neocortex in humans), the evolutionary purpose of sleep and dreams, demonstration of sign language abilities by chimps and the purpose of mankind's innate fears and myths. The title ""The Dragons of Eden"" is borrowed from the notion that man's early struggle for survival in the face of predators, and in particular a fear of reptiles, may have led to cultural beliefs and myths about dragons.The Dragons of Eden won a Pulitzer Prize. In 2002, John Skoyles and Dorion Sagan published a followup entitled Up from Dragons."
239,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/624827-sam-nordli,3,"Extraordinarily well written, this book covers the extent of history according to modern science, with an emphasis on the principles of evolution and the progression of man-like species. The subtitle betrays that a lot of the work is speculative, but this is not to say that it is far-fetched. Sagan's ideas are always based upon factual data and are admirable if only for the fact that they are honest and informed attempts. For example, Sagan talks about how animals such as monkeys have specific calls to warn each other of specific threats, and offers up the suggestion that the hissing of reptiles is perhaps the reason behind 'shh' as the universal sound for 'quiet' among humans because it is a remnant instinctual rememberance of warnings against our early competitors. Obviously this is not a fact, but it is interesting and promotes thought. The entire book is amusing and stimulates independent thought outside of the general subject matter. Highly recommended."
240,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1561354-adam,3,"Obviously, being a scientific text from thirty-three years ago, it's not a surprise that some of the business in this book is outdated. The last chapter, which is ostensibly about the future evolution of the human brain, could very well be called ""Grandpa is afraid of abortions and the computers"". That being said, I really appreciate the straight forward and engaging way in which Sagan writes about such difficult material. His use of language is friendly and readable, his examples often personal, clever, and easy to connect to.Despite the earlier mention of Sagan's unease about technology, he's extremely open to animal equality, careful to make the distinctions that one species' intelligence or suffering can't be a measure of another's. Which only serves to make the ""Hey! Pong! Neat!"" moments that much funnier. The ""calendar"" and ""timeline"" of human mental evolution in the opening section of the book were partcularly interesting and easy to understand."

If a fifteen-year-old can plow through it and understand the major part, so can you.To quote what I wrote about it for my library's summer reading program:""The book discusses the evolution of the human brain and connects that evolution to physiology, myth, animal potential, dreams and computer. Further, it declares science as the path to improving life.""The connections drawn to myth are reminiscent of this article in the Endicott Studio archives. Scientific explanations for myth are as a rule awesome.Also, the book is funny:""a human being has about a hundred times more bits of information in his brain than a rabbit does. I do not know that it means very much to say that a human being is a hundred times smarter than a rabbit, but I am not certain that it is a ridiculous contention. (It does not, of course, follow that a hundred rabbits are as smart as one human being.)"" - p. 48"
242,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,3,"I really miss Carl Sagan. More than anyone else, he ignited and cultivated my enduring interest in science. This book won the Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction back in 1977, the year I graduated from high school. I had not even heard of Carl Sagan at that time. It wasn't until his Cosmos series came out on PBS in the early 80's that he became a force in my life. So, now, 36 years after it was published I finally read this important book which is simply Dr. Sagan's educated speculations about the evolutionary history and future of the human mind. Most of what he writes about is very interesting and revealing about human nature. Much, however, is very dated. I kind of got a kick out of his descriptions of several amazing state of the art (for 1977) computer programs -- one of them being the video game Pong!A very thoughtful and thought-provoking book, but I wish I had read it when it had first been published."

This book was an excellent read, although the theory of recapitulation has been discredited. Carl Sagan’s books, including “Cosmos”, drove me towards the scientific method and a rejection of rationalism or mysticism. I was an agnostic from 1982 to 1989 as a result. Another good book is Sagan’s The Demon Haunted World. It was his last book before he died and I think he was trying to find a bridge between empiricism and mysticism. One of the most moving of his work for me is when he described going into the NY Public Library and marking the number of books he could read if he read one a week for the rest of his life. It was a pitiful small amount compared to the rest of the library and since I read that, I committed to only reading the best of literature. I began reading classics and text books exclusively. No more Sci-Fi or Lowie L’Amour books."

We learned a lot about neuroscience since 1977, but still moved in the same direction, so the book is still correct about many things at large, although details are often important.3. Contrary to Geoffrey Miller, who tells that evolutionary psychology was extremely controversial at the moment (just two years after the Sociobiology release—which, by the way, is not mentioned at all), here’s a Pulitzer winner that has a lot about how the human mind was defined by its evolution (although, admittedly, without many crucial details).4. A good book to learn something about the history of the area. If you want to learn about evolutionary psychology itself, you’d be better off starting elsewhere."
245,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5818273-alex,4,"The second to last chapter on machine intelligence is a little dated (it was written in 1977), however the preceding 7 chapters offer interesting insights into the nature of biological intelligence, our contingent evolutionary history, and a few intriguing speculations on the deep past. A couple of these speculations (such as the notion that our legends of goblins, trolls, giants, and gnomes might be genetic memories of our ancestors battling Australopithecus) border on the ridiculous. Sagan was fond of the reefer; perhaps this line was inspired under its influence. It's easy to tell from the prose that this book was written before Cosmos or Pale Blue Dot. Feels a little more casual and loose with 'out there' ideas that he is in later works Despite these misgivings, it was a short and enjoyable read."
246,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5892389-peterh,3,"Like any science book written almost 30 years ago, a great deal of the information in The Dragons of Eden is outdated. This holds especially true for The Dragons of Eden, as it largely concerns itself with neuroscience. Neuroscience has seen explosive growth and revision in the last 15 years.However, if you keep that in mind, I think that this can still be a very enjoyable read. Sagan writes in a very engaging way. His scientific imagination, his curiosity, his earnest hypothesizing and his ability to weave together information from almost every sphere of the humanities and sciences is incredible. This book is also illuminating for anyone interested in the history of science. It serves as a well developed ""snapshot"" of thinking in the 1970s.Sagan fans and dilettantes are sure to enjoy this book, but don't expect it to bring you up to date in the field."

Its almost as if you are given the unimaginable opportunity to sit down and listen to this incredible mind just shoot out theories, ideas, beliefs, and the straight up truth of how we came to be. Starting at a time when mankind was maybe just a twinkle of an idea of a star, Sagan goes over the ongoing debate of how we cam to be. Spreading to early man to almost present day( for the book anyway) Sagan creates a timeline in your head that leaves nothing to chance, and everything happens for a reason."

Oh, I concur vehemently. Throughout my life's curiosity about all the things science, I have heard great things about this physicist/humanitarian. Never have I stumbled upon his work till this gem of a book and boy what I have stumbled upon is so pure and breathtaking. Sagan presents and dissects idea with such clarity and interesting way you fall in love with science/nature and cosmos the way you never felt before. He is such a great teacher and student of sciences, the what-ifs he puts forth are truly out of the box and enlightens one. Throughout reading this tour de force my mind was creating what-ifs of its own. While reading the book I felt immense pleasure and pride to have belonged to a species that gave rise to such an ingenious spirit that is CARL SAGAN."

The book goes from reptilian and aviary brains to mammalian, non-human primate, then human brains, showing which parts are shared and which are exclusive to humans. A good introduction to the various parts and corresponding functions of the brain. Particularly interesting were the stories of chimpanzees conversing with humans via computer terminals and the effects of certain brain injuries. Less interesting was the wild speculation on the author's part on why primates have an innate fear of snakes, why humans eat eggs for breakfast, and the unfulfilled hope of artificial intelligence."

However, as a fun old-kitschy-psych-book it was quite entertaining, whenever Sagan says ""I sometimes wonder.."" you know something funny or ridiculous is coming next. Some of the research talked about in the book is still relevant and I found the parts concerning chimps using sign language to be fascinating. Turns out if you teach a chimp the sign for ""dirty"" he will start using it as an insult, as in ""you dirty monkey"". "

If you're not into science you probably would have ignore reading this book, but it really does not matter because this book was orgasmic; blissful in just a short course of reading, informative and promising, beautiful and eventually very surprising. Every trajectory of detail will pull your brains and exhibit your R-complex like it did million years ago. Yes, it is so depressing to think Sagan is not with us here anymore, but at least he is happy now and in solitude with his billions and billions of stars and lovely planets. A favorite."

As the full title attests, the topic is the evolutionary development of the human brain. As is to be expected, the technological references in the book are hopelessly dated, and I can safely assume that the scientific information is dated as well. I would have been very interested in a new edition with updated information, but unfortunately, Sagan died in 1996. Perhaps I will find a newer book on the topic of human intelligence."

The ideas are definitely not out of date. The book is well put together and thought-provoking. Sagan is a skeptic in the philosophical sense: someone who relies on evidence and reasoning rather than revelation and faith, but he does not show an antagonistic attitude toward anyone. The book is a comfortable read, well cushioned with appropriate stories that support his reasoning and conclusions. Large bibliography and a glossary."

As the subtitle says the book has plenty of speculation--some on the money, some not so much (this was written in 1977 after all)--but one always knows where Carl is doing it and that he wouldn't mind tossing out a hypothesis that is not borne out by evidence. These days I always wonder how J.R.R. Tolkien or C.S. Lewis, who frequently criticized science for being ""un-mythic,"" would take Sagan."

The beginning seemed rather tedious and I wasn't sure I could get through the book but as I adapted it became intensely interesting. Several times I found myself sitting back and breathlessly saying wow as I contemplated something I had just read.

However, this book is outdated, which is only most noticeable in the last 15-20% of the book when he discusses technology. My one concern is that the particular science that I'm not familiar with (neuroanatomy), I'm not sure how reliable it is due to the date that this book was published. Otherwise, there is still material that can be learned from this book that is highly interesting and thought-provoking. It does not take long to read nor is it hard, and still entertaining nonethless."

I am more on the Gould camp (that human intelligence appeared out of chance and if you reset the cosmic clock we might not be here and our definition of intelligence might never exist) in regards to the evolution of human intelligence but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

Thoroughly enjoyed reading the different case-studies/experiments he discusses in the book. Well in most of the book he can't assert anything with certainty but based on the observations made, he does hypothesize a few things about the brain. Towards the end of the book, the reader can themselves start coming up with their own hypothesis (which was the real fun part I feel). It's a small book, so I wouldn't think much before picking up this book. Go ahead and read it if you want to understand some aspects of the brain and if you enjoy reading about the human anatomy in general. "

Sagan always impresses me with the vitality of his mind, but, unfortunately, that is about as far as this book impressed me. The subtitle is ""speculations on the evolution of human intelligence."" An accurate assessment - the book has the feel of a rumination, or collection of random musings on a topic that he stretches quite widely (e.g., he includes an extensive discussion of abortion). It lacks a coherent message, other than that the neocortex is a big deal. OK, thanks. Also, since it was written in the late 1970s, it is dated both in sociological feel as well as the state of science. Not terrible, but not wonderful like I have come to expect."

Great book 10/10 would read again.He's able to communicate complex and otherwise monotonous information in a way that draws you in, like a story. His ability to link the development of human intelligence to the evolution of complex life really helped me make meaningful connections to things I already understood.He also goes into the left and right hemispheres, and individual regions, of the brain. Through this, and the comparison to other animals brains, he allows us a window into his understanding of the basic mechanics of human intelligence and consciousness."

I also found the speculations in this book to be intriguing. You could also learn a thing or two about how the human brain works in general.Another recommended nonfiction book from me to general readers.

Though, after some independent research, I've learned that the triune theory of the human brain, which features heavily in the book, has since been superseded by newer models, that doesn't diminish the relevance of some of the questions Sagan raises - the development of the fetal brain in relation to the abortion debate, for example, or the association of some of our more barbaric behavior to older evolutionary instincts.

Like all of his books, it is biased and he is not shy about interjecting his own thoughts and opinions along with research and science based information. But coming from someone as brilliant as he is, I certainly didn't mind his take and input. I did chuckle at his marveling at the new computer game, ""Pong."" See? Dated. "

While being a great teacher explaining the reader some biological, psychological and evolutionary aspects of it and sharing his ideas/theories (tested or to be tested) with us, he also does what a responsible scientist would do: make an attempt to explain our bad habits and actions with this evolution and emphasize them for the readers so maybe the world will be a better place...

When stretched to the limits of the imagination, science becomes a thing of mystical wonder every bit as curious and exciting as the ancient myths about the behavior of the gods or the existence of dragons, and yet it all remains so intrinsically human.

What he does, then, is explaining it through science: the beginning of the universe (astronomy), our evolution (biology), what our brain can tell about ourselves (anatomy)... he also even mentions some aspects regarding physics (in the ""artificial intelligence"" section). In other words: if you are seeking a book that will not only help you understand yourself, but leave you with a plethora of knowledge due to Sagan's creativity and examples mentioned, this book is waiting for you :)"

This book was written in the 70's so it was very interesting to see where science, computers, and technology was at back than. Regardless of the era it was written in, I learned a lot for the book. It a perspective changer more than anything else, aside from maybe a tribute to the miraculousness of the human/mammalian brian. It's certainly a stand out among other Sagan book's largely due to subject matter. So read it if you can. It be proud of the brain that allows you to do so. "

I don't think the previous owner liked those pages, but on close expection the missing pages don't look like they were ripped out, it is seamless between those two places ... it is doubly shame because it's a first edition hardcover print. :( Outside that the book is great and I'd really love to read a modern equivalent. If anyone knows of one please direct me. "
273,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9897115-aisllan,5,"Another great read from the master Carl Sagan. It was a very enlightening book, going through the evolution, the brain with a little bit of psychology in the middle (which was a pleasant surprise) and the end with his thoughts about the future. Carl Sagan is known for explaining complicated things in an easy manner and this book is no exception, it flowed easily even with the specific terms he applied. I guess it helped the fact that I've got some background knowledge on the subject, even though I would recommend this book to anyone that's curious about life."
274,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33937574-jose-salgado-wiggin,5,"Wonderful book to understand the biological basis of the human mind. It approaches such understanding from an evolution perspective that gradually builds up into the understanding of the human mind as an achievement of nature in relation to other species. It also examines the future of mind in terms of electronic technology, but the emphasis is not on that. It also examines the specific functions of the parts of the brain and makes interesting ""wondering about's"" from the mind of this great scientist. Very enjoyable if you are interested in the mysteries of the human and animal brain. "
275,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5749729-laura,4,"I read this book for a class. And I'm truly glad I did because it was very good. The great thing about this book it's that it's not just a divulgation reading, but a text that often asks you questions while you read, and allows you to wonder about a surprising range of topics, from animal mistreat to abortion.I like to think that just by reading this book many people would question their posture in such topics, and I also find it appalling that even all those years after Sagan wrote this many debates still stand, and many postures still need changing."
276,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33177343-david-l-pez,5,"Considering that have happened almost 40 years since this book was written it is very impressive the amount of 'new' information it contains. Definitively you have to praise Dr. Sagan for caring so much about give to the public the latest available knowledge.I really enjoy the symmetry that Sagan draws between the bible and the Greek myths and some important points of the human evolution, and also I like how he structures the book from the past to the present, and from our planet to the universe.Even today, 2015, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in human evolution."
277,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23004551-john-goodell,4,"I've always been a Carl Sagan fan but this is the first book of his I picked up. He writes for the layman but digs deep on the subject of the human mind and uncovers a lot on the evolution of the organ and the ways in which it has put humans above of other animals on Earth. The book is gripping throughout, always delving into new perspective and inquiry. Towards the end Sagan's clairvoyance becomes clear when he begins discussing computers and an age in which handheld computers will be commonplace..."
278,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58122745-ayush-johry,5,"I'll recommend this book to everyone. The book is a spectacular journey into deciphering the evolution of human intelligence. Each chapter is a another saga of wonderment and surprises as you unravel the deep mysteries and functioning of human brain, the most important part in our body. Carl Sagan is a scientific gift for the mankind, who sees the human species beyond all social distinctions as a race destined to achieve supreme intelligence. The book will help you open your mind and understand how far we have come from a single celled organism. "
279,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58656451-sru-r-cynea-sson,5,"A fascinating book for anyone interested in the development of the human mind. Sagan endeavours to answer some of the questions about the evolution of the homo-sapien brain and it's impact upon our rise to the apex of the power pyramid. For the student of psychology, then this is a must. For the student of self-improvement or self-deification, then this is also a must. Sagan provides a wealth of data and insight into the functioning and development of the brain. The resulting book should function as a 'quick start' guide to the use of the brain."
280,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3029574-caley,4,"Despite the fact that it was published decades ago, this book still rings true in most areas. Sagan presents his material clearly and without any notable bias. He makes clear distinctions between science and speculation, and does not hide the fact that many of his ideas are yet to be proved. Though the premise is pretty basic, it is a great read for any layperson interested in human intelligence and evolution, and is not only informative, but fun."
281,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3067993-ron,4,"More a rambling essay covering a range of related topics than a cohesive text, this book is nonetheless enjoyable. Being more than 30 years old, some of the science is outdated, but otherwise it serves as a decent introduction to the human brain and its capabilities. Recommended follow-ups to this book: The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and other Oliver Sacks works, and Phantoms in the Brain by V.S. Ramachandran."
282,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,3,"As a big Sagan fan I read this more to see what he was thinking back in 1977 rather than to learn a lot about the human brain and intelligence. I would have to say that it's the my least favorite of his books. As smart as he was, I think he would have been better off leaving topics of this nature to the experts in the field of neuroscience. Still it was interesting to read *his* views on these matters."
283,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1668393-anita,5,"This book gave me such a brain-crush on Carl Sagan: I dreamt I gave the man a *hug* the other night, his writing made me so happy. I've seen ""Cosmos"" several times so I know I love me some Sagan, but this was, amazingly, the first time I'd read anything by him. Incredible. You will probably never find anyone else who's both as excited and qualified to teach you about science. Read this book, dammit. "
284,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3984422-james-mitchell,4,"When I first picked up this book to read, I was concerned that it was dated (1977) and written by Carl Sagan (didn't he narrate populist space documentaries). Turns out he was an accomplished biologist, well versed in studies of ""origin and the early evolution of life"". He does a fine job of bringing along the reader on a journey into the depths and evolution of the human brain. Easy to follow and very informative, I was very happy to have spent my vacation reading this book."
285,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35876-jonathan,3,"I was so impressed by Sagan's Cosmos that I wanted to read anything else of his that I could get my hands on. I enjoyed Dragons of Eden a little less than Cosmos, mostly because we still know so little about the human brain that most of the topics discussed here contained quite a bit more speculation than those in Cosmos. Still, this book does a great job of getting the reader thinking about the origins of intelligence and where we might be going."
286,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2459103-ogi-ogas,4,"My ratings of books on Goodreads are solely a crude ranking of their utility to me, and not an evaluation of literary merit, entertainment value, social importance, humor, insightfulness, scientific accuracy, creative vigor, suspensefulness of plot, depth of characters, vitality of theme, excitement of climax, satisfaction of ending, or any other combination of dimensions of value which we are expected to boil down through some fabulous alchemy into a single digit."
287,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1758594-patrick-gibson,3,"This book is good for all, but exceptionally interesting for those studying the human brain, the function of the human mind, or the human condition in general. The stories which serve to illustrate Sagan's theories are presented exquisitely. The statistics which support Sagan's points are laid out in a logical and easy-to-understand fashion. The book is short enough to get through in one sitting. A must read. Period."
288,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,2,"This is basically a series of essays written by the famous cosmologist around the subject of human intelligence: its evolution and posssible future improvement. It was written in the mid 1970's and much of the author's musing now seem simplistic.I think if I had read the book when it was published I would have given it a 4 star rating, but now the material is too dated.His section on what digital computers can do would be laughed at by a 6th grade child."
289,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2029399-anders-franklin,4,"Read this book. First off, great disposition. Fairly short chapters which made it an easy read suitable for, in my case, lunch hours at work. Sagan tried, and in my opinion succeeded, to explain rather complex ideas in a graspable way, without, I must say, making it feel like being talked down to. Sure, in some places it's a out-dated book, but in my case I found it to be an interesting perspective on the world as it once was."
290,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5485036-caleb,4,"Take note of the word ""speculations"" in the sub-title -- this book has a generous helping of hand-waving mixed in with the references to research and analysis. I actually found that Sagan's speculations made the read more enjoyable. Just imagine that you're sitting down in a comfortable coffee shop to have an energetic ""what-if"" contest with a very intelligent and articulate buddy, trying to get to the bottom of why people KNOW they're people."
291,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3347892-jasmeet,5,"Carl talks quite well about how we as humans evolved. ""Why we are the way we are?"" is, i think the central question.The book is a well articulated account of history, science, and philosophy; all at the same time.It is interesting when he questions ""human-ness"" and talks about what separates us from ""beasts"". It shines a bright light upon the fact that we are not the only intelligent animals on earth and how we share a good part of subconscious with them. "
292,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/645102-kit-fox,4,"This is the book Sagan won a Pulitzer for is also feels like his weediest tome; counted multiple reference to the smoking of trees in this one. More than anything, though, this book is reminder that, with Sagan's untimely passing in 1996, the world was deprived of quite possibly the greatest video game reviewer of the modern era. Who else, in a review of ""Pong,"" would praise its ability to deepen a player's understanding of Newtonian physics? Uncle Carl would."
293,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10718146-adam,5,"Pros: An excellent read on how the human brain may have built-up from our reptilian ancestors. Exudes a clear prose with Sagan's normal hint of pedagogy - a perfect introduction to basic human brain evolution.Cons: I can barely hold this against the book, but the information is dated (obviously). Overall: I would recommend this book to anyone interested in human evolution, especially as an introduction to human brain adaptation. "
294,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3780769-bill-h,4,"Of course any 1977 book on neurology and human evolutionary biology is going to be dated -- but this was still a interesting read. These are indeed Sagan's speculations, just as the title promises. I certainly got the sense that Sagan would've been a fascinating person to just hang around and chat with.I'd be interested to have someone as engaging on the these topics -- but also current, and knowledgeable -- bring this up to date."
295,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16064551-cyndy-parr,5,"Another seriously influential book for me. I bought it as a high school sophomore in the gift shop of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. It set me on a course that took me to Cornell (where Sagan was a faculty member, though I never met him), carried me through graduate school (I got a PhD on evolution of intelligent behavior), and now has me working at the museum where I bought the book. Not bad for a book outside his astronomical expertise."
296,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6630189-caveman-pleasures,4,"Though some passages (on the wonders and possibilities of computers, for example) read a little dated in 2013, this book is still relevant and interesting. I like the hopeful tone the book picks up towards the end, and Sagan's musings on humanity's future and thoughtful and instructive. Also, Sagan is a great writer with an eye for concision and structure, so his ideas never overwhelm either him or the layman reader. "
297,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23350470-tim-evanson,5,"This is one of Sagan's earliest works, and his most award-winning. Compared to Cosmos or Broca's Brain, the writing is not as good. But the book lays out Sagan's basic scientific and moral philosophies, and explores many of the deepest themes of his life and work. The subtitle may be about human intelligence, but Sagan explores a wide range of topics that anyone would find enjoyable and fascinating."
298,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3533728-andrew,4,"Dragons of Eden is a book about evolution written in an engaging way. Sometimes Sagan tries to tie in myths to early evolution, but those metaphors were usually pretty weak, as he often admitted. Instead, the best parts of the book focused on how our brains developed and some conjectures as to why certain brain activities exist (like dreaming). The book definitely made me think and was pretty enjoyable. "
299,0345346297,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24318433-lin,3,"Carl Sagan is always a fascinating yet clear writer of science. Both as an intro to studies on the human and non-human brains, and to Sagan's philosophizing on what those discoveries mean to us, the book kept me interested for the most part.On the other hand, many of the theories he muses about here are rather outdated (Recapitulation theory, much of the dream chapter), so a modern reader should read it with a grain of salt."
