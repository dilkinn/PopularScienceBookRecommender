0,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"As I progressed through this excellent little book, I began to feel that the style was somehow familiar from another genre. Mozart? Perhaps e.e. cummings? But my subconscious, while granting that I wasn't totally off-base, informed me that it had a chess analogy in mind. I had never thought about it before, but I am suddenly rather taken with the idea of comparing great physics writers with great chess players. Penrose reminds me of Tal, trusting his astonishing visual intuition to steer him through mind-bogglingly complicated thickets of mathematical formulae. Einstein is Botvinnik, an iron logician who formulates his strategy at the beginning of the game and ruthlessly implements it to what seems like an inevitable conclusion. Newton is Fischer: not quite sane, he nevertheless plays perfectly without anyone being able to see where he finds the brilliant ideas. Dirac is Alekhine, producing a miraculous mating attack out of nowhere.And Feynman? Well, he can't be anyone except Capablanca. The deceptive effortlessness and simplicity of his moves, explained in a voice evidently more often used for seducing beautiful women...___________________________________I have been thinking about this remarkable book ever since I finished it a few days ago, and I feel I should say more. But it's difficult. Feynman is, of course, telling you interesting things about science, but the reason people love him is not so much the content, but the style. You read him, and you believe for a moment that you understand how this unique person saw the world. Is it an illusion? I really don't know. His voice is so immediate and personal. He says in a matter-of-fact way that we understand these things over here quite well, these other things a bit, and the matters in this last group not at all. He tells you how you question Nature to learn a new fundamental law as though it were the simplest thing in the world. At the same time, he warns that we are at a very unusual and exciting point in history, and that soon it will no longer be possible for people to have these experiences. He is utterly convincing.I just read William James's Varieties of Religious Experience, and I couldn't help thinking: is Feynman what James would call a mystic? If anyone had made the suggestion to him, I am sure he would have laughed at them. He hated all forms of pretentiousness, and his book never uses a long word when a short one will do. He evidently felt that formal philosophy was a waste of time. He didn't think he was doing anything special, and that anyone could understand the physical world as he did if only they would try a little. Of course, that's the kind of thing mystics often say."
1,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian,4,"all the great early-20th century physicists came up with this l. ron hubbardish conceit to invent a pornucopia of whackadoo sci-fi theories and sell 'em to the public as hard 'reality'… the solvay conference - where they came up with the first round of bullshit - was a blast! they eliminated absolute time, described light as particle & wave, defined space as 'curved', played with cats which were simultaneously dead and alive, came up with a slew of random constants, and - just as Area 51 info is passed on to every american prez ('except for the black guy! we can't seriously tell state secrets to the black guy, can we?!?!') - every new generation a select group of dreamers and thinkers are told of the great joke-slash-conspiracy and allowed to add on a bit. double slit experiment? multiverses? string theory? hadron collider? sure. have fun. just kick some of that grant money our way, sister. the gossip is that feynman wanted to blow the whole thing wide open and one can see the first cracks in lecture #6 'Probability and Uncertainty' -- in imploring his listener to just shut up and accept what feynman says, our humble lecturer is just begging to be called out on the bullshit: ""It will be difficult. But the difficulty really is psychological and exists in the perpetual torment that results from your saying to yourself, 'But how can it be like that?' which is a reflection of uncontrolled but utterly vain desire to see it in terms of something familiar. I will not describe it in terms of an analogy with something familiar; I will simply describe it. There was a time when the newspapers said that only twelve men understood the theory of relativitiy. I do not believe there ever was such a time. There might have been a time when only one man did, because he was the only guy who caught on, before he wrote his paper. But after people read the paper a lot of people understood the theory of relativity in some way or other, certainly more than twelve. On the other hand, i think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics. So do not take the lecture too seriously, feeling that you really have to understand in terms of some model what I am going to describe,  but just relax and enjoy it. I am going to tell you what nature behaves like. If you will simply admit that maybe she does behave like this, you will find her a delightful, entrancing thing. Do not keep saying to yourself, if you can possibly avoid it, 'But how can it be like that?', because you will get 'down the drain', into a blind alley from which nobody has yet escaped. Nobody knows how it can be like that.' feynman contracted two forms of rare cancer and died. hmmm…. "
2,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433865-robert,5,"This is a fantastic little book for which we have to thank the BBC: They decided to film these lectures and subsequently publish transcripts of them, at a time before Feynman had turned into a one-man industry and every one of Feynman`s students`first-draft lecture notes became as diamond dust.The title tells one enough about the contents; if you have any interest in the topic you should read this book. It is almost but not completely non-mathematical. If you can cope with the algebra contained within F=GMm/R - well, that's as hard as it gets.The aspect of the book that particularly interested me this time around is in Chapter two (and reprised somewhat in the final lecture). Feynman takes the above given equation, which expresses Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation and says - that's all very well, but you can express it in another way that's to do with how something called a potential varies locally - and if you do it will always give exactly the same answer! And, not content with that, you can express it another way that is to do with finding the minimum of a certain thing called the Action. (Technically it doesn't have to be a minimum, just somewhere where the tangent to the graph of the Action would be horizontal.) Done this way, the answers always come out the same as the other two ways! What's the point of that? Three ways to say the same thing!But here's the interesting, indeed profound thing: when it came to understanding quantum mechanics (which doesn't deal with gravity) it was found that both potentials and a principle of minimum (stationary, strictly) Action were needed. So the different ways of expressing Newton's gravity law turned out profoundly useful in understanding a different set of phenomena, namely the nuclear forces and electromagnetism.So if you are involved in trying to understand fundamental physics it would probably be healthy to actively search for different mathematical methods of expressing the laws as we understand them now!Incidently, I doubt you will ever come across a more accessible introduction to the essential mystery of quantum mechanics (the photon/electron double slit experiment) than that given in this lecture, in which Feynman gave his famous quote, ""...I think I can safely say nobody understands quantum mechanics."""

It is impossible, by the way, by picking one of anything to pick one that is not atypical in some sense. That is the wonder of the world.
I would probably be giving this little book five stars if I wasn't already familiar with much of it from reading Feynman's Six Easy Pieces and Six Not-So-Easy Pieces. There's a good deal of overlap in the material, and Feynman even uses several of the same examples and analogies. It seems he was so often explaining these things that he developed a method. I must admit I'm glad to see this, as it humanized the man a little in my eyes. The idea that he could just extemporize these things made me feel like I might as well bottle my brain in formaldehyde, and donate it to some med students for their instruction, because I wasn't using it for anything. What was new for me, however, was Chapter 2, ""The Relation of Mathematics to Physics."" It is extraordinary how Feynman is able to make such sophisticated philosophical points with such plain language, and with such apparent scorn for all philosophizing. Really, Feynman didn't dislike philosophy, he disliked bad philosophy. So what is the relationship of mathematics to physics? This is a difficult question, one that can apparently be probed through thought alone. Since physical laws seem only expressible in a mathematical language, and since mathematicians have many times developed the tools necessary for physicists, often a hundred of years before they were needed, it seems there is a deep connection between these two. Maybe they are ultimately the same thing? Maybe we could do physics like mathematicians do math, with axioms and proofs? Not so, says Feynman, and he offers one simple argument. In physics, we can often express the same thing in many different ways. We can talk about gravity as a field, with Newton's laws, or with the least action principal. Which is right? There's no way to tell. Maybe, he says, when we have all the laws figured out, we can do physics by pure deduction. But now that we're still in the process of guessing new laws, it's good to have multiple ways to formulate them, for one formulation might be very useful in the future. He gives as an example the ways that Newton's laws were useful to Maxwell, even though gravity and electro-magnetism did not appear to have a deep connection. The same sorts of relationships are found in apparently unrelated phenomena, thus preventing us from using purely deductive reasoning.Well, I'm quickly reaching the end of my scant knowledge, so I'd better end this review. I'll only add that, if you know any young physics students, do the universe a favor and get them this book. The cosmos will thank you."
4,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna,4,"It is commonplace to praise Feynman for describing fiendishly difficult concepts in friendly vernacular and intuitive analogies, for example, his wet towels metaphor for the second law of thermodynamics communicates its content, import, and the sad desperation physicists have felt about it unforgettably. But what matters as much is that he is never sloppy, he never allows an analogy to carry away substance or overstep its explanatory limits. I have read other accounts of the double-slit experiments aimed at the layperson that sound like hocus pocus, but Feynman explains the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle so that it makes the sort of sense that would have GCSE students (or my grandmother, even) nodding sagely, at the same time as he reveals the ostensibly juiceless statistical view of the universe as jubilant poetry, silver trumpets and redemption: even in the mind of god there is no fate..."
5,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9481358-christopher-wilson,5,"I once had a friend that I was tutoring in physics explain to me that this was her intro physics ""textbook"". Amazingly, though I was studying physics, I hadn't really been introduced to Richard Feynman in any real way. That Saturday, I sat down with a cup of coffee in my small rooming house kitchen and started reading this book. Feynman is a magician of explanation. On every page I read, Feynman took some concept that I was familiar with and tugged it apart, then with a sly turn deftly snapped it back together in a new form. The explanation that he produced this way was simpler, better, and it was as if he'd dropped that concept to its ground state. A puff of needless complication floats away and he hands you back a pearl of an idea. That's what reading this is like."
6,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,3,"Somewhat dated since this was first published in the mid 60s, it's still a fairly decent primer on some basic physics. I'd heard Feynman was renowned for his ability to explain complex topics in simple language. I found that true to a large extent, although sometimes I got confused. It's one reason I can't recommend the audiobook. There are a lot of diagrams & while I didn't need the early ones, about midway through they became critical.Table of Contents1   The Law of Gravitation, an example of Physical Law2   The Relation of Mathematics to Physics3   The Great Conservation Principles4   Symmetry in Physical Law5   The Distinction of Past and Future6   Probability and Uncertainty – the Quantum Mechanical viewof Nature7   Seeking New LawsInteresting, but nothing really new & there are better, more up to date books/lectures available now.

8,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,4,"Feynman was one of the few scientists who understood the methods, ideas and philosophy of science to the degree of a first rate philosopher. This can be shown in these transcripts in where he travels across a few topics in the nature of physics such as the reoccurring physical parameters(which we anthropomorphically call scientific ‘law’), his analysis of symmetry, the nature of math and its relation to physics, probability ,the oddities of physics and its future prospects. He showed a piercing understanding of his scientific discipline’s parameters in a way so few grasp. It will become soon clear to the reader- who I imagine will generally have stumbled across this book from hearing of feynman- why it is that his name is still echoed in our culture.While I will admit, I was personally not so aided in my framing of these topics, I though found this book to be one of the better popular texts to introduce the reader to the philosophy of physics, and why it is so some hear its siren’s call beckoning them to study its mysterious workings.Recommended for:-Those curious about fundamental questions of nature- those interested in the scientific method- those philosophers who have decided to start being empirical- intellectually curious people scared of science"
9,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5929851-robert-kosara,4,"Clearly my favorite Feynman book, because it’s actually about physics. The lectures are very well done, cover a lot of ground, and go into just the right level of depth. It’s also interesting to see him talk so much about the limitations of physics and what do and can know. "
10,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3323455-jeremy,5,"This is not a book about the content of physics, but the practice of physics. What is it physicists do and how do they think? Feynman's explanation here is unmatched in its clarity and accessibility."
11,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21430140-jerry,5,"	If it disagrees with experiment it is wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science… We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong.This is a semi-transcript of a lecture series that Feynman gave at Cornell University. Semi-transcript because “The lectures were not given from a prepared manuscript” and “The chapters in this book are reports of talks which were presented”. Comparing it with video of what I think was one of the lectures, it comes very close. “They have been checked for scientific accuracy by Professor Feynman,” according to the introduction.The lectures are about the character of physical law, that is, what kinds of things show up in the laws of physics, their symmetries and conservations.	It is easy to understand how an object can be symmetrical, but how can a physical law have a symmetry? Of course it cannot, but physicists delight themselves by using ordinary words for other things.Feynman here uses symmetry in both the relatively normal word—how the different laws can often appear to be mirrors of each other—and the physics sense:	that there are things we can do to the physical laws, or to our way of representing the physical laws, which make no difference, and leave everything unchanged in its effects.There are also nice descriptions of how relativity affects these laws, such as that the conservation of charge is “local”, that is, it is independent of the movement of particles.He emphasizes throughout the necessity of experimentation, and of definite predictions that can be measured.	It is a small section only of natural phenomena that one gets from direct experience. It is only through refined measurements and careful experimentation that we can have a wider vision.This is a small book that will definitely benefit from re-reading, because not only is it easily understandable on the surface, there are critical insights that ought to become more clear after thinking about them and re-reading the text.The book does not have an index, sadly, which means you can’t look up in the back later to quickly find where he talks about symmetry, or locality, or strangeness.It looks like the full lecture series is available on video.	Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns, so each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry. "
12,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"This is a short and easy to understand book. It is beneficial mostly to those new to popular science books. Feynman talks about the following topics: What are the laws of nature and how are they discovered. The story of the Law of Gravity up to Einstein, and that of the law of conservation of energy. The uncertainty and universality of the laws of nature. The flow of time, order and disorder (entropy). Levels of complexity. Quantum mechanics and uncertainty principle. And falsifiability."
13,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5106656-matthew-royal,4,"Much better than other, more biographical works of his. Guess I never thought of Physics as such a scattershot patchwork of guesses before. He does a good job democratizing it, emphasizing that ideas can come from anywhere, and their value comes only from their agreement with experiment data."
14,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49537311-amirreza,5,"A splendid story of the phyical laws of nature written by the best physics teacher of all times, Richard Feynman. He tells the theories of physics in the layman's language, making them easy to comprehend."
15,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4564953-david,5,"I read this transcript of lectures and watched some of them on YouTube as well. The first few are good reviews about gravity and basic physics concepts, but the interesting bits are about the nature of the laws themselves: how they were discovered and how science works in practice. I was surprised to learn first that the axiomatic approach that grounds mathematics isn't the most effective way to approach physics and that (relatedly) physicists often guess at the right explanations and only later figure out why they're so.I found especially interesting that Feynman explicitly values the practice of generalizing an observation beyond the realm in which it was observed. He makes a good case why this is critical for science. On the other hand, I've often felt that in some domains (especially software), people's tendency to generalize from their own experiences to everybody else's is a major impediment to real progress. I think these are pretty different cases, because science is trying to make predictions, but it's a thought-provoking point."
16,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72945589-illiterate,3,Feynman’s lectures are like physical laws: they’re all about maths and simplicity except when they aren’t.
17,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6130111-janet,4,"My son, Ryan, recommended this book since I wanted to learn more about Physics, and Richard Feynman per: Ryan is ""great at explaining terms that everyone can understand"". The content is seven lectures delivered at Cornell University in 1964, and I must admit that some of the material went in one eyeball and out the other despite Mr. Feynman's great diagrams and simplified explanations. The concepts of gravitation, conservation, symmetry, probability, uncertainty, and more are reviewed with credit given to a who's who list of scientists. I appreciated Richard Feynman's sense of humor such as ""X is always the unknown, so let us call it W to make it seem that we have advanced above the usual!"" And, how great to find out that ""nobody understands quantum mechanics"". I thought it was just me!"
18,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,4,"Feynman's sparkling personality comes through clearly in the words of these lectures. It is easy to see why he was a beloved professor in addition to being a genius physicist. There is little new ground covered here for anyone with even a passing knowledge of physics. Ideas of symmetries, conservation laws, the close alliance of math and physics and the weirdness of quantum mechanics are basic concepts, so this book is accessible to nearly everyone. But it is interesting and a bit outside of the norm to for a physicist to think and talk about the character of physical laws -- what they are, what kinds of problems they describe, how they can be confirmed, extended and refuted, how they can be used and misused. This kind of question is posed by philosophers of science like Popper and Feyerabend, but rarely by working scientists. The perspective of a working scientist like Feynman is unsurprisingly a bit different from that of a full time philosopher of science. One of the insights that I enjoyed most in the book was in the section about the relationship between physics and math where Feynman explains that the laws of physics cannot be based on a complete axiomatic system of the type used in math because the physical world doesn't quite work that way or on account of incompleteness of information. So for now in physics, we have to muck around with what Feynman calls Babylonian mathematics, starting from a few things that we think that we know that seem to apply to the current situation and trying to work out more truths from there. Interesting."
19,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7396031-ryan-curry,5,Enjoyed this one quite a bit. Particularly the last chapter on seeking new Laws of nature. 
20,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7212454,5,"Feynman is a great man to tell you about nature and physics and philosophy behind it. But he does this in a way that makes it hard for you to listen and enjoy most of such-called scientists talking about science, he makes you feel the difference."
21,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95446635-a23a,3,Interestingly divulgative. Intriguing and as clear as it gets. I covet deeper and more complex explanations.I have yet to read his lectures.
22,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10686638-jan,4,Feynman explains how we got to various laws and how scientists think about the new ones. I particularly enjoyed the explanation of process of how Newton came up with gravitation equation and the double slit experiment which demonstrates that electrons behave both like waves and particles. Feynman uses his characteristic analogies and stories to make the explanations super-captivating.
23,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"This was a late discovery for me amongst Richard Feynman's books, and it's something of an oddity. Like all the books with his name on, this wasn't a case of Feynman sitting down to write a book; he never wrote a single book - in this case it's a transcription of a set of lectures Feynman gave at Cornell University which were broadcast in the UK by the BBC.What the great physicist sets out to do is to explore the nature of physical laws. Where this works best (and he would probably have hated this suggestion) is where he was at his most philosophical. In the first lecture he explored just what was meant by physical laws and this is genuinely interesting stuff, especially as it's something we rarely give much thought to.After that he goes on to cover specific areas, with lectures on gravity, maths, conservation, symmetry, the arrow of time and probability, before pulling things together in a final lecture on the search for new laws. For me these chapters don't work quite as well in book form, partly because we miss the visual aspects of Feynman's talks, and partly because they are perhaps a little too summary for the topics covered. The other slight problem with specifics is that inevitably some of the content (from the 1960s) is quite dated - particularly in the 'new laws' section, where he covers particle physics at a point before quarks and when the particle zoo seemed out of control. It's interesting from a historical perspective of what the understanding was like at the time, but it's not an ideal way to find out about particle physics.Overall, an essential if you want to have a complete picture of Feynman's output, and fascinating in that opening chapter, but not the best of the Feynman books."
24,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5284687-albin-james,5,"Prof. Feynman consciously chooses select examples like the Law of Gravitation (which he says would have been considered less fancy Physics by then) and uses them to emphasise how tight-knit things really are in nature and how Mathematics is an indispensable tool for Physics. He goes into showing the importance of careful study and hard work while explaining the process of scientific research. He shows utmost respect to nature by taking a no nonsense attitude and avoiding any false modesty (he knows his Physics!). His treatment of Quantum Mechanics is made very clear by his decision to present things just as they are. Plus, there are many many funny words and phrases sprinkled in throughout the lectures to add to the reader's sense of satisfaction."
25,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78591412-vinay-ayilavarapu,5,"It's part of our survival instinct to study patterns in nature. This particular trait has led us to ask these important questions and to pursue their answers. And tools such as science & math help us achieve these goals. But, Feynman is also making an interesting point here. He says that ""Our main concentration will not be on how clever we are to have found it all out, but on how clever nature is to pay attention to it.""These lectures primarily focus on the characteristics of these laws and how nature follows them. Calling this book ""fascinating"" is an understatement because it's more like an epiphany.Another point he emphasizes is how to ""science"". The scientific methodology asks us to make intuitive guesses & perform rigorous experiments to prove out the ideas. Thorough exercises in reason & logic provides us with a solid foundation, which could be used for improving our lives. Curiosity sparks the deep yearning to understand oneself & the world. It doesn't always kill the cat.Regards,Vinay P.S.For those curious creatures out there. I would also recommend the following books.1.

If not, I can definitely know that so and so is correct"" is a systematic way of dealing with something. Feynman in his yet another incredible book, has gone through how physical laws are formulated, tested, and the best part, corrected over time. Through very simple examples of gravity, double split experiment and so on, Feynman has taught a lot of nuances in science.At no point does Feynman make dogmatic claims about any law. He says that what we know as the energy conservation law is perhaps not ""yet"" violated and insists that we constantly be on the look out for discovering new discrepancies in existing laws and be humble enough to amend them. Must read for anyone who wishes to understand systematic science. "
27,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/656942-david,5,"Feynman's lectures make good reading. That alone is somewhat unusual, since many lectures do not survive well when they are simply transcribed. The other unusual thing about Feynman's lecture style is that he makes what he's talking about clear and accessible without an excess of jargon. His approach is sometimes quirky, but in his lectures you can see how he thinks about that approach. In these lectures, there's a balance between musings about physics and musings about how people think (about physics and about other things). Read for the latter even if you think you'll be uninterested in the former."
28,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1481465-tom,4,"I procrastinated reading this because I thought the level of physics might be too difficult. It is actually extremely accessible and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the way the universe works and the relationship between mathematics and physics. Since the chapters are transcribed lectures, there are a few points in the book at which complex mathematics is glossed over or presented as an understood explanation. Also, as lectures, the diagrams and illustrations are sparse, which makes the text rely to heavily on verbal explanations of formulae. But you can skim and still be in awe."
29,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49311671-kauther-a,5,"For a long time, I was against the idea of having a favorite book; I thought it would be like picking a favorite child. But this book completely shattered this mindset.If you are not a physicist, this book will be a very easy and simple way for you to understand what physics is, and how we study it. On the other hand, if you are a physicist, this book will provide you with an extremely beautiful and concise way to look at the world and think about the major concepts of physics.This is, rightfully, my all time favorite book.

30,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5018981-jb,5,"How delightful is Nature for Feynman and his peers. This glimpse on the Physicist method (more than the actual explanations of some laws) is a great takeaway. I already feel the approach, both in technic and in philosophy, can be applied to any kind of intellectual work.This book is a transcript, hence it is sometimes hard to process. The videos can be seen online, that’s a great experience overall. Also it makes reading with Feynman accent in mind mandatory from now on :)"

There is then some reason to talk of other things sometimes. As we look into these things we get an aesthetic pleasure from them directly from observation. There is also a rhythm and a pattern between the phenomena of nature which is not apparent to the eye, but only to the eye of analysis; and it is these rhythms and patterns which we call Physical Laws.Relation of Mathematics to PhysicsPg.41 Mathematics is a language plus reasoning; it is like a language plus logic. Mathematics is a tool for reasoning. IT is in fact a big collection of the results of some person’s careful thought and reasoning. By mathematics it is possible to connect one statement to another.Pg.46 In Babylonian schools in mathematics the student would learn something by doing a large number of examples until he caught on the general rule.Pg.46 The most modern mathematics concentrates on axioms and demonstrations within a very definite framework of conventions of what is acceptable and what is not acceptable as axioms.Pg.56 The physicist is always interested in the special case; he is never interested in the general case. He is talking about something; he is not talking abstractly about anything. He wants to discuss the gravity law in three dimensions; he never wants the arbitrary force case in n dimensions.

And Euclid said, “There is no royal road to geometry”. And there is no royal road. Physicists cannot make a conversation to any other language. If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in. She offer her information in one only in one form; we are not so unhumble as to demand the she change before we pay any attention.The Great Conservation PrinciplesPg.77 In order to avoid simply describing experiments that have been done, we have to propose laws beyond their observed range. There is nothing wrong with that, despite the fact that it makes science uncertain. If you thought before that science was certain - well, that is just an error on your part.The Distinction of Past and FuturePg.113 One of the rules of the world is that the thing goes from an ordered condition to a disordered.Seeking New LawsPg.158 During all that time the theory had not been proved wrong, and could be taken temporarily to be right. But it could never be proved right, because tomorrow’s experiment might succeed in proving wrong what you thought was right. We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong.Pg.158 One of the ways of stopping science would be only to do experiments in the region where you know the law. But experimenters search most diligently, and with the greatest effort, in exactly those places where it seems most likely that we can prove out theories wrong. In other words we are trying to prove ourselves wrong as quickly as possible, because only in that way can we find progress."
33,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28727983-e,3,"Richard Feynman, who has always had the reputation of being a masterful explainer of complex concepts, sets out in this series of published lectures to describe some of the basics of physics. There are seven lectures/chapters. The first discusses physical law in general but uses gravitation as an example of how such law operates. The second chapter addresses mathematics and how it plays an integral role in physical investigation. Feynman does not hide his wonder and delight that so much of the universe can be described in mathematical terms. I actually consider this evidence of a divine creator, even if he does not.The third chapter discusses conservation principles, such as conservation of energy and conservation of mass. A really cool concept to think about, especially when one sits down to consider where the energy, say, of a hot fire goes. It ends up in many more forms than you might think, but none of it is lost! Next is a chapter on symmetry, which in physics refers to the concept of an action of reaction taking place in another place, with the same results.Perhaps the most interesting chapter is the fifth, discussing the distinction between past and future time. In the other dimensions--length, height, depth--one can go both forward and backward. But why doesn't time work that way? And yet, events that are simultaneous to one person are not always so to another person (enter the classic example of someone on a spaceship traveling near the speed of light). Thus there seems to be some play here in the fourth dimension. But it's not like Feynman is arguing for time travel or anything like that.The sixth chapter is the most complicated, dealing with uncertainty and quantum electrondynamics. I've read a whole book by Feynman on that topic, and it's still a bit over my head. Lastly Feynman discusses the science of doing physics and attempting to discover new laws. Even though the lecture is half a century old, it as still as relevant today as it was then.I love reading Feynman because of the joy and delight he derives from the physical world, and his supreme ability to communicate both the delight and the intricacy of whatever he's describing. That comes through well in this work."
34,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7552897-sebastian,3,"What the title of this book promises is an analysis of the concept of physical law, a text that would go “meta” and, perhaps, analyse what the concept of a physical law is, how it came/comes about, how it relates to the natural world, or how we as humans deal with it. When the book does actually grapple with these issues, it truly shines, but sadly, this only happens in the early and late chapters. The middle is a sort of highly-compressed tour of some examples of physical laws that seems aimed more at explaining how gravity or the quantum world works, instead of keeping to this “meta” level. The compression shows to the point that many of the explanations (particularly in the section on QM) become muddled and hard to follow. I’m going to guess that this tends to not be the first Feynman book people grab, and it shows in the weirdly high ratings here – people who come to this text already knowing these concepts may nod along, and I’d venture to say that for such people (myself included) the middle part was too extensive to the point of boring, covering ground we are already well familiar with. On the other hand, the rapid race through a number of interesting theories will likely prove incomprehensible to someone who comes into this without at least a basic grasp of those same concepts."
35,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48319145-clive-f,2,"This was a tough review for me: I mean, Richard Feynman?! The man is a god, really, plus the whole Nobel Prize thing, who am I to criticise? Unfortunately I think this book is showing its age, especially in the writing style. It's more or less a transcription of Feynman speaking his lectures, as captured by the BBC in the 1960s, and unfortunately that doesn't translate terribly well into a writing style. It's also starting a bunch of physics from (nearly) the beginning, which means that for me, it didn't tell me anything terribly new.On the other hand, it does give a very different perspective on things like Newton's theory of gravity, which you might not see in many other places. I enjoyed also his complete transparency about how physics, and science in general, is done: you make bold predictions about things in completely new spaces, you test them out, then if they fail you guess at the form of new laws that might explain them. And he's quite clear about the guessing part: great scientists are great guessers. Which makes Prof. Feynman a guesser of interstellar proportions, I think. A true polymath genius, that man. So I feel bad about the 2 stars, but I'm reviewing the book, not the man!"
36,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7842801-lior-alexandre,3,"I was surprised that, despite Feynman being acknowledged as one of the most able communicators of physics, some of his explanations were very hard to follow, although this may be due to the fact that these are lectures written down in book form which might not have translated well across media. An example is the explanation of local charge conservation which was very confusing and didn't distinguish clearly between local/global charge conservation. A quick read of Wikipedia made it much easier to understand.Another example is the link between the effect on the action of a small step to one side and conservation of momentum which is very badly explained. Perhaps it is only really understandable using maths which Feynman avoids as his audience was not mathematically inclined.Despite this some explanations were very beautiful. His classic explanation of energy conservation using a child's toys is fantastic and the Seeking New Laws chapter was well explained and I will be sharing it with my students. As a physics graduate most of the physics content was not new to me but I was intrigued by the link made between electricity induction and the conservation of angular momentum which I wasn't aware of/had forgotten about."
37,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11842614-glenn,5,"This is an amazing book. As James Gleick says in his Introduction, Feynman undermines his own point that nature can only be truly understood through advanced mathematics. Feynman provides remarkably nonmathematical explanations of fundamental physical phenomena.The book moves progressively from the (relatively) simple law of gravitation, to the fraught field of quantum mechanics. The author concludes by suggesting ways in which new laws of nature might be found, as well as by critiquing attempts to find new laws through vague or untestable statements.Feynman's wicked sense of humor shines through at the most unexpected moments. Well, almost any moment would be unexpected, because this is such serious subject matter.I note here that the term ""laws"" can also be fraught. Popper points out, in The Open Society and Its Enemies, that there are natural laws, or physical laws, in Feynman's sense, which are regularities in nature. We observe that such and such is consistently the case, and we agree that a law has been established. Feynman points out that such a law may last for many years, even though it is wrong. These are not norms or laws established by society for preferred modes of behavior.Fascinating, thought-provoking, and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny."
38,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27678334-eric,4,"Not quite amazing but a very entertaining scientific tour of the reality of the world around us. Usually just a step removed from being too difficult to follow. I did have one very interesting insight as this went on. Feynman posed that one could eventually understand the meanderings of the glacier from analyzing with increasing care the behavior of the ice crystals from which it is made. We recently finished listening to T. Colin Campbell's ""Whole,"" wherein he spoke of one of our problems in nutrition is our overwhelming reliance on reductionist thinking. i would love to have the physicist Feynman and the doctor/nutritionist Campbell set our their thoughts on reductionist thinking in a comparison of a common subject. It would seem the ultimate in reductionist thinking to study a glacier based on its individual ice crystals compared to the human body's health with no consideration for how individual molecules react to, for example, metabolism based on intake of a plant based whole foods diet."
39,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62545863-jonathan,4,"8/10It sounds strange to say, given that he died before I was born, but I miss Feynman. He had the ability to convey complex knowledge to the layman, (in other words, to communicate effectively cross-discipline) in a way that has seldom been done before, and in my opinion, has not been done since. It seems he has left a gap in the scientific community, for no one has come forward to take on his mantle, that of the genuinely curious, non pretentious, and passionate scientist, eager to share his passion with the world. Tyson has, in his own way, attempted to take on some of this, as has Nye, but neither are able to communicate in the self effacing, casual manner that Feynman always seemed to exude. Their really is no one else I could listen to longer about subjects that I tend to find boring and just beyond my grasp. As far as this specific work, its an excellent introduction to many basic laws of our universe, and similar to the rest of Feynman's material (that I've read anyway), I would certainly recommend it. "

The Mayans were able to calculate with great precision predictions, for example, for eclipses and position of the moon in the sky, the position of Venus, etc. It was all done by arithmetic. They counted a certain number and subtracted some numbers, and so on. There was no discussion of what the moon was. There was no discussion even if the idea that it went around. The just calculated the time when there would be an eclipse, or when the moon would rise at the full, and so on. Suppose that a young man went to the astronomer and said ‘I have an idea. Maybe those things are going around, and there are balls of rocks out there, and we could calculate how they move in a completely different way Algren just calculating what time they appear in the sky’.”"

I found the volume to be too light actually, as I felt that everything was indeed aimed at a reader who has a very low foundation in science. Surprisingly, this was mentioned even by the author himself; he discussed the many readers' futile endeavour to learn about science via reading popular science books, and I do agree with his premise that one cannot learn much from such books. Hence my take-home message is that unless I greatly enjoy reading popular science books on physics, I will not read them. And I do want to learn more, I will rather study physics from a high school to university level in my free time with proper textbooks.Not recommended to those who have already read his Six Easy Pieces: Essentials of Physics By Its Most Brilliant Teacher  - he repeats himself often. Recommended to readers who would like to see how Mr Feynman introduces the general audience to the enthralling beauty of physics.

Feynman talks about what laws of physics look like, how our understanding of them changes over time, how they relate to one another, and how they are discovered. One of the rare popular science books that left me feeling I wanted just a bit more meat - for example, I'd have liked to get a better sense of how the conservation laws can be derived from basic symmetries (I remember reading an explanation of this in another book some years ago but I can't remember which one).The text is derived from a series of public lectures and this gives it a quirky conversational style that helps to bring out the character of the author, making the book much more interesting and fun than a normal exposition would be. I found myself imagining Feynman talking and waving his hands in front of a blackboard diagram as I read the text. Strongly recommended."

Feynmann has a gift for teaching. Both his precise, yet uncluttered, diction and his ability to set up a thought experiment contribute to a nice new way of looking."

He doesn't just ""translate"" the science to the layman - like so many writers who bring science to the masses - and in fact he thinks that such a translation isn't possible. Instead, Feynman gives the ultimately compelling argument that we CANNOT understand the world in any real and engaging way without comprehending the mathematics and science that underlie the natural laws of the universe. What's more, he gives little shortcuts for ways to apply the mathematical lens, and he does it in a hilarious way. Amazing book."

Feynman achieves what most of should attempt to aspire to--both mathematical and intuitive insights to physical law. While few can or should compare themselves to the illustrious professor Feynman-- what we learn is that our passionate pursuit of science can fulfill an intellectual and spiritual need. A need to be one with the physical laws of the Universe. While the book is older -- it is still relevant.

The chapters are not intended to be written for a book, but still keeps you engaging in true Feynmen style. The theme of each chapter is interesting and touches most of the concepts of physics at the time. This is a must read if you have not read the famous The Feynman Lectures on Physics, as it covers a lot of ideas compressed across 7 chapters. "

It's the first book I've read that made the theory of relativity clear to me, which reflects on its main strength and weakness: this book is not for scientists. If you're looking for an in-depth explanation of any phenomena here, you're barking up the wrong tree. The focus is on how we arrive at the physical laws and how the laws interact to form the universe we know, not applications to specific examples and certainly not on any of the math involved.This is all well and good, but it is a dry read. For as much emphasis as it places on avoiding scientific nitty-gritty, there isn't much to take its place. Sagan's Cosmos takes this approach as well, but it executed it better by framing itself as the story of science, which makes it a compelling read because we as humans naturally want to know the conclusion of a given chronology. As this was a transcription of a lecture, I imagine much of the original experience was lost.What the book does well is to challenge the reader's assumptions about science, scientists, and the world around them, and encourages the reader to think about things in a new way. Of particular note was a section in which Feynman hypothesized how a dialogue with an alien species might transpire if we were attempting to describe human anatomy to them. The things that we can take for granted may not apply (for instance, the right-handed spiral of DNA could just as easily be left-handed in another race).Feynman's overarching views on the subject, it seems, can be summed up by the last line (no spoliers, don't worry), ""nature has a simplicity and therefore a great beauty,"" referring to his theory of what laws we will ultimately find are true of the world. I, for one, believe he's right. Now, young scientists of the world, go figure out that unified Theory of Everything already!"

Velocity is direction + speed, right? So, I understand that a change in direction could be toward the Sun. But how could a change in speed have a direction? It's either positive or negative. There MUST be simpler way to say what he's saying.Or how about later on p. 20: ""...and if you figure out how far it [the Moon] goes in one second you can figure out how far the circle of the moon's orbit has fallen below the straight line that it would have been in if it did not go the way it does go.""

These lectures were recorded by the BBC and subsequently edited to form the basis of this work. Topics included the law of gravitation (time and space), the great conservation principles (energy, charge, angular momentum, etc.), symmetry of physical laws, and quantum mechanics. I found the chapter on quantum mechanics, specifically Feynman’s description of the famous “double-slit” experiment, to be of most interest. His use of “analogy and contrast” utilizing bullets (for particles), water (for waves), and electrons (both particles and waves) to describe experimental findings was truly enlightening. Feynman concluded by demonstrating the impossibility of detecting the position of an electron without perturbing (changing the effect) experimental results – the essence of Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle. Feynman was obviously a scientific genius, however he was also pure genius at being able to convey complex concepts in an understandable, even light-hearted manner. This is a more technical work than “Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!,” but quite accessible to the interested scientific lay person. This reader derived an enhanced sense of awe that “nature has a simplicity and therefore a great beauty.”"
84,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4408725-catherine,3,"A short and sweet collection of lectures Feynman gave at Cornell in the sixties, this is a great read for anyone who's never read Feynman before. He clearly loves teaching and talking about physics; he is adept at explaining both the mathematical details and laws as well as the implications of these laws (if any) on our daily experience. He has a manner of looking at physical laws from different points of view, which makes the reader's engagement with them quite different; for example, he describes how observations in astronomy and the Renaissance-era advancements in physics collided beautifully to produce a set of laws around gravitation. In finer detail, in describing how the planets and the sun move around the sun, he allows you to imagine being the sun and the planets. I think that contemporary physicist-writers like Brian Greene and Lisa Randall (both of whom I had read first before Feynman) owe a great deal to Feynman in terms of adopting/adapting his conversational writing style, aimed at a rather wide audience."
85,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10756619-muthu,3,"The first remarkable feat of this collection of Feyman's lectures is, he has provided a treatment of the classical laws for people with minimal mathematical background. He would talk about an analogy that you are familiar with and then extend that on to a more general principle. For instance through the double slit experiment which we learned in high school, he explains the dual nature of light, which to me was the simplest explanation of Heisenberg's uncertainty. (But who am I kidding, That was probably the first time I thought about Heisenberg after I finished college). There is so much optimism in him when he talks about the quest for new theories. Some of the examples that he provides are redundant and you can guess in what context he is going to use it, even before he says it. It is probably due to the nature of the source material. (The book is actually a transcript of his classroom lectures). "
86,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876605-kam-yung-soh,4,"A good collection of lectures given by Feynman on the character of science and the search for the laws of physics. One can only wish to be present at the actual lectures to catch a glimpse of the actual Feynman behind the words.The book acts as a good introduction into what makes up the laws of physics and what physicists actually do to discover them. Many might be shocked to discover that instead of methodical and step-by-step research, laws may be 'guessed' via intuition but Feynman emphasises that all laws must have a basis in reality and be falsifiable; a point often missed by those who want to disprove scientific laws.Still relevant after all these years, Feynman closes by looking at what is in store for the future in the search for more fundamental laws of physics. And even now, that search has not ended."

Well I did the both of the things. This book is the textual version of the Messenger Lecture that Feynman delivered in 1964 at Cornell University.I didn't want to rate this book but finally I decided to do this anyway. Feynman as a witty prodigy we know of delivered his speech in the same way he's known of. This lecture series covers not all the aspects that shapes our universe but tries to do so by explaining what should be named fundamental laws, the requisites of Physics being mathematics to understand the beauty that equations holds and such and such- and such and such- that is what Feynman likes to call. For those of you, who want to do real science and be cautious and take risks at the same time I recommend to watch this lecture"

It is told simply enough that anyone who did well in high school can understand 95% of it. Feynman has a great talent for making things as simple as possible. He uses a few well-chosen concrete examples to demonstrate more general principles (such as conservation), illustrate methods of making discoveries, and show how Physics is related to Mathematics.Recommended for anyone with the slightest interest in Physics and should be read by every intelligent person who believes science is a collection of facts, rather than a process of making ever better guesses about nature.Feynman shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics."
89,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1115629-aaron,4,"This is a good second read if you picked up Five Easy Pieces.The title is carefully chosen: Feynman gives us a guide through physics and points out the general character of the laws we've discovered. How does the universe act, generally? Why would that be?With reference to concrete discoveries we get to ask the meta questions. It turns out that beside the predictable things in the universe, there are fantastic, incomprensible weirdnesses, things that have no reason to work.One such quote: ""I find it amazing that mathematics can predict what an atom will do. Mathematics has nothing in common with an actual atom. Why should maths correlate to the universe?"""

I am not so sure that Feynman was second. Clear thinking is rare. All of the Feynman authored books that I have encountered are examples of crystal clear thinking, massive intellectual honestly, and hard practicality. So rare. So wonderful."

Comparing different representations of the same law. Dealing with experimental data. The strangeness of Quantum Mechanics -- as Feynman points out, nobody really understands it.

On the other hand, it's pretty simple for someone w/ a physics/engineering background. BUT, it makes you think about some of the cool fundamental shit going down - minus the fact that this is like 50 years old. For example, it'd be nice if it touched on the Higgs boson, etc.Feynman has a talent for describing physics.

Based on my background in science, I could follow, but it took more work. I found the discussion of the philosophy the most interesting. This book is almost 50 years old, and so much has happened in physics. However, this look for a renowned physicist at how you get there, is what makes this book still worth reading.

At times, for a layman such as me, I found it tricky to follow but Feynman, while losing me intellectually still held my interest, usually by the end of a lecture I had a good general understanding which is all that I ask of a book like this. His style is nice and clean, not cluttered with unnecessary jargon and often he makes the complicated seem simple, especially through his deployment of clever analogies which make you go ""hang on, it's that simple?""."

Although it was first published in 1965 the theoretical physics and maths he ponders is timeless.His down to earth style in exploring questions such as ""what is gravity"" and why mathematical formulae that can describe, but not explain it, is exhilarating, as are passages on the nature of time and quantum behaviour.Stunning."

152,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36609786-charles-frode,5,"Just hold this book, peruse it, read something here and there. It is dense, but you will enjoy the clarity and challenge or reading one of the most profound physicists ever."
153,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16596553-marta,0,I can't really rate this because it isn't the type of book I am used to read. anyway it was interesting even if it was for school.
154,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11728359-kubap,5,This is so amazing stuff - it always blows my mind away even if I barely scratch the surface. 
155,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38548987-sara,5,"Really a sui generis overview of gravitational theory, without the math. It's readable for the patient and interested layman."
156,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20728189-nando,5,"A great transcript. All lectures are enlightening, especially the last two: 'Probability and Uncertainty' and 'Seeking New Laws'."
157,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23776640-dave-collins,4,"Pretty good, brief explanation of the the fundamental physical laws for the layman. Funny and eccentric. "
158,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52765765-steve-whiting,3,"Feynman explains well, as he always does, but there's a a fair bit of material that was already covered in ""6 easy pieces"". Unsurprisingly, it's also well out of date in some places."
159,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34848892-martin-v,4,Feynman's writing is engaging as always. This book is relatively accessible to non-scientists. 
160,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49545432-michael-bates,5,"Great book in the truly great teaching style of Feynman. Anyone who has a love for science and a love for good books, this is a must read. "
161,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/360965-kris,5,You only wish textbooks were this lucid and succinct.
162,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3321431-kadri,5,Interesting and entertaining look into the laws of physics in general
163,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67663356-nofar-spalter,5,"Very difficult concepts discussed in the usual Feynman style, with good analogies, patience and a little bit of humour. Not an easy read, but worth the effort."
164,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63205826-nicol-s,4,Fascinating for a physics student
165,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3213687-chrisgarrod,0,Second reading was more meaningful than my first
166,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17470030-s-milford,5,Brilliant and especially understandable for non-technical science enthusiasts.
167,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5503425-ken-wang,4,"Not as insightful as I'd hoped, but was still an interesting read."
168,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16410168-robert,3,I Love Feynman
169,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37138326-yves,4,read it in French when in highschool ; liked it at the time.
170,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52268212-anna,3,Feynman uses some good everyday analogies to describe the laws of physics. Fun read.
171,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5254180-atti,5,I cannot give Feynman anything less than 5 stars :)
172,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5997618-bill-phelps,0,"It is such a shame that Feynman died before I began attending college. Feynman did a wonderful job explaining many of the fundamental problems associated with Physics in this book. His prose style is down to earth, and he broke down concepts into easy to process chunks, that dig into the heart of what makes up looking at inquiry in physics. He had a wonderful sense of lightness in humor. I recommend watching these lectures in their video format just to see how his personality shines through in the words of this series of lectures. Although some of the issues that he looked at in this book were still in their infancy in 1965, when the book was initially written, this text and the lectures that contains is a good introduction to what it means to think like a physicist. I can see though this book how he earned the title of ""The Great Explainer."""
173,0679601279,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59728931-misha-behersky,5,We know almost nothing about the Universe. But discovering new laws is the process that should be done in a certain way. Best practices and insights are given for a clever approach and you can look at how nature works from the perspective of a great physicist.
