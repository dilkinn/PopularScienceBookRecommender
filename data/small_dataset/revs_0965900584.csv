0,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,5,"I like to talk shit about science sometimes. Sometimes it's just to push people's buttons and other times it's because of the pop side of science is ridiculous (you know like the studies that get quoted on your web-browsers start-up page, which may even be contradicted a few days from now by some other article, or all those fucking pharmaceutical ad's on TV. Hey, thanks Pfizer for helping make me a drug addict!). I just made a slight at pop-science and that is hypocritical of me, it's really the only type of science I can understand and this book basically falls into that category, it's a watered down version of real science so humanities idiots like me can understand concepts that they would stare open mouthed at if they had to read the actual articles about. By the way, I loved this book! Starting with a seemingly simple problem (or I would think it's simple, but it took a few hundred years and Einstein to adequately understand it, apparently (not that I could figure it out) about why the water in a bucket pushes up against the side of the bucket when you spin the bucket around really fast, Brian Green creates a narrative (I'm using this in it's normal manner, not in the science as narrative way that I use it when I want to piss people off, this book is a history of science book in quite a few ways) that shows how this bucket filled with some water paved the way for Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Uncertainty, the Big Bang, String Theory, M-Theory, Branes and other concepts that helped move forward theoretical understandings of the whole universe. Oh, actually the underlying theme to the book is how do we understand the concepts of space and time, or spacetime, which is one of the problems of understanding why the water in the bucket does what it does when it is spun around. Oh, did I mention I loved this book? I feel awkward giving it five stars because I lack the critical acumen to know if Brian Green is really telling the whole story, or if there is a huge bias here because I'm an idiot when it comes to matters like this. I felt like he was being fair though but maybe I was just dazzled by any of the mathematics he would throw into footnotes that I wouldn't have the first idea on what to do with if someone handed me even the simplest one and asked me to solve it. About a hundred pages into the book I had the realization that I should have been more interested in math and science growing up. More exactly I had the realization that the way math and science were taught in the schools I attended did nothing to inspire me at all. I'm fairly certain that most people never use most of the information they learn in science classes. I've never had the need to know all the parts of a flower, but if I had been taught something about what went into discovering some of the biology of (x) or say about the real awesomeness of evolution I'd probably have perked up and gotten interested. Or maybe learned about the difficulties still facing scientists when dealing with the subatomic level, and the weirdness of quantum uncertainty and entanglement might have gotten me more interested and wanting to know more in a chemistry class than endlessly learning how to balance electrons between elements (or whatever that fruitless exercise was called). I know these details are really important to doing science, but without any reason to care about wanting to know about science this is all just monumental busy work. Shouldn't it be the job of schools to get kids to care and wanting to learn rather than forcing meaningless facts onto them? This rantish aside about the misguided importance (pedological approach?) of science education in American schools was just me being bitter. It's too late now, and I'm too dumb in too many areas of knowledge but I should have been a theoretical physicist. That is what I realized reading this book. I wish someone had told me about the weird shit these people try to figure out, explained who Parmenides was and the basic gist of his Poem was, and then told me I could work on these problems for the rest of my life if I started to pay attention in math class and gave a shit about my science classes, that there was cool stuff I'd get to later on. Parmenides is never mentioned in this book, but at almost every step through the book he kept popping into my mind. He's my reoccurring fascination. His idea of the everything just being One at first glance is so silly. I remember the first time reading Zeno's Paradoxes (he was Parmenides student) and thinking they were just silly games with words, obviously something moves faster than something else and can over come it. Obviously an arrow shot at a target eventually hits it. Duh! But sometime soon after my immediate annoyance at these kinds of meaningless games something clicked in me and I started to try to think through what Parmenides could mean by the whole universe being an unchanging, undivisible, timeless thing. A point, if you would. On one level Parmenides can be thought of as the logical foil to the pre-Socratic materialists, the voice that says your theory is nice but what about (x)? I don't buy into the idea that was Parmenides only goal though. Unfortunately it's pretty much impossible to know exactly what Parmenides thought, because of thanks to those motherfucking Christians and Moslems (you know for their multiple burnings of the Library of Alexandria (and Christians for their wanton destruction of 'heretical' literature) we have only a scant few fragments left from Parmenides work, and most of it is second hand from the post-Socratic arch-materialist Aristotle (materialist meaning something sort of different in the Ancient Greek sense than one would think of a materialist today). Are you bored yet?Anyway, back to Parmenides, I don't buy the idea that his role was only as foil, or goad to the materialists to make their theories more logically consistent. Why? Because of Plato. Socrates is bested only twice in the dialogues. First as a young man by Parmenides of Elea (the guy I've been writing about) in Parmenides and second by the Eleatic Stranger in The Sophist and The Statesman (these two dialogues are like a part one and part two to each other). The appearance of the Eleatic Stranger is in the two dialogues that come at the end of Socrates life, before the series of dialogues that make up the trial and death of Socrates. In both instances Socrates is bested in his arguments by the philosophy coming from Elea. Why? Why is the only person who Plato allows to give Socrates a philosophical beat-down either Parmenides or a stand in for him? (Parmenides himself couldn't be in a chronologically later dialogue, since he was an old man when Socrates was a youth). Anyway, long story that doesn't mean too much to anyone probably, but to sum it up Parmenides has been an thought game for me for years now, and many of the ideas that I've had to reconcile what Parmenides means I find in this fucking book, there are people who are seriously considering some of the logical games I play in my head about cosmology, but they have math and ways of actually coming up with answers! I haven't done a good job at it, but to me this is so exciting. It's like all of the crazy shit that philosophers have thought up over the years can be actually studied and not just argued about using a mismash of concepts and logic, but possibly measured and articulated with math and shit! This book is like a validation to the stuff I think about when I'm not just wallowing in self-pity or being sad. Of course, I knew that a lot of this stuff existed before reading this book, but I had no idea what any of it really meant. I just took the words and applied common meanings to them. String Theory? Oh, everything is interconnected with vibrating strings. Actually, no. That's not what String Theory means. Multi-dimensions, you mean like people could be living in a dimension almost on top of me that I don't see because I don't have access to those dimensions, but one day maybe we could, right? No, actually even if the dimensions are big, the word big is being used on a microscopic scale, like the width of a piece of hair big, as opposed to small as in so small we have nothing that can see it. I realized that most of the ways books in the new age section use science terms to validate their ideas and how they claim to be drawing on cutting edge research is bullshit, that they are just picking terms out and using them in ways to sell books on hokum. I realized reading this book that I wish I wasn't so stupid and that I could at least understand this stuff at more than in a non-technical watered down way."
1,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"Did you know that Schrödinger’s equation is a perfect anagram of “A Second Herring Quits”? And is a near perfect anagram of “Surely someone’s taking the piss”? The second anagram relies, of course (and almost entirely), on a rather judicious application of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle – but I do think that one may be more illuminating of how I’m finding some of the quantum mechanical experiments described in this book. There is part of me that would like to believe that in the early part of the last century (I don’t remember the year, but surely on an April First) a group of European physicists got together and decided to come up with an idea so monumentally ridiculous that it would have them chuckling at the gullibility of we more mathematically challenged for years to come. Einstein was in on the joke at the start, but ended up thinking it had all gone on for far too long. Frynman introduced some slapstick into the equations (in a fine American tradition) – but, as always, it takes an Irishman (John Bell) to put the final touches on the comedy and to make it truly surreal. So, why isn’t anybody laughing?If you are not disturbed by the findings of Quantum Mechanics, well, you’re really not trying hard enough. This is quite some book so far.UpdateOkay, I’ve finished and I’ve had problems with this one. In fact, I have many problems with modern physics and believe that the only way I could really understand it more would be to go back and finish off a degree in this stuff. Since I’m unlikely to do that, I am going to have to accept that this stuff will have to remain a mystery to me. This guy really does try to make this stuff accessible, but I’ve a feeling that without the maths it just does not make any sense on any level.My problem is exacerbated by the fact that it seems that every time there is a problem in Physics we are having trouble solving we just make up something invisible to solve it. Universe not expanding fast enough? Stuff it full of dark matter. Expanding too fast? Bring back the Cosmological Constant. Can’t make gravity fit in with quantum theory? Postulate string theory. Having trouble with quantum theory? Why not create an infinite number of universes that can’t access each other. Having trouble explaining the vibrations of one dimensional strings? Vibrate them in 11 dimensional space.Bring back the Ether, I say. Physics never seems to do anything by half. Even cosmic inflation seems to have inflated the universe to a ridiculous extent in the first nanosecond of the universe.I don’t believe I can really say anything sensible about any of this stuff. It is so far divorced from my limited understanding that to express an opinion really just makes me feel incredibly ignorant. Like I said, I’m not prepared to learn the maths, so I should just shut up. It is a pity physics has become so esoteric – I would like to be one of its great defenders, to use it as a basis to understand the universe, but I come away from these books feeling someone is having me on.This is a good book, in part. Some of it is still remarkably hard going – even with the allusions to the Simpsons and X Files (I’ve never seen the X Files or some of the other bits of pop culture mentioned, so that made what I took to be some of the jokes quite inaccessible to me – but that will just be me). The stuff about Newton’s Bucket was utterly fascinating and well worth reading. The stuff of string theory was like most stuff on string theory – I’ve virtually no understanding of this stuff and can’t quite follow the controversy that surrounds it. Anyway, it sounds like no one will ever be able to test any of this stuff – if we can’t see an electron how the hell are we ever going to see a one dimensional string?My main problem with this book was his early explanation of entropy and how this did not provide an arrow of time. He says that if you watch a film of an egg falling and braking that you could reverse the film and there is nothing in the laws of physics to decide which direction the film travelled in that must be the right direction. He says that there would be a way to get all the bits of egg to fly back at the right speed and reconstitute. This, of course, is nonsense. It is not a matter of things coming back together at the right speed that is the issue. Have you ever broken a glass? You don’t get the pieces to go back together again by moving them together at the ‘right speed’. They never go back together again. This is a one way reaction. Why? Because once the glass is broken the bonds between the atoms in the glass are broken. Pushing the pieces together again is pushing negatively charged electrons against negatively charged electrons and they will repeal each other, not just nicely bond. There are laws of physics and laws of chemistry that do not allow this reversal. I figure that if I have spotted a flaw in this easy bit of his argument there are too many bits of this argument that I struggled to follow that may be just as equally flawed. (This stuff is from about page 145 – 169)I did learn some interesting stuff from this book – even about entropy. I had no idea that the arrow of entropy was double headed or that inflation was the main cause of order in the young universe. But large parts of this book deal with questions that are simply too esoteric. I ended up knowing that I would never know what was in a black hole or what caused the big bang and basically not really caring. I’m sure this wasn’t Greene’s intention, more is the pity."
2,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,5,"Wow, what a wonderful book. What a ride it was. Brian is definitely one of the best science popularisers about, hands down. It is amazing how he manages to convey potentially complex subjects, such as quantum mechanics and relativity, in a simple but at the same time rigorous manner. And he does that with a contagious enthusiasm which reminded to me why I love physics. I also greatly appreciated the fact that he never gets into the game (like so frequently happens in popular science books, unfortunately) of oversimplifying the subject. His book is very readable and he has a great gift of explaining complex subjects with an amazing clarity. While the book may be a bit too simple at times, more quantitative detail is available in the notes at the end of the book (which I strongly recommend you read, to get more detail), and bibliographic references are pretty good. It is a fantastic introductory book to the realm of contemporary physics - of course, if you are interested in more quantitative treatments of such subjects, then this is probably not the book for you - although I must say that everybody with an interest in science should really take the time to read this masterpiece. The author, being a foremost scientist directly involved in the most advanced research efforts in areas such as String Theory, does have his own preferences and biases (all honestly acknowledged by him, and also they do not impact the overall objectivity and impartiality of his book). Moreover, being particle physics an area of such intense and frantic development, there are a couple of area where the book looks a bit dated (for example, even if SUSY is not officially dead, the results coming out of the LHC are such that there is increasing doubt over the real prospects of SUSY and consequently of Super String Theories - although it is completely premature to claim that they are dead).Overall, it is an amazing introductory book, informative, entertaining, lucid, and a complete pleasure to read.

3,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28709846-manuel-ant-o,2,"If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.Going Overboard: ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene(original review, 2004)""Within each individual [time] slice, your thoughts and memories are sufficiently rich to yield a sense that time has continuously flowed to that moment. This feeling, this sensation that time is flowing, doesn't require previous moments—previous frames—to be ""sequentially illuminated.""﻿In ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian GreeneI agree that this is at least as much philosophy as science, though mathematically based philosophy. But what irks me is that for all the pages of science books devoted to this subject, no one has pointed out that for us to experience moments sequentially (assuming those moments don't themselves move) our mind has to move through those moments. And movement entails time. So while time may be a spatial dimension, if Greene (and Godel, etc.) are right, then there must be at least one other dimension of time that allows our minds to move through the different moments that all exist and experience them sequentially.﻿"
4,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21675244-stian,3,"Let's start with the positives: Greene does an excellent job of explaining very hard-to-understand concepts in non-mathematical ways. That said, I think it was unecessary to use popular culture the way he did. It feels silly, reading about Einstein and general relativity and getting an example which uses the Kwik-E-Mart, Bart, and Lisa and so forth. But okay, I admit that this is a fairly small detail that shouldn't take too much away from the overall experience. The important thing is that the concepts are explained in a manner which is understandable. Does Greene do that? He does, for the most part.Furthermore, Greene is obviously passionate about the subject matter, and that is something that is contagious. Reading about the bucket argument (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_a...) and the various attempts at answering it; the exciting exploration of time, the arrow of time, and its mysteries; the exhilarating explanation of entropy; the outline of general relativity, quantum mechanics and a whole host of other physical theories, and on the whole Greene's passionate way of writing makes this an extremely engaging read. And the subject matter is interesting. I mean, the bending of space and time, particles being ""entangled"" (""spooky action at a distance"") through space, possible hidden dimensions, elusive particles, multiverses.. Paul Erdos said that ""if numbers aren't beautiful, I don't know what is."" Well, if this stuff isn't interesting, I don't know what is! Thus, overall, the book is extremely engaging and exciting, and it's one of those books that are very much, in many ways, unputdownable. Now, the negatives.First of all, the illustrations are almost no help, because they are of awful quality. I read the hardcover version, and even here they are small, with no colour and in fairly awful quality. Another problem with the book has been pointed out in this review as well, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show.... You get the impression that without the math, a lot of this just isn't really possible to convey properly. You are left with only a part of the picture. I'm reminded of Richard Feynman's words: ""To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature... If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in."" Sometimes Greene is pretty frank about this. He'll essentially write, ""okay, I know this is far-fetched, but trust me on this one: the math is right, guys."" To Greene's credit, there are a lot of pages in the back of the book devoted to the more mathematically inclined reader, so that those who do get it can check it out for themselves. Now, the last negative aspect of the book is the fact that there's not a whole lot of new things here. If you've read The Elegant Universe, you don't really get a whole lot of new knowledge, except that this book is less about string theory and more about cosmology. I think it's enough to read one of them, which kind of renders this book somewhat unecessary. With all those negatives aside, the book is enjoyable and engaging. If you want some stretching exercises for your imagination, it's not a mistake to pick it up."
5,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856764-kristen,0,"I GIVE UPYou win this round science book **(shakes fist in anger)**In fact, after reading this book I've given up on science completely in favor the Nabokovian theory of very young earth creationism: The World Was Created This Morning. ""Theoretically there is no absolute proof that one's awakening in the morning (the finding oneself again in the saddle of one's personality) is not really a quite unprecedented event, a perfectly original birth."" Yeah, that does make a bit more sense than most of this book. . . . I'm starting to wish I never listed this here because if I hadn't I could give up without feeling so bad (or anyone knowing). It's not that he's a bad writer it's just that I'm not that smart, but I suppose we all have own unique talents, right? Sure, Brian Greene might understand physics but can he roll a joint while driving his car with his knee? . . . so yeah, I got that going for me at-least . . . That's something, right?"
6,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,4,"You probably know more about physics than you think. See, right there, when your brain registered the p-word, a black hole of anxiety opened up in the pit of your stomach from which nothing can escape. Your underarms began to radiate heat as your mind conjured memories of stuffy high school laboratories. And as your eyes scanned ahead for those dreaded half-English, half-Greek words followed by an equal sign, the probability of you reading on fast approached zero.But there’s hope! Whether you realize it or not, you just visualized some of the more important natural phenomena that govern the world around us. The stomachache was space-time curvature at a point of infinite density. The sweating was a crass simulation of something known as black body radiation. And your waning interest was a metaphor for quantum non-locality. What do these words mean? It doesn’t really matter. Even complicated physical processes were surmountable — even understandable — when they were put into the context of something familiar, say, traumatic experiences of young adulthood.Without analogy and metaphor, a reader can quickly suffocate in the rarified air of the hard sciences. The task then for any science writer is to couch these concepts in colloquial terms and familiar experiences, and no one does it better than Brian Greene. His second of two books, The Fabric of the Cosmos, is a potent distillation of 200 years of discovery and an invaluable roadmap of reality that is almost impossible to get lost with, regardless of your level of scientific knowledge. It is a compelling narrative of the search for understanding that probes the boundaries of human experience. Greene, a professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University, is not the first to attempt such a crash course in physics history and experiment for the non-science minded, and he won’t be the last. In fact, the popularity of this breed of book has even necessitated its own genre, which has come to be known as pop-physics. Make no mistake; it is truly a difficult task to make the revolutionary ideas of hundreds of brilliant people not only digestible, but palatable in fewer than 500 pages. Since you can’t change the elements of the story — an exhaustive historical record of dozens of collaborating countries — good science writing then becomes an exercise in conversational skills, patient instruction and plenty of examples.Greene is adept at all three but his skillful employment of examples is one of the book’s greatest strengths. Throughout the text, he uses objects we experience and protagonists we can visualize to illustrate his points. The Simpsons characters, Mulder and Scully from the X-Files, and former President Bill Clinton all appear on multiple occasions and eggs, snowflakes and bowling balls all serve as props. As juvenile as this might seem, you would be surprised at how effective Greene’s methods are. At one point in the book, he tries to explain how something called the Higgs ocean — typically the focus of a Ph.D. thesis — may give particles like protons and electrons their mass. But he uses a very familiar and somewhat playful example to illustrate the point. “If [a particle] has greater difficulty accelerating through the Higgs ocean, it has a greater mass. If we liken a particle’s mass to a person’s fame, then the Higgs ocean is like the paparazzi: those who are unknown pass through the swarming photographers with ease, but famous politicians and movie stars have to push much harder to reach their destination.”While this technique of using vivid examples seems straight forward, it is actually very easy to mess up and there are a few cardinal sins that many physics authors commit. A common transgression is to sacrifice accuracy for sensationalism under the misconception that science fiction is the only way to engage the average reader. The very talented Michio Kaku of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton (the same place Einstein spent the last few decades of his life) is a repeat offender. His most recent work of pop-physics, called Hyperspace, contains examples that are shamelessly unscientific at times and really underestimate the reader’s intelligence.But by no means does Greene dumb down the information in Fabric and yet, none of the underlying ideas are lost. Further, he doesn’t resort to sensationalized hypothetical situations but instead finds a creative way to make the reader appreciate real scientific results. In doing so, he makes it more than understandable. He makes the reader appreciate and even enjoy the excitement of discovery.And if Greene’s delivery of concepts is superb, his thoughtful selection of content only reinforces the readability of the text. The fundamental — and most impressive — difference between Greene and most other science writers is the breadth of the issues he addresses. Another cardinal sin for a science writer is to allow a topic’s complexity to dictate its relevance, which is just a cop out and a disservice to the reader. Gary Zukov, the author of The Dancing Wu Li Masters, basically left out entire chapters of vital experimental findings because they were too tough to couch in human experience. But Greene doesn’t succumb to such temptations of writing around difficult material. He acknowledges the complexity of problematic topics and painstakingly walks the reader through the material every time.Unfortunately, some concepts will be beyond analogy and word craft and require at least a cursory digression of technicalities. As Greene puts it: “Human language is far better at capturing human experience than at expressing deep physical laws.” But what is unique about Fabric is that Greene gives the reader the option to get more technical without a loss of continuity. Throughout the text, he would broach a huge topic by putting it into historical context and discussing its relevance in the big physics picture. Often, the section would end with an ultimatum: keep reading to explore the details for a deeper understanding or skip to the next chapter with at least these implications in mind. This “choose your own adventure” organization gives the book a refreshing flexibility that is too often absent from pop-physics novels.Writing style also plays a large role in this work’s success. Richard Feynman, one of the more beloved albeit quirky physicists of the 20th century, was famous for his conversational style physics lessons. Though this made Feynman an incredibly effective educator, he was never able to write a book for want of literary chops. Fabric is such a good read because Greene buttresses the same savvy teaching techniques with an eloquent style of storytelling. Some parts are downright poetic and they uncover the easily missed romance and excitement of scientific discovery. He writes, “By deepening our understanding of the true nature of physical reality, we profoundly reconfigure our sense of ourselves and our experience of the universe.” And other parts are surprisingly suspenseful, especially for a narrative with such well-publicized plot twists. Even though most people know that Albert Einstein would propose his groundbreaking theories of relativity in the early 1900s, until Greene gets to that part of the story, this reader was genuinely concerned about the troublesome relationship between absolute space and time. (Spoiler: It all works out beautifully!)One of the more striking features of The Fabric of the Cosmos is how Greene’s enthusiasm for modern physics almost leaps off the page, making the reader wonder, if only for a second, whether or not the Large Hadron Collider will actually produce spontaneous symmetry breaking of massive scalar bosons. But that’s beside the point. To wonder about the world around us is the first step on the path to scientific discovery and Greene’s work makes it so that anyone can find the way."

Get me into anything more than general commentary, discoveries, famous names and famous theories, and I'm completely at a loss. Green is a likable and passionate author, but for readers without a physics knowledge base, his little treatise is tough going, even with all the Simpsons references. I remember the most important concepts, but the intricacies didn't stick with me. This book is best read in segments, preferably when you're completely lucid and can take notes. "
8,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17463213-j-m-hushour,5,"Being utterly unscientific (I still believe toasters toast toast by invoking thrice the name of said bread and summoning forth a kind of crisping deity), I pounce on shit for the lay reader. Sacks, Sagan, Ramachandran, Richard Simmons, etc. I had never heard of Brian Greene and have typically held physics and such things at arm's length, with my other hand pinching my nose shut as if holding the world's most curious diaper: there is probably much of interest within to parse out, but noxious enough to keep me anyway. This book was recommended to me (okay, it was a present) by a friend who seems to be aware of my constant questioning of the nature of the very fabric of reality itself. Luckily, this book squares a lot of things and sets them to rights for me.Greene is an awesome writer. He's funny and he describes this complicated shizz really well (he likes to make Simpsons analogies). There are few parts that are mind-bending to the point where I got a headache. Greene will outright warn you to skip ahead if its getting too dense, which is nice.As to the actual content? Fuck, it sounds like he knows what he's talking about. I'll just say, I came out of the book feeling and sounding smarter. I can rap about three-branes, the Many Worlds hypothesis and impress my friends with my knowledge of the eleven spacetime dimensions.All-in-all, satisfying, funny, and informative."
9,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,1,"Bad book. I was looking forward to learning about cosmos themed science, something I never learned about in school. This book was not the answer to my acquisition of knowledge. In fact, I learned almost nothing from this book. The writing is awful. It seeks to explain through dense prose, repetitive text, asinine pop references and endless in text questions. It really just shows why science writers should write books for the general public, not most scientists. Further, the author is in love with his superstring research and theory, but never convinced me it actually exists. All in all, it’s hard for me to express my disgust with this book. At least my nightmare and dread of reading on with this book have come to an end. I will never read this author again and may just avoid cosmos and superstring science if there’s no better work out there. "
10,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,5,"Glancing at the reviews for Brian Greene's overview of how we view the stuff of which our universe is made, it seems that some people base their rating and opinion on how much they agree with the science, or how credible they find it. While I have read a fair few popular science books – especially in the areas of physics and cosmology, areas I find utterly fascinating and about which I am perplexed that anyone can not be astounded and beguiled – I have to assume that I am reading a fair explanation of facts and theories. That is not to say that I assume the author is more knowledgeable than me simply because he has more letters after his name, but because he grounds his claims with background and the weight of evidence that is needed for a scientific hypothesis to become a generally accepted theory. Also, I have taken the effort to educate myself in these areas so have enough grounding myself to be able to appreciate the arguments.That said, for much of this book I'm unsure how much background would be needed to understand the explanations. Greene writes with a clarity and readability which is all too rare in any field, and is particularly welcome in discussing such big ideas. As in Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design, Greene completely dispenses with calculations but, unlike Hawking, he also tries to keep the use of metaphor to a minimum. It cannot, of course, be dispensed with completely – metaphors are an extraordinarily powerful descriptive tool, especially in a field that can only properly be explained and understood using specialist mathematics – but for the most part Greene simply gives an overview of each field in historical context, and explains WHY it is important, what it explains and why it works.He starts – as modern physics in so many fields must – with Isaac Newton, and particularly Newton's Bucket. If you hang a bucket of water on a rope and twist the rope, as the rope unwinds, spinning the bucket, at first the water remains stationary until the friction of the bucket's movement makes the water begin to spin. When it does, the surface becomes increasingly concave, moved outward by what why now call centripetal (or centrifugal) force. But what, asked Newton, is the water moving away from, or toward? What is it moving in relation to? He decided that it moved in relation to the fixed fabric of the cosmos, the stuff in which the matter (that he recognised as being the thing on which gravity works) sits. Recognising that he had no way of testing this medium by experiment, Newton took this is an immutable absolute and left it at that. Greene keeps returning to the bucket and its implications throughout the book, to superb explanatory effect.I won't go further into the details (read the book!), but simply say that thanks to Professor Greene I now understand areas of cosmology and physics where I had previously had to simply give in to brain cramp and accept as being true. I understand why the speed of light (actually, the speed of any electromagnetic radiation) is approx 300, 000 km/sec faster than you, no matter how fast you are travelling. I understand a whole lot more about General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, and why they make sense and are such powerful tools in describing our universe. I understand that Inflationary Theory is not merely a tweak of Big Bang theory to enable it to fit observed facts, but a whole new way of looking at the growth of the universe that actually explains much more about the fundamental physics.I'm not claiming a thorough understanding of these subjects (and in some, like Brane Theory, I still found myself rather lost; a re-read may be in order), but I feel that The Fabric of the Cosmos has deepened my comprehension of and appreciation for the wonders of our universe. And for the wonders of the human mind to work out these things. In around three hundred years we have developed this system, science, as a means of examining the world around us in a way which is comprehensible to anyone who is willing to put in the work. All books on science now seem to feel the need to restate this about science; it is NOT knowledge passed down from on high by men in white coats using deliberately obfuscatory language for reasons of either professional pride or conspiracy. Science is a method that enables us to understand more and more about the world, to revel in the joy of knowing how the rainbow is formed as well as in its simple beauty. No idea in science is sacrosanct, no theory is holy. To achieve the status of acceptance of say, General Relativity or Evolution by Natural Selection, a theory has to be tested – that is, it has to survive again and again and again the onslaught of people systematically trying to prove it wrong. When a weakness is found the theory must be re-examined. Sometimes the fault will cause the foundations of the theory to crumble, and it will be discarded; it has still served a purpose, to show how promising such an approach is. Sometimes finding the errors will strengthen a theory and teach us more – Edwin Hubble's original calculations of distant galaxies seemed to show the universe to be about 1.5 billion years old, despite lots of other evidence at the time insisting it was at least 3 billion years old (as we now know, this was still almost five times too conservative). Everything else about Hubble's observation and theory made sense, there was simply an error in calculating the distance of the super novae he was using to get the figures, a correction which itself taught us much about the universe.And this is incredibly important to realise because, while many theories, however much work they take, partly make sense on an intuitive level you get to Quantum and Brane theory and they simply cannot – in fact they seem, by intuition and everyday experience, utterly ridiculous (the great physicist Nils Bor said something along the lines of “if you think you understand Quantum Theory, you don't understand Quantum Theory”) but they are undoubtedly right. One important way a theory is tested is to use it to make predictions in the physical world and Quantum Theory has been called far and away the most successful predictive theory in science. It is, like every successful theory, one that accurately describes the way our universe works, with the limits of perception and understanding we have, which is why theories are modified or discarded when new information comes along. Which is why General Relativity replaced Newton's Laws of Gravitation as the best description we have for how gravity works – although NASA still use Newton's calculations most of the time, for the same reason you don't need to understand Gaussian Quadratic Maths to balance your chequebook.Greene's book, the first I've read by him, shows why it is worth reading a range of books on the same (or closely connected) areas of science. While in The Grand Design, Hawking and Mlodinov managed to convey a sense of wonder and discovery on a par with Carl Sagan's writings (a plaudit I don't throw around lightly!), Greene has given us a book that manages a clarity and depth of explanation while being a thoroughly entertaining read. At schools, perhaps instead of training our children into narrowly defined roles, science classes should just be introducing them to the works of Greene and Hawking, Sagan and Tyson (Neil deGrasse, not Mike) and Krauss to show them how huge and wonderful and beautiful the universe is, and how much joy and fulfilment can be achieved through our efforts to understand it."

I think Brian is fantastically gifted to explain esoteric and cutting-edge cosmological concepts without the use of formulae and maths. He says himself that he will only use metaphors to explain the ideas, but even so he remains respectful of his subject, he does not dumb things down, and I found the metaphors for the most part evocative and helpful. Towards the end of the book, however, the ideas get so far removed from human intuition that I would have wanted a little more formalism, perhaps. But - this was on offer as well! Brian adds a copious body of footnotes and in this way relegates a more rigorous discussion to the back of the book. This discussion will of course still not satisfy those who have an in-depth understanding of the science involved, but I don't think they are the target group of this book in the first place. To me, this was the best account of the current state (well, it's ten years old, but close enough) of cosmology I have read. The field appears to be so fast-moving that some of his statements in the later chapters have already been overtaken by reality, but there is a special charm in hearing Brian suggest that the LIGO experiment may demonstrate the existence of gravitational waves in decades to come when you know that this has already happened, much sooner than he thought. Equally, I felt a pang of regret when he expresses optimism that the LHC runs may find evidence of extra spatial dimensions soon after the upgrade to higher energies, knowing this has not happened yet, and scepticism is mounting that it ever will.Transcending what Brian was actually teaching me about the science, I also had an epiphany when I was reading the book. Brian talks at length about the shortcomings of the Big Bang theory, and explains how the theory of inflation may answer some of its more frustrating issues, such as the flatness problem. The flatness problem highlights the issue that a tiny difference in origin conditions would have generated a universe entirely different from the one we observe today. Now, I have always thought that this is no mystery, the fact that we are here to observe this universe is the reason we may puzzle about these finetuned conditions, but they are just one in many, equally possible, universes, and our surprise is therefore of our own making. I even thought this position was enlightened, and quite clever. But Brian explained that physicists abhor theories that rely on unknown qualities, on axiomatic pronouncements that accept something as a given. I understood that only by asking ""why"" were physicists able to develop a theory that explains the finetuning, and go beyond the Big Bang as the creation theory of the universe. And this was an excellent lesson to me. I think I knew this once, but I had forgotten about it. In my case, my anthropic stance was actually an attempt on my part to avoid a deeper question, an attempt to posit an answer where there wasn't one yet. Brian reminded me that we must never stop asking ""why"", that asking ""why"" is what makes us human. I loved this book. I can only recommend it to anybody who does not have a formal degree in science and wants to learn more about cosmology but is a bit frustrated about the lack of depth popular accounts of this topic typically provide."

Greene avoids both. This is hands down the best popular intro to modern physics I've found. Even with half a B.S. in physics and formal courses on many of the topics covered, this book consistently kept my interest and taught me new things.Two unique aspects of this book I haven't found elsewhere are (1) its focus on space and time and (2) its enthusiasm. As for (1), most pop sci books on physics focus on trying to convey one or more specific theories (quantum theory, special relativity, string theory, etc) and may discuss space or time in the context of one of these theories but don't make connections between them. Greene actually makes space and time the main character of this story and follows them throughout history and across theories. As for (2), not since Richard Feynman have I found a physicist whose writing makes me shiver with childish delight at the wonders of the universe. Some might find his poetic geeky gushes cheesy, but others (like myself) will spend the next several evenings lying outside on their lawns, staring at the stars, and just basking in the awesomeness of it all.That said, don't expect a book without mathematics to convey a full picture of our current understanding of physics. Nature seems to be written most naturally in the language of mathematics and that is the language in which she must be read. Hopefully though, if you haven't gotten over a particularly frightening encounter with mathematics as a young impressionable child, this book will convince you that it's worth doing.If you:

   are interested in modern physics but don't know where to start 
   have read a few pop sci books or many pop sci articles but want to see how many of the ideas fit together 
   or curious about our past and current understanding of space and time
...then I highly recommend this book, regardless of your background."
14,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,"This was as very confounding book to me - not confusing but confounding. It has some amazing observations and conundrums to ponder over and I suspect I did not appreciate (or even understand all that it had to tell me).Let me explain - some of the chapters used examples - some of which I have actually studied in my years in education. For example the example where electrons can be treated as particles while at the same time be treated as waves. Now I remember the experiments and I remember the theory that went with them. But I did not associated them with the bigger picture being presented in the chapter. And so the reason why I am confounded- this book challenges many of the scientific notions, a few it takes and builds upon them often reinforcing the notions it is trying to convey. And yet reading this book I feel there is so much more to learn and understand (including some of the sections in the book itself). Ironically looking back at my education I realise that rather than trying to build a foundation for me to build upon I feel like it have been shown how little I know and how so much there is still to explore and learn.Books like this have a variety of effects on me - but this is the first to make me feel so small in the scheme of things. But rather than making it feel a negative experience its almost like a reassurance that you are part of everything and in the right place. As I have said earlier there is more to be learnt from this book - but for now I need let my mind rest as its had a bit of a work out reading these pages. "

We’re storytellers, and what could be more grand than the story of creation?” Admittedly, my head was spinning quite a bit during this read. After all, trying to understand quantum physics is something my brain just isn't wired to do.I love science, and even though volumes like this can be a task to get through, I am always left enlightened and amazed at the facts and philosophies of existence and all that it encompasses. This is not a book I would recommend if you are only wanting to be entertained, but I will say this; several times during this read I snapped out a stupor and realized I had been staring off into space, lost in those thoughts of time, space, and reality.

My only criticism is that Greene can't figure out who his audience is: there's an odd mix of esoterica and the mundane. Most of the esoteric stuff is banished to the footnotes, which are well worth reading--and I suppose I should be happy that it's there at all, since most books on modern science are written with Hawking's Editor's Law in mind: with each equation, your audience shrinks by 90%.

I guess at least now I am familiar enough with the concepts which confuse me to be able to sound like I know something about general relativity, quantum mechanics and string theory over beers with friends, and that's the important thing, right?Greene uses lots of pop cultural referenced examples to illustrate difficult mathematic/theoretical constructs, so familiarity with the Simpsons, X-Files, Star Trek and Star Wars may sometimes have you thinking ""hey, I know what he's talking about"" even when you have no clue. I think some of it actually did sink in, so I'm going to recommend this to anyone who desires a primer on the advances in physics & cosmology since e=mc2 but doesn't want to read a bunch of equations."

I really enjoyed the many easy to understand explanations. Also, the book has a lot of material for the reader that even has an intermediate understanding of theoretical physics. So, it's great for a broader range of science buffs.The book covers many of the relevant theoretic physics theories. The books gives a great chronological history of physics itself.I've read the Serbo-Croatian translation Tkanje Svemira autora Brajana Grina / Heliks 2016 publishing / 592 pages / 159,214 words.Translation was well done."

After reading this book, you'll always have unfinished business in discovering more and more about the universe. This book is a very good intro to physics and discovering about the universe."
21,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/951046-john,4,"Lots of really interesting things in this book. I didn't realize physics had progressed so far in finding a unification theory.What I found most interesting would probably horrify the author because, while he didn't say so in so many words, he apparently really believes that physics is, or can be, the answer to everything. I, on the other hand, believe there is a God, the Christian God, who has a hand in our existence.I have always thought it curious that descriptions of God or angels appearing to people seem to be accompanied by bright light and that the supernatural being just appears out of nowhere. Upon reflection this seemed to me very much like them coming out of another dimension. So, what to my surprise, some of the current notions coming out of physics is that reality consists of more dimensions than we currently are able to experience. Score one for angels appearing out of nowhere because they can move from another dimension into our 3-dimensional existence.Then there's the issue of God being omniscient, i.e. knowing everything, past, present, and future. OK, He's God, so I suppose he can know all that, but it seems kind of difficult to figure how He can know the future when it hasn't happened yet. So, what to my surprise again, I learn that physics suggests that space and time are not independent but should be considered spacetime. And (from page 452) ""that moments--the events making up the spacetime loaf--just are. They are timeless. Each moment--each event or happening--exists, just as each point in space exists."" So it appears that someone, God, for instance, who has extent in another dimension outside our spacetime, could presumably see all of our spacetime, past, present, and future. Wow!Now what about free will or agency? Christians believe that people can choose to do good or do evil and are therefore responsible for the consequences. On the other hand (from page 455), ""The laws of classical physics are deterministic. ...if you were to know precisely how things are now (the position and velocity of every particle in the universe), the laws of classical physics would tell you exactly how things were are would be at any other moment you specified. The equations are indifferent to the supposed freedom of human will."" So, according to classical physics, there is no such thing as agency or free will. But then along comes quantum theory and one view is (from page 456), ""...if the passage from probabilities to definite outcomes requires something beyond the standard quantum framework--it's at least possible that free will might find a concrete realization within physical law. We might one day find, as some physicists has speculated, that the act of conscious observation is an integral element of quantum mechanics, being the catalyst that coaxes one outcome from the quantum haze to be realized."" Greene goes on to say, ""Personally, I find this extremely unlikely, but I know of no way to rule it out."" He doesn't like it, but he has the honesty to admit that it's a possibility.Those who have faith that God exists don't, or shouldn't, need science to back Him up. But I've got to admit that it is nice when it does. Of course, as Greene points out, much of what physics proposes is theory that has not been experimentally verified. Some of the above may be supplanted in the future by other theories, but for the time being it is interesting that science seems to verify some of the attributes of God as understood by Christians."
22,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,5,"Once again, as in ""The Elegant Universe,"" Greene has done an exemplary job of presenting a ""popular"" explication of deep science (particle physics and cosmology) that is neither condescending nor watered down. I've been amazed both times than anyone could pull this off, since it's been attempted so often but left the subjects either impenetrable or eviscerated.Greene's salient attribute is clarity: He can find and present the basic contours of just about any scientific discipline in clear, disciplined, open outline. He employs several simple, elementary approaches to make this happen.• short, direct, declarative sentences: Beautiful writing with little waste.• analogy: His use of analogy to elucidate arcane concepts is spot on even when (especially when) the comparison seems initially off the wall. I can't, in any way, overestimate the worth of this ability. (Bertrand Russell made a hash of explaining relativity with a raft of confounding, muddying analogies.)• repetition: Greene presents an idea and its details from several different but complementary directions that both reinforce the underlying principles and keep them continually in mind. And he doesn't assume that once he's outlined a concept, you will automatically recall its ramifications three days later. Instead, when he refers to it again, he summarizes it quickly, as if reminding a friend walking with him down a forest path. • basic fairness: Greene has his biases (mostly in favor of string theory and its near relatives), which he never denies. But he gives full credit to the other theorists down the block, admits the failings of the theories he loves and the positive side of the others.• combining inside-outside views: Any enterprise can create a corporate worldview where what you're doing assumes a centrality that the rest of humanity might consider either scary or amusing. Greene is an insider, to different degrees, in the enterprises of mathematics, physics and string theory. Yet he does a pretty complete job of balancing the committed insider against the (more) objective outsider. He speaks equally well for himself, for the wider theoretical community, and to you, looking through the window. Greene's writing and willingness to share himself have grown since ""The Elegant Universe."" It shows most in his humor. He kept it under tight rein in the first work, but here it wanders out to laugh in the sun. ""The Simpsons"" in all their glory rollick throughout the book without apology, and the analogies often have a giggle in them that in no way limits their affect.Some of the elements I'd regretted being missed from ""The Elegant Universe"" are here in detail, in part because of the intervening half decade between publication, but I think more because that's what he's chosen here to add on. You've got dark matter, dark energy, the Higgs field (prior to the way-too-recent discovery of the Higgs boson), inflationary cosmology.I'm looking forward to reading his still more recent work."
23,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2419499-liz,3,"Did Greene plagiarise a section of his book? More on that later.Oh, god, I'm surprised I finished it. For the most part, I enjoy theoretical physics. I'm not sure if I believe everything that theoretical physics proposes (but then again, I'm not one for blindly allowing myself to be pulled along by an entity I can't see), but I enjoy it nonetheless. And I wanted to enjoy this book, I really did. Greene offers some thought provoking ideas, and he even mentions at one point the author of one of my favourite theoretical physics books,Lisa Randall. Unfortunately, Greene is unable to translate all his ideas into legible text. I was able to understand some of what he was saying, but after a while, my eyes started to glaze over and I was left puzzling my own existence. Greene tends to throw ideas out there (such as cracked eggs becoming whole again, or ice forming in a glass of warm water and then melting once more) without giving a warning, that leaves the reader wondering if perhaps Greene has lost his marbles in the search for truth. Furthermore, and this may be more a publisher's error, but the book promised discussion on black holes and the like- my favourite of all astronomical topics. However, black holes are only mentioned in depth in the last twenty odd pages. However, there was a chapter on time travel, wormholes and alternate universes, but that was only a short chapter in of itself.There was one segment I did catch that made me sit up and laugh. I only would have caught it because I read Flash Forward by Richard J. Sawyer shortly before this book. Greene and Sawyer both use the same analogy of Gone With the Wind as a way of describing looking through time, in exactly the same manner. Seeing as Sawyer wrote his novel first (back in 1999) and The Fabric of the Cosmos was written in 2004, I can only suspect that Greene was, er, inspired if you will to use it. Still, I'm sure Sawyer would appreciate the credit."
24,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Periodically I get inspired to read big science books aimed at clarifying things to laypeople without any maths. Generally, each time I get slightly further than I did the previous time before eventually losing focus and coasting to the end. This was one of those times. Greene is a competent writer (though ugh, his cheesy TV analogies were not needed), and Smart Science Guy straight out of Central Casting - a graduate of Harvard and Oxford, a happily married vegetarian and accomplished pianist. Less of a character than Feynman with his bongo drums and strip club visits.Anyway. Some notes I took:The book starts off with the idea of relativity. We generally associate it with Einstein but it goes back to Newton. Newton said ""I won't define space and time since their meaning is known to everyone"". As he has it, constant motion is indistinguishable from stationarity, (unless you can see...) in terms of the laws of motion. So if you're in total darkness can't tell if you're moving. However you CAN tell if you're accelerating - if your *velocity* is changing. You cam feel it. Why? It's an interesting question, and a very important one, as we'll see later.if all motion is only noticeable as motion relative to something, what is the universal space all motion is relative to? One suggestion is that it's just ""space' - that's what Newton assumed. But that's kind of weird. What is space/is the universe inside of it/ is there any meaning to space if there is nothing in it? It's like an alphabet with no letters, is that still a thing? Surely it only has meaning because of what it contains? Leibniz suggested that space couldn't exist because then God would have to choose a point within it to put the universe, which would be arbitrary, and everything God does has a reason. Sounds very theological but in a scientific way we can pose the same question. So is there is no such thing as space?Another possibility was posited by Mach, and it rocked the world of physics. That everything has motion relative to the amount of matter in the universe. If there was almost nothing, motion would be very slight. Until the current amount of mass, and current laws of motion. Lenin wrote a philosophical essay about this while in exile. If so maybe there is no way to tell if you're moving, except relative to other objects!Maxwell/EinsteinMaxwell realised that electricity and magnetism are same force. Also, light is just electromagnetic radiation! Speed of light was constant, same as speed of this force propagating in a field. But what does light move through? They assumed all forces move within something, so called it the ether after the Aristotelian term (an antecedent of modern ethernet cables also!)The problem is that light should then have different speed depending on if you're moving towards or away from it. But Michelson/Morley couldn't find any change. They had some weird theories about it but none of them held up.Einstein came along and suggested an amazing idea. If light moves at constant speed, time must be relative when you speed up, and movement through space and time must also be connected!! Just like if you are moving north and then turn slightly northwestward your west movement takes away from your northward, so too starting to move through apace (say starting from stationary to moving) takes away from your movement through time. Just need to calculate 4-dimensional geometry, weird, but not very difficult maths.Thus clocks moving at different speeds keep different times, and atomic clocks taken on a jet measured vs clocks on the ground have proved this even on earth. And so you can never approach the speed of light. Therefore it is always constant.Also shows how simultaneity doesn't necessarily exist. It's relative between people. But ultimately space, and time are relative, but spacetime is absolute, just like Newton thought space was.That's special relativity - constant motion. What about acceleration? Also what about gravity? This was the big flaw for Einstein, since it seems to move faster than light. How does it work? He thought about it a lot and this led to general relativity. In fact even Newton said he didn't get how it worked.Einstein explained gravity as distortions in spacetime. So the presence of a massive body propagates a wave through spacetime that attracts other bodies. This moves at the speed of light, not instantly! And connected this with the puzzle of acceleration. Einstein said that acceleration is relative to spacetime, and that only someone weightless can be said to be not accelerating. If you're feeling that pull, you're accelerating relative to spacetime. In other words, the pull of gravity is equivalent to the pull of acceleration. The only person who doesn't feel it is someone in freefall. Einstein is broadly Machian, in that acceleration is relative to something, but for him it's not relative to other matter - it's to spacetime itself. Einstein originally cited Mach as a key influence but eventually rejected his idea.Quantum MechanicsLight tends to act like a wave. But unlike water, which has waves made out of particles, the actual particles themselves individually behave in a wavelike way. What kind of wave could this be? The answer turned out to be crazy: a probability wave! The electron's location, or photon or any other particle, is a function of probabilities. Very high around some areas, but non-zero even on the other end of the universe. Thus world changes from deterministic to probabilistic.Einstein with Podolski and Rosen wrote a paper trying to prove that particles do really have positions, before people observe them, thus quantum mechanics doesn't explain the true state of things. But there's an idea with looking at which direction the particle is spinning along one of three axes, with 2 different detectors - if deterministic, should agree more than half of the time? Not exactly sure. Results prove EPR to be wrong.Part 2 - TimeTalks about if time is something we can move about in, like a river frozen. People very far away would see in their ""now"" events that happened in the ancient past, but wouldn't be able to affect them.Can time's arrow move backwards? Entropy tends to increase. Egg breaking but not unbreaking. This is the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Although all physical laws seem symmetrical around time direction, entropy goes only one way. But this is only probability. Where does any order (low entropy) come from? Answer: the Big Bang caused a uniform distribution of gases like hydrogen, deuterium, etc, ordinarily a high entropy sitch, but under the influence of gravity a low-entropy one! Since gravity pulls it into clusters. Thus we know time's arrow goes forward because most likely we went from one-off low entropy event (Big Bang under gravity) to high, than the other way around. Even when order exists it comes at the expense of more order - entropy is always in the black.Quantum Mechanics + time.If electron goes from A to B, it has probability waves going over every possible path between them. This is what Feynman calls the sum of histories approach. True of a baseball too - takes every possible path, but with bigger objects the possibilities are so small that classical physics works.If we observe a particle it becomes a particle, if not it's a wave. How does human observation change this? This is a huge, crazy question, and we're not sure of the answer to it, no clear consensus. Wheeler has an experiment where you have detectors along the way, and so the photon ""decides"" in the past to be a particle not a wave, when there is future human observation!! Discusses different theories, including multiverse, and how they could answer the arrow of time issue.CosmologyHubble noticed in California in 1929 that galaxies were all rushing away. Why? Was earth the centre of ancient explosion? Answer was no, and based on relativity. Universe was expanding, so all galaxies would appear to be riding away from each other at equal speed, like pennies drawn on an expanding balloon. And because space expansion is uniform speed, they are all basically stationary relative to space, which is why clocks agree - hence we have one age for the universe, not many. But we're not being pulled apart because of stronger nuclear forces holding us together.Symmetry one of the most important concepts in cosmology, modern physics in general. Discusses possible shapes of the universe - sphere, infinite cube, torus (like video game screen - exit on one side and reappear on the other).Inflationary universe - dark matter - gravitational waves - Higgs ocean, where we're all surrounded by Higgs particles dragging against us. this was discovered in an experiment at the LHC after book was published. String theory - many dimensions - gets progressively weirder. Last section is speculation about the future, time travel and teleportation, etc. I tend to be a grouchy skeptic about these things. The time travel paradox is very old hat, and doesn't add much to the plot of Back to the Future.Did you seriously read all this? This is overall a pretty great book. It really does not contain any maths (although I often feel like having some would be better, because at some stage so much becomes ""for mathematical reasons beyond our scope, the 12-dimensional frogs must be in the shape of a donut""). Greene genuinely loves explaining science and gives you a sense of what's gone on in the field in the last 100-odd years. Even if you don't retain all that much of it, this book will reward your time invested handsomely. "

I can't. Physics is too hard for me. However, Brian Greene is a brilliant man with a teacher's magic talent of sussing out how to simplify and explain difficult complexities of scientific thought.

Gentle reader, I highly recommend this book.Physics is not only about observations and experiments, it is mostly about interpreting horribly complicated maths. Fortunately, Brian Greene leaves the math for the 'Notes' section in the back of this book while describing through analogies and simple-as-possible, and logical, well-written historical vignettes about the key physics discoveries by famous physicists which illuminate the nature of space and time. Each step of increasing scientific knowledge important to cosmology is described in a logical procession of conclusions, facts and theories, chapter by chapter. I finally understood many much briefer and out-of-context explanations in science articles which I have occasionally read. (However, I think I will not remember much of this enlightenment in a few weeks, alas.)The newest theories and guesses, described in chapters 12-16, about three-branes and brane splats, extra dimensions, string theory holograms, super-symmetry particle spinning, potential energy bowls, free will (yes, I said free will), five-string theories, two 'Big Bang' theories, and loop quantum gravity, by these genius scientists are the hardest of all to understand by this ordinary mortal, gentle reader, but perseverance with 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' DID make a small collapse of probabilities in the jittering mass of my excited brain particles so that this cat was radiant with more intelligence upon exiting the ebook. Unfortunately, though, I have a feeling this enlightenment is but a moon's dim reflective glow, gone as soon as the sun rises."
26,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,3,"This is a nice overview of modern physics, including implications of relativity (specific and general), quantum mechanics and string theory, together with a discussion of the implications for cosmology. Some of the interesting items discussed here include the notion that during the ""Planck time"", ie, 10^(-34) sec or so after the Big Bang, space and time had no meaning, that our 3-D universe may be only an illusion of an underlying 11-dimensional universe, and reality may be coded in a cosmic ""hologram"", and that our universe may be only a minor dot in an incomparably vaster ""multiverse"".My own objection to this book is that most of this material has been written elsewhere -- for starters, Greene's earlier book ""The Elegant Universe"" was an excellent introduction to string theory and its implications. That's a problem with writing a great book -- it's hard to match the same level of excitement in the next book.The other criticism that one might raise is that string theory and the multiverse, in particular, remain highly controversial in the field. Indeed, some scientists (such as Lee Smolin) are saying out loud that string theory has been given too much rope for too long, and it is time to face the reality that it has not produced any crisp, testable hypotheses (nor is it likely to for a while). For the same reasons, many are opposed to the notion of the ""multiverse"", not just for technical reasons but also for philosophical reasons -- how can the hypothesis of an infinity of companion universes, whose existence can only be indirectly suggested, even in principle, qualify as empirical science?"
27,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5866692-mel,5,"The book focused mainly on the concepts of space and time, and how they build the universe around us. Starting with the concept of space and how that's changed over the years, then time and how that's changed and now the concept of spacetime, and then the universe itself. A large part of the book was used trying to explain, ""time's arrow"" why things go forward but never backwards, why entropy is always greater in the future and never the past. It was all very interesting. At times I did get a bit lost, though not that often, but I feel now I have a much better understanding of a lot of modern physics concepts and ideas, for example I know understand Pbranes user name! I never really understood the big bang, that the universe was expanding, not that things were just getting flung further out into space. I think inflationary cosmology is neat. (even if it doesn't tie everything together). The chapter I enjoyed the most I think had to be looking at the teleportation and possibilities of time travel in the future. It was definitely more on the what if end of physics, but it was very interesting and I really enjoyed his explanations for why there would be no paradox. But it's definitely a book I'd recommend to anyone who is interested in learning how the universe might work, and how in a lot of ways it does. It made a nice change for me to read a book about a subject I know so little about. While I cannot therefore give an expert opinion about it's accuracy, it was fascinating and I feel like I understand the world a lot more now."

Although the book is maybe a bit too simple at times, I really enjoyed how Greene is able to present some very difficult concepts by gradually building up ideas. Instead of jumping over here and over there, he leads the reader in a very precise (well, as precise as you can get without serious mathematics) and logical manner which seems to be satisfying both to the layman and to the expert.

This book carefully lays out the most famous experiments that form the foundation of quantum mechanics and explains the results in plain words. A similar treatment is given to general relativity, and the line between relativity and the supposition of dark matter and dark energy is brightly highlighted. These topics make for a very rewarding first half of the book. [First Half: 5 Stars]Greene then delves into the motivations behind string theory, m-theory, and their variations. String theories are interesting to hear about, but impossible to appreciate because they are complex mathematical models without observations to give them meat. Attempted explanations of string theory give way to advocacy for Brian Greene's favorite string theory. Then the author talks briefly about time travel and wormholes to check if you are awake before describing, for pages on end, the amazingly wonderful world that will come about when a unified theory is achieved.

I'm a bit late to the party, so reading the book felt like a time travel. Having read it more than a decade after it's been written, I know that Higgs boson has been discovered, gravitational waves have been detected, and NASA's Gravity Probe B mission has been accomplished. Does that fact take anything away from the book's worth? Well, it depends on your perspective, but I would say ""no, not at all!"". Lacking the descriptions stellar scientific achievements that occurred in the last 13 years, the book is still a very good exposition of our current understanding of our universe and reality. My only criticism can be summarized as the following: it's good for a popular science book to stay away from the technicalities of complex physics theories, but I think putting a bit of math in the end notes hardly helps, simply referring to the relevant sources for details would make it more concise. Moreover, I'd expect a more thorough description of loop quantum gravity, instead of a mere few pages of introduction and a very short comparison with string theory. "

Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy.

42,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41431387-mike-morgenstein,5,"In the authors words: ""To excel in physics is to embrace doubt while walking the winding road to clarity. The tantalizing discomfort of perplexity is what inspires otherwise ordinary men and women to extraordinary feats of ingenuity and creativity; nothing quite focuses the mind like dissonant details awaiting harmonious resolution""The Fabric of the Cosmos is a thrilling unparalleled odyssey through space, time, and reality. The author Brian Greene is eloquent, insightful, cunning, cordial and concise. I'd say what excels the most is how the author makes many of his points through artful metaphors and figurative language (which i quote a few at the end of this review), as well as practical examples and applications. He helps his readers get a firm grasp on abstract concepts and ultimately makes obscurity look like clarity. Brian Greene is one of the leading string theorists and top educators. This is definitely manifest in the text, his genius is salient at most when he approaches some of the most difficult conundrums with frivolity. One thing i like most about the book is that there are many sub-sections/titles within the chapter which really benefits someone that may not have time to finish the chapter. It helped me better understand exactly where i left off (i would make sure i ended at a sub-title before I put down this book -which is very hard to do).The book is composed of 5 parts and 16 chapters.Part 1, REALITY'S ARENA, is basically a epistemological inquiry on existence, perception, reality, and more. Greene also sheds light on how the physics and conception of the universe has changed and juxtaposes many viewpoints from past brilliant thinkers such as Albert Einstein, Ernst Mach, Isaac Newton, etc. He touches upon monumental scientific discoveries like special relativity, general relativity, quantum uncertainty - the uncertainty principal, and more. Its a good way to learn or review about the retrospective progression of theoretical physics.Part 2, TIME AND EXPERIENCE, talks about what you'd surmise the title to allude to, time. In these chapters the author talks about time in the sense of perception, direction, flow, and its relation with the quantum realm.Part 3, SPACETIME AND COSMOLOGY, touches upon the big bang and many theories of what transpired right after the bang (e.g. Inflationary theory). The Higgs field is touched upon. The miraculous symmetry of the cosmos is also discussed as it purports to many things that happened in the initial microseconds of the universe.Part 4, ORIGINS AND UNIFICATION, introduces string theory which in a nutshell states that our cosmos is made up of Planck size ultra-microscopic strings. The beauty of string theory is that if it proves to be correct, then it can be the ultimate theory of unification that previous great minds like Einstein dedicated a chunk of their lives for but never quite solved it. In essence, ultimate unification is contingent on the expedient integration of quantum mechanics and general relativity. In this part, the perplexing brane theory is even introduced as well as the many probable dimensions needed for string theory. Recently, all 5 string theories were compromised and combined by Edward Witten to be called M-Theory. Witten's insight showed that all 5 theories were subtle ways of arriving at the same conclusion.Part 5, REALITY AND IMAGINATION, which is uncannily interesting, touches upon many Sci-Fi like itineraries. Discussed are time travel, time machines, teleportation, and more. Greene inquires on how to approach such tasks if they are indeed possible at all in any way. I found it interesting on why backward time travel does not have to be a contradicting paradox - you'll have to read to find out why. Just as a 3D hologram is made by reflecting light from a 2D surface, our 3D reality may in fact be just that, a hologram....An illusion.This section indeed has a warm spot in my imagination.This book is compelling, insightful, and eye-opening, and i would suggest it to almost anybody that's willing to explore the confounding world of theoretical science.Below are some of the rhetorically masterful figurative quotes by the author:""But the data revealed that, like a driver who hits the gas pedal after gliding through the EZ-Pass lane, the expansion of the universe has been accelerating ever since.""""The goal of these investigations was to attune the nascent scientific ear to nature's harmonies""""The revolutionary discovery of special relativity is this: When you look at something like a parked car, which from your viewpoint is stationary - not moving through space, that is - all of its motion is through time. The car, its driver, the street, you, your clothes are all moving through time in perfect synch: second followed by second, ticking away uniformly. But if the car speeds away, some of its motion through time is diverted into motion through space. And just as Bart's speed in the northward direction slowed down when he diverted some of his northward motion into eastward motion, the speed of the car through time slows down when it diverts some of its motion through time into motion through space. This means that the car's progress through time slows down and therefore time elapses more slowly for the moving car and its driver than it elapses for you and everything else that remains stationary""""If entropy is likened to property taxes, it would be as if New York City acquired the Sahara Desert. The total property taxes collected would go up, but by a tiny amount compared with the total increase in acreage."""

Greene does an amazing job of breaking down mind bending concepts of relativity, quantum mechanics and hidden dimensions; several times I had to stop and reflect on the astounding way the dots had suddenly been connected. It's heavier than a 'pop-science' book and more in depth, but worth the investment of time and energy."

The author does a great job in presenting the material in a chronological and comprehensible manner. If you're into astrophysics and space, this book is very approachable and still has a lot of detail. "
45,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"In this book Greene is surprisingly unclear regarding Einstein's theory of special and general relativity. On the special theory, Greene puts a guy named Bart on a skateboard ""reading, whistling, yawning, and occasionally glancing at the road"" (why is this relevant?), initially heading north, but when he shifts to the northeast, his speed to the north is diverted and slowed down. ""That, in a nutshell, is special relativity,"" Greene writes, presumably showing a relationship between time and space. But that's a perplexing explanation as Bart is covering the same amount of distance in the same amount of time, and the only difference is that he's going in a different direction.With the general theory, Greene says of Einstein that there cannot be instantaneous communication between two bodies across the vast distances of space as, even at light speed, there's a time delay. So far, so good. Then Greene states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent because, in contrast to a natural state of free motion, you ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it."" ""Acceleration from whose viewpoint?,"" he asks, and then the writing gets challenging as to just how all of this connects with Einstein's geometric view of spacetime. And one wonders how this principle of equivalence matches up with that of Einstein's 1948 collaborator, Lincoln Barnett, who writes that Einstein's Principle of Equivalence was between gravitation and inertia. Greene says that when you are reading calmly at home, ""you are accelerating"" and that all the things ""we usually think of as stationary are accelerating upward."" If this means that the earth is pushing us, then isn't it clearer to say we are BEING accelerated as opposed to us having rockets on our tails? Or, back to the notion of free motion, like all mass do we move in a free fall, but encounter the intertial mass and gravitational pull of the earth that has a mind of its own, holding us back and resisting our attempts to be free (i.e., in the sentence above, we ""feel gravity's influence only when you resist it.""). While we might understand the connection between time and space (time to cover distance), it's almost easier to keep ""time"" off to the side as the gravitational effect of warped space is easier to conceptualize than warped time and time always seems to be added as an afterthought. Interestingly, in a 2012 Newsweek article, Greene refers to just space. As the subtitle to his book indicates, spacetime takes on a mantra-like life of its own for Greene and becomes a ""something"" even though, in a relegated footnote, Greene says that Einstein himself ""believed that spacetime had no existence independent of its metric...so that if one were to remove everything - including the metric - spacetime would not be a something."" Thing or no thing, the reader is not sure. While Greene writes that spacetime is the incarnation of gravity, it seems that Einstein said that gravity is the product (""incarnation"") of spacetime (Wheeler says it is both). Also, in the same illustration he used for his NOVA program, Greene writes that ""The earth stays in orbit around the sun because it follows curves in the spacetime fabric caused by the sun's presence,"" but he doesn't say why the earth doesn't follow those curves to the bottom of the depression to be incorporated into the sun and what role, if any, the earth's own inertial mass has in this.Regarding a few other miscellaneous observations, Greene's take on entropy is interesting. He ties gravity and entropy together by stating that clumpiness - not uniformity - is the cosmic natural state and that it is a low-ordered entropy state. This suggests that, rather than the big bang starting from a low entropy/highly ordered state with its energy dispersing across the cosmos into a high entropy/low ordered state, it is the opposite. Greene says that Newton, Mach and Einstein did not explain why objects resist acceleration (inertia). Then he goes on to say that he means that they did not probe how an object acquires its mass, whereas I wonder why Greene doesn't explain why mass itself has inertial effects. In one of his central points, Greene says that gravity is not just a ""pulling"" force but a repulsive force that drives space to expand (""like acceleration""). This seems more like an explosion than a gravity phenomenon unless that is exactly what he means: Gas is pressurized against the inward contraction of gravity and encounters resistance, a wall of sorts, until it bursts forth. But is that gravity? Finally, Greene is at his best in describing string theory. A non-dimensional string of vibrating energy is the fundamental cosmic ""ingredient"" and the different ""vibrational patterns"" make up the different cosmic particles and the ""mass of a particle...is nothing but the energy of its vibrating string."" A heavier particle vibrates faster than a lighter particle, and this means more energy and more mass. There is a lot of physics in this book. Greene variously refers to the expert reader and the mathematically-inclined reader,"" in his excellent footnotes so it's likely that much of what he says would be understandably a challenge for the general reader. "
46,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3872950-carla,0,"Greene is a wonderful science writer, and he has a gift for choosing the perfect metaphor or anecdote to illustrate complex ideas.

55,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9297293-biserka,4,"I'm into reading these kinds of books. It's not the first one I've read either, but unlike other popular science books about physics I've read, I understood at least 85% of this one without having any education in phisycs other than what we've learned in primary school. The explanations are very clear - or at least they were to me - sometimes even too clear. Some things that I've unterstood emediately, were explained on multiple pages, but that just shows that the writer could position himself in the mind of a very unexperienced reader - if the reader is open minded of course. I would recomend this book to anyone with a basic understanding of primary school phisycs.One thing to remember before reading any popular science book about phisycs is that most of these things are just theories. We basically don't know jack about the space or time or phisycs. We just asume things based on how the world around us behaves and we could be wrong about everything. Even the ""proven"" theories in use today could be very close minded, being able to calculate and simulate thing that we see and not the actual nature of the universe.I liked this book. I really enjoyed it in general, but it was a bit too long for me. I've been reading it for the past few months piece by piece. In chunks, a few pages at a time. At the same time I got my mind blown away because the findings described were something I couldn't even imagine before and I understand that if the book was shorter, it would not be able to explain things as good as it did, so I'll give it that.Before I finish, I also want to counter the claims of a few reviews which point out that the pop culture references in this book were unnecessary or even distracting. I really dont think so. It was quite fun imagining Mulder and Scully thinking about quantum physics. These references took me back to the 2000's and I did not mind them at all. In fact it was better imagining Bart Simpson doing experiments, than if the author would just make up a name and say imagine John Doe...All in all this was a really good book as far as popular science books about phisycs go. Very good explenations and examples and pretty clear descriptions. It is a bit outdated now, but historical facts described in it are still true."
56,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,5,"I started this book hoping to get a basic understanding of the Theory of Relativity. I got that, and much, much more. I can't remember ever having read an author as talented at distilling and simplifying the complex as Brian Greene. He is great at using metaphor, repetition and illustrations to explain exotic, intertwined subjects. I'm really pleased at how far he was able to take me without requiring me to use math or learn equations. I appreciate the fact that I'd have a deeper understanding of the theory if I learned the math, but my goal isn't to become a cosmologist, it's to get a basic understand of what cosmologists are doing. I was also pleased at how he is always careful to distinguish untested or disputed theories from generally accepted science.Some of the parts that stand out as especially interesting to me were the discussions of entropy and the laws of thermodynamics, the Theory and Special Theories of Relativity. Why dark matter matters and what it potentially is. What gravity actually is, what the Higgs ocean is (if it exists). How quantum mechanics and quantum uncertainty work and what the implications are. He explains what we know about black holes and why a knowledge of them is so important as well as what string theory, super-string theory and M-theory are and the shortcomings and alternatives to those theories.The final chapters are on the frontiers of science and talk about things like whether time and can be broken into discreet, indivisible units and why that would matter. He also discusses the possibilities of teleportation and time travel into the past or future. After reading that far, It feels great to actually understand some of the theory behind the discussion from the previous sections of the book. Greene's excitement for physics is contagious. He is unabashedly enthusiastic and is always careful to point out, in a non-patronizing way, when and why you should be excited about a particular point.

57,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548739-campbell-mcaulay,4,"This is is a life changing book on a par with Blind Watchmaker. I was a little daunted by the subject material to begin with, but soon lost my inhibitions - it's not half as bad as I expected and I'm actually finding myself second-guessing some of the directions and explanations that author is taking in explaining the wierdness of the relativistic and quantum worlds. Either I'm not as deeply stupid as I thought or Greene's treatment is perfect for the non-expert reader. It's still a challenging book, and I'll need a re-read at sometime in the near future to fix the concepts in my head, but I'm looking forward to the prospect. A few minor gripes: - The illustrations don't seem to have transferred well to the paperback version - they're on the small side and difficult to interpret and return to. Perhaps larger, colour illustrations, gathered in a central section would have been better. - Some of Greene's analogies grate a little. He makes a lot of use of analogies, which I guess is inevitable and necessary given the esoteric nature of the subject matter. However, one is occasionally left wondering whether these analogies tell the whole story or if there's something important that's been left out for the benefit of the reader's sanity. The early ones on relativity are played out by The Simpsons (obviously Greene is a fan!) which comes across as a little patronising and later ones relate to baseball, which doesn't translate well for the British reader. - Although the conclusions are mind-boggling (quantum entanglement, string theory) a degree of shell shock is setting in - can the universe get any wierder? I'm only 3/4 of the way through! and it is difficult to lift oneself to the heights of admiration and wonder that Green obviously reaches - Ho hum! More strangeness! Nevertheless, this is well worth a read and don't be put off by the subject material. You'll never look at the world in the same way again. "
58,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Another excellent popular work on the foundations of physics by the author of The Elegant Universe, which I read a year ago. The earlier work was primarily an explanation of string theory; this book has more general background on general relativity and quantum theory, and only arrives at string theory and more recent developments about three fifths of the way through. The background was more than I really needed, but would be useful for someone beginning from scratch; it was a good clear introduction, and I did learn things from it. Green is particularly clear dealing with the specific interpretations of quantum theory, which are well laid out, and the Bell/Aspect experiments, and also gives a very good explanation of the Higgs field, which I had only a vague understanding of. The material on string theory is briefer than in the earlier book, which it refers to, but also a few years more up to date. One annoyance, which is also present in the first book but much more so here, is Greene's use of popular culture icons (the Simpsons, Mulder and Scully, etc.) in all his illustrations of various points. I could see this if there were analogies between the physics and aspects of these characters, but in most cases he might just as well have used A, B, C or common names, which would have been less distractingly cute.There was very little mathematics, which would have made some things clearer to me perhaps, but most of the math of quantum and string theory is beyond my knowledge anyway. I would recommend this to anyone with a general layperson's interest in physics."
59,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1642545-michael,0," If there is one subject I struggle with, it's the hard sciences. But Brian Greene's book is written exactly for people like me who probably haven't picked up a science book since high school and are mathmatically handicapped. And given the importance of the research going on, the discoveries so far, and the possibilities that are coming soon that may change our world in some really significant ways, it is also an important book.  In a nutshell, Greene delivers what we know and what we theorize about what, exactly, the reality of the universe is: what it is made out of, how it functions, and how it may have come about. Here are explanations of what ""dimensions"" are, why Higgs particles are the subject of furious exploration, and why huge supercolliders are being built. More to the point for the reader is that this book is great exercise for you imagination, trying to wrap your brain cells around concepts like braneworlds, ""strings,"" and ""dark matter.""  These are concepts I run across rather frequently when I pick up a science fiction novel--this will definitely help my understanding of some of the high concepts there. But more exciting is the fact that the reality of this frontier of science is, in many ways, more fantastic and epic than fiction! "
60,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1892148-sandra,5,"Author Brian Green is to be commended for his brilliant attempt to communicate the intricacies of particle physics, general and special relativity, the Big Bang, quantum mechanics and, yes--even string theory--to the interested lay person. It is a monumental effort ,since these topics are not easy for most people to grasp. I know because I have a genuine interest and have read numerous books purporting to make these theories understandable. This is the first one that I almost, nearly--at least sometimes almost nearly--got. And since the book contains an excellent glossary of terms I will at least now be able to sprinkle my conversation with some daunting verbiage--always a good thing.I did not find all the included graphics helpful, but a few were enormously helpful. I now have a much firmer grasp of what is meant by extra dimensions (never easy to visualize) and I was blown away by the thought that the universe probably resembles a Pringles potato chip, when I had always just assumed it must be balloon-like. Who would have thought.I think that if I read this book two or three more times, I might actually become an educated person. That’s unlikely, but at least there’s that great glossary."
61,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2490942-david,5,"Referencing Camus’ ultimate philosophical statement that the only question worth considering is suicide, Brian Green states at the beginning of this book that the ultimate question is really, “What is space?” and takes some 500+ pages to trace the chase for an answer. He nailed the question, but never came to a definitive answer—because there isn’t one. But he did an incredible job of discussing it, taking a hack like myself through the paces of Newtonian physics, Einstein’s theories of relativity, the bizarre world of quantum mechanics, and into string theory. This massive amount of astoundingly complex information was explained about as well as anyone has ever explained it to me (I've read several attempts), and with some levity. It took me over a year to read this, because I had to reread several sections several times, along with some time to let it seep into my head (to the extent possible) before moving on to the next section. And I plan to reread it again sometime in the future. It’s like a reference book. "
62,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32722-erica,4,"Physics is such a strange science, and yet, it's also the most elemental. The wild theories these folks come up with are mind-bending, almost whimsical. But are mathmaticians the only ones who have a claim on reality? There seems to be a strain of hubris running through the book - if we keep running more and more experiments and solving more complex math problems, we'll have all the answers. One YouTube video description refers to Greene as an ""evangelist"" and it's difficult to argue with that characterization as he gesticulates from his ""pulpit"" (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu-_Pv...).Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this book. It was well-written, it caused a great shift in my perspective on everyday live (I now imagine myself moving through a ""space-time loaf"" as I pull laundry out of the dryer), and it brought me into the debates of a science that might otherwise remain beyond even my faint grasp."
63,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8811289-correen,5,"Greene writes beautifully about astrophysics and particle physics, bringing the two fields together as he describe how scientists have struggled to explain both with a single theory. His specialty is string theory which he introduces in this book. I started reading this book earlier and stopped as it took greater concentration than I could provide. Having completed it, I would do better reading it again. However, it is a few years old and, therefore, does not provide the latest discoveries. He talks of the Higgs Boson but it had not yet been identified. The Higgs field is critical to considering space. Scientists were quite certain of its existence but needed more evidence.Books get old very fast in physics but some have sufficient clarity to help maintain their usefulness. This is one of them."
64,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39041422-andrew-escobedo,5,"This is was such a fantastic and deeply interesting book. Brian Greene is able to write and convey these extremely technical and complex ideas into something that the general reader can digest. The book is written in such a way in that you can feel Green's child like curiosity and excitement. The book spans from understanding Einsteins Theory of special, then to general relativity, and eases you into quantum mechanics, sinking into string theory, and going into m-theory, and understanding super symmetry, ultimately leading to the question and theorized ideas of what is space, what is time? It's a tremendous explanation and one that gives you a deep appreciation for all of the intense work through the centuries that so many of the greatest minds have spent so much time on in order to understand ourselves and our place in the universe, and how far we have come since these early times. "
65,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28510605-kaelyn,4,"I read this during BookTubeAThon and that was probably a mistake. This book is very long and very in depth and NOT easy to get through. Despite that, I REALLY enjoyed it. I learned so much about things that I didn't even know existed. If you asked me what the Higgs field was before reading this, I would have an answer. I didn't have a concrete understanding of general relativity before this book. So this book does what I think it promised to do: teach me. The way Greene explains such difficult to wrap your head around concepts is great and filled with a lot of funny examples. My only issue, as I may have mentioned earlier, is that the book definitely shouldn't be read (almost CAN'T be read) in a short amount of time. The concepts are very complicated and they need time to sink in. Keep that in mind; it's not a quick read! "
66,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2456844-theresa-leone-davidson,4,"Dr. Greene wrote something called The Elegant Universe, which I have not yet read, but after reading The Fabric of the Cosmos, I definitely will. In this book, he explains the complex ideas behind and hypotheses of string theory, and of the research that involves the very fabric of space and time. I did not need to recall too much from my physics classes in college because this is mostly written at a layman's level, and he is an engaging writer. In fact, the very complex research going on today at places all over the world attempting to discover the fundamental makeup of the universe is written about and explained as though Dr. Greene is writing for an audience unfamiliar with college level science. Not only does Greene makes this intensely complex subject matter understandable, he makes it fun to read. Highly recommend!"

You don't need previous knowledge to read this book, but it isn't an easy read. There's not a lot of math or formulas, but you do need your brain to handle all the dense information. Well written, smooth, with the occasional entertaining anecdote.The basic question it tries to solve is why time has a direction, whereas there is nothing in physics which seems to dictate that.

It is an excellent book; however, I just lack the background knowledge to fully understand a lot of it. Perhaps I should say, to understand it at any applicable level. I can understand most of the concepts and ideas, I just cannot envision many of them. Still, the little I have been able to absorb has really given me a completly different perspective on our existence and on the world around me, both of the vast and the miniscule.

It's my curse, I guess...to be endlessly fascinated with physics and quantum mechanics, but never being about to grasp the math. Mr. Greene does a good job of explaining his and others' theories for the lay person like me, but he also includes detailed notes for the mathematically inclined. It took me over a year to read, because I re-read many passages, and spent a lot of time thinking about the concepts, to ensure that I understood everything as well as I possibly could.

I have to confess that I'd never understood some of the most basic and exciting ideas of modern physics until this book...e.g., the relationship between time and speed; general / special relativity.

The best part of the book, though, goes well beyond the basics to vivid explorations of the most profoundly weird - and exciting - ideas about the essential nature of the universe. "

It's a really amazing thing to be able to articulate such technical and/or bizarre (to common sense) concepts in such a way that normal people can understand the implications of complex math without having to look at math. My favorite part of this book is his explanation of time - the past is not gone from the universe, and the future exists also - all times are now...because Chewbacca, on his planet far, far away, is observing us in the distant past or the distant future."

The questions that modern physics strives to answer fascinate me and I believe that these are the most crucial endeavors of our times.Space and time are difficult concepts to define, yet Greene as a good professor that he is has tried to do just that. Space can be explained by the inflationary theory as shown by the discovery of the cosmic background radiation. And it looks as if time is an inherent concept of space which makes ""spacetime"" the continuum that dominates our reality."

However, it is missing a sense of wonder that fills the best books on science. It reads more like a textbook.There is one exception to the problems in this book, which is why it gets 4 stars. There is a chapter about time in the beginning of the book that made my head spin. It did have a sense of wonder and messed with my head, in a good way. I definitely recommend reading that section.

It’s a fantastic read, goes without saying.Will share a few weird facts of the Cosmos as brought out in the book, though. The Universe is, to say the least, not what you think it is. It is a weird place. So we humans should feel right at home being here.#1 Weird Fact: Space and Time are not Immutable and UnchangeableLet’s start with the big things first. What is Space and Time? Isn’t it immutable and unchangeable? Isn’t Space and Time the grand arena, the unchanging permanent components of the Universe where stuff happens like galaxies colliding, supernovas, Earth going around the Sun, night becoming day etc?Isaac Newton thought so too.In his Principia Mathematica, Newton articulated a conception of Space and Time, declaring them absolute and immutable entities that provided the universe with a rigid, unchangeable arena. As far as Time was concerned, Newton even made the sweeping statement that he couldn’t be bothered trying to explain what Time is all about, as everyone knows what Time is. That is deep.But for Albert Einstein, Space and Time was not absolute and immutable. His insight into the very special nature of ‘light’ got him thinking on the nature of Space and Time.As a teenager, Einstein asked: What happens if you move at light speed?'What would a light wave look like if you were to chase after it at exactly light speed? Since you and the light wave would be zipping at exactly the same speed, you would be keeping perfect pace with the light. And so, the teenage Einstein concluded, from your perspective the light should appear as though it wasn’t moving. You should be able to reach out and grab a handful of motionless light just as you can scoop up a handful of newly fallen snow.'This fantastic theory sort of makes sense. But Einstein himself, in 1905, in his Theory of Special Relativity, postulated that the speed of light is a constant, no matter what the relative motion of the observer. So regardless of your state of motion, whether you chase a light beam, or run from it, or just stand still, the light retains its one fixed and never changing speed of about 3,00,000 Km per second.So Light will never appear stationary. No matter how fast you move.From this radical postulate that the speed of light is a constant, Einstein concluded that Space and Time are relative, not absolute and immutable as Newton assumed it to be. Each of us carries our own clock, our own monitor of the passage of time. Each clock is equally precise, yet when we move relative to one another, these clocks do not agree. They fall out of synchronization; they measure different amounts of elapsed time between two chosen events.This postulate of Einstein - that we all carry our ‘own clocks’, was proven by the famous Cesium Clock Experiment.'In 1971, Joseph Hafele and Richard Keating flew state-of-the-art Cesium-beam atomic clocks around the world on a commercial Pan Am jet. When they compared the clocks flown on the plane with identical clocks left stationary on the ground, they found that less time had elapsed on the moving clocks. The difference was tiny—a few hundred billionths of a second—but it was precisely in accord with Einstein’s discoveries.'So what it means is that when you move, Time travels more slowly for you than for someone who is stationary.The same is true of distance or Space. Each of us carries our own yardstick, our own monitor of distance in space. Each yardstick is equally precise, yet when we move relative to one another, these yardsticks do not agree; they measure different distances between the locations of two specified events.If Space and Time did not behave this way, the speed of light would not be a constant. Space and Time adjust themselves in an exactly compensating manner so that observations of light’s speed yield same result, regardless of the observer’s velocity.#2 Weird Fact: You are Moving at Light SpeedEinstein said that when you are stationary, you move at Light speed. At 3,00,000 Km per second. But through Time.In his theory of Special Relativity Einstein postulated the concept of ‘Movement through Time’.Consider this:We are used to the fact that objects can move through space.But Einstein said that there is another kind of motion that is equally important: objects also move through Time. Right now, the watch on your wrist and the clock on the wall are ticking away, showing that you and everything around you are relentlessly moving through time, relentlessly moving from one second to the next. Newton thought that motion through time was totally separate from motion through space-he thought these two kinds of motion had nothing to do with each other. But Einstein found that they are intimately linked. 'In fact, the revolutionary discovery of Special Relativity is this: When you look at something like a parked car, which from your viewpoint is stationary—not moving through space, that is—all of its motion is through time. The car, its driver, the street, you, your clothes are all moving through time in perfect sync: second followed by second, ticking away uniformly. But if the car speeds away, some of its motion through time is diverted into motion through space.'The speed of the car through Time slows down, when it diverts some of its motion through time into motion through Space. This means that the car’s progress through time slows down.And therefore time elapses more slowly for the moving car and its driver than it elapses for you and everything else that remains stationary.Special Relativity declares that the combined speed of any object’s motion through Space and its motion through Time is always precisely equal to the speed of light. The maximum speed through Space is reached when all light-speed motion through time is fully diverted into light-speed motion through space—one way of understanding why it is impossible to go through space at greater than light speed. Light, which always travels at light speed through space, is special in that it always achieves such total diversion. 'Time stops when travelling at the speed of light through space. A watch worn by a particle of light would not tick at all. Light realizes the dreams of Ponce de León and the cosmetics industry: it doesn’t age.'#3 Weird Fact: Space is Warped and CurvedWhy does the Earth go around the Sun? Or the moon around the Earth?It’s because Space is curved and warped. Not smooth and featureless as one might expect.If you roll a marble on a smooth wooden floor, it will travel in a straight line. But if you recently had a terrible flood and the floor dried with all sorts of bumps and warps, a rolling marble will no longer travel along the same path. It will be guided this way and that by the warps and curves on the floor’s surface. In 1915, in his Theory of General Relativity, Einstein postulated that the presence of matter or energy has an effect on Space much like the effect the flood had on the floor. Matter and energy, like the sun, cause Space to warp and curve.And just as a marble rolling on the warped floor travels along a curved path, Einstein stated that anything moving through warped space—such as the earth moving in the vicinity of the sun—will travel along a curved trajectory.That, according to Einstein, is how gravity exerts its influence amongst heavenly bodies and everything else in the Universe. #4 Weird Fact: The Quantum WorldIf you thought the Cosmos is kinda weird, then you probably have not been introduced to the Quantum world as yet. That’s where things get truly insane.Einstein classified Quantum mechanics in precise scientific terms: SpookyConsider a few bizarre facts predicted by quantum mechanics and scientifically proven:# Non LocalityQuantum mechanics predicts that interconnections between two particles need not be local. What this means is that something that happens here can be entwined with something that happens far away, even if nothing travels from here to that location far away. It’s called Entanglement.Quantum connection between two particles persists even if they are on the opposite sides of the Universe.For example, consider two people standing on opposite sides of a lake wearing sunglasses. Light from the surface of the lake reflects and photons are emitted. Quantum mechanics shows that there is a 50-50 chance that a particular photon reflected towards you from the surface of a lake will make it through your sun glasses.'When the photon hits the glass, it randomly “chooses” between reflecting back and passing through. The astounding thing is that such a photon can have a partner photon that has sped miles away in the opposite direction and yet, when confronted with the same 50-50 probability of passing through the sun glasses of the person standing on the opposite side of the lake, will somehow do whatever the initial photon does. Even though each outcome is determined randomly and even though the photons are far apart in space: if one photon passes through, so will the other.' This is the kind of nonlocality predicted by quantum mechanics.Quantum Mechanics says that two things can be separated by an enormous amount of space and yet not have a fully independent existence. A quantum connection can unite them, making the properties of each contingent on the properties of the other. # Probability wave of an electronAccording to quantum mechanics, every probability wave of an electron extends throughout all of space, throughout the entire universe. In many circumstances, though, a particle’s probability wave quickly drops very close to zero outside some small region, indicating the overwhelming likelihood that the particle is in that region. Nevertheless, so long as the probability wave of an electron somewhere in the Andromeda galaxy has a nonzero value, no matter how small, there is a tiny but genuine—nonzero—chance that the electron could be found there. So what it means is that there is a probability that the single electron you just exhaled sitting in your room can be found on the dark side of the moon.# Position and velocity of a particle Quantum mechanics claims that the position and the velocity of a particle cannot simultaneously have definite values. Instead, particles hover in quantum limbo, in a fuzzy, amorphous, probabilistic mixture of all possibilities; only when measured is one definite outcome selected from the many. #5 Weird Fact: Time is IllusoryThe passage of Time is illusory.The past, present and future have already happened.It’s like the movie reel. Each portion of the reel captures a particular scene. When you watch the movie, you have the illusion of various scenes playing out moment after moment. But that is just an illusion.Similarly, events in the entire Universe- past, present and future have already occurred. Or to put it differently, the past, present and future all exist simultaneously. What you experience as a flow of time is just an illusion. The Big Bang and the end of the Universe have all occurred and exist as frozen moments in time.We intuitively ascribe this particular moment, this ‘Now’ to be same for everyone across the Universe. For instance, if in this ‘Now’, am reading a book and someone is watching a movie in New York, and simultaneously a Volcano is erupting in Jupiter, we believe this ‘Now slice’ of Space-time should be the same for everybody.But this view is dated. A Newtonian way of envisioning reality. According to Newton’s absolute space and absolute time, everyone’s freeze-frame picture of the Universe at a given moment, contains exactly the same events; everyone’s ‘Now’ is the same ‘Now’, and so everyone’s ‘Now-list’ for a given moment is identical. If someone or something is on your ‘Now-list’ for a given moment, then it is necessarily also on my ‘Now-list’ for that moment. Most people’s intuition is still bound up with this way of thinking, but Special Relativity tells a very different story.As already explained, Time moves slower for someone in motion as compared to someone stationary.So there are ‘Different Now’s’ for the ones moving and those stationary. Their clocks will not match.Observers moving relative to each other have different conceptions of what exists at a given moment, and hence they have different conceptions of reality. At everyday speeds, the angle between two observers ’Now-slices’ is minuscule; that’s why in day-to-day life we never notice a discrepancy between our definition of ‘Now’ and anybody else’s.The author gives an example to drive this point home. A thought experiment:'Imagine that Chewie is on a planet in a galaxy far, far away—10 billion light-years from Earth—idly sitting in his living room. Imagine further that you and Chewie are not moving relative to each other. Since you are at rest relative to each other, you and Chewie agree fully on issues of space and time: you would slice up space-time in an identical manner, and so your ‘Now-lists’ would coincide exactly. After a little while, Chewie stands up and goes for a walk—a gentle, relaxing amble—in a direction that turns out to be directly away from you. This change in Chewie’s state of motion means that his conception of ‘Now’, his slicing up of space-time, will rotate slightly.This tiny angular change has no noticeable effect in Chewie’s vicinity: the difference between his new ‘Now’ and that of anyone still sitting in his living room is minuscule. But over the enormous distance of 10 billion light-years, this tiny shift in Chewie’s notion of ‘Now’ is amplified.His ‘Now’ and your ‘Now’, which were one and the same while he was sitting still, jump apart because of his modest motion. If Chewie walks away from you at about 10 miles per hour, the events on earth that belong on his new ‘Now-list’ are events that happened about 150 years ago, according to you! According to his conception of ‘Now’—a conception that is every bit as valid as yours and that up until a moment ago agreed fully with yours—you have not yet been born!If he moved towards you at the same speed, the angular shift would be opposite, so that his ‘Now’ would coincide with what you would call 150 years in the future! Now, according to his ‘Now’, you are no longer be a part of this world. And if, instead of just walking, Chewie hopped into the Millennium Falcon travelling at 1,000 miles per hour (less than the speed of a Concorde aircraft), his ‘Now’ would include events on Earth that from your perspective took place 15,000 years ago or 15,000 years in the future, depending on whether he flew away or towards you. So: if you buy the notion that reality consists of the things in your freeze-frame mental image right now, and if you agree that your ‘Now’ is no more valid than the ‘Now’ of someone located far away in space who can move freely, then reality encompasses all of the events in space-time.'If we can visualize ‘all of Space’ as really being out there, as really existing, we could also visualize ‘all of time’ as really being out there, as really existing, too. Past, present and future certainly appear to be distinct entities. But, as Einstein once said, “The distinction between past, present and future is only an illusion, however persistent.”The only thing that’s real is the whole of space-time.In this way of thinking, events, regardless of when they happen from any particular perspective, just are. They all exist. They eternally occupy their particular point in space-time. There is no flow. If you were having a great time at the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Eve, 1999, you still are, since that is just one immutable location in space-time.And the weirdness quotient of the Universe just increases when the author talks of Multi-verse, hidden dimensions, String Theory.....A great read.Can’t recommend this book enough."
107,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33761275-katherine-tirado-ryen,5,"This is my 31st book to read this year, the fourth on astro and particle physics, and by far the most fascinating. Though not as humorous or relatable a writer as Neil deGrasse Tyson, Brian Greene nevertheless tackles wide-ranging topics in particle physics and quantum mechanics, while also highlighting history from Greek astronomers to Newton to the advancements of modern day string/m-theorists and loop quantum gravity. This is a weighty tome, academic and verbose, but so very interesting in its subject matter. There are a number of terrific takeaways, like how microwave photons, traveling to us from 14 billion years ago, all emit nearly identical temperatures that fills out a pattern across the sky that's explained via jitters that arise from quantum uncertainty. Or how the farthest we can see of our observable universe is so minuscule that if we shrunk our entire universe to the size of Earth, what we can see with our most powerful telescopes represents but single grain of sand. Or how inflation cosmology, by mining gravity and in stark contrast to the standard Big Bang Theory in which the total mass energy of the universe was greater beyond words, could have produced all the matter and radiation in the universe by a speck of a uniform implaton field weighing a mere 20 pounds. I appreciate how well Greene explains the conflict between general relativity (which explains the macro: stars, galaxies, the expansion of the universe) and quantum mechanics (which explains the micro: atoms, quarks, strings) and specifically how their formulas break down when merged. A great example is a black hole, whose incredible gravitational pull is so immense it swallows everything beyond its event horizon (general relativity) before compressing all that ingested matter into a microscopic pinpoint (quantum mechanics). He explains the conundrum of how we cannot know the center of the black hole until we have a unifying theory. Special relativity has the constancy of the speed of light. General relativity has the equivalence principal. Quantum mechanics has the uncertainty principal. String theorists, meanwhile, continue to look for a unification of all forces in a quantum mechanical framework--a noble task indeed!This book is well worth your time. It was slow-going for me only because I had to reread (and sometimes triple read!) whole sections to better understand them, despite my familiarity from advanced physics and quantum mechanics courses in college. But I walked away with a keener appreciation of our universe, and the scientists tirelessly working at unmasking some of life's greatest mysteries. "
108,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73412549-zeljko,5,"This book was one hell of a ride. I did realise one thing tho, I definitely should have read this one first, then moved on to The Elegant Universe and The Hidden Reality because this book lays the best groundwork for those 2, especially The Elegant Universe. While I found The Elegant Universe to be pretty good, it was rather too difficult for someone who only has basic high school knowledge of classical physics but that applies only to the last third of that book. The Fabric Of Cosmos however is a different animal, Greene starts this book by explaining Newton's laws which is pretty awesome for someone who has no education in classical physics (first 40 pages or so) and then he moves on to GR and QM like he did in his other books. The difference is that he explains some other things that I did not know from his other books and it really fleshed out and refreshed the knowledge I got of those concepts from his other books. The big thing that made me give this book a 5 star rating is the Inflation Theory. I didn't expect him to give that theory so much ""screentime"" but it was so awesome. I knew only basics of that theory, mostly from listening to a podcast called Ask A Spaceman (which is awesome for train rides when you don't feel like reading). Greene tho goes into great detail of this theory and the explanation of the Inflation Field and even Higgs Field. Also it was pretty fun to see him being hyped about the possibility of a discovery of Higgs Particle which eventually did happen in 2012 if I recall correctly, same goes for gravity waves which he was hyping up aswell and turned out to be true and they were detected a couple of years ago I believe. Anyhow, this book was maginificent, even the string theory parts which were the most complicated in other books were very interesting here (sorry for my stupidity to comprehend this theory in The Elegant Universe, I am only a senior in high school with basic physics knowledge). The last part was ofcourse the awesome speculation that you can expect from Brian Greene, using the concepts he explained previously and making crazy speculations, presenting them in a very understandable and cool way. Awesome read for anyone interested in pop science books, but I would suggest it for some professionals aswell since there are mathematical equations laid out at the back of the book, in the notes. I found it pretty intriguing since I acctually understood some of those related to GR. Also this was not a light read so it took me awhile to get through it but it was so worht it. "
109,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7552897-sebastian,4,"Right off the bat I have to say that this audiobook was made twice as enjoyable as it would otherwise have been because of Michael Prichard. His voice, accent and cadence made me feel like I was listening to an old timey nineteen-fifties science radio show, and kept my attention from wandering as it sometimes tends to with audiobooks.The books in itself is lovely. I feel it provides a well written and quite accessible description of the general state of play in physics at the time it was written, through its use of pop-culture references has not aged very well in the interim. I also feel that some of the explanations could have been further elucidated with a good diagram or two (e.g. the endlessly convoluted “which path” quantum experiments with causality), but when I hunted down a print version of the book to check if there are any, and if there are whether they help, I was disappointed to discover the illustrations tiny and illegible, and hence adding little to no clarity.Now, to the serious down side. The reason I decided to go with Greene’s book is to try to understand what the deal is with superstring theory without getting too deeply enveloped in the maths of a theory I feel is very likely not the right answer (team LQG all the way!). The problem is that in this regard, the book remains quite “handwavy” with many of the explanations, and even at times refers the reader to Greene’s other book, The Elegant Universe, for an actual explanation or elaboration. Since roughly half of this rather hefty tome is, in fact, about superstring theory, this feels like a bit of a letdown. The presentation was nice and systematic, but the explanations left a lot to “just trust me on this one”.Oh, and string theory? Greene didn’t really convince me. I see where it comes from, but it seems to me as if to answer a simple problem – e.g. the fine-tuning of certain constants – string theorists have built an immensely complex, mathematically unintelligible and convoluted tower of assumptions and ideas that merely push the fundamental questions further down the line while at the same time opening a myriad new ones without answer."
110,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96417621-mira,4,"What is it with theoretical physicists and their amazing ability to explain concepts through non-technical ordinary world analogies? Why can't writers from other fields (like experimental Physics, Chemistry and Biology) make things super interesting like this? This is evident in the abundance of physics books aimed at the general public. Is it because theoretical physics is all there is to it-- theoretical? Is it because theoretical physics is either an incessant succession of mathematical equations or highly complex experimental evidence, that they resort to explaining things like you're a five-year-old? And it actually works. I love how Prof. Brian Greene gives endless analogies, sometimes repetitive, to make sure that his message gets through his audience. He understands how intimidating the concepts can be. He avoids math entirely, but explains in a very detailed, patient way. I never thought I'd appreciate theoretical physics, even after watching 12 seasons of The Big Bang Theory. I only picked up this book because of the Netflix drama ""Dark"" and I just wanted to know more about time travel. But now, theoretical physics will be one of the subjects for my future reading lists, in addition to politics, finance, history and art. I cannot say that I fully understand everything now, despite the numerous thought experiments in the book. But the book piqued my interest enough that I'm watching YouTube videos about the subject every now and then. And of course, the book is dumbed down. It's meant for people with very little background of theoretical physics, so we could never expect one to be an expert after reading the book. And that's what makes it so great. It leaves you wanting for more. Still, it is not a quick read. It needs patience and an active mind from the reader. Otherwise, skimming through it will be a total waste of time. Looking forward to reading other books from Prof. Greene, Carl Sagan, Sean Carroll and Stephen Hawking in the future.Note: I'm a chemist. I work at the interface of chemistry, biology and medicine."
111,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4262636-john-michael-strubhart,5,"This book was published in 2004, so, yes - it's dated, but mainly in that some of the things that Brian hoped for have come to pass, like the discovery of gravitational waves by LIGO and the evidence to support the existence of the Higgs particle/field. Of course, any advances in the cutting edge research described that have been made since 2004 are not included. My biggest disappointment is that Brian doesn't have a support page for this book. In this book, Brian Greene gets down to the nuts and bolts of exactly what space and time are. He takes the reader through the history of the subject, and avoiding mathematical treatment at all costs, brings the reader to the state of the science as of 2004. He makes extensive use of analogies, but is careful to point out the limitations of the analogies he uses. The last 40% of the book or so, Brian gets more into the speculative views and cutting edge research into string/brane theory and even loop quantum gravity. He take the aside note several times to point out that experimental evidence is needed to bring these views and hypotheses into the mainstream of science, which is better than he did in his previous book. I think that maybe Neil got on his case about it. Anyhow, for its lack of mathematical treatment of the subject, the very abstract concepts are explained in great detail and Brian patiently hammers them home from multiple perspectives. Realizing that he is nearly beating a dead horse at times, he even advises readers who don't want to get that intimate with the subject to skim or even skip ahead, but he is faithful to his die-hard readers. You gotta love him for that! See the PBS/NOVA series and read this book as carefully or as casually as you like. I assure you that you will be educated, fascinated and mystified - in that order. "
112,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2615246-elgin,5,"This was my favorite Brian Greene so far, even though I was a little late reading it...the existence of the Higgs boson has been verified and gravitational waves have been detected. I would have loved to have read Greene's interpretations and ideas in light of these recent discoveries (so I will look for a later book.) Brian Greene writes about a deep, complicated subject in an incredibly clarifying way. He clearly spends time thinking about what he wants to communicate and how, finally homing in on an insightful allegory or illustration to help the reader's understanding.The thing I like most about this book are the revelations about how very strange is the universe. Theories now point to our universe having at least 10 spacial dimensions (7 of them on such a small scale that they are undetectable). Nonetheless, there is a very good chance that evidence in support of these extra dimensions will be produced in the new super-colliders. Scientists have deduced the state of the universe 10^(-30) seconds or so after the big bang, finding evidence for a super-cooled field that drove a rapid inflationary period and then evolved into the Higg's field (responsible or particles having mass.) In fact, recent ideas suggest that space and time are ""granular"" (that is there is a limit to how finely they can be divided) and in fact that space it self may be constructed out of some yet to be detected fundamental building blocks. All through Greene's book is are the underlying questions: what IS space? what IS time? Why do these two things even exist? These are fundamental, intriguing questions; it is exciting to live in times when some of these questions might start to be answered."
113,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10621457-keith,4,"“The Fabric of the Cosmos” is one of the more interesting and captivating books that I have ever read. Brian Greene is a physicist in his own right, but he is more or less the “narrator” as he follows the greatest minds in history as they attempted to define the universe at every levelBefore the end of the 19th century, some thought that, with the incorporation of electricity and magnetism, and with Newton in their back pocket, that physics had come to an end and all that was left was measurement (I actually remember this from engineering Physics almost 40 years ago!). But what Greene tells us is “buckle your seatbelts, you ain’t seen nothing yet.The book is not technical, it is qualitative. Even at that, there were some things that left me dizzy. At the first of the book it was pretty “simple,” first Newton, then Einstein and spacetime, then time itself and the flow of time, then on to entropy and gravity – the simple stuff. Then he starts making my head go around in circles with quantum mechanics, symmetry, cosmology, the shape of space, the Higgs field, on to string theory then superstring theory, and other dimensions.It is a hard book to summarize, because the subjects are so esoteric and seemingly at odds, but all at once making sense together.Brian Greene is a great writer. Again, as a “narrator,” he rarely inserts his viewpoint (which I’m sure is relevant), and lets the story flow. This is not a book to be digested in an afternoon, but one to be considered for the unfathomable complexities it covers.Finally, I would say that Greene and his colleagues and predecessors, belongs to a group of really super-smart people that makes us poor mortals realize what we really are."
114,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13061921-oth-n-a-le-n,5,"Amazing book! Brief: Cosmology, the structure of the universe, general relativity, special relativity, quantum mechanics, entanglement, strings theory, time travelling, teletransportation, etc. at their best. I especially enjoyed the simple way Mr Greene makes such complex topics accessible to not versed in physics readers, like me! The most appreciated sections of the book for me were those dealing with Einstein's relativity, both general and special and how they relate to older and current cosmological theories and of course, their unification with quantum mechanics. Thanks to this book I realise I was missing very much information on these three fundamental theories; for instance, in regards to relativity, on how gravity depends not only on mass and energy but also on pressure, wow for that! The way Mr Greene deals with the quantum measurement problem is also fascinating; I had no idea (at all) of that. Entanglement and the explanation of why everything is not connected to everything were also mouth opening (as so many other things in this book). Unfortunately, I am sure, I arrived late to this party; the book is from 2004 and it even comes after his previous book and one of my next reads, ""The Elegant Universe"" (tell me about chaos! Haha...); I am certain many things have been added to these topics in the more than the twelve years that have gone by since Mr Greene wrote it, nevertheless, I learnt a lot.If you want to understand in about 30 or 35 hours of reading about the nature of the universe and therefore about ours, this is the book."
115,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25600796-angel,3,"Brian Greene has done it again: make science easy and fun to understand. ""The Fabric Of The Cosmos: Space, Time, And The Texture Of Reality"" is a great work of non-fiction from its preface to its last page.The story goes this way: it tells the story of the universe from the beginning of times (if there was something like that) to the future (if there is something like this), stopping to explain different understandings of time (it goes by really fast) and space (which seems to vibrate a lot). We get cameos from Bart Simpson or Chewie and even a very cool DeLorean.Greene knows what he is doing. He is interested in making science interesting (he, he...) and he knows how to do it. The examples are clear, the science simplified but not simple, and his writing style is engaging and enjoyable, never becoming too technical, and always fun. It falls sometimes into repetition ('the mathematical inclined reader' just too cringeworthy after its umpteenth appearance) and sometimes it all sounds a little mumblejumble (reader's fault), but it never becomes boring. Only the last third, with string theory, supersymmetry and similar it may become a little bit too head-scratching.The other minor quibble is that some of the ground (or quite a lot, depending on your views) was already tread in his previous work, ""The Elegant Universe"".

The book is split rather conveniently into all discoveries pertaining to the concept of space (general relativity, Newtonian mechanics), then time (Boltzmann concept of entropy, arrow of time), and finally the fabric of the cosmos (string/M theory, higher dimensions, time travel, quantum mechanics). The book is well structured, and easily understood, a laudable feat especially considering that it attempts to explain physical concepts while still maintaining a certain paucity of mathematical formulae. Now a complaint I have about the book is that certain concepts were not entry level and required prior knowledge on the readers part. I felt while reading that had I not known about this particular topic from previous curiosity driven escapades, I would have a hard time understanding what was being taught. The portion on relativity was poorly explained, and other portions (quantum mechanics) were not fully delved into, atleast not to a point where a greater understanding could have been ascertained. Other than that, it was a solid book, one that I would not re-read in its entirety, but I would go back to sections that caught my interest. Also: Big Bang theory season 4 episode 20"

I appreciated the compilation of modern physics topics (no matter how scattered or loosely related) and compared to many other popular physics books this one discusses more superstring theory and touches on M theory which is nice. However the amount of times I rolled my eyes reading Simpsons or X-Files metaphors to describe the multiverse was unnecessary, especially since many times the metaphors were flawed. (for example the bowl metaphor for the Higgs field zero value). I also didn’t love how Greene would pose a question and then deliver multiple answers- I would prefer to have it structured initially as a listing of the different proposals so you aren’t filling in the gaps prematurely, and then maybe discussing after. The organization and recall when reading could have been improved with a table of proposals under each theory or at least with bolded words- even when I was well versed in a topic it was hard to keep track of what he was talking about simply from lack of structure. It’s also important to note that this book was written right before the Large Hadron Collider opened so several suggestions regarding residue energy from Higgs collisions is outdated. Still really like this book though, and it reminded me of several topics that I’d like to continue researching!"

For example, the travel along a northern and a northeastern axis is great to illustrate travel along the time and space dimension. Unfortunately, the writer tended to be too repetitive or elaborate. Sometimes, too many pages were spent in describing a simple idea. I am sure most readers will get the idea of non-locality or entanglement with just 25% of the text. The lead-up to the idea that entropy was very low at the creation of the universe and therefore has been increasing was simply excessive, giving the impression that the writer is engaging in page-fillers like a poor fiction author. The writer also seemed to think that repetitions will clarify a complex idea. This gets very tiresome and energy sapping after a while. Much as I love to follow all the concepts and finish the book, I found myself skipping entire chapters. Then at chapter 14 in the section on Reality and Imagination, you find that old tiresome discussion on Einstein, Mach and the spinning bucket once again. What is the point here? Ultimately, I could not bother to finish the book. Quite disappointing."

Pros: - (somewhat) accessible for laypeople- Some good analogies- Well-structuredCons: - Inaccessible in many spots- Some terrible analogies (unless you watch the Simpsons. I don't)- Uneven in the amount of depth with which each topic is explored. Some concepts get a simple ""it's that way because of math"" while others get an entire proof lasting dozens of pages.I came away understanding the possibility of multiple dimensions, entanglement, and time's arrow, which was all I could have expected. I was frustrated with Green's treatment of entropy. Really? it's more probabilistic for the entire universe to have jumped into existence at this very moment, including the ordering of thoughts and memories in my mind, than for us to have arrived at this moment naturally, and yet ""we choose"" to accept a natural occurrence anyway? I have a problem with this."
120,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84682964-hai,4,"A comprehensive book outlining the important developments in theoretical physics in a logical and somewhat inspiring way. The book is perfect for a layman who wants to really familiarize him/herself on important concepts in the realm of theoretical physics and avoid the ""pop-sciency"" side of say, articles on the Internet or explanation videos on you tube. The author reserves mathematical/technical jargon and uses highly visual metaphors to describe these physics concepts. In addition, the author tends to reserve his opinions and does his best to focus much more of the book on experimentally proven concepts.Overall, it's a perfect book for a hobbyist like me. I gave it four stars only because it skimmed through some details I thought were rather important to explain. Highly recommended. Also, if you are new to the subject matter, the book is not intended as a fast read. You will need to take breaks and mull over the concepts presented here."
121,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85367851-eduardo-rocha,4,"To the review inclined reader, I'd like to say (like many other reviewers to this book have) that this is no easy read. Quite far from the basic aspects shown in Sagan's books, this feels like a nice bridge between science communication and an actual science book, meaning it goes further in depth on the scientific concepts shown, but there are still a lot of analogies to ease things up (and an awful lot of those are used with Simpsons' character). Some parts are quite a headache, but I'd say that's much more to blame on the difficulty of grabbing such complex concepts rather than Greene's skill in presenting them to the reader. The only thing thing that feels tiresome it's the excess of examples that Greene quotes. There are always three of them, and he is always reaffirming what he's shown. Sometimes it's pretty helpful, but also tiresome. All in all, it's was a worthful read. I have a different view of string theory, and it's clearer how works in Cosmology can be achieved."

I enjoyed this one more than the Elegant Universe. The first book laid so much groundwork that this book built upon, that it felt far less technical and dense to get to the heart of the matter. It also feels more philosophical which appeals to me. I like the science but there’s something to be said about the Why? and not just the How?Brian Greene’s examples and de-jargon-ifying (definitely a word, look it up) is on point as ever. I love the George and Gracie references of the Elegant Universe (I assume he’s going with George Burns, “say good night, Gracie” was a references), and the Simpsons allusions of the Fabric of the Cosmos is even better, pop culturally speaking. It makes it fun, accessible. But the explanations are really good, regardless of how entertaining they are in general. "

It is like being back at a college lecture - one that is 22 hours long, but one that I actually want to attend. But the content is great. This is actually my second reading of this book. With the successes reported by LIGO this year, it sparked my interest to tackle this one again.Despite the author making the content as straight-forward as possible, I do think some will struggle. A math and science background will help here somewhat, but I think unless you were focused on physics or physical chemistry you will still have some gaps in your background for reading this book. You may have to re-read a passage or two for better understanding or maybe (gosh!) look up something on your own. But I think most people can get through it, and it will open your eyes to how strange our universe really is."

From the parts where we memorized Newton's laws without ever asking: ""So, if every motion is relative, what is the acceleration in the second law relative to?""; to relativity, quantum physics, cosmology and string theory. Brian Green lets his enthusiasm about physics come out in every line and involve you. The book is written in a simple yet captivating way. Anyone, with almost no understanding of mathematics can understand it easily. And it helps you gain insight into physic's fundamental theories.I recommend it to all the physics enthusiast out there who have lost hope on finding a text that is not a work of fictional-popular-pseudoscience, and yet not too technical to understand."

Not only are there notes at the end of the book but there are asterisked parts within the book WHAT? WHAT?????????, Greene tries to relate to to the modern day but as someone who has never watched the Simpsosns or Mulder and Scully he really doesn't achieve that aim. AMOST of all i am sincerely sick of his note ""for the mathematically minded"" this book is meant to be for ALL not just the mathematically minded.

It is very non-mathematical (relying heavily on analogies), while packing serious content. The ideas discussed are complex (obviously!), and the author has taken genuine efforts in explaining them to a layman, while not ""dumbing them down"". Given all this, I have to acknowledge that I still found it a challenging read. I got stuck at places, had to re-read previous topics, finally taking about two months to finish the book. However, it was an AMAZING read, well worth the effort. The ideas discussed are simply fascinating (my favorite- the delayed choice experiments). The book is heavy, and my only regret is that there is only so much that I can retain. Highly recommended!! "
127,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2873006-manikanta-avinash,4,Excellent summary of how our understanding of cosmos evolved from Newton till modern day String Theory. The author gives excellent analogies to all the concepts wherever possible. The book increases your curiosity in physics and gives a basic understanding of all complex concepts to a non science person almost without any mathematics! Green's strength lies in conveying complex ideas in a easy way with the right kind of analogies which speaks volumes of his capabilities. One thing I got a great explanation that I didn't find elsewhere is on the Spooky Action at a distance or the EPR paradox.  A little biased towards String theory though it is understandable given the author is himself a string theorist. It is almost like he is trying to convince a layman that String Theory is the one most probably going to unite general relativity and quantum mechanics.
128,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23139812-megan-wight,4,"What a project this book was. I would say a couple other physic books should be read prior to this one. It was a little harder than I thought it would be. Something I did love about the author is when he gave us permission to skim through certain sections. I liked reading his perspective, and it was a cool feeling reading about the Higgs particle, knowing now, it has been found and proven. Everything is so small, it gives off an eerie feeling. Brian throws questions out that will turn your mind upside down. Have you ever questioned what “now” means? Is the now, now, or is it now, and now isn’t really now, because we have to take into consideration the delay of our brain to process and interpret the stimuli of now. So is now just an illusion, and a collection of all the memories of other nows? This gives a whole new meaning to mindfulness? So we are trying to understand the world through the window of our brains. We like to look at science as the know all. We have found rules the universe seems to follow, but they will always only be seen through our eyes. Even our eyes absorbing photons affects the results of experiments! The act of observing the experiment changes the results. So can we ever know true reality? Now after learning about entanglement, decoherence, and quantum eraser, the term spookiness at a distance becomes even more meaningful. If two photons become entangled, they will forever be “one”, even if separated by depths of galaxies. Brian tries to find explanations for how this could be possible. Is there a communication well beyond the speed of light? Or are the two photons really one? The level of interconnectedness is bizarre. Einstein found he could do something here, and it can have effects there. How far can you bring this to life in the macro world? The book even mentions black holes can become entangled. Us bigger levels are made up of these quantum small levels. We are living and made up of a world of quantum weirdness. The space that exist between the atoms making up our bodies is mind bending. What makes everything so orderly and separate? Brian talks about entropy, and he uses it as a base to explain the arrow of time, being that entropy is the law saying more order moves towards less order. As the mysteries unravel, think of how the photons, these tiny minute dots have such crazy entanglements, and then think of us humans, tiny dots in the grand scheme of the universe. Are we not capable of crazy “spookiness at a distance”? The universe is expanding at such a high rate(faster than the speed of light) that by the time light reaches us from 14 billion light years away, we will be long gone. Our galaxy will have expanded into nothing. But, what is nothing? Trying to decipher the emptiness we think is vast and nothing, but we find it is actually full of what is called dark matter. Basically this is just a term for something we can’t put a real identity on. The gist is after calculating all the mass inside most of the galaxies, scientist found there isn’t enough matter for gravity to keep the galaxies from spreading out and absorbing into each other. There has to be something giving the galaxies more matter for gravity to do its thing and have individual galaxies rather than one giant galaxy universe. The matter inside the galaxy is what pulls everything in. This matter is called dark matter, they seem to know it exist but they can’t quite get their finger on it. It actually contributes to a significant amount of matter in the universe as well as dark energy which takes up about 70% of the universe. It's the darkness that keeps us together! Dark energy is the energy creating the expansion of the universe. Greene talks a lot about repulsion from gravity as part of the source for the expansion of the universe also but dark energy is another thing they are blaming universal inflation on. It is confusing. Another special something that takes up “nothingness” is the Higgs particle. The higgs particle now known and proven to be a reality exist as a cosmic higgs ocean. The higgs particle gives all matter its mass by the way it interacts with the components it is made of. The more drag the higgs particle gives an electron or quark the heavier it will be. The top quark is the heaviest quark and has the most drag. A photon who has no mass will speed through space at the speed of light because it doesn’t interact and get slowed down by the higgs particle. Quarks on the other hand which make up the elementary particles of matter do interact. Greene- “ A more precise picture is to think of the molasses like drag force of the Higgs ocean as giving mass to fundamental particles such as the electrons and quarks”. Experiments have proven this to be true by releasing I beleive electrons at a high speed and with a freaking bad ass microscope actually seeing the higgs run into the particle released. Super fascinating stuff if you ask me. He talks a lot about the string theory also. Here is a quick quote,”The different vibrational patterns in string theory correspond to different kinds of particles”. E=mc squared which says energy equals mass. So the energy of the vibration of the string creates the particle and its mass. So the lighter particle will be more placid strings. The universe is a symphony of vibrating strings? I am lost. At this point physics becomes more of a philosophy. Which is probably why I love it, even though,I don’t really understand it. Greene ends the book saying,” Looking for familiar spacetime in the deepest laws of nature may be like trying to take in Beethoven's ninth Symphony solely note by single note”. Ah, to me, this means the universe isn’t only beautiful, it is more beautiful than I will ever know. "
129,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5843549-nair,5,"In this book Brian Greene embarks on an explanation of the universe through the eyes of Physics, and it's a wonderful journey.From the reasoning of Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein to recent discoveries and theories, the books presents us with the logic behind all of the well-know theories, and this is by far one of the most important and relevant aspects of it. Being able to see into the minds of our most prominent scientists and how they thought and discovered things that most of us are almost incapable of grasping is humbling but also inspiring.This is not by a very far stretch a light read, but if you manage to get half way through (beyond Newton's bucket experiment) you absolutely won't regret it."
130,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30866944-almustafa-couch,3,"Excellent, a good, basic, outline of Superstring theory and a basic guide to the rudiments of the terminology used in this physics debate. Brian Greene (the author)used some common characters from various (2) popular television programs to illustrate these particular points, and even I who didn't necessarily follow these programs were able to see the relevance of the use. It is a good introductory discussion on the themes involved in this debate ,about,the place played in the theory of reality, concentrating on an understanding of the direction of ""Time""within the theory. Overall I would say that it is a good book for the parameter cosmologist to read, I am not sure how good it would be for anyone with a background knowledge in the field."
131,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"An outstanding workIn some respects this book is an extension (and a substantial one) of physicist Brian Greene's well-received The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory (1999) in which he attempted the very difficult task of explaining relativity, quantum mechanics, and string theory to the educated layperson while keeping the mathematics in footnotes. Here he covers some of the same ground as he patiently and painstakingly illuminates some of the most important ideas in physics and cosmology, employing new ways to explain the nearly unexplainable.His watchword is ""reality"" and his overarching idea is that reality is not as we intuitively think it is. (p. 5) This is one of the startling revelations from relativity and the quantum world: namely that our perceptions and concepts built up through evolutionary experience are NOT adequate to understand the world of the very small or the very large. The dual nature of the particle/wave is the most obvious example, and one that Greene examines at length. We have no way of intuitively appreciating the fact that elementary particles are not just particles but waves as well--actually probability waves. But there is also our notion of something and ""nothing"" that is being tested by modern physics. What appears to be empty space is in fact far from empty. Moreover, space itself has unsuspected qualities, as Greene demonstrates in his discussion of the postulated Higgs fields.Particularly exciting was the way Greene makes inflation credible (""the universe could easily have expanded by a factor of 10 to the 30th, 10 to the 50th or 10 to the 100th or more"" within a time frame ""as short as ten to the minus 35th seconds"" p. 284) by positing that before the Higgs field made its phase transition, all quanta had zero mass. It doesn't take much energy to move something with zero mass. (Or maybe something with zero mass can't be moved at all.) At any rate, very shortly after the big bang, space and presumably time, expanded enormously (faster than the speed of light, actually--but, as Greene, assures us, the speed limit on light does not apply to expanding space).In short what Greene does in this book is take the reader to the edge of what can be understood. What he writes is exciting and awe-inspiring, and he writes so very well, and he works so hard at trying to reach every reader. However you'll forgive me if I get some of this wrong. And of course I am compelled to point out (as Greene does himself) that the Higgs field and therefore inflation, not to mention string theory and M-theory, etc., remain as yet in the category of the not proven.Obvious is Greene's faith in the ""beauty"" of mathematics to point the way to physical truth. He recalls the work of Glashow, Weinberg and Salam in predicting the existence of W and Z particles because of the ""strong faith these physicists had in the power of theory and the beauty of symmetry that gave them the confidence to go forward."" (p. 266) Whether the beauty that physicists see in the equations for string theory, etc., will lead them to a deeper understanding of the cosmos remains to be seen. Most readers are familiar with what one ugly fact can do to a beautiful theory.One of the most enjoyable parts of the book is Greene's delineation of time and time's ""arrow."" I have always been fascinated with time and have spent many hours trying to figure out what it is. Reading between the lines, it would appear that Greene believes that events create time. Or more precisely, that asymmetry creates time. He writes ""If the universe had perfect temporal symmetry--if it were completely unchanging--it would be hard to define what time even means."" (p. 228) Of course this is somewhat circular, but I think I can add that if the universe were completely empty, it would also ""be hard to define"" what time means.On the question of ""Does time have a direction?"" Greene writes that ""the laws of physics...show a complete symmetry between past and future."" (pp. 144-145) Yet, in everyday life, time is always aimed toward the future. An egg splatters. It doesn't unsplatter. Why is that? Greene brings entropy into the picture, noting that entropy has increased since the big bang. He explains that the unsplattered egg has a very low degree of entropy (that is, it is highly ordered, thanks to DNA, energy from the sun, etc.). Eggs splatter more easily than they could ever hope to unsplatter because there are an uncounted number of ways that the egg can have high entropy (ways it can be splattered about) but only one (or very few) ways it can be pristine. In a footnote on page 511 Greene articulates something that I have been waiting to hear from a prominent physicist. Suppose the universe began to contract, seemingly reversing time's arrow. Would eggs unsplatter? Greene's answer: ""Physical processes (eggs breaking, people aging, and so on) would still happen in the usual direction...""What impressed me the most about this book is just how well produced it is. Greene improves on his previous opus in two important ways. His explanations are more detailed and more accessible to the average reader; and his information and understanding are more up to date. Furthermore, the book is beautifully presented with many drawings, a glossary, selected readings for further study, and a fine index. There are 493 pages of text and 43 pages of notes. It is handsomely presented and beautifully edited and proofread. This is a book clearly worth the money and then some. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
132,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1865375-theiron-paw,4,"I marked this as ""read"", but not really - I just need to take a break from the intense level of thought required by this book. Greene has provided me with the most effective explanation of major cosmological theories such as Relativity. However his explanations, for me at least, are very intricate and involved and require me to put the book down, cogitate upon the issues for awhile, then re-read chapters, and repeat till understood or deciding its beyond my ken. This really is a worthwhile exploration of difficult concepts but it takes a lot of work. I am going to take a break from it now, as it moves into the quantum world."

How else if not by using the words “fabric” and “texture” you could capture the attention of millions who are more concerned about what clothes they wear rather what knowledge they possess. If you are off the grid of existential questions, and none of those have ever bothered your calm and smooth mind then you are the part of the problem humanity is facing nowadays.

This is one of those books that needs back to back readings to soak it all in. I set out to read this because I had what I thought was a simple question about the shape of the universe. I came away not with an answer like I expected, but an even deeper mystery, and more possibilities. An now I am not so sure that my original question was even framed correctly anymore, or if it was answered and I just didn't grasp it quite, or if there just isn't a solid answer.

To me, the author was trying to establish the possibilities of 'string theory' to explain the unexplainable universe. It was not absent in the author's mind that the theory has many inconsistencies to fit existing science community. He made those clear in several occasions in the book.

I still don't understand what the significance is of 10 -35th and 10 -33rd is but it's the first seed planted in my brain.

I could do without the Simpsons references, I felt like sometimes he was so focused on incorporating their world that the concept he was trying to explain got a little lost.The really fascinating part for me was at the end where he did an overview of some exciting experiments that were to take place after the book was published. I thought this was really cool because by the time I read it some of these experiments had taken place and I had read about the results. "
138,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88529741-antonio-lizcano,3,"I read this book to learn things about physics. I started many yers ago and finished it off recently, after I trained myself in mathematics. This book is not formal science because it does not contain equations. Moreover, it is not even a book for the layman because it explains things in a difficult way to understand. Perhaps, science today lives mainly out of creating new languages that only a few speak. My conclusion is that modern speculations on physics are far away from those well tested theories of previous centuries. The book is about the promises of modern physics, promises that have not delivered for many years. "

I had probably gone through the vast majority of multiple libraries and bookstores’ theoretical physics sections trying to find an answer to this in a book which I as a 12 year old could at least partially comprehend when I pored over it. The scenarios described to illustrate various principles were excellent."

It deals with concepts of modern physics which are extremely complicated, ambivalent, abstract and mathematical, but Greene is simply a king of alegories and metaphores and his explenations are simply a form of art in themselves. Make no mistake, this is a seriously difficult book. But, on the other hand, it is written in the most approachable way humanly possible concerning the subjects it is dealing with. This is truly a book that expands horizons."

Greene poignantly highlights the theoretical paradox[es] existing between empirical evidence in the quantum, vs. macro realms. I found most of Greene's examples to be tangible, and the expanded chapter notes section served as a sufficient guide when technical detail was necessary. All in all, a very intriguing read that inspires the reader to branch off into specific domains of topics covered (perhaps with some added background knowledge before jumping down the rabbit hole)."

I found the parts about string theory to be less compelling, but that makes sense given the state of theoretical development and lack of experimental verification there. Overall, even 15 years after publication this is a great book for non-physicists who have a lot of amateur interest in astrophysics like myself."

I have seen reviewers claim that this book is appropriate for ""any non-expert"" or ""the average layperson"". These claims are, to put it mildly, a bit of a stretch. I have a pretty substantial grounding in calculus-based physics, and toward the end my ability to even vaguely grasp the more abstract concepts was severely strained.

Because it was written in 2004 there are a lot of experiments that Brian Greene was excited about that we have seen progress on since, such as the completion of the large hadron collider and its subsequent atom smashing. Although the material in this book is deep and complex (what makes up space, the shape of space, the arrow of time, quantum physics, and string theory/M-theory) it is worth the read for lay people that would like a glimpse at the foundation cosmologists are working with.

148,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89684796-faisal-bashir,4,"I think after reading this book, I am perhaps better able to assert my ignorance of many topics, which is to say that it was a rewarding experience and a great introduction to many contemporary and constantly evolving scientific conversations. The details about the string theory near the end went a bit over my head but I'd say I was able to gain some appreciation of the laws that govern our nature and that our understanding of them may not be as definitive as would seem to be the case intuitively. "
149,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74630041-erika,5,"Already a fan of Brian Greene, The Fabric of the Cosmos did not disappoint. Diverse theories handled with necessarily objective exploration, followed by modest and well-reasoned opinions of a noteworthy, intelligent author. I certainly recommend this book to those working in related fields, or with 500+ pages worth of passion on the subject, as it is admittedly a long-term investment for a recreational reader."
150,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59071153-alexander,4,"This one is a tough one to rate. I thoroughly enjoyed Parts 1-3 and the beginning of 4; however, I really struggled to get through the major of Part 4. It might partially be be due to the fact that I’m reading this book 15 years after it was published and I know a large portion of Part 4 has since changed, so it seemed less relevant. To a friend or a person just about to read this book, I’d recommend ending at the end of Part 3 and finding a current book on string theory in place of Part 4. "
151,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18966987-paolo,5,"This book is so great, the topics being discussed aren't definitely easy to understand even from a simple, non technical intuitive point of view. But Greene does such a fantastic job in using metaphors and offering explanations that are easier to grasp despite the content, and also keep the narration flowing and interesting. If you want to know more about the state of the art around the latest theories about who we are and how we came to be, this is definitely an excellent book to start from!"
152,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6755420-lidija,5,"This book hurt my head. I'm definitely not a physics person, but found myself geeking out. It didn't hurt that Dr. Greene won me over by referencing Camus to start out with. I found out that the book inspired a four-part NPR documentary that I watched after reading to solidify some of the key brain-jolting concepts. BEYOND beautiful. "
153,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67520854-hemanth-kotagiri,5,"Massively recommended for people who are hungry for the grasp of the cosmos. Brian slides you through complicated topics like string theory, unification, Newton's bucket analogy, quantum entanglement and more complex topics like relativity very diligently with sheer amazement and highest feeling of curiosity. I enjoyed a lot listening to this book, and I am looking forward to more books like these."
154,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70776713-raj-sadasivam,5,"Though the theories put forward might not be the latest as the book was published few years back, it is a very interesting read as it traces how our understanding of spacetime evolved. Non physics professional like could gather a lot from this book. I did back this up with watching few of his videos in You Tube. Dr. Greene seems to simplify complex concepts and theories to the right extent for my understanding. Hoping to read more of his books soon. "
155,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107312088-paul-widdicombe,5,"It’s rare to find a book that can deal with such extraordinarily difficult concepts such as General Relativity and Quantum physics and make them relatable, and at the same time deliver an historical concept as to how mankind arrived at the such discoveries. Having read several books that have tried to do just that, this one towers above. A must read for anyone grappling to understand the fabric we call the universe. "
156,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7942278-jake,4,"While some of the later chapters needed to be reread, and I feel like some of his sentences desperately need a period here and there... Brian does an excellent job of recapping modern physics from Newton to Einstein, and into string theory (as it was when this book released, anyway). While I had to read the string theory chapters with a grain of salt, I learned so much about the universe and I'm hungry for more!"
157,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11199869-prashant-ghabak,5,"I started reading this book after watching the Netflix series Dark as it got be intrigued about things like Dark matter, Time travel, Multi-verse, etc. Have to the say, the book served tA very accessible book for the layman to understand the mysteries of the universe. The book does get a little overwhelming at times despite the author's best efforts. Overall, a really good read to get a gist of major scientific theories in physics developed over the past few centuries. "
158,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25620507-chris-lins,4,"Very approachable to the layman. It talks about string theory, gravity, and spacetime. basically all the cool shit that people find too difficult to explain without going into to the math. Brian Greene doesn't give you math, he gives you analogies about soup cans and jumping frogs that somehow make perfect sense."
159,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64867731-elvira-tulvik,5,"The best popular science book I have read so far, except, perhaps, those by Stephen Hawking. Everything you ever wanted to understand about the universe is in here, dissected, systemised and illustrated. Intellectual Christmastime. Does require some knowledge of Physics, but if you paid any attention in high school, you should be fine."
160,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70907778-liedzeit,4,"The first part is really a great story, the conflict of relativists against absolutists. Great because I can follow. The true fact is, he loses me. But not completely. I can read it, which is more than can be said of his mother. And she may or may not write the most influential book on string theory. There is hope for all of us."
161,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22857970-gino-filicetti,5,"Fantastic book, I just devoured this one (as an audio book). One of the few audio books that I had to rewind if my mind wandered elsewhere and I didn't take in every last sentence. There's a good bit of information density here and a good mix of explanation for the difficult things but not dumbing it down completely."

163,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76286167-alejo-monta-ez,5,"One of the best books in physics. It shows in an elegant way the advances in the most interesting topics in physics, from General relativity to quantum physics. Also, as a researcher in the superstring theory at last part of this book, Brian Greene presents the principal characteristics of this topic."
164,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28295118-coflo,5,"4.8 stars. A very engrossing introduction to spacetime and cosmology. The writing style is pretty accessible for people like me who haven't studied physics. Difficult concepts and theories are all illustrated with comprehensible analogies and examples. Together with the clips on Youtube, this is surely a great and inspiring read for people interested in general science. "
165,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30087868-unvano,5,"Topic discussed in this book are very interesting, some are a bit hard to chew on, but manageable for laymen. Readers can even skip some part of the discussion and still be able to perceive the essential idea. Great book for general public, I suspect any deeper understanding would require mathematical scrutiny."
166,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66846296-thomson,0,"I'm about a third of the way through - this book is quite lucid and accessible overall.However, the nature of the subject matter is such that you have to read carefully and truly understand the concepts presented or risk getting really conceptually disoriented. I started to feel this way and think I'll take a break and then come back and re-read the first chunk again before forging on."
167,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92326484-russell-kapryn,5,"This is an exquisite book that can be enjoyed by the novice and intermediate reader alike. You will learn and gain a lot from reading this publication. Pursuant to this, it is fun to reflect on the discoveries that have been made since its release in 2004. This is an overall great book all around and is highly recommended to read."
168,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95378270-greg,4,"Brian Greene explains physics better than just about anybody. That being said, the book can feel like work at times because it’s so technical (even though the metaphors and humor help) and is a bit outdated now. Since it was published, CERN has been operating for years and the Higgs Boson has been discovered. Still worth reading."
169,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75263340-jackson-curtis,3,"For a physics novice like me, I loved that this book was so thorough and went into a lot of depth while requiring fairly little background knowledge. It had a lot of interesting stuff. I felt like it dragged on toward the end, mostly because a lot of the complexities went over my head while I wasn't paying enough attention as I listened to it."
170,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15747665-brady,5,"I thought this was a better than Elegant Universe. It gives a better, more well rounded, excellent explanations for what is going on modern theoretical physics relating to space and time (spacetime). String theory gets a lot of attention but it doesn’t get the spotlight throughout the whole book as it did in Elegant Universe. Brian Greene is quickly becoming my favorite science author."
171,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100862653-abdul-qayoum,5,"This book entails everything that indicates time, space, and takes you to eleven dimensions with string and superstring theory. The reason why cosmology is different from physics and others? what is the direction of time? where our universe came from? how to teleport? how to make black holes? what is an egg to do with the universe? "
172,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60520222-laureen-solari,4,"I generally don’t write reviews for books, but I listened to this book on audible and felt i needed to mention that the narrator is awful. Several times I was so distracted by his voice that I had to rewind and relisten. Other than that, I enjoyed the book and shared many parts with my high school kids. Great conversation starters! "
173,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49774256-katie,1,"BORING.Listened to the audiobook. Way Too verbose. Very easy to lose interest in the topics because of the narration and the over-use of fancy words. Just because its science, you dont have to use thd thesaurus for every other word. Explanations are quite poor tooWould not recommend. There are definitely better books out there in this genre."
174,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65954128-kevin-cooper,5,"Brian Greene shows space and time in a light that has never been represented with such enthusiasm and clarity as in The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time and the Texture of Reality. Greene follows space in time from classical physics proposed by Newton through Einstein's special and general relativity and then finishes on how space and time could be altered through time travel and wormholes. Greene induces levity into a hard subject by using analogies of Bart, Lisa and all of the other simpson’s hijinx and using modern physics to explain. The main theme of this book is the ever evolving understanding of space and time which is why he chooses to follow space and time throughout. The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time and the Texture of Reality is for all people who have an interest in modern physics and are willing to read at a slower pace so they can digest the information. Greene’s writing style is great for understanding complex topics because he does not dwell of the details but still explores breadth and depth of each topic. The book would be an excellent aid in a modern physics class because it addresses similar topics in a different light that helped me to understand some concepts far better then when just taught in a classroom. "
175,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12090782-rachel,3,"An excellent introduction to string theory and hidden dimensions for the uninitiated. Though long stretches of the book were difficult to follow, the text crystallized nebulous concepts such as black holes and the relative nature of spontaneity. "
176,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17333506-ander-nesser,3,"Rather dumbed down; rife with mundane metaphor; too much verbiage wasted on String Theory; at least two conceptual errors that I counted. Otherwise, it's a fairly good book. A little dated now that gravity waves and the Higgs field have been observed empirically."
177,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63306092-airida-zavadske,4,"Great book. A bit too difficult for me, though. It's a bit old already, but it's very interesting to read about some concepts, like Higgs boson or gravitational waves, which have been known like theoretical concepts at the moment when the book has been written, but confirmed in recent years."
178,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46138260-jamadagni-pariti,4,A great universal journeyThis books takes us through some of the proven facts about the universe and then explores the current analysis into breakingdown and understand the universe around us and understanding spacetime itself. A must read for people with cosmic curiosity.
179,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533949-kimball,2,Only two stars because much of it went way over my head. I enjoy the cosmos and learning about it but I need to be careful because I can't understand everything on it. But he did explain String Theory well so that was a plus. Motion has meaning only in a relational sense.The end.
180,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13895962-parker,4,Enjoyable. Some great parts that really explain the current understanding of the fabric/spacetime/aether/vacuum/11 dimensions that we live in.

181,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56275065-denise-k,5,Another great book from Brian Greene! I absolutely love how he explains these complex topics in analogies that make a lot of sense. This is one of my favorite works by him. Highly highly recommended. 
182,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49343119-pranav,4,A highly recommended book for physics enthusiasts. This book will take you into a journey through the cosmos. Brian Green has done a great job explaining concepts like Arrow of time and quantum entanglement in a very simplified way.
183,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70296246-allen,5,"Absolutely mind blowing. A very approachable book on cutting edge physics (no math). I loved all the analogies he used to explain concepts, and especially how he mixed in things like The Simpsons and X-files."

286,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33128262-tony-taylor,5,"If you’re curious about the universe, if you always had a hankering to understand relativity, quantum mechanics, string theory, M-theory, and how many supersymmetric particles can dance on the head of a pin, one of the ways to make a little progress on your never-ending journey of understanding reality is to read Brian Greene’s The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality.He begins with a spinning bucket of water to illustrate the notions of motion held by Newton, Leibniz, Ernst Mach, and Einstein in their conflicting views of absolute versus relative space. For a couple of chapters and most of a hundred pages he threads the ideas of those thinkers through that simple spinning bucket and concludes unsurprisingly that Einstein has the best handle on the issue with his general relativity theory supporting a surprisingly absolute concept of spacetime and accelerated motion. And Greene manages this while not putting you to sleep, keeping you entertained with intuitive analogs and earthy examples such as a pistol duel between two whimsically named characters, Itchy and Scratchy.Although my educational background is physics (from a long time ago), I learned something new—an astounding revelation for me in a chapter devoted to quantum theory. To the counter-expectations of Einstein and many others, physics (aka nature and reality) was proven to be non-local as a result of experiments in the 1970s and 1980s based on an insight by physicist John Bell in 1964. This earth-shaking result, violating the cherished notion of the locality of physics, establishes that things can be interconnected instantaneously at a distance, sinking Einstein’s notions of hidden variables and the incompleteness of quantum mechanics. The experimental establishment of quantum entanglement and the discovery that it apparently disobeys the law—the speed limit of light—nearly brought down the Special Theory of Relativity, leaving it in a delicate and unsteady balance with quantum theory.The book progresses through three more broad themes—“Time and Experience,” “Spacetime and Cosmology,” “Origins and Unification”—before concluding with a final “Reality and Imagination.” The topics within those themes include the ebb and flow of time and its dance with entropy (which way does time’s arrow point?), the teeming fullness of the cosmic vacuum, the Higgs field and the Big Bang, repulsive gravity, inflation and a runaway universe, string theory and M-theory, and curled-up six-dimensional Calabi-Yau shapes in ten-dimensional spacetime.As might be expected, the last theme, “Reality and Imagination,” is full of blue sky (or should that be black sky?) conjectures on dark matter, dark energy, and the fate of the universe among other things, but among those other things is discussed the concrete and tantalizing possibility that strings (the fundamental constituents of string theory whose different vibrational modes constitute everything we’re made of) might be much larger than previously thought, which would translate into the CERN Large Hadron Collider finding scads and scads of previously unseen supersymmetric particles, like ”a well-hit golf ball ricocheting around the inside of a piano.” The book was written in 2004, and since then the first phase of collider operations has concluded with the discovery of the Higgs particle but not much else. Although this is not a refutation of string theory, it puts a damper on some aspects of it that Greene waxes enthusiastically about. There remains a chance that the future upgraded version of the collider will find something in its extended energy range.This book manages to make an entertaining story out of an incredibly esoteric and still unsettled field. Greene is a master of the simple and easily grasped analogy, which is why his explanations are so easy to follow and understand. He more than acknowledges the incompleteness of our knowledge of the cosmos, and in fact revels in its incompleteness as an exciting path forward through a jungle of unknowns, a never-ending path of adventure for the human spirit. If you’re curious about the cosmos and the meaning of space and time, then The Fabric of the Cosmos is your book. It does a damn good job of laying out some of the answers and being entertaining as well, but leaves plenty more unknowns to ponder ...But then that’s the nature of the infinite journey we’re on, isn’t it?"
287,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772165-parksy,4,"Very cool overview of the state of physics and the cosmos to date. In depth, but still quite readable.---------Amazon.comAs a boy, Brian Greene read Albert Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus and was transformed. Camus, in Greene's paraphrase, insisted that the hero triumphs ""by relinquishing everything beyond immediate experience."" After wrestling with this idea, however, Greene rejected Camus and realized that his true idols were physicists; scientists who struggled ""to assess life and to experience the universe at all possible levels, not just those that happened to be accessible to our frail human senses."" His driving question in The Fabric of the Cosmos, then, is fundamental: ""What is reality?"" Over sixteen chapters, he traces the evolving human understanding of the substrate of the universe, from classical physics to ten-dimensional M-Theory.Assuming an audience of non-specialists, Greene has set himself a daunting task: to explain non-intuitive, mathematical concepts like String Theory, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, and Inflationary Cosmology with analogies drawn from common experience. For the most part, he succeeds. His language reflects a deep passion for science and a gift for translating concepts into poetic images. When explaining, for example, the inability to see the higher dimensions inherent in string theory, Greene writes: ""We don't see them because of the way we see…like an ant walking along a lily pad…we could be floating within a grand, expansive, higher-dimensional space.""For Greene, Rhodes Scholar and professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University, speculative science is not always as thorough and successful. His discussion of teleportation, for example, introduces and then quickly tables a valuable philosophical probing of identity. The paradoxes of time travel, however, are treated with greater depth, and his vision of life in a three-brane universe is compelling and--to use his description for quantum reality--""weird.""In the final pages Greene turns from science fiction back to the fringes of science fact, and he returns with rigor to frame discoveries likely to be made in the coming decades. ""We are, most definitely, still wandering in the jungle,"" he concludes. Thanks to Greene, though, some of the underbrush has been cleared. --Patrick O'KelleyFrom Publishers WeeklyString theory is a recent development in physics that, by positing that all which exists is composed of infinitesimally small vibrating loops of energy, seeks to unify Einstein's theories and those of quantum mechanics into a so-called ""theory of everything."" In 1999, Greene, one of the world's leading physicists, published The Elegant Universe (Norton), a popular presentation of string theory that became a major bestseller and, last fall, a highly rated PBS/Nova series. The strength of the book resided in Greene's unparalleled (among contemporary science writers) ability to translate higher mathematics (the language of physics) and its findings into everyday language and images, through adept use of metaphor and analogy, and crisp, witty prose. The same virtues adhere to this new book, which offers a lively view of human understanding of space and time, an understanding of which string theory is an as-yet unproven advance. To do this, Greene takes a roughly chronological approach, beginning with Newton, moving through Einstein and quantum physics, and on to string theory and its hypotheses (that there are 11 dimensions, ten of space and one of time; that there may be an abundance of parallel universes; that time travel may be possible, and so on) and imminent experiments that may test some of its tenets. None of this is easy reading, mostly because the concepts are tough to grasp and Greene never seems to compromise on accuracy. Eighty-five line drawings ease the task, however, as does Greene's felicitous narration; most importantly, though, Greene not only makes concepts clear but explains why they matter. He opens the book with a discussion of Camus's The Myth of Sisyphus, setting a humanistic tone that he sustains throughout. This is popular science writing of the highest order, with copious endnotes that, unlike the text, include some math."
288,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12830124-christopher-l,5,"The book The Fabric of the Cosmos by Brian Greene is a book that is very informative but is still intriguing. I like how the book showed that optimism is key, which I can relate to because I made my entire photo essay on optimism. The book takes you through the history of physics, all the way from Newton up to String theory. The book will make you realize what you thought was the truth, is actually just an illusion. I had a great time reading this book and I also feel it also enhanced my knowledge in the world of physics. In the Novel the author makes an apparent argument that just because something (theories, equations, etc.) get triumphed by new and more accurate things doesn’t mean that the original thing is wrong or that we should that person any less credit for coming up with it. “Newton’s theory of gravity has been superseded by Einstein's theory of General Relativity, but it would be naïve to say that Newton’s theory was wrong.” In this quote the author couldn’t have been more direct in making his argument. He shouted, “give Newton his credit”, and it made me think. What I realized he was saying was that we are too focused on things that are brand new, we forget that without the person who started it all, no one would be able to make more advanced versions of that thing or idea. I feel like this goes for everything, not just physics. We need to appreciate those who made the original product were just as--if not more-- important than those who built apon it. One main conflict in the novel is that General Relativity and quantum physics don’t match up. Since general relativity is about things as big as stars and galaxies and quantum physics is things that are extremely small, you’d think that they wouldn’t need to mix. And you’re right, except for the big bang, when things are really small, are also really massive. “This requires a theory that would have to overcome perhaps the greatest obstacle theoretical physics has faced in the past 80 years: a fundamental rift between General Relativity and quantum physics.” As you can see this is obviously a giant problem, two of the most widely accepted theories in physics come up with complete non-sense when they are put together. To resolve this conflict the author talks about Superstring and M theory which (in their simplest forms) add spacial dimensions to the universe so that General Relativity and quantum physics come together. I find string/M theory very interesting, but trying to imagine more spatial dimensions is next to impossible. That is why I feel that as physics, we should keep our minds open and work hard to try and solve the problem of unifying General Relativity and quantum physics. The big picture or theme the author has is that in physics, once you think you finished one problem(or anything), you've opened the door to so many other ones. He shows this in multiple ways. One is “With this stunning realization, Einstein’s general relativity exposed a loophole in the more than two-hundred-year-old belief that gravity is always an attractive force . . . when pressure is negative, there is a contribution to gravity that would have shocked Newton. It’s repulsive.” This is a prime example that figuring out one things, just opens up a whole new world of unknown things. Einstein figured out his theory of General Relativity, which in turn helped us gain key information into the Big Bang. I feel that this theme is important in the field of physics because without it we would probably would have felt we understood everything, which is far from the truth. I feel that the lessons learned in this book can help you to live life with a greater appreciation of people who invented or made the original, and it can help you live with more optimism that there is always something bigger and better. As I have shown, this book taught me a lot about physics but it also helped me live my life better than I did before. Not to mention this book was extremely interesting and made me not want to put it down the whole time. All in all, if you want to learn about physics or just want to read an extremely interesting book, then I suggest you pick this book up."

About 3/4 the book is devoted to relativity, Higgs Theory, and cosmic inflation, while the latter fourth is devoted to discussions of string theory and it’s potential application to spacetime (more expansive discussions can be found in The Elegant Universe). In summary good read, dense at times, but was very rewarding.Note: string theory, especially, has adherents and opposition; take those sections with a grain of salt.

292,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29257231-neil-cake,5,"My investigation into physics and where the universe came from continues. In this book, Brian Greene gives us a history of science from Newton and classical physics, through the special and general theories of relativity, quantum mechanics and ever onward into string theory, branes and beyond. By the end you're getting into the realms of fantasy - by which I mean theories for which no experimental evidence has yet been found - but it is all fascinating and presented with as little recourse to maths as possible. Which is useful because I wouldn't understand that. Not understanding that, you of course have to take Greene's word for it at times because there's no way for you to verify the workings and conclusions. You just have to trust that professional physicists haven't missed anything, or made any mistakes, or form part of an evil club that wants us all to believe some over-complicated, made up shit for their own nefarious ends. Thankfully there is enough that makes sense, and that has been proven experimentally for me to have faith in what I'm reading. What could their nefarious aims be anyway? Wasting millions of pounds on particle accelerators, continuing to write on blackboards and wearing brown at every available opportunity?So Greene is able to describe [most of] these discoveries and theories in purely conceptual ways, which means mathematical dunces like me can comprehend it. Some credit for that might go to the fact that I've read about some of this stuff before, so it may be sinking in, but it is getting clearer and this probably is the clearest description - particularly of quantum mechanics - that I've come across so far. I think back to Brian Cox's ""The Quantum Universe"", and apart from the slit experiment, I can't even remember what else he filled the book with. It was almost incomprehensible, and full of all this stuff about winding clocks. None of that here. Cox's method reminded me of when you have a shit maths teacher (as I invariably did at school), and they'd show you an unfathomable method for doing a calculation. Then you'd go home and ask your older, more mathematical sister (by which I mean 'good at maths' rather than 'constructed out of numbers and symbols' any more than the rest of us) to help with your homework, and she'd go, ""what are you doing it like that for? Do it like this..."" and then show you a really easy method that makes you wonder whether the teachers are doing it on purpose. I suppose the aims of these books were different - Cox probably wanted to show off the fancy maths so we don't just think he's a ponce off the telly.I enjoyed reading this - particularly the part where I got to look intelligent, reading it on the train - though I have to agree with other reviewers that using characters from popular culture in examples was... annoying, for lack of a better word. The main gripe though, is that, being published in 2004 or 2005, it's more than a decade out of date, so I had to look up some things on Wikipedia to see if there had been any breakthroughs since. The Big Hadron Collider (sic - I'm not an imbecile) was still under construction at the time, so when Greene hints at what it might be able to tell us, you want to know whether that turned out to be the case. I can't see that the LHC has found definitive proof of the Higgs Boson, but it does seem at least that the existence of gravity waves have been confirmed by LIGO. So that's quite exciting, and it isn't really the book's fault that it's 10 years old anyway. If you're after a comprehensive but accessible introduction to cosmology, I can heartily recommend this. Should I give it 5 stars? Hard to say... it's hard to give anything 5 stars. Could this book have been any better? In all fairness, probably not much. Go on then, I will."
293,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77114510-lie-poplawski,5,I love Brian Greene's books. This was a fascinating journey through the history of our understanding of space and time and the current theories surrounding their creation and makeup.
294,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21730963-ad-n-galv-n-gonz-lez,5,"This is a very enlightening book, it provides good examples with familiar things that we know. In my opinion the books that cover the topics of string theory, quantum theory, relativity, time and space are always difficult to follow, the author has to connect with their audience by giving meaningful examples and this book is a great example.I loved the part in which the author contrasted the free will(quantum theory) and the “future is already set/ defined states in matter “(classic Physics) when traveling through time with the example of back to the future."
295,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875081-arvind-balasundaram,5,"In this beautifully written book, string theorist Brian Greene takes on the enormously difficult task of explaining the puzzling and complex world of modern-day theoretical physics in language aimed at the common reader, and succeeds brilliantly.Beginning with a simple articulation of space as fixed and absolute in the Newtonian model, Greene uses easy-to-grasp analogies to progress to Einstein's conception of relativity and spacetime, and how gravity in essence represents the warping and curving of the spacetime fabric. He motivates arguments that most of us take for granted without ever questioning - why does time always flow only in one direction as we perceive it, when all physical laws are time-symmetric, and are valid forwards or backwards? Why for example, asks Greene, do we see an egg roll off the kitchen counter and splatter into many pieces, but never do we see this process work in reverse - splattered egg shells on the ground assemble into a whole egg on the counter? The author convincingly traces the basis of time flow only forwards to the Big Bang and creation of high order and low entropy states in its immediate aftermath. Greene then introduces the reader to the most current ideas in cosmology - the stretching of space and time, inflationary expansion of the universe, the concept of the Higgs ocean and how mass arises. Is there one grand unified theory that connects the microcosmic world with the macrocosmic, asks Greene, and how does one reconcile the world of the quantum with the world of general relativity in cosmology? This is possible, he argues, in the domain of string theory & M-theory, which he explains with an artistic balance of the high science and the basic ideas behind the framework. Here the reader is introduced to a mind-numbing world of many dimensions, branes, time travel, and wormholes. Greene develops strings as the essence of the fundamental structure of everything as opposed to point particles, and shows how this resolves age-old problems in particle physics such as the infinite regress that one encounters in reconciling quantum ideas with relativity. Vibrating strings and quantum jitters lead to a more clear articulation of how three of the four forces we know (electromagnetic, strong force, and weak force) work within branes while gravity can work across branes, and hence may resolve some unexplainable paradoxes that we perceive. Greene offers easy to grasp analogies to help the reader grapple with a world of multiple dimensions, and makes this complex domain of the academic physicist comprehensible for the intellectually curious layperson to explore.The style in which this book is written makes it impossible to put down. This is a world of the fantastic, of travels to galaxies far, far away where one can depart from earth at light speed for a 6-hour round trip to say Andromeda, only to return back to an Earth that is many million years in the future. It is a world of quantum entanglement, where particles separated by enormous distances are in complete sync, and where the moon may not exist if you are not actually seeing it, even if you did see it only a moment ago. Reading this book will enlighten the reader as to why things are as they are, and to wonder ""Are they, really?"" This is a roller coaster ride that must not be passed up, one in which the mind whirls between ideas concerning worlds extremely small and large, in the tutelage of a master storyteller of the cosmos and the mysteries of our universe. What a wild ride this is, and what fun! "

297,0965900584,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality. Which is a pretty big topic to fit into one book. Greene does a fairly good job of it, but it says something about his REAL topic, that he dare not put it into the title or subtitle. This is a book about String Theory, the physics theory which dare not speak its name.There's a lot in front of the string theory discussion. Greene delivers one of the more readable summaries (if something which takes about 300 pages can be called a 'summary') of classical, relativistic, and quantum physics. His particular angle in all of this is the nature of space and time, i.e. if the universe is like a painting, are they more like the canvas of a painting, or more like the frame?The problem which all of physics faces, however, is one which we have to face most directly when we look at string theory (or its rivals): physics has gotten ahead of the rest of us. We will need better math, or better software, or better engineering, or maybe even better philosophy before we can find a good way to test these things. Europe hopes to get around these inconvenient obstacles by simply throwing a bajillion euros at the problem and building a collider on the border of France and Switzerland big enough to detect strings, or lack of same, as the fundamental building blocks of the universe.If it happens, it will be nearly the only time string theory has come face to face with experimental evidence in decades since it was first proposed. Right now, it hangs in a weird limbo between science and speculation, much like the ether of 19th century physics, which turned out to be more or less a mass hallucination of the world physics community.Greene does his best to show that things aren't as grim as all of that. He reminds us of the context in which relativity and quantum physics were developed, and how they both were starved for experimental data for a time. But his history of physics also serves as an excellent reminder of how far off base even the sharpest minds can get when they don't have empirical evidence to right their course from time to time.This book is worth reading though, if only for the first several sections where he explains just how weird the (already well attested) theories of relativity and quantum physics are compared to our intuition. It helps that he sets many of his imaginary thought experiments in a town called Springfield, with characters named Bart, Lisa, Homer, Apu, etc. going through wormholes and traveling at nearly the speed of light. If relativity is the Simpsons' territory, quantum physics seems to be Mulder and Scully's, with Scully's skeptical (and Newtonian) view of the universe being constantly upended by Mulder's enthusiastic (and quantum) view. The Truth is Out There, and it's never been this easy to get somewhat of a handle on. String Theory's idea of eleven (or maybe twelve) dimensions is a bit harder to swallow, but give Greene credit, it's not for lack of a cogent and coherent explanation.Maybe, by a decade from now, that collider out in France and Switzerland will prove to us that string theory was all a blind alley, or maybe it will prove that it is the genuine Theory of Everything. Either way, Greene's book is still going to be worth reading, if only for a lighthearted look at some very heavy material about how we got here."

However, there were a few things holding it back from a 5-star review.First, I read ""The Elegant Universe"" in the early 2000's (just a year or two after it was published). At that time all of Greene's forward-looking statements were very exciting. It made the cutting edge of physics seem much more like a spectators sport than it really is. Unfortunately, I somehow overlooked ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" for 7 years and even though it contained a lot of ideas that were new to me it felt a bit dated. The Large Hadron Collider had not come online at the writing of ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" and Greene talks a lot about what it might find (including things that have been discovered and made the news since).Perhaps because Greene's books might become dated he spends a good deal of time rehashing material he has already covered in his previous writings. Also, I suspect that for most people a ten year lapse between reading two of his books would necessitate a bit of a review. But, he did such a good job of explaining relativity and string-theory in ""The Elegant Universe"" that his explanations stuck in my head. So, this complaint should in no way dissuade you from reading his books.Finally, I got a little tired of being told I could skip bits. About half a dozen times in the last half of the book Greene tells the reader something to the effect of ""The next bit is hard so you can skip it if you like."" Was he worried people would put down the book and never pick it up if they encountered a bit of trouble understanding something? The first time I read a passage like that, it served as a challenge to me and I concentrated. By the third time, I started to feel like maybe he was encouraging me to find a different book. The whole point of Pop-Sci Books like this is to dumb-down things that only a few people in the world understand so that those people can share their excitement and their results with the rest of us. Telling your audience they can skip ahead because the next part didn't meet that goal shows a real lack of confidence. ;)Yikes, I just wrote four pretty critical paragraphs about a book that I really enjoyed. Here is a short list of the awesome stuff in this book (because if I keep writing no one will ever read this).1. There is a long passage about the idea that the universe might be a 3-Brane. This is very cool and also something I had not heard before (even though it does make an appearance on Wikipedia).2. The second half of the book has an explanation of the Higgs Field/Particle that since the writing of the book has been ""discovered.""3. An (light-on-details and thus very-understandable) explanation about how string-theory might be made independent of time and space. 4. There is a great explanation of how the ""folded-up dimensions"" that string-theory calls for could actually be bigger than the planck length without us noticing them. Anyway, I look forward to reading ""The Hidden Reality"" and will not wait a decade to do so."

That is a huge thing to wrap your mind around. Every moment in space-time just exists. While we experience the ""arrow of time,"" the feeling of moving forward (which Greene explains) every moment already exists in the universe, and always will. When I saw an episode on NOVA made from this book I knew I had to read it. The episode I saw was ""The Illusion of Time,"" and it blew me away. Watch it at the link and you'll be a 25-point Calvinist.Mathematics might be the highest form of worship; every Christian should read books such as this one about cosmology. The more we learn about the universe, the more improbable a self-existing first cause seems. As Greene points out, the universe we see now is dramatically less probable, statistically speaking, than one that developed from complete randomness. That the universe originated with a low-entropy (Big Bang) event is also highly improbable, but yet we know it happened.The universe started at a size smaller than the period on the end of this sentence. It had incredible symmetry, such that perhaps all of the forces we know today were combined together in one force. The laws of physics break down at that point, there's the incompatibility of quantum mechanics and generaly relativity such that we have a ""fuzzy patch."" But newly-discovered inflationary theory tells us much of what happens after the first moment, exactly how the universe began its incredible rapid expansion. (See Greene's recent article in Smithsonian Magazine).But, the ""fuzzy patch still looks fuzzy.""Galaxies are now moving apart from each other at high rates of speed. We discover planets and learn more about the makeup of the universe every day. The last third of the book deals with super string theory, which Greene also details more thoroughly in The Elegant Universe (some parts seem to be repeated verbatim in both works; I imagine all of his books essentially say the same things in different ways... one has to make money somehow).How many dimensions does space have? 10? More? Why did only 3 dimensions experience inflation after the Big Bang? What about curled dimensions? M theory? Planck length? Those are the tedium in the second half of the book. He does delve into the possibility of Star Trek-like teleportation, showing the recent advances in research that indicate this may one day be possible. Just this week the Army confirmed that it can teleport quantum data, for example.There is also an explanation of the theoretical and mathematical impossibilities of time travel-- traveling backwards in time. These are amusing aspects.Greene frequently uses Simpsons characters in his analogies. It is not nearly as analogic in language as The Elegant Universe, but it's mostly understandable. The second half of the book gets pretty heavy, though, an audio version is the only way I could get through it. When you get bogged down in quantum mechanics it helps to have the audio keep pushing you on to the main point.I really should not judge a book by one that followed it, but I give this book 3.5 stars out of 5.
