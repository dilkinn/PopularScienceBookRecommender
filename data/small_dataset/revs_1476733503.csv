0,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33771-tony,5,"I have this tendency, when I read a book as brilliantly informing as this one, to wipe the froth from my mouth, shuffle the pages of notes I've written contemporaneous to the reading, and plunge into the cocktail party which is this forum, grabbing each of you by the virtual lapels, and launching into a lecture about one of the hundreds of things I learned in the process. As if, you know, I missed some of the froth.So, imagine me back from some journey, casting pleasantries aside, and launching wild-eyed and, yes, maybe a little frothy, insisting that you grasp the fraction of what I've learned via the fraction of my ability to explain, as if it is the most important thing in the world. Until next week's book and next week's cocktail party, that is. Passionate and off-putting. Aware, but unable to stop myself. Yup, that's me. But I have a defense.There's probably a gene that makes me so.Seems I got more than blue eyes from Mom, more than dark hair from Dad. There are many chambers of the human heart and many caverns in the human mind, but they are all there somewhere pinned onto the genome which is Tony.--This book is worth the read just for the section on sickle-cell anemia, or the one explaining the genetic basis for sexual identity, or the story of Mitochondrial Eve. --Did you know that when the Allied forces entered the Nazi death camps, they found an inordinate number of twins among the survivors. This was so because Mengele was fascinated by Zwillinge? These survivors, sharing as they did identical genetic markers, served as the subjects of much subsequent genetic research.--The problem with racial discrimination . . . is not the inference of a person's race from their genetic characteristics. It is quite the opposite: it is the inference of a person's characteristics from their race. But, I've now learned, ""the vast proportion of genetic diversity (85 to 90 percent) occurs within so-called races (i.e., within Asians or Africans) and only a minor proportion (7 percent) between racial groups...""--I knew the story of Carrie Buck, legally sterilized after an Opinion by Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes stating ""Three generations of imbeciles is enough."" But Mukherjee lets that story hover over us as he takes us to a lecture he attended in 2013, a lecture given by a fifteen year-old girl named Erika, who suffered from a severe, progressive degenerative disease, causing muscle tremors that progressively worsened. She tried new drugs, clinical trials. Nothing worked. Yet there she was speaking to this hall of scientists, ""by far, among the most articulate, introspective teenagers that I have ever encountered."" A prenatal test to find the mutations that caused Erika's condition is theoretically possible. We could, bluntly, prevent future Erikas. Mukherjee lets us ponder this as he watches Erika being pushed by her mother across a parking lot in her wheelchair, ""her scarf billowing behind her, like an epilogue.""It's that last little bit, that fragment of a quote like a piece of DNA, that I hope exposes why this book had such a purchase on me. It's not just that Mukherjee can take a very complicated scientific subject and make it understandable. It's that he does so with really gorgeous writing.At one point he is explaining how 'we' got here, how 'humans' began on an arid mesa in South Africa and, from there, ""went west, as young men often do..."" The migrants made it to the northeastern edge of Ethiopia or Egypt, ""where the Red Sea narrows to a slitlike strait."" And then he writes this: There was no one there to part the ocean. We do not know what drove these men and women to fling themselves across the water, or how they managed to cross it. . . What is certain is that every perilous ocean-crossing left hardly any survivors--perhaps as few as six hundred men and women. Europeans, Asians, Australians, and Americans are the descendants of these drastic bottlenecks, and this corkscrew of history too has left its signature in our genomes. In a genetic sense, nearly all of us who emerged out of Africa, gasping for land and air, are even more closely yoked than previously imagined. We were on the same boat, brother.The same but different; different but the same. I'll stop there, having no doubt expressed my enthusiasm better than my understanding of human genetics. I'll stop even though the clicker below says I have 15,480 characters left, or about 500 less than the number of genes in one of my cells. But one of the truly entertaining parts of this book was the author's use of quotes. So, since I'm feeling epigrammy, I'll add my favorites to the comments.Bye. I have to go. "
1,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,5,"I think this was really good, and even better than The Emperor of All Maladies which I just read recently as well. I might have enjoyed this one more because it's relevant to my current day to day thing though. I really liked the way it ties in the personal elements of genetics through out the book and how it acknowledges really important questions of what we actually deem normal and healthy. I feel like a lot of times there isn't as much acknowledgement of the tradeoffs made when trying to eliminate genetic variants that in this current environment are maladaptive or considered pathological but may confer other advantages in a different environment. Also I think there isn't as much acknowledgement that we don't know enough to even say if a specific variant is abnormal, in the colloquial sense, and what the downstream effects might be to eliminating that specific variant. I think Mukherjee did a great job reckoning with that here. I also just really like have historical context and things explained to me accessibly but in a thorough fashion. This was really great, definitely going to end up being one of the better books I read this year. "
2,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16069171-aditi,5,"Hello bookish peeps,Another one of my review has been posted on our country's largest daily newspaper's website, The Times of India. ""This book is the story of the birth, growth, and future of one of the most powerful and dangerous ideas in the history of science: the ""gene,"" the fundamental unit of heredity, and the basic unit of all biological information. I""~Siddhartha MukherjeeThe 2011 Pulitzer Prize winner, Siddhartha Mukherjee, is back with another incredibly well-written book, The Gene: An Intimate History that unfolds the extensive and profound knowledge and research about human genome and its genetics that reflects beyond the definition of both basic and advanced science. The above quote by the author, himself, simply outlines the story line of this in-depth and thorough yet intimidating book about genes.Since the primeval times, it has been observed that living organisms can pass down attributes to their offspring, who can then pass down to their own children and so on. The author begins his book with Gregor Johann Mendel, a scientist, who observed the nature of genes in pea plants by isolating them to discover the transmissible characteristics in pea plants. Thomas Hunt Morgan, who in the early 20th century observed a study on fruit flies to state the real location of genes in a living organism's cell. The author has mathematically noted down each milestone in genetic science in this book, rather descriptively. But with all this, the author ensures that his readers do not lose their focus from the fact that study of genes is not anymore just a progressive or evolutionary aspect in science and medicines, rather it is a study and observation about how an individual is insufficiently deciphering the technological advancement in the science of genetics as well as the study of oneself.Siddhartha Mukherjee sweepingly shares his own Bengali-family medical and genetic history through this book. This includes his father with a genetically challenged brain illness, his mother and her twin sisters and the sudden onset of schizophrenia among his cousins and uncles, thereby inducing fear for the future generations and shock and knowledge about the unknown genetic defects underlying in his family history of hereditary.The author's writing has a lot of gravity, meaning and research affixed with true facts, that might or might not be able to bring a change among the readers to look at this scientific study of genes and its underlying messages in a different way, but it will definitely open the tight-shut windows about human genome in the minds of the readers. In a crux, the book will gracefully enlighten the readers. The narrative is articulate and I believe the book is written in a way that even if you are not accustomed to big scientific and medical terminologies, they can easily be comprehended.Please follow the link below to read my review:http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/li...Thank you!"
3,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,3,"I listened to the BBC abridged audio book as I often do before ordering it. I like hardbacks so I try and be sure first I want to read it. I didn't like it enough. I loved The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer but couldn't feel that deep interest with this one.Now it could be that the book is fantastic and it had a lousy editor at the BBC. Oliver Sacks autobiography, On the Move: A Life is a 10 star book, but the abridged BBC one is terrible, mostly the wrong episodes chosen. But still, the book was full of Mukherjee's usual overly-detailed extremely long passages and I couldn't get anything from them, so ... on to the next book. (But I might still order it in hardback because I think this is one of the books I might be wrong about)>"
4,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49521790-ayse,5,"In this beautifully written, vivid history of genetics; Mukherjee takes us by the hand and walks us through the hall of fame of all the people who are the reason for modern biology as we study it today. His picturesque descriptions make the book a joy to read.Starting with Mendel and ending with embryonic stem cell research and beyond; the fascinating story of genetic research is given in the book. There are life stories of many exceptional scientists. Unfortunately many examples of bad science and faux-scientists can also be found. I am particularly glad that Rosalind Franklin (who died at age 36 due to ovarian cancer; most likely because of Xray exposure from her experiments) and her work (without which DNA structure would not have been understood) is given the importance and acknowledgement in this book. Students of medicine, biology and related fields as well as anyone with an interest in the history and future of science will enjoy and learn a lot from The Gene."
5,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol,5,"Cannot begin to tell you what I learned from this fascinating study of The Gene but I gained great insight from the thorough research of Siddhartha Mukherjee. I am destined for a second read/listen. The audio narration by Dennis Boutsikaris made this compelling, very well paced with a distinct and pleasant tonal quality. Highly recommended."
6,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Not half as good a narrative as The Emperor of All Maladies, but still a good account of the Gene's journey and where it is going. It will hold your attention even if you have read multiple accounts of the progress of Genetics such as Watson's, because most histories of the Gene focus on the Genome project or on the early phase of discovery of genetics, Mukherjee instead focuses on the applications that are currently ongoing and how those fields have developed. My only complaint: the focus of the book is on the Human Gene and hence on Medicine, while the story of the Gene is surely about much more than medicine - extending to Food, Evolution, Economics and perhaps Politics - the Gene has a very wide role to play in our future and we need to develop perspective on that future today. Mukherjee gives a glimpse of where Medicine is going, but perhaps could also have shown us where We are going."
7,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"Thanks goes to Netgalley and a wonderful author for a wonderfully told series of stories within the world of genetics.I was worried, briefly, by the insistence of bringing Aristotle's take on the genome, or the recapitulation of many of the grandfathers of the science, such as Mendel and Darwin, but the way that these otherwise well-known personages were brought alive to the page was more of a story than a dry recounting. Even so, I wasn't prepared for what was soon to come.I became engrossed in the history of American Eugenics, and even more so in Germany's frightful improvements, all of which painted the history of the science in quite a dark, and ignorant, light.Fortunately for all of us, Crick, Watson, and Ferdinand come out swinging and we can see this all as a heroic step forward... even considering the fact that Ferdinand never got to see her work truly recognized. From here on out, we've got truly wonderful tales of Beck and the birth of recombinant DNA, scientists self-policing, the rise of multinational bio-engineering firms, AIDS, gene therapies, genome mapping, and of course cloning and stem-cell blocking, and each and every one of these stories are bright and very readable.And what's more, it's always informative and it's always interesting. It even draws us in to the author's own deep and emotional familial history and his own drive to understand.I'll make no bones about it: I was moved.I've read more than a handful of books on genetics in the past, and while some were quite good and some were sometimes mesmerizingly boring, I think this one has got to be the most readable, grab you on the human level, and most in depth survey of the entire field that I've ever read. So many disparate characteristics managed to encode the proteins of the narrative, and no one could be happier than me to see such a healthy and shining phenotypical expression be borne from a popular book. It's classy and smart. Very smart. In fact, it's pretty much a must-have if you're a science-history buff bringing us up to the cutting-edge present and want a few questions for the future. :)"
8,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,5,"I'm not going to lie, there were some pages of this book where all my mind saw was 'science science science science' etc etc over and over again instead of the actual words which apparently make sense to people cleverer than me. Happily though, the vast majority of the book is written in a more engaging and approachable fashion. Nevertheless, it clearly represents a vast amount of research, spanning the field from Aristotle to the present day. It plots the path of ever increasing knowledge and more specific theories about the means of heredity. Detailed descriptions of research, the individuals and teams who undertook it, every step forward (and backwards), the social, moral, scientific, and political implications of new information and techniques- all these things and more Mukherjee has addressed in this biography of the gene. His evaluative skill is piercing and never more so when looking at the dangers inherent in being able to modify our very nature. Of course, eugenics and the Nazis are covered, but he casts the net wider, into forced sterilisations in America and movements in the UK to create 'better' people. Not only that, he investigates the presence of these issues in contemporary society, asking whether our increasing capacity to make changes to our genes is balanced by a real understanding of the ethical implications. Yet he doesn't fail to point out how the lives of many people with certain genetic conditions have been vastly improved by the new science. As with so much of technological and scientific advancement, ideas about morality are inherently intertwined with the way it is actually used. It was a compelling read, though challenging. Very much worth taking the time to understand an area that will, I think, come to affect our lives in more and more ways as the years pass.Many thanks to Random House/Vintage and Netgalley for the chance to read this in exchange for an honest review."
9,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,5,"Siddhartha Mukherjee, Pulitzer's Prize winning book, ""The Emperor of All Maladies""scared the hell out of me right from the 'get go'....when I read that ""1 in 4 people will get cancer in your lifetime"". Mukherjee dives right in again, ( wasting no time), in ""The Gene"". We first learn that mental illness has been in Mukherjee's family for at least two generations. He shares personally with us about 4 different relatives: 2 cousins and two uncles -- ( from his father's side), whose minds were crumbling. --- Each with a little different story. It's clear Mukherjee isn't removed from his research in any shape or form. There was even a time when Mukherjee himself went through troubled period - as a teenager. He stopped talking to his parents for six months, refused to turn in school homework, and threw books in the trash. Filled with anxiety, his father took him to a doctor fearing his son was losing his mind ( fearing another Mukherjee bites the dust). Years later, when Mukherjee met Sarah, ( his wife today), he warned her about the heredity component that lurked behind his family history. In 2009, Swedish researchers published and enormous international study involving thousands of families and tens of thousands of men and women. It was discovered - with striking evidence that bipolar disease and schizophrenia shared strong genetic link. Questions that lingered in Mukherjee' mind at the start of his research was ...( looking at each his cousins and uncles), if the illnesses are genetic, why were some family members spared? (Mukherjee' father's sister had been spared)What 'triggers' had unveiled these predispositions? How much arose from 'nature'and how much was due to environmental 'nurture'. Also, was Mukherjee a carrier?What if he could know the precise nature of this genetic flaw? Would he test himself?Would he inform his daughters? If technologies were available -- who would control them and their safety? Part I is about ""the missing"" science of heredity ....discovering and rediscovering genes.. dated from 1865 to 1935. He talks about theories from Aristotle and Pythagoras....and what each of them had right and what they had wrong.Pythagoras's theory was that sperm carried all information to make a new human. Aristotle's theory was that heredity was carried in the form of messages to create materials ..( ""it was the hand that carried the instructions to mold an embryo""). --In time, both theories were demolished. Mukherjee continues to describe how past prominent scientists, physicians, philosophers, historians, sociologists, anthropologist, biologists, linguists, theologist, etc. understood the function of the gene.....and how many of these educators fought furiously over the question of human origin. Charles Darwin, for example, gave rise to the most important synthesis in modern biology and the most powerful understanding of human heredity. --- yet here we are today in 2016-- and Mukherjee is all about the future - medical advances. I'm beginning to see why this book is important. Embryology, inherited genes, chromosomes, .....so much information to keep taking in. Genetic information could be mixed, matched and swapped. As a reader...about half way through the book -- it's easy to feel exhausted. I put the book down...Made some tea... and listened to to Siddhartha Mukherjee do a TED talk. His talk recharged my energy... I began to see the larger purpose of understanding what past experts believed - to learn about what their work contributed. It's only until really being able to see how we've been treating disease in the past -- can we begin to comprehend the re-organization of treating disease in the future. Mukherjee presented the idea that it's possible the gene will cure disease - rather than a pill. This is a challenging book to read--yet fascinating -- not as hard to understand as one might think...just hard to stay with all the research. I needed breaks. ( I read other fiction stories at the same time)....but this book is looks at all sides of genetics: genetic diversity, morality, ...( such as stem cell research -and eugenics)... -and what about predicting the future from genes. ..and alternating the destiny through genetic manipulation. Medical advances seem to be moving faster than the speed of light. 11 months ago, I had a complete ankle replacement (a somewhat new and complicated surgery). I'm out hiking the hilly trails once again. Given how thankful I am for a working walking foot, I read this book with a hopeful fresh spirit for our future in the area of medical advancements. Thank You Scribner Publishing, Netgalley, and Siddhartha Mukherjee "
10,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24882791-india-m-clamp,5,"Not my first review of a masterpiece orchestrated by Siddhartha Mukherjee, as I am guilty to languishing (past a reasonable amount of time) in Pulitzer Prize winner “Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer.” Our Mom and Dad give us something. Finding what the something is are drops of light in a “dunkelweld” begging the question do genes determine our identity? What part does Mom and Dad play? What is a gene anyway? A gene is vibrating message to build a protein, which creates a protein. After the silent birth of form and function, regulation becomes its’ job. In this case, how does this explain his specialty as he takes a view from the heights and adds “family material” in candidly documenting heritable/un-inheritable mental illness. “...with God shoved aside---what was the driving force behind the origin of the species? What impetus drove the descent of, say, thirteen variants of finches down the fierce rivulets of speciation?” ...Spring 1838...Darwin tore into...the maroon C notebook.” ---Siddhartha Mukherjee, MD Erudition comes slow and in the doing we are transported to a garden and find a humble monk growing peas on 5 acres in Austria. This monk lives in an Österreich abbey and chooses peas as his subject—as he is prohibited from using vermin. His name is Gregor Mendel. He creates pea hybrids and with mutations he discerns come variety. The Gene: An Intimate History is providential. From the Asilomar Conference to the birth of Genetech that within is profound. Siddhartha Mukherjee, MD writes as if a fire burning slowly “intus penetus.” Mendels’ forgotten “pea” paper was key to the basic core of heredity and opened a door to W. Arating. Buy, read and share. "
11,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,5,"""We seek constancy in heredity--and find its opposite: variation. Mutants are necessary to maintain the essence of our selves.""- Siddhartha Mukherjee, The GeneI've owned Mukherjee's other book, The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer, for years and have consistently found rational reasons to not read it. So, I'm not sure what made me pick up this book first. Perhaps, it was a friend who prompted me. Perhaps, too, was my tendency to come late to authors and read them backwards (rNA?). Perhaps, there is a gene somewhere that always pushes me read an author's first, great novel late. Don't know. What I do know is I was BLOWN away by this book. It was, first to last page, intensely interesting, it flowed well, and in parts it was damn near poetry. Every day I ended up reading more than I planned for that day. I couldn't put it down. Just like it is sometimes amazing that a fruit fly, a virus, or man can come from an arrangement of just 4 nucleotides in DNA (ATGC), it often amazes me that 26 letters in our alphabet can express the poetry of E.E. Cummings and the prose of a writer like Mukherjee. There were some experimental chapters that didn't resonate quite as well, but these were minor dings on a nearly perfect work of narrative nonfiction. Overall, the book reminded me a bit of Wright's The Moral Animal: Why We Are the Way We Are: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology or Rhodes' The Making of the Atomic Bomb. It easy sits among the very best in science writing I've read, covering genetics and the gene from Darwin to CRISPR technology. As someone who has Type 1 diabetes, RA, Graves disease, and Marfan syndrome, I've always been fascinated by genes the history of genetics (Yes, I'm exist uncomfortably in the shallow end of my family's gene pool). I've actually had my skin punched for genetic tests in the late 80s by Dr. Reed E. Pyeritz at Johns Hopkins. So, discussions in this book about Marfan Syndrome and Johns Hopkins' Moore Clinic hit REALLY close to home. After reading 'The Gene' I'm now a HUGE Mukherjee fan, and have moved 'The Emperor of All Maladies' to my bedside table and will be jumping into that book soon (sometimes, it seems, we can act rationally just by moving cancer closer to us)."
12,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"This book is a skillfully crafted combination of science history, character sketches, and personal encounters by the author's extended family with a history of mental illness. The end result maintains the interest of the reader in a subject that could have been a lot less interesting in the hands on another writer.Most of the book is an account of the history of human advances in the understanding of how heritable characteristics are passed through multiple biological generations. Toward the end of the book the author explores the more ambiguous contributions of nature, nurture and chance in the destiny of biological life. Also some speculation is made on the future possibilities of gene manipulation and repair.The author's discussion of the complexities of sexual identity was particularly poignant in light of recent political controversies in the USA regarding transexuals. This section of the book should be required reading for legislators who think that the determination of sex at birth is final.Below are some quotations that caught my eye. I've preceded each with my introductory comment:I feel sorry for Darwin in his efforts to defend his theory of survival of the fittest as the driving force in the evolution of species. He didn't understand the rules of genetics and thus didn't have the needed information to explain why unusual beneficial genetic traits were not lost through cross breeding. The following quotation describes how close Darwin came to finding the needed information. Instead the significance of Mendel's findings remained unnoticed for four decades.Had Darwin looked carefully through the books in his voluminous library he might of found a reference to an obscure paper by a little known Botanist from Brno, unassumingly titled ""Experiments in Plant Hibernation"" and published in a scarcely known journal in 1866. The paper was written in dense German and packed with the kind of mathematical tables that Darwin particularly despised. Even so Dawin came tantalizing close to reading it. In the early 1870s pouring through a book on plant hybrids he made extensive hand written notes on pages 50 , 51, 53, and 54, but mysteriously skipped page 52 where the Brno paper of pea hybrids was discussed in detail. If Darwin had actually read it, particularly as he was writing ""Variation"" and formulating pangenesis, this study might have provided the final critical insight to understand his own theory of evolution. He would have been fascinated by its implications, moved by the tenderness of it labor, and struck by its strange and explanatory power. Darwin's incisive intellect would have quickly grasped its implications for the understanding of evolution.The following summary of the Nazi and Soviets genetic programs during WWII shows how things can go astray when genetics is made to fit political dogma.The Nazis believing in absolute genetic immutability—a Jew is a Jew—had resorted to eugenics to change the structure of their population. The Soviets, believing in absolute genetic reprogrammability—anyone is everyone—could eradicate all distinctions and thus achieve a radical collective good. One positive contribution of the Nazis is that they totally discredited eugenics programs.The mark of Nazis genetics remains like an indelible scar. … This perhaps was the final contribution of Nazism to genetics. It placed the ultimate stamp of shame on eugenics. The horror of Nazi eugenics inspired a cautionary tale prompting a global reexamination of the ambitions that had spurred the effort. Around the world eugenic programs came to a shamefaced halt. The following quotation is addressing the differences between identical twins. I saved it because of the three adjectives modifying ""events."" I might need those words someday to explain why I'm surprised. What causes the difference? Forty-three studies performed over two decades have revealed a powerful and consistent answer: unsystematic, idiosyncratic, serendipitous events.Genetic markers have been identified that predict differing abilities to handle stress. The following is an interesting discussion of what could be done with that information. It is as if resilience itself has a genetic core. Some humans are born resilient but are less responsive to interventions, while others are born sensitive but more likely to respond to changes in their environments. The idea of a resilience gene has entranced social engineers. … ""Should we seek to identify the most susceptible children and disproportionately target them when it comes to investing scarce intervention and service dollars? I believe the answer is yes. Some people are … like delicate orchids, … they quickly wither when exposed to distress and depravation but blossom if given a lot of care and support. Others are more like dandelions. They prove resilient to the negative effects of adversity but at the same time do not particularly benefit from positive experiences. By identifying these delicate orchid versus dandelion children by gene profiling … societies might achieve vastly more efficient targeting of scarce resources.""For many years geneticists couldn't find a way to perform targeted gene repair. The following is an interesting summary of the author's description of how yogurt engineers found a bacterium capable of defending itself from hostile viruses by a clever method that could also be borrowed by geneticists to target specific places on a gene and make repairs. Only a handful of such instances of scientific serendipity have occurred in the history of biology. An arcane microbial defense devised by microbes discovered by yogurt engineers and reprogrammed by RNA biologist has created a trap door to transformative technology that geneticists had sought for so longingly for decades. A method to achieve directed efficient and sequence specific modification of the human genome.  The following short review is from PageADay Book Lover's Calendar for January 19, 2018:Siddhartha Mukherjee Won the Pulitzer Prize and legions of devoted readers with his biography of cancer, The Emperor of All Maladies. He brings the same depth of knowledge and personal touch to the story of the human gene. Covering everything from how Aristotle and Darwin understood genetics to the rnodern phenomenon of mapping the genome, The Gene prepares readers to understand the ethical questions surrounding genetics today. Fascinating, accessible, and timely.
THE GENE: AN INTIMATE HISTORY,
 by Siddhartha Mukherjee (Scribner, 2016)"
13,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,5,"Siddhartha Mukherjee's 2010 The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer is amongst my top nonfiction books of all time.When he released THE GENE: An Intimate History in 2016, I had plans to get to it, but the 500+ pages on genetics and molecular biology was (just) a little daunting. I mean, I love biology, but I was imagining heredity charts of peas... of course, I just needed to remind myself how fantastic Mukherjee's writing is and trust in that fact.I chose to listen to the audiobook of this one and it was well-suited for that format. It's largely a chronological tale, starting with Mendel and Darwin, the long shadow of eugenics, DNA modeling, the politics and personalities of the Human Genome Project, epigenetics, CRISPR, and the future of genetics in transhumanism, AI, etc.Mukherjee inserts meaningful anecdotes on many of the scientists, some humor - but where the book really stands out is how he shares his owngenetic and family history interspersed with the scientific history. His family, like many other Bengali families (he states) were deeply affected by Partition. Incidentally, mental illness, specially bipolar and schizophrenia, further caused this rift in identity. He recalls childhood visits to an institutionalized uncle, and his father's fear of passing this illness to his own children.If engaging science writing is your thing - it's definitely mine - I highly recommend Mukherjee's work. Both of his books are remarkable."
14,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629647-emer-a-little-haze,4,"'The Gene: an intimate history' is a most readable story about what it means to be human. It is a book that attempts to shine a light on the complex and often fraught history of understanding heredity. The book is laid out in a relatively easy to follow format with a writing style suited to those without a scientific background but with a keen interest in science. What makes this very readable for the non-scientist is how the author relates the history of the gene, determining the human genome and the advancements in gene therapy with his own family story of mental illness. He also carefully chooses case studies which humanise the face of genetic research and helps to pose questions about ethics and scientific responsibilities while demonstrating the positive advances made by the scientific community. The book starts off with the workings of Gregor Mendel. Anyone with secondary level/high school biology will no doubt be familiar with Mendelian genetics and will recall their days of first creating punnet squares in science class!! The book follows on from these early days through to the dawn of the eugenics era and how it so easily and chillingly turned into genocide with the rise of Nazism. A frequent motif throughout the book is focusing on the scientists behind the research and some of their actions which can best be described as being soap opera worthy!! It is this type of storytelling that provides the lay reader with moments of respite from the more technically heavy detail. People will no doubt be familiar with the testy relationship between the founding fathers of DNA structure, Watson and Crick, and Rosalind Franklin whose work was instrumental in their determination of said structure. More recent soap opera worthy stories surround the Human Genome Project with private enterprise facing off against publicly funded research. As this is a book describing the history of the gene there is a lot of science terminology. It is unavoidable. In my opinion I think it was handled as expertly as possible and I felt that there were sufficient explanations of the scientific processes behind the ever advancing technologies. I should however point out that my background is in scientific research and therefore none of the processes and themes described therein were new to me, but as I read I firmly kept the perspective of a non-scientist in mind with regards to my review of the book. The chronological style of the book helped to layer up the information learned piece by piece and I felt this was so skilfully done that I wished I had read this book as a young undergraduate coming to grips with simple genetics. I think it would have made excellent supplemental reading in my early undergraduate studies because of this, and the pop-culture style of the book, which would have made a refreshing change from some of my more stilted text books. And therefore, I would highly recommend this book as additional reading to any science student requiring an understanding of genetics within their first year of their degree course. I was however, somewhat disappointed with the coverage and explanations given to the topic of epigenetics. This was the weakest aspect of the book and needed to be further explored to provide a more complete view of current genetics in my opinion. However, this book still felt very relevant. It was more or less completed in the spring of 2015 and the author had stayed relatively up to date with his references. The last section of the book was excellently laid out and I thought gave the facts of current gene therapies and gene targeting with minimal bias. Other buzz-worthy topics mentioned in the book which will no doubt be of interest to many include discussions regarding gender and sexual identity, IVF treatments, genetic screening (breast cancer, CF, Huntington's) and targeted gene therapies to name but a few. Overall this was a very enjoyable read and while it won't be an easy read for anyone without a scientific background I would still heartily recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning about genes and heredity and who especially wants to inform themselves about controversial topics such as genetic screening, stem cell research and the tangible possibilities of future manipulation of our genome. The book ends with a warning for the future about the responsibility of scientists and society at large when it comes to the negative possibilities of genetic intervention. 
But an infinitely deeper quandary is raised when an intelligent organism learns to write its own instructions. If genes determine the nature and fate of an organism, and if organisms now begin to determine the nature and fate of their genes, then a circle of logic closes on itself. Once we start thinking of genes as destiny, manifest, then it is inevitable to begin imagining the human genome as manifest destiny.When we claim to find “genes for” certain human features or functions, it is by virtue of defining that feature narrowly. It makes sense to define “genes for” blood type or “genes for” height since these biological attributes have intrinsically narrow definitions. But it is an old sin of biology to confuse the definition of a feature with the feature itself. If we define “beauty” as having blue eyes (and only blue eyes), then we will, indeed, find a “gene for beauty.” If we define “intelligence” as the performance on only one kind of problem in only one kind of test, then we will, indeed, find a “gene for intelligence.” The genome is only a mirror for the breadth or narrowness of human imagination. It is Narcissus, reflected.

15,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,4,"I began this book knowing practically nothing about genes and chromosomes. My ability to follow it from start to finish without any serious problems is amazing! The author is clear, and he captivates a reader’s interest all the way through. Mukherjee, a cancer physician and researcher, begins with the history of genetics, moves forward to our capabilities today and what lies ahead in the future. He makes the science relevant to modern-day readers. He relates how genetics has impacted on his own family troubled by schizophrenia, and he does this in such a way that science on a general level also becomes personal. He discusses the origin of human species and our dispersion over the globe, and then what this says about the similarities and differences between races. He shows how historical developments, such as eugenics and Hitler's racial policies, revolve around our ability to shape humankind. Each topic that he shifts to is made relevant to people today and ties the reader's interest. Who isn’t drawn in by twin studies? Who isn’t curious to know what very possibly lies ahead in the future? I appreciate that even philosophical aspects are touched upon. The author neither simplifies the complexities of the science nor does he make the topic incomprehensible for a layman. For me there was a good balance of specific scientific details and clarifying summations. Both how history has shaped our current knowledge and what most probably lies ahead is explored. While I did not understand in detail every step of all the research projects, I could follow the gist of what was being said. There were points where I felt the sentences could possibly have been clearer and where I had to seek further information on the web, but this was not often. Having read the book, I am by no means now an expert, but I feel I have a better comprehension and a solid base to stand on.The audiobook was very well narrated by Dennis Boutsikaris. He spoke clearly and usually at not too rapid a speed. Keep in mind, I classify myself as a beginner; others reading this may know much more than myself. Such listeners can increase the speed!I was very hesitant to pick up this book. The reading experience turned out to be much better than I had expected, basically because it kept my interest from start to finish and I learned a lot."
16,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60311509-udeni,3,"Sorry, people. I couldn't finish this book. Billed as a prequel to the brilliant Emperor of Maladies, this was just too confusing and frustrating a book for me. My major difficulty with Mukherjee's approach is that the book is a history of genetics which never properly explains what a gene is. So the reader follows the scientists down blind alleys and back out again while getting dizzy from the increasingly long list of names and biological terms. I ended up trying to sketch out a diagram of how the gene relates to the genome and to a chromosome and to a cell. And then gave up because I was too confused. A chapter outlining the basic biology would have been helpful for non-biologists. The florid writing regularly tips over into incoherence also annoyed me. For example:""If haemoglobin's capacity to deliver oxygen to distant sites was disrupted, our bodies would be forced to be small and cold. We would wake up and find ourselves transformed into insects.""No, we wouldn't wake up at all because we would be dead. And what's with the pointless reference to Kafka's ""Metamorphosis""? It felt like showing off.One star for the sheer ambition of trying to write a book about the history of genetics; another star for the incredible detail in the book, and third star out of sentiment, because I loved ""Emperor of Maladies"" so much. Probably best enjoyed by those with a better basic grasp of genetics than me."
17,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,4,"The dude who wrote Emperor of all Maladies is back with a prequel and it's good!It starts with some history - a little Darwin and a lot of Mendel, the monk who spent his whole life geeking out over pea plants, and who I remember as being the most boring part of a very boring 9th grade biology class. (Why is high school so awful at making science interesting? It's so interesting!) And some other, lesser-known characters. This is what Mukherjee did in Emperor of Maladies, too: the history of research into a thing. He's good at making it interesting - and he reads a lot of books, so you never know when all of a sudden he's gonna cite Tarzan of the Apes. That's a great bonus for those of us who are book nerds first, science nerds later.Then it goes into actual DNA stuff with Watson & Crick etc., and here we get into the realm of ""There's really no way for me to intuitively grasp any of this,"" so it's a little tough going for me but I get it a little, I guess. And in the last third, we talk about all the stuff you're really curious about with genes:- If we're all getting DNA tests when we're pregnant, are we actually engaging in a vague sort of opt-in eugenics? (Yes!)- Remember that book The Bell Curve? WTF was that? (It was bullshit!)- Is there a gay gene or what? (Sortof!) - What personality traits are genetically influenced? (Studies of identical twins separated at birth find that they tend to agree on sexual preference, religion and politics. That's bananas.)I raised an eyebrow a little when Mukherjee discussed kids with Downs Syndrome: he ascribes to them a genetic tendency toward sweetness, and my wife (who works with disabled children) adamantly denies that's a thing. She says Downs Syndrome kids are just kids; it's condescending and even damaging to insist they're naturally sweet, and also laughably incorrect if you've spent much time with Downs Syndrome kids. Science agrees with my wife, so now we're reminded that it's dangerous to pick any one person as one's authority on any one thing. Mukherjee is well-intentioned but what else is he wrong about? So, y'know, warning: no one's got all the answers.Mukherjee has many of them, though, and this is a fun-to-read and informative book."
18,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558460-caterina,5,"4.5/5 But what is ”natural”? I wonder. On one hand: variation, mutation, change, inconstancy, divisibility, flux. And on the other, constancy, permanence, indivisibility, fidelity. Bhed. Abhed. It should hardly surprise us that DNA, the molecule of contradictions, encodes an organism of contradictions. . . . Our genome has negotiated a fragile balance between counterpoised forces, pairing strand with opposing strand, mixing past and future, pitting memory against desire. It is the most human of all things that we possess Its stewardship may be the ultimate test of knowledge and discernment for our species.Sura-na Bheda Pramaana Sunaavo;Bheda, Abheda, Pratham kara Jaano.Show me that you can divide the notes of a song;But first, show me that you can discernBetween what can be dividedAnd what cannot.— An anonymous musical composition inspired by a classical Sanskrit poemThis wondrous journey through the history of genetics and genomics left me surprisingly hopeful and somehow less fearful of the future despite the potential risks of genomic technologies and the enormous changes Mukherjee foresees on the horizon, where “what can be divided and what cannot” is yet unknown. With a gentle, compassionate voice, an open mind, and a sense of humor (he’s unable to resist a groan-worthy literary pun) you would definitely want this man as your personal physician. Looking soberly at the risks and atrocities past, present, and (potential) future, he nevertheless exudes a calm and infectious sense of wonder, acceptance of life’s infinitely creative diversity, and careful hope for benefit to humankind.Aesthetic appreciation was no small part of my delight, not only in the writing but in the thrill of learning about the gene and the genome, the literal stuff of life. One semester in college I took a course in Ancient Greek Philosophy together with one in Modern Physics (relativity, quantum theory, etc.) delighting in the juxtaposition of the ancient and modern minds, each seeking the secrets of the universe in their own time. This time around, unplanned, I experienced similar juxtapositions of ancient and modern “seekers” by reading in parallel an imaginative analysis of the biblical origin story: The Beginning of Desire: Reflections on Genesis by Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg. To my surprise and delight, both authors crammed their books with literary references. Shakespeare, Kafka, and especially Wallace Stevens were quoted in both tomes. And what a treat for my poetic imagination. Genesis. Gene-sis. DNA, the “script” of every living being on earth, begins to look to me like an unfurling scroll. On it are written the instructions for our creation in combinations of four letters: A, C, G and T. They could just as well be four musical notes playing the unique song of each individual being. (Surely some composers have taken inspiration from this?) Or the four letters in the traditional Hebrew Divine Name, creating infinite marvelous variations in its own image and likeness. And today I read in the news that some poet is genetically altering a bacteria to encode his own poetry into its genome. (“Translated” somehow into the four-letter code, I guess.)I found the storytelling in The Gene: An Intimate History compelling for the most part. With a delicate touch Mukherjee interwove his own family’s troubled medical history with tales of the scientists and their discoveries, from the unlikely father of genetics, the gentle monk Gregor Mendel and his almost unimaginably rigorous analyses and documentation of tens of thousands of meticulously cross-bred pea plants grown in his monastery garden (after his superior had nixed his similar attempts to cross-breed mice in his monastic cell) — to the recent discoveries by Jennifer Doudma and Emmanuelle Charpentier of CRISPR/Cas9 technologies that allow precise gene editing based on what bacteria naturally do to combat viruses. (This gave me a deeper understanding of current news stories.) A medical doctor, Mukherjee focused on the human medicine perspective — he doesn’t say much about genetically modified organisms in other contexts such as agriculture. As in my recent journey through the history of geological science with John McPhee’s Annals of the Former World series, there was no shortage of scientists behaving badly. For example, Mendel’s unique, groundbreaking work was suppressed (and plagiarized in part) by an envious scientist to whom Mendel had sent his paper — setting back science for 35 years until Mendel’s research was “discovered” after his death and widely published. And then there were the atrocities committed in the name of human improvement (sometimes) — from forced sterilizations of people on the basis of poverty or race in the United States, to the “final solution” of the Nazis and the “medical” experiments of Josef Mengele at Auschwitz. Could things like this be repeated? Maybe. Terrible things are happening now, Mukherjee contends: in his birth country of India and in China, tens of millions of girls are selectively aborted or removed from the human race by infanticide or exposure. As a caution to the world, Siddhartha Mukherjee dedicated this book to Carrie Buck, the first woman to be forcibly sterilized. Getting further into controversial territory, I was, perhaps naively, surprised and dismayed to learn that the current state of genetic medicine is as primitive as it is, consisting primarily of identifying genetic abnormalities in utero and offering the option of terminating the pregnancy. Ostensibly this is done only by choice, and only for only the most extreme medical conditions that would cause great suffering, but as Mukherjee pointed out, reality is a different story. He also points out the slippery quality of the concept of ""great suffering"": -- what is it, and who decides? Another major current application of genetic medicine is through in-vitro fertilization, when embryos can be genetically tested and selected or not selected for implantation. Mukherjee discusses some of the ethical concerns with these approaches. What about actually curing genetic diseases? So far, the dangers and technical difficulties of making targeted genetic changes, including fatal screw-ups by overeager experimenters, have held back progress, but Mukherjee believes we are on the cusp of seeing this change, although he cautions that this approach may only apply to conditions that are traceable to a single gene or a simple combination of a few genes -- and we do not know whether changing those genes will also change other, desirable characteristics. We do not know what can be divided and what cannot.Mukherjee tries to speak evenhandedly and sensitively about the dilemmas of genetic “abnormalities” — or, more neutrally, genetic ""variations"" — which can sometimes also be gifts. For instance the common co-occurrence of genius and mental illness (as occurred in his family) can be traced to genetics and isn’t just the stuff of legends and movies. And most of the time, genes only indicate a potential that may or may not be realized. One special case that is more genetically clear-cut than most, but ethically less so, is Down syndrome. Even this seemingly straightforward chromosomal variation can result in a wide range of outcomes for people born with this condition -- some people born with Down syndrome can have relatively healthy, relatively independent lives. Mukherjee also points out (at least twice) the sweet, almost angelic disposition of people with Down’s syndrome, implying how much would be lost if they were all eliminated from the human race as ""undesirable"". (Having worked and lived for two summers with Down syndrome youth, I agree.) On the other hand, Mukherjee is sensitive to women who may have reason to make another choice. He mentions the case of a woman who, after having a child with Down syndrome who suffered greatly from medical conditions, underwent many painful surgeries, and died young, decides to abort a subsequent Down fetus. (I couldn’t help but contrast Mukherjee’s sensitive perspective to Richard Dawkins who has said that a woman would be immoral not to abort a fetus with Down syndrome. I find that horrible, and so much for women’s autonomy, some men can’t resist telling us what to do even without a religion to blame it on.)In short, I recommend this book to those interested in a human-focused book on the science of genetics and genomics in pretty close to its current state. I will definitely read Mukherjee’s cancer book now, and I’m also looking forward to reading a new (2018) book with an epigenetic focus: She Has Her Mother’s Laugh: The Powers, Perversions and Potentialities of Heredity by Carl Zimmer (also new to me). Since finishing this book I've also listened to several extended interviews of Dr. Mukherjee on YouTube about this book and his early book on cancer; my overall impression is of a humble, thoughtful man who cares deeply for us humans."
19,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Mukherjee makes science history interesting, accessible and relevant. We learn about genetics and how a steady stream of brilliant and driven scientists uncovered the code that defines us all. Recent discoveries have given us the ability to change that code. Mukherjee presents the moral conundrums implicit in our new knowledge. The moral dilemma has a history too that is as important as that of the discoveries. Mukherjee begins with Darwin and Mendel. Mendel’s 1856-63 studies of heritable traits in peas would go unnoticed, but Darwin’s 1859 On the Origin of Species drew immediate response. Many considered it blasphemy but in 1883, a year after Darwin’s death, his cousin Francis Galton grasped at a new idea coining the term “eugenics”. He called it “the science of improving stock to give the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing over the less suitable”. Evolutionary theory was barely out of the starting gate and its perversion was racing ahead of it.Galton died in 1911, the year the American Charles Davenport published Heredity in Relation to Eugenics which became a widely used college text and primary reference for the movement. Many states enacted laws authorizing sterilization to eliminate “defective strains.” Mukherjee dedicates his book to Carrie Buck who in 1924 in Virginia was classified as “feebleminded” by doctors and ordered by a judge to the Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and the Feebleminded where her mother had been sent four years earlier. Carrie had been raped and was pregnant. To protect the perpetrator she had been characterized as promiscuous. Virginia wanted to sterilize her and launched a test case that went to the US Supreme Court in 1927. Against the backdrop of widespread fear of immigrants arriving from Southern and Eastern Europe the Court ordered her sterilized. Writing for the 8-1 majority the eminent Oliver Wendell Holmes stated, ”society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind”. While America took the early lead, Germany would bring the eugenics movement to its gruesome conclusion.In 1900 Mendel’s work was rediscovered and the search for heritable traits was on. From 1905 to 1925 Thomas Morgan and his associates tracked these traits in fruit flies in their Fly Room at Columbia University. They learned much about how genes worked but still did not know what genes were. In 1928 English bacteriologist Frederick Griffith showed that genes could be passed from one bacteria strain to another. In 1944 in New York molecular biologist Oswald Avery used Frederick Griffith’s work to pinpoint DNA as the genetic material. Next came a dramatic race among scientists won by James Watson, Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. In 1953 they identified DNA’s molecular structure, the famous double-helix. In 1959 Jacques Monad, Arthur Pardee and Francois Jacob published a paper showing how DNA operated through RNA to code proteins that in turn regulated DNA allowing each cell to carry out its own function.In 1972 Paul Berg created DNA chimera combining genes from viruses and bacteria. This was not without risk. What if a new pathogen for which humans had no defense was unleashed? Soon after Herb Boyer and Stanley Cohen developed the ability to transfer genes from bacteria into mammalian cells and clone them. Frederick Sanger began to sequence them. In 1976 Herb Boyer was approached by venture capitalist Robert Swanson to exploit this new technology. He suggested they call the new company HerBob, but they settled on Genentech. By 1978 Genentech was making insulin, by 1982 human growth hormone and in 1983 an important blood clotting factor that meant hemophiliacs would not have to rely on AIDS infected blood transfusions. It continues to this day to produce a steady stream of important biological therapies. In 1992 Craig Venter left NIH’s Human Genome Project to set up his own company, The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), dedicated to gene sequencing. In 1995 TIGR was the first to sequence all the genes of a living species, a bacterium. In 1998 Venter left TIGR to form a new gene sequencing company, Celera, derived from the word “accelerate”. Venter intended to beat NIH to be the first to sequence the human genome. That year NIH’s Worm Genome Project completely sequenced the first multicellular animal. Not to be outdone, Celera completely sequenced the fruit fly a year later. In 2000, President Clinton, afraid of the political fallout if the expensive NIH project was beaten by a private startup, engineered a truce. In 2000 Clinton called Venter and Francis Collins who headed NIH’s Human Genome Project to the White House to announce (a little prematurely) that both groups had sequenced the human genome. Both completed their projects and published their results in February 2001.A new era in genetics was underway. Human lineage could be analyzed, ancestry determined and forensics vastly improved. Completely new avenues to diagnose disease, determine its cause and treat it were opened up. Gene therapy got off to an unfortunate start with the highly publicized death of Paul Gelsinger in 1999. But far better and more powerful techniques were coming. In 2012 Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier published their findings about CRISPER. This bacterial defense system could be used to precisely splice genes. Human embryonic stem (ES) cells and human embryos could now be readily modified. After modification pluripotent ES cells could be converted back to embryos. The opportunities and risks are mindboggling.I am struck by the timeliness of reading this in August 2017. In April the FDA approved 23andMe selling home testing for health related genes. Do you have a gene that increases your risk of Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s? Now you can find out, but how will you handle the information? In June an FDA advisory committee recommended approval of a gene therapy, CAR-T, which holds much promise in the fight against cancer. If as expected the FDA approves in September, it will be the first gene therapy approved. We can expect subsequent approvals for gene tests and gene therapies to grow rapidly. In July a disease carrying gene was successfully replaced in a human embryo. Designer babies can’t be far in the future. Changes that have long been anticipated are upon us. Is our moral compass up to the responsibility science has placed upon us? Reading Mukherjee’s book one gets a sense of the furious and ever quickening pace at which genetic technology has advanced. Profound capabilities will be readily available to change what we are. Genes define our mental attributes as well as physical features. What will we make of ourselves? It’s scary when we consider how well humans have managed our world and society. This is a 500 page book and much is left out in this review, particularly about how genes work which is explained well for a general audience. But the distinguishing feature of this book is to put forward the risks and moral hazards in balance with the great opportunity and benefit genetics holds. Everyone concerned about our future should pick this one up."

21,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26552534-greg-brozeit,5,"At the same time I reached the midway point of Siddhartha Mukherjee’s The Gene: An Intimate History, the satellite Juno entered the atmosphere of Jupiter. But that feat pales, in my view, to the story about genetic journeys that are taking place within our individual, biological selves, especially since “genes provide the context to understand development and fate” of every human life. As I finished the book today, the New York Times reported that a clinical trial using a promising type of genetically engineered cells—made, coincidentally, by a company called Juno—had to be halted after three patients died because of swelling in the brain. It is a sobering reminder of, despite its promise, how far we still have to go to understand and harness the promise of genes to lessen the burdens of disability and disease.It’s hard not be overly enthusiastic about how the manipulation of genetics might make things like birth defects, cognitive issues, mental illness, and diseases like cancer, Alzheimer’s, and hemophilia things of the past, especially considering Mukherjee’s masterful, precise overview of the history of scientific progress to understand how the gene works. Yet his combined gifts of scientific expertise and literary brilliance—which he also demonstrated vividly in 
The Emperor of All Maladies
—provide a dose of reality of how difficult the steps from theory to practice will be. There is an overriding sense, however—like Martin Luther King, Jr.’s vision of the Promised Land—that we just might get there if we keep trying.In writing about the evolving history of the gene from Pythagoras to Darwin to Mendel and their intellectual progeny through today, Mukherjee has taken what is usually a dry subject with the prose of a gifted novelist. He interweaves the story of the gene with his own family’s history of mental illness, leaving unsaid his fears of genetic predisposition that might one day affect him, his children or other loved ones. From a lay perspective, it is most interesting that the basic knowledge of the gene is built on studies of things like fruit flies, worms and yeast. (Keep that in mind the next time you hear a member of Congress complaining about “wasteful” spending on research he or she cannot comprehend.) By understanding the basic mechanisms of genes, which are within chromosomes and synthesize DNA to RNA to proteins in these smaller, “simpler” organisms, researchers could better understand how these processes work in humans. Two fly geneticists, for example, “understood that mutations [in genes] are just variations...that convey…essential and profound truth[s]. A mutation…is a statistical entity, not a pathological or moral one.” In other words, when we impose our personal, social, or political views on things like race, a person’s disability or disease, or anything caused by genetic variation, for that matter, it tells us more about our subjective humanity than it does about objective reality.This explains why he doesn’t shy away from the history of the misuse and deliberate misinterpretation of genetics for purposes of political ideology or social engineering. In taking on subjects like eugenics, the monstrous “racial” policies of Nazi Germany, Murray and Herrnstein’s book The Bell Curve, and then brings them together through the telling of the story of Carrie (to whom this book is dedicated) and Emma Buck, a daughter and mother who were forced to undergo state-sanctioned sterilization in the name of an evil policy built on a combination of junk science and misguided notions of morality.In telling this story, Mukherjee intertwines contextual definitions with simple rhetoric. Genes are much more complex than carriers and purveyors of heredity; to evolve, genes express things like variation, adaptation and mutation, the latter which he sums up as, “A chicken…was merely an egg’s way of making a better egg.” An essential concept is the genome, i.e., “all genetic information within an organism.” The interplay between genes within any organism’s genome is what makes up the stuff of life. It is an uneven, pragmatic process, or has Mukherjee explains more clearly, “Beautiful laws were often killed by ugly facts.”The ugliest of facts is: even when genes and genomes are distilled to their most simple elements, answers on how to manipulate them is elusive. Scientists must understand the interplay of a variety of factors. “A genotype is an organism’s genetic composition. It can refer to one gene, a configuration of a gene, or even an entire genome. A phenotype, in contrast, refers to an organism’s physical or biological attributes and characteristics—the color of any eye, the shape of a wing, or resistance to hot or cold temperatures.” Or as he puts it more simply: “genotype + environment + triggers + chance = phenotype.” Some genetic information about disease can be distilled down to one gene defect as in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), hemophilia or Huntington’s disease. “But most common human diseases do not arise from single-gene mutations. These are not genetic illnesses as much as genomic illnesses: multiple genes spread differently throughout the human genome, determine the risk for the illness.” The next most important steps to address these issues will be to sequence genomes; to figure out what genetic information is transmitted in particular places at particular times. “Cancer,” for example, is “a genome that becomes pathologically obsessed with replicating itself” and, depending on the type, it can require multiple—perhaps tens or hundreds of distinct operations at the genetic level—approaches to alter blood cells have them match up with the disease causing mutations within each individual’s body, something that Juno’s clinical trial tried unsuccessfully to do. Yet, Mukherjee’s opus leads me to believe that when we understand why these trials have failed, the news will be much bigger than interplanetary exploration and much, much more significant to our lives.Mukherjee is a trained oncologist. These folks are usually very dry and hyper-focused; they aren’t well-read outside of their fields nor do they know much about art, poetry or history. But Mukherjee is different. He can write with an eloquent simplicity that makes complex issues completely clear to someone like me who was never crazy about science. First he writes what is arguably one the best nonfiction books ever written, 
The Emperor of All Maladies
, and then he follows it up with an eloquent masterpiece on a subject that is much more complex to explain. He is incredibly gifted. Much like Carl Sagan, he should be considered one of the great medical minds of our or any generation if only because of his gift of being able to convey such complex, relevant ideas to lay persons everywhere."

If you do like science, you'll find it even more informative and entertaining. The book is written for a broader audience who enjoy history, biology, and for those who enjoy debating social, cultural, and ethical dilemmas.In the book the author takes us in depth though the biological journey of the evolution of our knowledge and struggles with the study of the gene, all coiled around like the DNA strand with world histories most critical events and Mukherjee's personal intimate story.The stories in the book relating to the competitiveness between laboratories are suspenseful and fun to read. We also find out, to my surprise, the important roll identical twins play for geneticist in providing data and proof that inclination to a certain temperament, urges, illnesses, and other character traits are in most part hereditary, and therefore written in our genes.We also see that the commonality, or better yet solidarity, that bonds some of the greatest names in biology such as Darwin, Mendel, and others is their failure in the natural and applied science formal education systems of their times. This can be encouraging for those academically struggling.The book is well-written, and the science and history is well balanced. Mukherjee stays on topic, which is always good. Don't be discouraged by the 600 pages, it's an enjoyable and easy read. You won't regret it.

23,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"‘The Gene’ is a very informative book, and a book I believe which everyone should read, as it packs vital information on what we really are. That said, this is a big book, and is very dense in several sections. Siddhartha Mukherjee traces the history of how we have gained better understanding of our genes since over a century. He starts with his family, many of his relatives on his father’s side suffering from mental illnesses. This is interspersed with some random musings on the impact of the partition of the country, which is largely incomplete, assuming the idea was to link it to mental health. The various experiments done by a variety of people (starting significantly with Mendel) allowing us to understand our genome & genes gradually makes for engrossing reading. The ‘nature’ vs ‘nurture’ debate expectedly finds coverage and it was interesting to read how it is actually one reinforcing the other rather than a binary or a sum. The ethical considerations and some failed genetic treatment experiments insert a sobering caution, though the progress made has been stupendous.The narrative could have flowed more easily - enhancing readability (also some random & sketchy non-subject references do not add much), and a possibly wider coverage of genes could have been included (the coverage is very much oriented towards disease causing genes). This is a book of great value and certainly recommended reading!My rating: 4.25 / 5."
24,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27078093-alice-lippart,3,"Very interesting and educational, but a bit of an effort to get through."
25,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"When this title arrived, before I opened the pack I thought there were two books inside, and my stomach sank a bit at the thought of ploughing through a 600 page wrist-buster. Apart from anything else, very long popular science books are often loaded with affectation, and this impression was not helped by the toe-curling praise of a previous title ('The notion of ""popular science"" doesn't come close to describing this achievement. It is literature.' Ick.) Not to mention the tedious, very personal prologue.Thankfully, though, the writing settles down once Siddhartha Mukherjee gets on to the actual content, though the style remains a little flowery. There are minor quibbles of detail (friars, for example, are described as monks) but what follows is a detailed and well-told story of the development of genetics, from Darwin and Mendel's early work to the modern medical implications and dangers of making changes at a genetic level. In fact the potential negatives of genetic theory come in early and are repeatedly stressed. Starting with eugenics and the Nazis, that sense of threat never goes away - the reader gets the impression that at times that Mukherjee would probably rather we had never found about genes. This is the most original and strongest aspect of the book.You will either love or be irritated by the regular return to the author's family story - I'm in the second camp as it really has very little to do with science or history of science, but I appreciate it will help those who find the idea of reading a purely science-based book scary.The history of science side isn't bad, though Darwin is given a distinctly old-fashioned lone genius treatment. We are told 'The essence of Darwin's disruptive genius was his ability to think about nature not as a fact - but as a process' - but in reality this viewpoint was very much in the air as shown by Wallace's letter, independently duplicating many of Darwin's ideas, which panicked Darwin into publication. I am not doing down Darwin's contributions, which were huge - but the change of viewpoint we are told about was by no means unique to him.I was also disappointed by the lack of coverage of epigenetics, the idea that genes don't have quite the sole central importance that was once thought, as what is more important is the combination of the genes and the various external factors that turn them on and off. In effect we've moved on from the gene being the lone controller to a major part of a much more complex (and hence harder to explain) system.This has had a major impact in the field, but perhaps because of the book's title, Mukherjee hardly gives the concept any coverage.Overall there is plenty of material here both on the development of genetic theory and medicine and on the moral implications of such work. For me, Matt Ridley's Genome was a better backgrounder if you don't also want the medical content, and either book needs to be read alongside Nessa Carey's The Epigenetic Revolution. But there is no doubt that if you like the blockbuster approach to science reading - perhaps as something to get you through some long holiday flights - this is an excellent example of the genre."

It is so well written and very engaging, but it does includes many details (and reads like a textbook for some of the time). I am not writing this to discourage anyone from reading this, just to set the expectations if you decide to approach this book. Since I studied some extended biology in the past it was easy for me to dive into the RNA and the amino acid described at length, so just FYI. The author did an amazing job spicing up the book with stories and interesting topics (intelligence, mental health and much more). He is discussing at length our ability to know what is in our genes, and to decide what will be in them more and more. It is a world inhabited by “previvors” and “post-humans”: men and women who have been screened for genetic vulnerabilities or created with altered genetic propensities. The consequences are not only scientific, but also emotionally the world is going to change. Would you decide to have no people with mental illness in the world? No crippled people? No people with terrible diseases? As Edvard Munch put it, “[My troubles] are part of me and my art. They are indistinguishable from me, and [treatment] would destroy my art. I want to keep those sufferings.”  The author takes us to a journey from Charles Darwin, to Mendel and later to IVF. The mysterious gene unravelling, the strength in the system that we live through holds and creates everything. In every cell in your body, you have two meters of the stuff; if we were to draw a scaled-up picture of it with the DNA as thick as sewing thread, that cell’s worth would be about 200 kilometers longThere is a lot still unknown, and there are moral implications that are yet to be explored. But we do have the technical ability to do many things in a tube today, that would be a far fetched dream not long ago. We do not know where genes come from, or how they arose. Nor can we know why this method of information transfer and data storage was chosen over all other possible methods in biology. But we can try to reconstruct the primordial origin of genes in a test tube. To read a very engaging book about project Eugenics, I can highly recommend reading Necessary Lies by Diane Chamberlain (it has some faults, but overall a really good book). I learned a few thing about the sterilization that was done not too long ago, not presented as an option (or even really presented at all) to the feeble minded (or just poor uneducated people). Taking from people their basics rights without even the slightest remorse.I am planning on reading his Pulitzer Award winner sometime soon. Almost 4.5 stars, and my favorite of the genre for this year."
27,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,4,"This book offers a comprehensive and engaging overview of genetics. It includes the history of the field, anecdotes of its development, a well-paced technical explanation of the high level aspects, and quite a lot of discussion on the associated moral dilemmas that we are faced with as we understand how we can use this technology to change our own species.Unfortunately, the book does not delve into some of the aspects of modern genetics that I find most interesting, such as gene drive. These are discussed near the very end almost as an afterthought, and are hardly given enough focus. Similarly, epigenetics is only briefly touched on. Lastly, the book is very human-centric and does not discover genetics in a broader context of evolution in animals (e.g. selfish genes), which I find fascinating.Overall, this will likely become my default recommendation for the reference Genetics book for a general interested reader who is mostly interested in the history of genetics, who enjoys thinking about the ethics of genetics in humans, and who wants to get a good high-level overview of the technical aspects. 4/5"
28,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"Siddhartha Mukherjee dove deep into the history of the gene and provided and extremely thorough account of the various associated discovery that have occurred since Darwin's day. This book is heavy on the history, and semi light on the science. Each discovery is detailed, but the science involved is related in a manner that is accessible to the nonscientists. One thing I found curious was his discussion of Lamarck. Recently I finished reading Survival of the Sickest, but Sharon Moalem, in which it was suggested that Lamarck was more of a science writer than a theorist. Moalem posited that it was not Lamarck who came up with the idea that traits acquired during the lifetime were passed down. Rather, Lamarck simply championed that idea, which was the dominant paradigm of the time, in his writing. Mukherjee, like every author I have read except Moalem, took it as a given that Lamarck was the originator of such thought. I now feel compelled to research this and find out who is correct. In this rich history, Mukherjee shared many interesting tidbits that I hadn't heard or had forgotten about. His choice of facts, both of a personal and scientific nature, kept the book humming along. Despite being a longer than usual science book, it felt as if moved fairly fast. Some of, what I thought, the more interesting parts of the books were as follows:The best biography of a scientists involved Hermann Muller. When Muller first began his career, he was extremely enamored with eugenics. John Morgan was a prominent expert in eugenics and Muller sought him out to work in his lab. Muller worked on many aspects of genetics and, as a result of his significant contributions , became a Nobel laureate. As he continued his work, Muller realized that instead of eugenics serving to level the playing field, it was a tool of oppression, mainly aimed at minorities and the poor. Not wanting to be on the wrong side of history, Muller became very politically active. As editor of a progressive leftist journal called The Spark, he helped champion ideas that promoted equality for women, minorities, and the poor. Instead of being thanked for his efforts, Muller's outspoken views on equality made him a target of the FBI. He underwent a character assassination that attacked him socially, professionally, and politically. Not being able to endure it any longer, he walked out into the woods, took a bottle of pills and fell asleep under a tree. Turned out the pills were not enough to kill him. Grad students found him walking around in a daze. His best analogy of genes involved a rare syndrome. According to Mukherjee, having a disorder that enables your brain to remember every single thing you have ever experienced might seem like a superpower, but it's more like a crippling disease. He likens it to being in a loud crowd, every moment of your life, and never being able to turn the sound down low enough so you can hear the people you love and want to talk to. It's just noise all the time. He suggested that genes act like memory. If epigenetic modification does not silence some genes and express others, the end product could never be a fully functioning organism. We are all born with many genes. But if we expressed them all, all of the time, we would not be human. We would not be anything we recognize. Epigenetic modification is happening all of the time and cannot be separated from gene expression. Sometimes epigenetic modification can turn off and on genes many times in a second. Sometimes it can silence a gene for an entire lifetime, making it as if the gene never existed at all. There was a wonderful discussion on genes, sex, and gender identity that was top notch. Mukherjee related how sex is determined by the X or Y chromosome *AND* the SRY gene. Not only do the SRY gene and the Y chromosome need to interact, but the SRY gene itself (which in turn regulated the Y chromosome) is itself regulated other genes. This creates a very complex model of gene expression. It's not simple. We cannot just say, ""This person is male,"" or ""That person is female."" There is more to it. Genetically, A person can be genetically male, possessing a Y chromosome, but the Y chromosome is not regulated and the person never becomes what we would recognize as male. Thus, a person with a Y chromosome might feel, act, and look like a female. A person might look like a male but their brain, lacking SRY gene regulation of the Y chromosome, might in a real biological sense identify as female. I would like to have seen a discussion of how gender roles have affected gender identity. That cannot really be found in this book, which was disappointing. However, that was the only exception to a truly fantastic discussion of gender identity. Mukherjee provided an equally wonderful discussion about race, IQ, and genes. It was balanced, well researched, and well presented. I would have liked more examples of epigenetic modification. There probably wasn't time, considering how long the book was, but there are so many wonderful studies and I never get tired of reading about them. He included the usual suspects and that got the point across to the reader in an effective manner. I would say the overall tone of this book was fairly conservative -- paying homage to Dawkins, paying head to concerns about playing God, expressing concern for those who use evidence from epigenetics to shift paradigms too wildly, etc. Even with that, it was a solid piece of work. "
29,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2908629-ellie,5,"I loved Siddhartha Mukherjee’s previous book, The Emperor of All Maladies. Well, maybe “love” is not the correct word, since I found it profoundly unsettling and a little nervewracking (especially having a mother who died of cancer). But it was compulsively page turning and fascinating.So I was very excited to get a copy of The Gene.The Gene felt to me like a very readable textbook of genetics from the Greeks to (of course) Mendel to the present, with a look at the future. It is surprisingly interesting-Mukherjee writes well and I enjoyed his character sketches of the various players in this history.The science of the book is connected to Mukherjee’s personal experience of dealing with mental illness in his family. Obviously, the study of genetics is no mere pastime but a subject he has a vested interest in. Will he become ill (he had struggles as a teen)? What about his children? I found this personal investment very moving and helped keep the book from being only a textbook. It increased my emotional connection to the work. I also realized that even those of us who don’t deal with mental illness in our families often deal with other genetically connected illnesses. All of us are shaped by our genetic code and so this book is relevant to everyone.Studies indicate that both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have a genetic component. Mukherjee has reason to be scared. He concerns himself with questions such as why do some members of a family manifest a genetic illness and not others? What role does the family (or other aspects of the environment) play? Clearly, the manifestation of mental illness is caused by more than one factor.Mukherjee mulls over the genetics and their implications. What does a person do with this information? And how much information is helpful?I was a little overwhelmed by the science of the book. There’s a lot of information to take in and try to synthesize. Mukherjee starts with the Greeks and keeps going. Of course, Mendel plays a key role but I was surprised at the extent to which Darwin was involved. Of course, this is a sign of how ignorant I was. I’m not sure how much of the science I will retain-I would probably have to study the book rather than simply read it and read related material as well to truly grasp all the material in this book.Of particular interest to me was the issue of eugenics. I have become aware of how active eugenicists were in the United States and some of the horror they inflicted (forced sterilization, primarily of black and poor people, as well as the cognitively limited and mentally ill). Hitler’s Germany took to an extreme something practiced here as well. The nightmare of Nazi Germany resulted in the disappearance of eugenics in the U.S. but it’s important to know how active we were in this frightening field. The promise of human perfection is always something to beware of.With all the advances in the field and possibilities for doing good-as well as doing harm-Mukherjee’s book feels like a “must read,” especially for people like myself with very little knowledge (other than Mendel, the controversy around stem cell research, and eugenics). But there is much, much more going on. In order to begin to understand the present (let alone the future), it is important to understand the past. Mukherjee offers a comprehensive coverage of the development of gene theory and its implications for our future.I especially enjoyed all the character sketches of the many scientists involved in the study of genetics. They leavened the book and added a personal touch. Thank you Scribner Publishing, Netgalley, and Siddhartha Mukherjee for providing me with this fascinating work in exchange for a fair and honest review."
30,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12022033-joshua-rigsby,4,"I will readily admit that a lot of this went over my head. It was interesting to see the history of genetics laid out chronologically. The back-biting and competitive nature of scientific research comes to the fore in striking clarity. The random luck and dogged trial and error that often propels new understandings in research is fascinating. I enjoyed learning about the experiments that gave rise to current genetic theories. Especially because so much has happened in the field since I was in school, and because the ideas and stories surrounding genetic research quickly gets diluted into urban legend by a scientifically illiterate public. This is a great book, certainly worth reading before it gets eclipsed by new advances in the field. Mukherjee does a great job of buoying up some of the research-intensive jargon with illustrations and personal stories to keep the reader interested. It's definitely worth the effort. "
31,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3055585-marian,3,"Unfortunately, this book is for much of its length more or less a textbook on the history of genetics. A nicely written one, with ""characters"" (e.g., Mendel, Darwin, less-well known names) and their stories woven in--though personally I didn't care about details like the grub at the restaurant in Hawaii where several researchers dined while birthing a breakthrough, or the neon signs along the strip; maybe Mukherjee should dip his oar into fiction or creative nonfiction. The development of his personal family story (bipolar disorder and schizophrenia affect many on his father's side) is less than satisfying, and does not have quite the impact he wishes it to. Discussion of the latest technologies and their ethical hazards is likewise a bit workmanlike, and since this tech is constantly evolving and will soon be yesterday's news (if it's not already), voice and insight are everything. "
32,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,3,"The Emperor of All Maladies, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 2011, is among my most memorable reads of the past decade. So it was a disappointment to find that I could never really engage with Mukherjee’s second full-length work. There’s no denying this book’s impressive scope: it’s a comprehensive survey of the past 150 years of genetics research, but it also stretches back to antiquity to see the different ways people have imagined that heredity works. It’s a no-holds-barred science and social history text, both chronological and thematic in approach, and it also surprises with its breadth of literary reference (as in the epigraphs from 1Q84 and The Importance of Being Earnest). However, my favorite snippets were those that constitute a mini family memoir of the schizophrenia that runs through the author’s India-based family.Part of the problem was that a lot of the early material concerning Gregor Mendel and Charles Darwin is very familiar to me. High school genetics material has stayed fresh in my mind even though so many other subjects have faded, and I’ve done a lot of reading on Darwin for my Victorian Literature MA and on my own time. Darwin’s cousin, Francis Galton, then provides a segue into the dark side of genetics: eugenics. A lot of space is given to Nazism, but Mukherjee also hits closer to home with the case of Carrie Buck, a “feeble-minded” woman whose enforced sterilization the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed in 1927.Other important figures in the history of genetics include Dutch botanist Hugo de Vries, Hermann Muller, Oswald Avery, Linus Pauling, and the famous English team that discovered the structure of DNA, Watson, Crick & Franklin. Parts Three and Four, which chronicle the advances in genetics that fell between the 1970s and early 2000s, struck me as particularly dull, whereas Part Five held my interest much more strongly in that it brings things up to date with the developments of the last 15 years, including epigenetics, genetic testing for breast cancer and schizophrenia, stem cell therapy and the search for a “gay gene.”The book did leave me with a strong sense that our knowledge of genes – the least divisible unit of information about life – affects our understanding of the human identity and future:In the early decades of the twenty-first century, we are learning to speak yet another language of cause and effect, and constructing a new epidemiology of self: we are beginning to describe illness, identity, affinity, temperament, preferences—and, ultimately, fate and choice—in terms of genes and genomes. This is not to make the absurd claim that genes are the only lenses through which fundamental aspects of our nature and destiny can be viewed. But it is to propose and to give serious consideration to one of the most provocative ideas about our history and future: that the influence of genes on our lives and beings is richer, deeper, and more unnerving than we had imagined. This idea becomes even more provocative and destabilizing as we learn to interpret, alter, and manipulate the genome intentionally, thereby acquiring the ability to alter future fates and choices.However, at nearly 500 very dense, small-print pages, this book will, I fear, struggle to find a broad readership. Is it for science majors and graduate students? They’re likely to have their own university-approved textbooks. Is it an introduction for the general layman? Without a keen interest in science and a determination to learn the last word about genetics, readers are unlikely to persist with such a tome. I have a greater than average interest in genetic diseases, yet couldn’t manage more than a desultory skim. Unlike The Emperor of All Maladies, I can’t see this becoming a modern classic of popular science writing. For me it’s this year’s Citizen Kane: an achievement I can objectively admire but not personally warm to.Originally published on my blog, Bookish Beck."

He was on the way towards a theory of heredity - to identifying the existence of genes.Siddhartha Mukherjee is a cancer physician and researcher, a stem cell biologist and cancer geneticist.

34,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43878721-vinay,5,"At the risk of sounding repetitive, this was a stunning book - Siddhartha Mukherjee is a beautiful writer. As I was telling a friend, if a scientific historian can make slow, methodical scientific research as engaging as a Frederick Forsyth novel, he’s doing his job right. It’s a must read for anyone with even a passing interest in BiologyCouple of things I liked:- Competitive scientific research makes for great reading - especially Crick-Watson v/s Wilkins v/s Franklin (on the structure of DNA), Craig Venter/Celera v/s the HGP (on sequencing the human genome) and Genentech v/s Walter Gilbert (on synthetic insulin). The academia v/s industry theme in research/innovation played out again (I last saw it in The Innovators — Bell Labs v/s Stanford/MIT)- The chapter on the Asilomar conference was fascinating - it always amazes me when a group can self-regulate against long-term loss at the cost of immediate progress. Especially relevant today, given Junjiu Huang’s and the Chinese’s recent experiments- I loved the ethical questions Mukherjee raises. The interesting thing about scientific innovation is that substantial innovation comes into conflict with legislation (e.g., Uber v/s Governments), but fundamental innovation comes into conflict with society’s understanding of morality and ethics. Who defines which genetic interventions may be permitted or constrained? Is it okay for a parent to abort a foetus that would have average IQ (assuming this is possible etc.)?- The parts on Nature v/s Nurture - something I’ve always been curious about. It seems clear that, like it or not, genes play a significant part in defining who we are. The search for the gene determining sexuality was interesting as well - I wonder if we’ll find it soon, and what the political consequences might be if we knew sexuality was completely geneticAnd so much more. Reading about Genetics sometimes amuses me by how easily we use the word ‘disrupt’. “Disrupting"" the home service aggregator space is fundamentally different from “disrupting” our ability to edit genomes. I wish I read more about topics like the latter."
35,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"Hah! I made it! I picked this book up with the intention of being done before my horse-back riding vacation. I got through with all of half an hour to spare. Anyhow, to say that ""I really liked it"" might be pushing the truth a bit. I truly loved some of the bits, such as the discovery of patterns of inheritance, the horror of eugenics, ""the genetics of identity and 'normalcy'"". Other things, such as the mapping of the human genome were mind-numbingly boring (to me, I know this is fascinating to others). Although written for the lay person, this is not a very easy book to read. Having read much on the subject, I found most of it comprehensible enough, but there were parts I didn't even bother to try to get. There was fewer personal fates than in ""the Emperor of all Maladies"", which severely reduced forward tension. There is of course the story of the author's family's history of schizophrenia, but this isn't quite enough. I mean, what is there to do about that? I wasn't biting my nails hoping for the uncle to survive here. I do understand that living in the shadow of such a serious disease with such marked genetic component, as in this case, would be influential. It just didn't do enough for the book.However, there is no denying that this is a book every highschool student should read. And anyone else unfamiliar with the territory. This book sets down the basic concepts. The discovery of the gene, the mapping of the human genome, the ethical considerations in aborting children with chromosome faults, well of it, has a profound influence on life today. This book should be read for its informative content. As for eugenics - ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."" - George Santayana. "
36,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6940509-hannah,4,"4 Stars - Fantastic bookThis book is fully deserving of the 4 star rating. The author took what is a complicated topic, the history of genes, and created an engaging and fascinating read.The title does a great job at telling you what the book's about. Mukherjee gives us a in-depth look at how modern science's study of the gene came to be. He interweaves science with history and his personal story - the story of his family. I appreciate when people share their personal history with a wider audience. He didn't have to by any means, even though it did affect him deeply. Not surprisingly, this aspect made the book more personal. Mukherjee's basic thesis, and I'm watering this down significantly, is that it's impossible to understand anything without understanding the gene. And the way Mukherjee lays out the book this makes sense. I'll admit that some of the science went over my head just a bit, but I honestly know that I know more now than I did before, which is always a good thing when reading non-fiction. The writing is professional and well-done but not overly academic or dry. My expertise is not in the sciences and not once did I feel like the writing held me back from learning. I can honestly say you can read this with no background and not have a problem - at least in terms of the writing.Some of the more noteworthy aspects, or parts that stood out to me, dealt with eugenics. Let me just say that eugenics has always and will always make me feel nauseous. I think a lot of people associate eugenics with Nazi Germany and rightfully so. However, I think more people need to know more about eugenics and America because it was a large part of our (American here) history. I'm glad I had teachers throughout my academic life who tackled this subject head on. It's important to know about because the Nazis weren't the only ones who championed eugenics. Quickly, going back to the Nazis one thing I was not aware of before reading this book was the pre-Holocaust killings that started in 1935. They started with children, adolescents, and juvenile delinquents. Systematic extermination started long before what we know as the Holocaust and death camps existed. Do I recommend this one? Absolutely!"

I am not a scientist, but I do know that some of the explications by the author (originally published in the New Yorker) have provoked responses from scientists who disagree with him over epigenetics, as well as the relation of sex and IQ to genes. (One grad student in the UK, in a short, breezy critique, even criticized the author's writing style. Whereas, the author's lucidity is a strong point for we lay people, eh?).https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/20...I have since learned that the author made some changes to later editions of this in response to the critique.The book covers a good deal of ground, both chronologically and topically. For everything one learns, one also learns that there are a lot of unanswered questions. This is fine. The author does not pretend his book is the final word. But it does give readers a foundation for exploring the wide array of topics he covers and the questions he raises. And far from being a recondite subject, it's one with tremendous social implications that should concern us all.----------Since reading this book, I have also read this book, which is the better book on the subject. Mukherjee is a cancer specialist, which makes his book on cancer stronger than his gene book. He's not a specialist on genetics, which is why he proved incorrect on epigenetics. https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Another book on genetics that I just read and reviewed....https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."

I can see how this week the Gene is #1 on the NY Times bestsellers's list. His voice is engaging, the story is brilliantly and poignantly written, with a thrilling narrative that has kept me glued to each and every page. He is not only a scientist, but he scribes like a bone fide literary writer-- Amazing! Mukherjee won the Pulitzer for his previous book and is a prominent cancer researcher. The New York Times book reviewer called this book, ""A Molecular Pursuit of the Self."" The last book I read about the gene, Richard Dawkins's The Selfish Gene, changed my whole way of looking at a human being! For me there is something spiritual about science! I believe the gene is the bridge between science and spirituality. In fact, reading about science always makes me more spiritual! There is so much we don't know that cannot be explained by science. Isaac Newton, the famous 17th century physicist himself was seriously stumped by many factors in the universe he couldn't explain, calling it ""the invisible hand"" (of God). I am curious as to the many different ways this author will tackle the history and nature of the human gene."
39,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,2,"Siddhartha Mukherjee's first book, The Emperor of All Maladies, won the Pulitzer Prize, which may be one reason why this book is a bit of a let down. This book was pretty much guaranteed to sell, and so Mukherjee could be more self-indulgent with his language and have a little insulation from particularly stringent editorial suggestions. The Gene: An Intimate History is a weighty tome, covering human understandings of heredity for the past two thousand years or so, and the history of genetics research for roughly the last two centuries. Yet the book could have been substantially reduced in size merely by the omission of some of the many adjectives or pointless details. (I mean, some colour is nice, but does the reader need to know that on arriving at a scientific conference in the 1970s, one attendee took a cab from the airport late at night and that from his hotel room, said attendee could see the conference location? Probably not.) Large swathes of the book sag, seemingly included more for the sake of comprehensive coverage than because even Mukherjee was interested in them. The Gene is at its best when Mukherjee is tackling particular case studies that illuminate some particular ethical aspect of genetic research, or when he speaks to contemporary concerns (like gaining a better understanding of transgender and cisgender identities). If he'd structured the book around those questions, rather than trying to shoehorn in two millennia worth of research, this would have been a better read.Otherwise The Gene becomes a history of science/genetics textbook which isn't that great at being a history. Mukherjee's lack of training in critical source analysis becomes glaringly obvious at certain points—I gritted my teeth through much of his framing of Rosalind Franklin. (He draws heavily on accounts of her written by Watson and Crick, so she's ""difficult"", but of the fact that James Watson is a bigoted ass? Not a peep.) He also seems to have cribbed from other pop histories of science at various points, and this leads him into some errors that even I, very much not an expert in this field, could spot. For instance, Mukherjee writes that Galen's theory that male and female reproductive organs were analogues of each other was stretched ""to its absurd point"" in the Middle Ages. He states that this can be seen in a ""medieval verse, an anatomical mnemonic for medical students: Though they of different sexes be Yet on the whole, they're the same as we For those that have the strictest searchers been Find women are just men turned outside in.""Setting aside the debatable point of whether or not this is actually a mnemonic, it's most certainly not medieval. It's a slightly altered bit of doggerel from the anonymous late seventeenth-century sex manual and midwifery guide known as Aristotle's Masterpiece. Where Mukherjee actually got it from, though, isn't so clear because of the clunky and inefficient quasi-end note system he employs. He'd had been better served by sticking to his strengths in contemporary science, and leaving the science to the historians. "

An example of great science writing that doesn't condescend the reader, but rather elevates the reader by giving some sharp and hard science to grapple with. Mukherjee's ability to communicate the ideas, techniques, history and examples of our history of genetics is a real high-point of science writing in general. While I did enjoy his working in of familial history with mental illness, I don't think it was quite successfully woven throughout the book to make it feel quite as relevant as it could have been, and actually, at times, felt sprinkled in last minute to try to add a ""human"" element to what is otherwise easy-to-digest, rigorous science writing.Perhaps one of the most interesting points Mukherjee makes early on is to link the gene with other humanity-changing discoveries of the 20th century: the gene, the byte, and the atom. All three unlocking the code of how things work, loaded with benevolent potential but also bearing a sinister capacity for destruction--the atom and the bomb, the byte and AI, and the gene's horrific history connected to eugenics.Particularly exciting was the later, more recent gene-editing chapter covering the possibilities of CRSPR/Cas9, a protein that was discovered in bacteria at a yogurt/cheese plant in 2011. The protein is useful in the editing of specific, targeted genes in DNA--something that was not possible to do before its discovery (and still not able to be performed at the time of the book's writing in 2015). This was made doubly exciting as while I was reading this section, I received a notification on my phone with news about researchers at Oregon Health and Science University having successfully edited out a gene causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from human embryos using the CRSPR/Cas9 gene-editing method. Steps closer to the exciting (and probably supremely dangerous) capacity for gene-selection in humans.The gene is beautifully simple in all of its complexity. But it presents startling and terrifying moral blockades. Mukherjee presents an extremely well-researched and unbiased presentation of all sides of this moral dilemma we are (and will continue to be) facing about our ability to edit the fundamental instructions in the manual for making humans. The book is, perhaps, a vital read to prepare you for the science wars to come."

I enjoyed reading this book very much. I purposely took my time to study the fascinating intricacies of how the science to parse out visual clues and biochemical reactions was developed by people who had nothing but guesses and hypotheses to work from. Each new discovery led to small forward steps. Collaborations between scientists and sharing information, passing down their discoveries to yet another generation of investigators were enormously important to figuring it all out. But since people learned the accidental interactions of nurture and nature affect not only personality, but genes too, genetics also profoundly interested those who wondered if conditional nurture and nature could be forced on purpose on the gene to correct mature imperfections and make humans disease free. The sometimes sad failures in attempts to treat patients cursed with miserable genetic diseases as well as the tantalizing successes are also clearly examined from all sides of the reasons for philosophical and medical caution. The horrors of the half-baked early eugenics movements in Europe and America are placed in context, and it is obvious these 'scientific' ideas reflected racial discrimination more than actual scientific fact. However, I feel sorrow how the 1920's-1950's eugenics movements poisoned the well of genetic discoveries in certain directions, particularly after ending in President George W. Bush's banning of work with stem cells. Pure idiocy, in my opinion, gentle reader.Siddhartha Mukherjee writes in clear lucid language and in a logical procession of the centuries of research. He also gives short and interesting biographies of the many scientists who spent so many years trying to decipher the mysteries of why offspring are similar to their parents and yet show remarkable alterations which differentiate us from each other, with the exception of many twins. The book has historical photographs, a glossary, a timeline of discoveries, a section of notes, a bibliography, and an index. 'The Gene: An Intimate History' is a wonderful science read!"

Mukherjee uses his own family as a case study to further the discussion. As a narrator Dr. Mukherjee keeps the pace slow and drama-like. With politics, social impact, progressive science making clunky appearances in this chunky books, scientific inquiry takes a back seat every now and then.

This book desperately cries out for an editor. It’s an excessively detailed history of genetics, filled to the brim with a massive cast of characters and sprinkled with an account of the author’s own family history of mental illness. Reading it felt like a slog — after every 2 or 3 chapters, I’d have to set it down for a while to regain the will to continue. I filled in some gaps in my understanding of genetics, but I didn’t particularly enjoy the process.“Gene” is also replete with metaphors, more than you can count, undoubtedly in attempt to make its dense subject matter more accessible to a general audience. Example: “Organ by organ, the body transforms into mineral, like the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz, ultimately leading to tissue degeneration…” We get it just fine without the Tin Man analogy. By the time you see the cognitive mind compared to a mechanical engine (how else to understand it?) for the 63rd time, it will start to grate on you."

With his beautiful prose, he weaves through the chromosomes, taking the reader on a unique journey towards coming to know our own selves. I was left feeling awestruck, mesmerized, and thirsty for more knowledge upon finishing this book. Having read Dawkins' ""The selfish gene"", this book usurps the title of a best book on the topic (though it helps to have read Dawkins prior to reading this).Mukherjee is a national treasure.

Three profoundly destabilizing scientific ideas ricochet through the twentieth century, trisecting it into three unequal parts: the atom, the byte, the gene. Each is foreshadowed by an earlier century, but dazzles into full prominence in the twentieth. Each begins its life as a rather abstract scientific concept, but grows to invade multiple human discourses – thereby transforming culture, society, politics, and language. But the most crucial parallel between the three ideas, by far, is conceptual: each represents the irreducible unit – the building block, the basic organizational unit – of a larger whole: the atom, of matter; the byte (or “bit”), of digitized information; the gene, of heredity and biological information.
Siddhartha Mukherjee, as a cancer physician and researcher, made a name for himself with  The Emperor of All Maladies, and when he was done writing it, he felt so completely drained that he knew he had no other book inside him. Eventually, Mukherjee realised that he did have one more story – that of the “normal” gene; its makeup, the history behind its discovery, and current applications – and he wrote The Gene as a sort of prequel to Emperor. While the history behind theories of heredity (from those of Aristotle and Pythagoras to Darwin and Mendel) made for an interesting narrative, I realised as I went along that there wasn't much here that I hadn't learned in high school. And as the story picks up steam into the modern day – with philosophical warnings about the future of genetically modified humans – again, it felt like you'd need to be hiding under a rock not to know what the current debate is. So, this isn't some paradigm-shifting exposé of the shadowlands of science, but it does have value: with his assured and easy voice, Mukherjee is able to make both history and science interesting and accessible (something not always achieved by my own erstwhile teachers), and to have assembled everything in one volume connects all of the dots in a satisfying manner. This is light science and I enjoyed it quite a bit.
Freaks become norms, and norms become extinct. Monster by monster, evolution advanced.
 As I said, I don't think the history of thought about heredity has many surprises for someone who took grade nine Biology, and even its corruption into the Eugenics movements of the early/mid twentieth century (culminating not just in the horrors of Nazi Germany and Mengele's twin experiments, but the forced sterilisations found throughout North America) is common knowledge. When this historical narrative took off for me began with Watson and Crick trying to figure out the structure of DNA, and while a neighbouring researcher like Rosalind Franklin was perfecting her techniques for actually photographing the now famous helices, Watson and Crick were going at the problem obliquely: using Tinkertoys to assemble the various ways in which what little was known about genetic material could possibly be turned into a stable structure. What I liked best about this idea – besides Mukherjee always being careful to note the contributions of researchers like Franklin who might otherwise be forgotten in the historical narrative – was that this idea of researching the gene obliquely seems to be the only way it works. You want to efficiently write out the genome of a worm? Use a “shotgun” approach to separate and analyse random strings of DNA and hope they overlap enough to solve the entire sequence like a cryptogram. Want to discover the location of a single mutated gene that causes a disease like Cystic Fibrosis? First assemble massive family histories of sufferers and carriers and discover what other traits might be passed along in tandem with the mutation, thus narrowing the search for the real culprit. This notion of not really being able to study a gene directly led to something that was a surprise to me: When the Human Genome Project announced that they had succeeded at mapping the human genome, I thought that meant that we now knew the location and function of every gene in the human body. Turns out it “only” meant that the three billion or so base pairs were mapped (which includes long strings of exomes and introns and other non-true DNA as I understand it) and that only then could researchers begin to decipher what it all meant. We're not actually as far ahead as I had assumed.
That one of the most elemental diseases in human history happens to arise from the corruption of the two most elemental processes in biology is not a coincidence: cancer co-opts the logic of both evolution and heredity; it is a pathological convergence of Mendel and Darwin. Cancer cells arise via mutation, survival, natural selection, and growth. And they transmit the instructions for malignant growth to their daughter cells via their genes. As biologists realized in the early 1980s, cancer, then, was a “new” kind of genetic disease – the result of heredity, evolution, environment, and chance all mixed together.
I appreciate that we are living in an era of fake news and viral conspiracy theories, but I was stunned when a bright and educated young woman told me just last week that she knows that “they” have found the cure for cancer and are suppressing it for profit. As a cancer specialist, Mukherjee really shines when describing the genetic (and nongenetic) components of various forms of cancer, and if there were a magic drug or gene therapy that could simply enter the body and fix the various cancer-related mutated cells, I'm going to assume that at least one of the life-long lab-bound researchers who is working on it would rather publish than be bought off (while watching friends and family members succumb to the disease). I need to pick up  The Emperor of All Maladies.More interesting ideas: There is more genetic variation within a troop of Chimpanzees than within a random grouping of humans; indeed, there is more genetic variation within so-called “races” of humans than between races. I loved the idea of Mitochondrial Eve: Because the mitochondrial information within every human cell is passed on only from mother to daughter, every time a woman has only sons, her own information is lost. Tracing back the vast human family tree through its dead ends and branches, we all end up at a common female ancestor (mentally, that doesn't feel true. I'd be impressed with twenty or a hundred common mitochondrial lines – does the fact we all share the same mitochondrial information really mean one common ancestor? Have they actually found variants in so-called dead ends? I still liked the idea, though.) And I loved that every time the genetic researchers felt they were on the brink of something morally questionable – mixing human and animal DNA, creating designer human embryos – they would call their own conferences and decide on self-imposed moratoriums (yet, what can they do when Chinese researchers say they intend to proceed with whatever they like?) 
History repeats itself, in part because the genome repeats itself. And the genome repeats itself, in part because history does. The impulses, ambitions, fantasies, and desires that drive human history are, at least in part, encoded in the human genome. And human history has, in turn, selected genomes that carry these impulses, ambitions, fantasies, and desires. This self-fulfilling circle of logic is responsible for some of the most magnificent and evocative qualities in our species, but also some of the most reprehensible. It is far too much to ask ourselves to escape the orbit of this logic, but recognizing its inherent circularity, and being skeptical of its overreach, might protect the weak from the will of the strong, and the 'mutant' from being annihilated by the 'normal'.
Throughout The Gene, Mukherjee intersperses stories from his father's family that feature schizophrenics and manic-depressives. Because of their unhappy and destructive lives, Mukherjee is understandably concerned about passing on the genes for undesirable qualities. Yet, he also makes the point that many of the most creative figures in history – poets and composers and scientists – were probably bipolar; their incredible creative output coming in fits of mania. If we could track down the mutant gene responsible for a Beethoven or a Munsch or a Plath, would the world be better off for eliminating their future ilk? It seems inevitable that we will eventually “perfect” the human genome – eliminating all future variation and putting the brakes on the processes of evolution – and if I'm alive for it, it will be fascinating to see how we decide what the desirable “wild type” human will be. Again, there was nothing earth-shattering in The Gene, but it's well written and full of interesting linkages; a fine primer for the layperson."
50,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34550725-alfred-haplo,5,"It took a while, but we did it - man discovered the gene. The earliest quest to understand and control hereditary, with methods often cruel and crude, was fraught with suppositions and ignorance. Once the gene was irrefutably discovered, genetics became a bonafide exhilarating science that fired the imagination of scientific communities worldwide and led to major breakthroughs after breakthroughs. As of today, there is an international race among nations to manipulate the human genome, with ethics, moral and history as guideposts and time as the final defense.  The story of the gene from its rudimentary origins to post-human genome sequencing is captured engagingly in The Gene: An Intimate History by Dr Siddharta Murkherjee. A tour de force offering, The Gene is Mukherjee’s third non-fiction book* and his broadest in scope. Published in 2016, it successfully accomplishes the monumental task of consolidating information from hundreds of scientific publications and sources, all of of which is interpreted comprehensively in Murkherjee’s thoughtful pen and expressed with elegant insights. Oftentimes, genetics is regarded as dry and technical, and indeed it can be, when viewed as discrete facts and numeric data. Yet, when we open ourselves to the wonder of what genes mean to us as human beings on a macro level, in how it shapes our evolutionary past and creates a hereditary blueprint for an enhanced future, it becomes philosophically profound. As readers of books, we are familiar with the alphabets ABCD to Z. Twenty-six letters used in combinations to build words, then strings of words, which join together to form sentences that make a story. Be it a prolix magnum opus or a succinct poem, or even an exclamation of delight, the most basic conveyance of expression boils down to a letter. Now, transpose that thought on literature to living material. The simplest to the most advanced organisms have the same basic genomic building blocks of just four nucleotide bases, ACTG **. These DNA bases form sequences, which in turn build genomes, that in a multitude of permutations create us. Homo sapiens and bacteria, we share the same fundamental derivation of life. Though you and I, the most complex of creatures, while similar in genotype, can be vastly dissimilar in phenotype and identity. We each have a unique story to tell.  Stories, of persons and personal, abound in The Gene. Threading through the book is Murkherjee’s own evolving tale of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder running through the paternal germ line from familial genetic mutation. Two uncles and a cousin, either died of or was institutionalized due to chronic mental illness, a dark shadow that looms over the family on when and who would suffer next. Murkherjee puts significance to the names of some bravely suffering from genetic mutation diseases, and also to those whose dogged persistence in research have increased our awareness and understanding. Their inspirational stories, and his narrative, so empathetic and clinically observant, elevates The Gene several notches above pop science but never reaching into the monotony of textbooks.  Ultimately, this book is designed for a wide audience with the purpose of enlightening, even provoking, but not teaching. The Gene is not an onerous read, despite its 600-page volume and subject matter. Some knowledge of molecular biology is helpful as a mental shortcut to bypass the glossary of genetic jargon, but it is not necessary to appreciate the implications from historical and philosophical standpoints. Several simple diagrams on DNA, RNA and protein mechanisms aid with visual conceptualizing. A nifty timeline of milestones as discussed in the chapters is provided, and summarized here (not a spoiler, just a long list): (view spoiler)[ 350 BC: Aristotle argues that hereditary information is transmitted in the form of messages. 1859: Darwin publishes On the Origin of species  1865: Mendel identifies discrete units of hereditary 1869: Word “eugenics” is coined. Galton writes Hereditary Genius 1900 to 1909: Word “gene” is coined. Mendel’s work gain more prominence. 1908 to 1915: Morgan et al discovers genetic linkage and crossovers 1927: Buck is sterilized by tubal ligation 1934 to 1935: Drafting of Nuremberg Laws for the Protection of Hereditary Health. 1933 to 1939: German’s “biological state” is launched for racial hygiene 1943: Mengele launches experiments on twins in Auschwitz 1941 to 1944: Avery proves DNA is carrier of genetic information 1953: Watson & Crick discovers the structure of DNA 1945 to 1960: RNA and gene regulation discovered 1961 to 1963: Genetic code solved 1968 to 1973: Recombinant DNA created by Berg, Cohen, Boyer 1975: Moratorium on recombinant proposed in Asilomar meeting 1970 to 1980: New techniques to clone and amplify genes 1976: Cancer, a disease caused by genetic mutations 1978 to 1988: Map of human disease-linked genes 1990: SRY gene determines maleness 1993: Geneticists posit existence of “gay gene” 1994: Massive genetic study debunks conception of race 1998: Human embryonic stem cells derived 1999: Gelsinger died from gene therapy 2000: Draft sequence of human genome project 2005 to 2008: human genome studies reorganizes notion of human origin and migration 2009 to 2013: Genes for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism identified 2010 to 2015 (year book written): New methods to “edit” and change human genomes invented  (hide spoiler)] For centuries, the curious man has tried to understand what makes us, us, in how we look, how we think, what we identify with and what influences our destiny. Now that man has accomplished the seemingly impossible of breaking down us into our most basic component, the gene, can we ever perceive ourselves in the same way again? “A whole assembled from the sum of the parts is different from the whole before it was broken into the parts.” Should man once having un-made man, re-make mankind in a more desired image? “...DNA, the molecule of contradictions, encodes an organism of contradictions. We seek constancy in heredity - and find its opposite: variation. Mutants are necessary to maintain the essence of ourselves. Our genome has negotiated a fragile balance between counterpoised forces, pairing strand with opposing strand, mixing past and future, pitting memory against desire. It is the most human of all things that we possess. Its stewardship may be the ultimate test of knowledge and discernment for our species.”  A book like this calls for numerous quotations, some of which are here (Parts I to VI) and here (Part I) along with my usual ramblings. A highly recommended read. [* The Pulitzer prize (general non-fiction, 2011) winning

53,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16002711-anna,4,"""How can we describe the influence of genes on normal human form and function? The language should have a familiar ring to it; it is the very language that was once used to describe the link between genes and illness. The variations that you inherit from your parents, mixed and matched, specify variations in cellular and developmental processes that ultimately result in variations in physiological states. If these variations affect master-regulatory genes at the tip of a hierarchy, the effect can be binary and strong (male versus female; short statured versus normal). More commonly, the variant/mutant genes lie in lower rungs of cascades of information and can only cause alterations in propensities. Often, dozens of genes are required to create these propensities or predispositions.These propensities intersect with diverse environmental cues and chance to effect diverse outcomes—including variations in form, function, behavior, personality, temperament, identity, and fate. Mostly, they do so only in a probabilistic sense—i.e., only by altering weights and balances, by shifting likelihoods, by making certain outcomes more or less probable.""The scope of this tome is very broad, it is mostly a history of genetics, from Mendel and Darwin to the discovery of chromosomes, genes, the double helix and the genetic code, onward to the Human Genome Project, gene editing and transgenic mice. For me, it was a bit too rambling: too many names mentioned, too many themes and side stories, not linear enough to follow the thoughts easily enough. At the same time some of the topics I would have liked to go into greater depth. The chapter on epigenetics, for instance, I found lacking.The chapter on Eugenics was interesting, some of it new to me. The German version is given a whole chapter, starting from killing deformed children to exterminating Jews. But Germany was not the only nation to embrace eugenics, although it carried it to the extremes. It in fact originated in Great Britain. The phrase itself was coined by Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin. In the US many states passed legal measures to sterilize and confine men and women judged to be genetically inferior. The case of Carrie Buck, sterilised in 1927 for imbecility is vividly portrayed.The book deals with several other topics: bioethics, monogenic (sickle-cell anemia, cystic fibrosis) and poligenic diseases, the role of the environment in whether a disease manifests, genes that regulate development/ embryiogenesis etc. The final chapters deal with the future of genetics, and the ethics of genetic screening/ genetic manipulation in humans."
54,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"Genes are not only the key to life, but holds the details of our history and our future too. In this book, Mukherjee takes us on a journey to uncover the origins of this master code and the story of discovering and deciphering it. It is a story that spans world history, but begins with a monk in an Augustinian monastery who discovers a unit of heredity in his study of peas. Mendel may not have been one of the first to be fascinated but the ideas of heredity, and he certainly wasn’t going to be the last. Darwin was one of the next with his discovery of evolution and the way that certain traits established themselves in the populations of finches on each of the Galapagos Islands.As science advanced during the latter part of the 19th century and into the 20th century, cells started to give up their secrets to the scientists that were studying them. Each discovery added to the knowledge of how each of us carries traits and characteristics from our parents. This dream of making the perfect human from good parents became the spectre that is eugenics, culminating in the horrors with the Nazi obsession with creating the perfect Aryan race and eliminating those that were deemed to be sub-human. Post world war two we knew more about the way that RNA and DNA worked, but no one could work out just how it did it. The brilliant X-ray images of DNA that Rosalind Franklin took gave Francis Crick and James Watson the insight to work out the construction of the beautiful double helix that is DNA. He describes the quest to map the entire human genome, a feat achieved by scientists working across the globe, who just beat a private company who had designs on patenting it.He is eminently qualified to write this, as he is the assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University. He brings us up to date with the latest research and discoveries in genetic research as well as posing the questions that we need to ask and answer as we learn how to change and write to the human genome. To cover all that we have found out about the gene, the book needs to be broad in scope. It is fairly detailed and occasionally baffling and incomprehensible to a non-scientist like myself, but thankfully not very often. Woven through the book too is the story of Mukherjee’s family and their reoccurring history of mental illness as it moved through the generations; it adds a nice personal touch to the book, showing just how our genes can affect us all. If you want a good overview of the history of the gene, you can’t go wrong starting here. "

But reading this book for fun was like swimming through quicksand in the Fire Swamp. There were flashes of brilliance, but overall it was a slog. Mukherjee writes well and has a knack for explaining scientific concepts clearly, but he spent far too much time covering the early history of genetics that we all learned in school. The sections on eugenics were well done; I had no idea that people in the United States were being sterilized on trumped up charges of idiocy in the 1920s and 30s. But this was followed by lots of head shaking about how we are using genetic knowledge and technology today. (He reluctantly admits that terminating a pregnancy if genetic tests detect a serious untreatable condition such as Down syndrome *might* be allowable, but then adds a bunch of caveats.) I found his arguments in the following sections about disease being just ""a mismatch with the environment"" facile and unconvincing. There are so many amazing possibilities inherent in personalized genetic medicine, which I think a physician (of all people) should be celebrating.The high point of the book for me was the brief reference to Dr. Arthur Riggs and City of Hope's role in creating the process now used worldwide to synthesize human insulin. I spent several years working at City of Hope, and during that time, I had the privilege of meeting Dr. Riggs. He is not only an incredible scientist, but a great philanthropist. The vast majority of GR reviewers and literary critics rave about this book, so you may enjoy it much more than I did. But I just didn't see the gene-ious."

Mukherjee, whose first book The Emperor of All Maladies won a Pulitzer prize, knows how to keep an audience and explains genetics in a way that us non-scientific types can understand. He begins with the history of genetics, following the story of the gene through the 19th and 20th centuries up to the present and possible future of this growing field. In addition to giving me an overabundance of trivia for my next awkward social gathering, Mukherjee ends with food for thought, emphasizing the need for caution in this growing field—just because we can do something doesn’t mean we should (Dr. Malcolm from Jurassic Park would be so proud). Science must be balanced with a moral philosophy.Definitely a top pick for nonfiction this year, so if you follow award-winning books, you'll want to get your hands on this one soon."

Some people find the author's constant digressions to his own family's history distracting and unnecessary, but I really enjoyed those. It created a personal narrative among the piles of tedious scientific data.

Very accessible for those with little-to-no science background, though the tidbits of science and a lot of the history are things I remember being taught in highschool/first year human bio units at uni so it wasn't always super riveting to me personally. I didn't know as much about the history of eugenics in the US, however, so it was horrifying to learn about just how bad things got over there before WWII made everyone realise how fucked up eugenics is and everything was shut down. If you're interested in genetics and genes and want to know more about how that branch of study came into being, I'd say this is a pretty good place to start. Might type out a more detailed review later, but a) ya girl has uni stuff to do and b) you know how I am with my little 'RTC/the review never came' habit."

I loved this personal account, it made it all very relatable. Then we move into how we came to discover the gene. It was fascinating to move to different countries where several people were studying and discovering, in their own way, heredity. Some papers got lost or forgotten, to later be discovered. Some discoveries were accidental. Some of the pieces of the heredity puzzle were in the hands of different people. I've highlighted so many paragraphs. Lots!Of course, you can't discuss heredity and genes without mentioning Darwin. But while he was very important he wasn't the only one. Others, less known, at least to me, made tremendous contributions: Mendel for one. By the time we get to the discovery of the gene, we've gone through a lot of history. I won't deny that certain parts are easier to read and understand than others. Nevertheless, this is compelling, fascinating, extremely well-written non-fiction book. While it answers some/lot of questions, as we all know by now, a lot of questions have been raised and are being raised, mostly related to ethics. So in conclusion, this is a terrific non-fiction book, worth spending your time mulling over. I'm in awe of Mukherjee's writing talent as well. I've received this novel via NetGalley. Many thanks to the publishers for the opportunity to read and review this advanced copy."
60,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"The best book ever on the whole shebang of evolution, heredity, and genes. Mukherjee takes a patient, step-by-step historical approach to building our understanding of how it all works and what moral and practical issues arise. He brings the science and the scientists to life, and uses an account of hereditary mental illness in his own family to add further intimacy. He writes like an angel, waxing poetic on rare occasion, although the wax seemed to build up in the epilogue.I thought that Mukherjee's treatment of Charles Murray, the surviving author of The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life was shabby. Murray, in my opinion, is a fine scholar and a man of great integrity and goodwill. Sam Harris reacted in the same way that I did, and he took it up with Siddhartha Mukherjee recently in a conversation on his Waking Up podcast. My sense was that Mukherjee was attempting to pass glibly over the highly contentious issues of intelligence and heredity (particularly in comparing human groups) without being ostracized, threatened, and branded as racist or sexist, as Murray has been. His arguments were incomplete and unconvincing in the book, and his response to Harris was casuistic."

I have hardly found any book with such crystal-clear focus in sight! He narrated an intimate history of the Gene in such an enigmatic way that the words fell out like precious gems in front of the reader. I was so electrified with the beautiful, ingenious endeavours, ambitions, and high dreams of the field that every single word, thought, failure, and success is still glowing vividly in my mind.This one also should have won a Pulitzer like its predecessor!"

I kind of remember this from an interview I saw of him at Town Hall (please donate!), but only realized that after finishing the book.By far the most interesting for me was the history of genetics: how and when were the key discoveries made. I learned a lot (though much was familiar), and reflected what I loved most about his earlier book on cancer, The Emperor of All Maladies. Definitely want more of that from Dr Mukherjee!"
67,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13614926-caidyn-he-him-his,4,"My basic understanding of genetics comes from these things: books I've read about Nazi Germany, General Chemistry I, General Biology I, any talk about twin studies and concordance rates and epigenetics I've had in psychology classes, Behavioral Neuroscience, and that one day when we talked about genetics and race in Religion, Race, and Ethnicity.So, as you can see, I've never taken a genetics class in my life. What I know about genetics comes from little things that I've learned in classes that aren't even about genetics, but they include a bit about it since it's important to know these little things. However, I apparently know a lot more because this book was sprinkled with things that I knew and things that I didn't. Sometimes I could even make an argument for/against the things Mukherjee talks about because I actually knew about it.This book is very interesting. It starts with a personal story of family history and you follow that throughout it, being able to link more and more of what you learn about in the pages to the story. Then, it starts with ancient times and conceptions of genetics before genetics was a thing. Pythagoras, Aristotle. Those ancient philosophers. Then, you quickly go through medieval times up to Mendel and Darwin. I loved the way it was told because you tend to lose sight that those guys were alive and talking about genetics at the same time. Mukherjee was perfect with how he went back and forth between talking about them, then tying in other people.After that, you literally go through everything. From Nazi Germany to eugenics in America to anything and everything. I was really impressed by it. It's not only a handy book to read if you're interested in this topic, but it's really important because Mukherjee is right. In a way, eugenics is coming back as a thing. We've gone from biological etiology to things, then to social/environmental etiology as a reaction against the Holocaust, and now we're back to biological etiology. And when I say etiology, I'm meaning from diseases to mental disorders to anything else. (I've mainly had this discussed in psychological terms, so I have to use that as an example.)Psychopathy is a difficult term to understand. At first, it was conceptualized as something biological. Phineas Gage -- the railroad worker who had a steel rod pass through his skull, and he lived -- was called one because he showed all the signs of one. He was the first person to really prove that the brain is in charge of personality and these symptoms can be explained that way. Then, you get to Freud and Skinner and so many other people who talk about environment and society. That's how it was conceptualized from the 1930s on through the 1970s. Psychopathy is caused by society and environment; awful parents, poverty, etc. And now? We're back to psychopathy -- primary psychopathy, not secondary (which I don't really feel like explaining here) -- being biological. Genetic, but also some environment playing effect.You can go through this with so many other disorders. Schizophrenia, depression, anxiety. So, I agree with Mukherjee's argument on that.This is a very interesting book. You may not be interested in genetics, but it's helpful in seeing the patterns of theories to explain different things. "
68,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16616412-nandita-damaraju,5,"His writing has a very discernible style. He opens with a very strong anecdote. The statistician in me would quickly skim through this section without paying much attention, but it’s hard not to let his expressive style draw you into paying more attention to the anecdotal evidence than it requires. I’m going to admit, that his writing leaves a more lasting impression on me than the science he tries to convey. Coming to the science, the book begins with the discovery of the gene, which when stripped of the flowery language is essentially everything taught in the very beginning of a course on genetics. But he very beautifully links all the landmark experiments that were conducted back in the 19th century and describes in detail all the very logical sequence of events that led to many discoveries surrounding the principles of heredity. His description of those experiments obviously lacks scientific rigor but it would have made for a great precursor to my genetics course. The book proceeds chronologically to advance into the developments in the field of genetics and genetic engineering all the way up to the era of the Human Genome Project. The Human Genome project opened up a plethora of investigative directions. As Siddhartha Mukherjee puts it, the field of genetics transformed from “pathology to normalcy” and It no longer made sense to talk about the advancements chronologically. He then goes on talk about various ethical and moral quandaries that surround genetics and genetic-therapeutics that really got me thinking. He ends the book on a very futuristic note.I appreciate his books and articles because they are precursors to get you enthused about the field and read more about it. They are not scientific texts, nor does he claim them to be. He does however do a very decent job of explaining the science in pretty good detail."
69,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3265660-mainon,5,"Everything you could possibly want in a nonfiction book.The topic is timely. Human beings are pushing the envelope of gene manipulation, and breakthroughs are happening regularly. The topic is important. This is more than just a history of the gene -- it tackles some of the major philosophical, theological, even ontological questions, but always grounded in the practicality of science. Once it's become clear that we *can* do something, how do we decide whether we *should*?The author is authoritative. Even if he hadn't already written a book on cancer (The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer), his deep understanding of the medical field generally and of genetic research in particular shines through. The footnotes give helpful additional information but don't intrude on the text. I feel like I learned a LOT I didn't know before, even after a fantastic high school genetics class where the teacher was extremely enthusiastic about the Human Genome Project. Finally, and perhaps most importantly for the non-medical professional: it's enjoyable to read. It's long and dense, but Mukherjee is fundamentally a great story-teller, and in some ways the story of humans discovering what makes them human -- and exploring the possibility of manipulating their humanity -- is the biggest story ever.I received a copy of this ebook from the publisher in exchange for my honest review. Thanks!"

The Gene: An Intimate History by Siddhartha Mukherjeereader: Dennis Boutsikarispublished 2016format: 19:22 digital audiobook acquired: library listend: July 31-Aug 13, Aug 30 - Sep 3rating: 4 stars Mukherjee's history of the gene is, well... there is a lot here. His strengths are his tone and clarity and the personal stories he brings in from his own family. His history of the gene from Mendel through Watson and Crick (and Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins) is interesting, and worth listening to, if a bit standard, I think. From there the book sprawls. There is simply no simple narrative of the ideas and research directions, discoveries and applications of genetics through the last fifty years. The DNA is very simple, if very very long, but getting from there to, say, us, is a complicated path with many unexpected aspects both known and unknown. So, there is also no simple model. In trying to cover this, Mukherjee's book begins to feel less like a narrative and more like a lecture. This is worth the read, but maybe does not the offer reading enjoyment you might expect...if you're interests go that way."
71,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,5,"This book is similar to The Emperor of All Maladies in that it has a basic chronological structure, starting out with the primitive guesses of the ancients, then the attempts of Victorian gentlemen, and eventually getting to the work of modern scientists. It was more readable than his book about cancer because the contemporary science was split into understandable subsections unlike his previous dive into cutting-edge molecular biology that gave me the intellectual bends. He covers epigenetics, gene therapy, and genetic testing, with the best explanation of CRISPR I've read so far. This is comprehensive and long, but Mukherjee's individual stories (including from his own family) keep the details from becoming untethered to real life."
72,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22390233-viju,4,"Some background: I worked on genomic and proteomic signal processing for my PhD. I hated biology after class 10 and it took 6 years for me to get back to biology - molecular biology - where I looked at the ATCG sequence as numbers (and then signals). I spent a good 5.5 year of my life looking at DNA strands, protein structures and the like. This book had a false start by me in 2016-17 when it just came out and I then ended up donatingmy physical copy to someone else. It was this pandemic that drew me back to this book and I don't think the timing could have been better.Siddhartha Mukherjee is a gifted researcher, story-teller and a writer. It impresses me how he wrote the chapter on genes, nucleotides and amino acids so brilliantly. In fact that was the toughest chapter for me to write in my dissertation (since I had no formal biology background after class 10). That chapter just spoke to me on how well one can write on a dry topic.The rest of the book is extremely well researched with multiple peoples' stories (including that of the author's family) and I really loved how it hit home. This book affected me on the Sunday afternoon I was reading it. It is definitely not a Sunday afternoon read, particularly in the lockdown. I do not mean to say it negatively, but such is the impact the chapters have on you. From the ethnic cleansing to the human genome project, there have been multiple mistakes mankind has committed in the name of research. One such mistake is also the reason for the current situation!Highly recommended read, this one is!Short one: An impressive book! I’ll write more on this soon but I so wish I had one chapter of this book when I was wrapping up my dissertation and writing the introduction part. Such a well researched and well written piece of work!!"
73,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75627418-ryan-smith,5,"This was a great read. After an undergraduate degree in Biology, I let the book sit idle on my shelf for nearly 2 years; I figured I already knew the heart of the story and wasn’t excited to read (again) about Mendel pea’s and Darwin’s finches. Delightfully, I was wrong. Mukherjee told many stories that I had never heard, and added interesting detail to the ones I had. The last third of the book was especially refreshing and gave me plenty to think about. I’m excited (and nervous) to watch the content of this book’s sequel play out in the coming decades."
74,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,5,"The universe is chemistry. All that is, is formed due to the electrochemical affinities of atoms. When different atoms join together a molecule is formed. But there is a limit to the complexity of molecules in the inanimate world because large molecules that are more than simple crystals in structure are easily broken by the environment.The most complicated molecule known is the DNA that sits protected within living cells. This molecule exists only because chance encounters, blindly trying this or that molecular form, have built it and it operates only within living things, subject to the survival of the fittest. If there is a designer, it's the Grim Reaper.In the history of the universe, something as far as we know uniquely ours since there is no evidence of any other beings capable of reflection, a good understanding of heredity has only been achieved within the last 150 years, the actual form and operation of DNA only within the last 60 years. At long last after billions of years, something exists in the universe that is capable of understanding, to at least a good degree, the universe. Humans alone can hold that understanding.We stand at a critical moment. Man can now intervene in this heretofore blind process. This is the reason The Gene is a necessary read. What we can do and what we should do are quite different things, but who is to say? Siddhartha Mukherjee wants us to think about what we are doing and he gives us the history of eugenics as a cautionary tale.This book assumes the reader knows absolutely nothing about the gene and only the basics of heredity. The history of the search for the thing within us that passes characteristics from one generation to the next makes up about 2/3's of the book, starting with ancient Greek ideas and moving up through Mendel's work in the 19th century to the latest manipulation of DNA in 2015.Throughout, the author gives us snippets of his personal story as a member of a family subject to mental illness. The connection between genetics and disease is deeply examined and at a level that the layman can follow. Mukherjee reiterates key concepts to refresh the memory in order to gradually build up a picture in the mind of DNA, so very simple in basic structure (made of only four nucleic acids) yet astoundingly complex in the manner that the information it contains is read, reproduced, repaired and modified.Astounding facts come regularly. Did you know there is a kind of worm that has a specific number (957 if I recall) of cells in its body? Every single worm has exactly that number of cells and they all come into position and function as a result of the worm's DNA, right down to the precise timing of cell creation. There are lowly animals with far more genes than we humans. Some insects have more chromosomes (which contain the genes) than we do). A since gene can be expressed over widely separated parts of a chromosome or even over different chromosomes. Amazingly, there is a single gene that determines sex in humans, though it can take very many genes to express other human characteristics. All this falls into place over the course of the book.In the last part of the book, the bold moves and mistakes that have so rapidly brought us to the point of intervention in our inheritance are related. There is excitement as one mystery after another is solved, barriers fall and possibilities open up. At the same time almost everyone involved realizes the risks. The author has a list of precautions to take but I confess I am not optimistic on any limitations being set on technology. Sooner or later all things that are originally impossible become routine. Though Mukherjee doesn't speak of it, I'm all but convinced that we are as helpless to control things as were the ancient molecules. All things will be tried sooner or later. We are on a road that we cannot leave, one with a direction we cannot determine in advance. Our universe has a fate determined by the nature of chemistry which has us inherent in it. Some things work, others don't. We can't know which in advance.What you will discover in The Gene is bound to awe you. Consider that this work of billions of years is present in every cell of your body...all of it yours without asking. All of the past is given to you in the form that has proven itself best able to survive and thrive. Could one ask for anything more?"
75,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2376710-donald,5,"The Gene by Siddhartha MukerjeeThe author of the ""The Emperor of Maladies,"" himself a physician, has written another wonderful book which tells the story of man's discovery and scientific manipulation of the genome, an extremely long double strand of DNA (deoxyribonucleac acid) which is uniquely folded up so as to fit within each and every cell nucleus of living organisms. When unfolded, the DNA molecule is almost two inches long.Prior to Mendel's recognition that various species of pea plant could be hybridized by grafting two plants together, it was noticed by the early Greeks that children often had resemblances to their parents, and thus it was said that family relationships were ""in the blood."" In 1856 when Charles Darwin wrote his seminal work ""On the Origin of Species,"" he knew he had a serious problem with regard to explaining what caused variation between one organisms' phenome and another of the same species as the discovery DNA was still more than 100 years away. It was thought that each of the male cells contained a homunculus, a miniature, fully formed copy of the parent which was deposited into the female of the species through sexual intercourse. Though the female did not have the homunculus in any of her cells, she was the vessel which sustained the fetus during parturition, and she was also the primary nurturer post-partum. However, this rather self-serving idea failed to explain the mother's characteristics which were apparent in her children.Fast forward to 1953 when Watson and Crick discovered the existence of DNA, and over time were able open its digital mystery: four amino acids -(A)denine, (G)uanine, (C)ytosine and (T)hymine are used in various combinations to code the instructions for making the various proteins which comprise any given organism. Later it was discovered that epigentic markings, e.g. methylation, can turn the three letter codons on or off, selecting when and where in the protein synthesis program they should occur. Epigenetic markings derive both from evolution of the genome as well as from environmental changes to the phenone, for instance, grandparents who survived a famine tend to produce grandchildren who tend to be obese: it is not thoroughly understood why this process skips a generation except that the the epigenetic marking may not have been laid down prior to grandparents having had their children.Mukerjee discusses the history of genomic findings in interesting detail up to and including an amazing discovery made within the past five years. It turns out that bacteria have evolved a technique for modifying the genomes of organisms which are pathogenic to them. This process known as CRISPR (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) has been in use since 2007, but in 2012Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier studied a simpler CRISPR system from Streptococcus pyogenes that relies on the protein Cas9. The Cas9 endonuclease is a four-component system that includes two small RNA molecules.[34] In 2012, they re-engineered Cas9 endonuclease into a more manageable two-component system by fusing the two RNA molecules into a ""single-guide RNA"" that, when mixed with Cas9, could find and cut the DNA target specified by the guide RNA. By manipulating the nucleotide sequence of the guide RNA, the artificial Cas9 system could be programmed to target any sequence in DNA for cleavage.[35] This technological advance has fueled efforts to edit genomes with the re-engineered CRISPR-Cas9 system.[36]Since 2012 another protein Cpf1 has been used to refine further the genome editing ability of CRISPR, and promises significant progress in the future.In sum, Mukerjee has written a very informative and entertaining book drawing from disparate histories and fields of study connected with genomic studies, one that I will probably read again."
76,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"A fascinating (and long) biological sciences read, ""The Gene"" by Siddhartha Mukherjee introduces the general reader to the brave new world of genetics. And while it starts slow -- I mean, I've been reading about Darwin and his finches and Gregor Mendel and his peas since middle school -- the book hits its stride when talking about how scientists began picking apart the gene. The hundreds of ingenious experiments that teased out complex heredity. And how scientists uncovered how DNA/ RNA work, by coding proteins. How Watson and Crick deduced the structure (FYI -- it was less methodical, and more a ""throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks"" approach. And then, you are treated to what the new techniques of genetic engineering promise. Mukherjee provides us with whole chapters describing both the techniques, as well as current and potential ways the techniques can be used. And most importantly, Mukherjee lays out the ethical considerations that will confront us as genetic technology moves forward. For instance, we can detect Downs Syndrome. And there is little doubt that children with Downs Syndrome live challenging lives. And yet, they are sweet tempered. Should we be notifying parents of the syndrome so they can abort? Or develop new technology that will increase their mental capacity while keeping their nature's sweet. Or, would the extra smarts wipe-out that sweetness? He hints at the fact that we may be throwing out baby along with bathwater. Which reminds me a lot of HG Wells' ""The Time Machine."" Where the genetically engineered ""upper crust"" turned out empty, useless and unable to defend themselves. While the more vital workers proved the real masters of the world. If creepy, violent and cannibalistic. Mukherjee also delivers cautionary tales of how oversimplified ""genetics"" helped create the ever-popular eugenics movement. That gained traction in America, where poor whites and minorities were often forcibly sterilized. And led to the atrocities under Hitler. And takes Charles Murray's pseudoscientific, Right-wing white supremacist polemic disguised as research, ""The Bell Curve,"" to a well-deserved toolshed, delivering it a well-deserved drubbing.Over all, a great book for any fan of informative, well-researched and well-written popular science. Written with a human touch and intellectual grace. Four stars. "
77,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/834122-vegantrav,3,"Mukherjee's first book, The Emperor of All Maladies, a history and detailed explication of cancer and its nature, is one of the best works of nonfiction I have read in the last 20 years. The Gene is good, and in places sparkles, but it is not on the same level as its elder sibling.I found much of The Gene to be a slog: there was a lot of history that was old news to me and would be to anyone familiar with the last 200 to 250 years of the history of the biological sciences. The historical sections on Darwin and his predecessors and contemporaries and on Mendel were informative but had little in the way of any new insights. Much the same can also be said about the sections on the eugenics movement in the US, Britain, and under the Nazis.With the story of DNA's discovery and the unraveling of its structure, Mukherjee tells a story that, while known in its broader details, is less well known in specifics, and here we see some of the flashes that made his first book so good. What I really enjoyed most, though, were the following sections on the relationship of genes and phenotypes, where Mukherjee shows us how various traits and diseases were linked to genetic factors. Mukherjee also spends a good deal of time explaining how genetic engineering works, and sometimes he seems to gloss over important technical questions (e.g. how, exactly, does a geneticist get the modified genes into precisely the right cells and then into the nucleus and then into the right location on the proper chromosome, and what happens to the bad genes when the new genes are introduced into the cell?), and at other times he becomes overly detailed, and the book feels more like a textbook for aspiring geneticists rather than a nonfiction book for the general reader.The Gene provides a thorough, broad-based introduction to genetics and its history. In this, it well serves its goal. It is undoubtedly very educational and informative, but it is, in many places, a bit boring, yet there are enough fascinating case studies and interesting bits of knowledge to make it, on balance, a good read."

79,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,4,"15th book for 2017. What a beautifully sensitively written book, weaving both a moral and scientific history of genetics. It starts with Ancient Greek ideas of inheritance and ends with a discussion of the latest CRISP-R technology that has opened up the possibility of the creating of transhuman embryos, something currently being pursued by a number of labs within China. Interweaved within the book is the personal story of Mukherjee's own family, some of whom have suffered the genetic horrors of mania and schizophrenia.Minor quibbles: It takes about half the book (almost 300 pages) to get to Watson, Crick, Wilkins, and Franklin's discovery of the double helix. Leaving a somewhat cramped feeling about all interesting stuff that has happened since the 1950s. And at times I would have liked more details. How for instance was the three-letter code for DNA deduced? And so many things were left untouched: How has modern genetics been used to rewrite our understanding of the tree of life? What do we know about the functions of Neanderthal (and other archaic hominid species) DNA within our own genomes? What are the implications for personal DNA mapping on the future of medicine etc. etc.All-in-all a wonderful starting point to much further reading."

Siddhartha tells the development of the field of genetics and the intermingling political and scientific events happening like a really good story - from Mendel's lost paper on peas to the invention of the latest sequencing and gene editing techniques, his commentary always keeps the real world impact of those events at the forefront. Though I feel he misses out on a few things (data science in particular, but perhaps excusable given that he is a doctor) and some big developments have taken place after the book was published (portable sequencing, high throughput sequencing as being practised by companies like Grail) it is overall a great primer for the field. Five stars."

You must be equally enamored with these distinct sequence of nucleotides in order to make it through this book. I must admit my attention wavered at times but there were sections I loved. It was fascinating to learn about the early days of gene research, eugenics, and Crick and Watson. I also found all the information on behavioral genetics and it's role in gender identity, gender roles, and sexual orientation engrossing (no surprise there). The discovery of genetic markers, gene therapy ,and the isolation of Hutington's Disease gene were equally engaging. The nitty gritty of genetic code and amino acid translation was less engaging. It still amazes me that DNA provides instructions to make molecules called proteins and in the end a human being is born."

87,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116660907-brian,4,"The Gene: An Intimate History elegantly traces the history of genetics. Inside is the story of the gene.It all started with Mendel's pea plants. Mendel: monk and scientist. In the 1850s, Mendel began experiments with hybrids. His experiments began to unfurl the keys of heredity: dominant trait and recessive trait, parent to offspring. One might imagine a fleeting thought entering Mendel's mind: the idea of a courier of heredity—the gene. He published his results, full of groundbreaking discoveries ready to be found . . . but nobody looked. But Mendel had planted the seed for genetics, and, slowly but surely, it grew. Others discovered his paper and the field began to grow like Mendel's hybrid pea plants: gene, mutation, DNA, A-T and C-G, double-helix, replication, RNA, transcription, translation, protein. Scientists had soon found the essential function of the gene. But how, scientists asked themselves, could an embryo give rise to life. How did gene know when to activate at the right times? The answer to this question lay in the genes itself:Even though every cell contains the same set of genes—an identical genome—the selective activation or repression of particular subsets of genes allows an individual cell to respond to its environments. The genome was an active blueprint—capable of deploying selected parts of its code at different times and in different circumstances. Proteins act as regulatory sensors, or master switches, in this process—turning on and turning off genes, or even combinations of genes, in a coordinate manner . . . Genes specified proteins that switched on genes that specified proteins that switched on genes—and so forth, all the way to the very first embryological cell. It was genes, all the way.Genes were Regulated through proteins. We also learned that DNA Replicates to form new cells. It was now time to begin Recombining. A breakthrough was made when scientists figured a way to ""cut and paste DNA."" With gene cloning, DNA from different organisms could be mixed and matched to create sequences that had never been found before. This would prove to be a crucial step in the merging of medicine and genetics. So how could genetics be used in medicine? Imagine a disease. If the disease is linked to a polymorphism (a variant gene), call it VARIANT, individuals with the disease will have VARIANT. Using VARIANT as a marker, we could compare all the genes near the marker from a individuals with and without the disease. Through a technique pioneered Sanger, the individual base pairs could be read. Mutations in the gene of the individual with the disease could thus be found this way. This gene-mapping technique resulted in the finding of the gene responsible for Huntington's disease. Through genetics, we have found that human genes are strikingly similar between races. Dr. Mukherjee says of race: You can use genome to predict where X or Y came from. But, knowing where A or B came from, you can predict little about the person’s genome. Or: every genome carries a signature of an individual’s ancestry—but an individual’s racial ancestry predicts little about the person’s genome . . . The geneticist goes home happy; the racist returns empty-handed . . . In a society where black men and women experience routine, pervasive, and insidious discrimination, such a propensity could become fully self-reinforcing: black children do worse at tests because they’ve been told that they are worse at tests, which makes them perform badly in tests and furthers the idea that they are less intelligent—ad infinitum. (342–348)Given that genes have the instructions of life, then what different are we from robots? But, on the contrary, identical twins inherit the same genome, but still wind down different paths in life. Epigenetics reveals the true drivers of our fate: Illnesses. Accidents. Traumas. Triggers. A missed train; a lost key; a suspended thought. Fluctuations in molecules that cause fluctuations in genes, resulting in slight alterations in forms.III Rounding a bend in Venice and falling into a canal. Falling in love. Randomness. Chance. Is that an infuriating answer? After decades of musing, have we reached the conclusion that fate is, well . . . fate? (389)But how does our genome ""remember"" our experiences? In other words, why can experiences shape our fate? Once again, we looked to the genes. With proteins, our experiences are etched into are genome, like footnotes on the instruction of life. These ""footnotes"" are modified in response to different stimuli. But how these ""footnotes"" affect our genes has yet to be resolved.A general question held by scientists was how humans could effectively alter our own genes. Then, the 2000s, scientists working on yogurt discovered that certain bacteria had developed a system to maim their long-time enemies (viruses):The bacterial defense system was soon found to involve at least two critical components. The first piece was the “seeker”—an RNA encoded in the bacterial genome that matched and recognized the DNA of the viruses. The principle for the recognition, yet again, was binding: the RNA “seeker” was able to find and recognize the DNA of an invading virus because it was a mirror image of that DNA—the yin to its yang . . . Once the viral DNA had been recognized and matched as foreign (by its reverse-image), a bacterial protein named Cas9 was deployed to deliver the lethal gash to the viral gene. (471) We have now learned to replicate this technique, called CRISPR/Cas9, ourselves. Scientists have since learned to program it for specific purposes.Since Mendel's time, we have learned to program our genes. Through the Human Genome Project, we have also read our genome. The problems that now confront us our not physical, but moral. Now that we as humans know our instructions, the gene has become a powerful yet dangerous tool. One step out of line, and we modern civilization topples.I was entranced by the skill with which Dr. Mukherjee presented scientific concepts. His words convey feelings and ideas with stunning detail. Dr. Mukherjee is truly a brilliant scientist and writer. In this superlative book, Dr. Mukherjee presents the knowledge found in textbooks while articulating a literary masterpiece. "

92,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,4,"""As our island of knowledge grows, so does the shore of our ignorance."" probably best describes this book for me. My understanding of the subject grew manifold after reading this book, but I also realised how little we know!Perhaps the one question we all seek an answer to is ""Why are we here?"". There probably is no universal answer to that question, as science and religion like to approach it in different ways. Personally, I think that purpose is either just a narrative in hindsight, or a story we build to create meaning in our lives. Meanwhile, science has raced ahead of religion in explaining ""how are we here?"" In terms of the two building blocks that have existed before us - atoms and genes - as well as the influence of the one we created - byte. This book is the story of what the author describes as ""one of the most powerful and dangerous ideas in the history of science: the gene, the fundamental unit of heredity, and the basic unit of all biological information."" Indeed, it is the history of this unit - from its presence in a human's mind as an abstract idea to the human attempts to write and rewrite it - that makes up this book.In just under 500 pages, the author takes us through the various experiments and discoveries that have led us to our current understanding of the gene, and how everything from gender and sexuality to other facets of personality and choices are influenced by it. One important aspect of this is how he highlights the individual experiments and the influence of those results. For example, Rosalind Franklin in the context of Maurice Wilkins, Watson and Crick. The heroes and their heroics owe a lot to many whose names might be forgotten later. As he constantly reminds us, it is obviously not only the gene, but the environment, triggers and random chance that make us who we are, and drive our future. (I was fascinated by the idea of the epigenome) Genes are after all recipes, and not really blueprints. That however should not take away from the phenomenal impact they have in our lives. The author quotes a character from GATTACA who says ""my real resume is in my cells"". It is humbling to know that we share a large percentage of genes with the most basic of lifeforms. It is also amusing to note that while long back women were only considered as containers to carry forward the genetic lineage, we now know that a woman is the origin of our mitochondrial lineage - the Mitochondrial Eve! And while that initial understanding might evoke scorn now, it is important to understand that what we know now is a drop compared to what we don't! The last part of the book is the author's perspective on where this might lead us to in the future. It raises important questions on what would be the limits to which we would play with genes and how that would impact not just the individual but society and culture as well. Would we completely understand what he calls our 'fate map'? (In terms of several illnesses, we can actually see parts of it already and have the capability to deal with it safely) What would be our definition of a 'normal' human in the future? Conceptually, the history and the future are both fascinating and kudos to the author for making it engaging enough for a non-scientist such as me. The narrative is largely chronology based, though it does move into themes later in the book. The back and forth in timelines I found to be disconcerting only in the beginning. The style has everything from elegant prose (""men like this seem to turn up every day, appearing out of nowhere off the streets and walking unannounced into houses, stepping casually over thresholds into their past."") to puns! (“He drew the line at mice, but didn’t mind giving peas a chance.”) There is a lot of lucid description of places and people that helps bring out the mood and the setting where key discoveries were made, crucial discussions were initiated, and consensus reached. And then there's the sensitivity - you notice it right at the beginning when the author introduces the personal angle. It is also manifest when he writes the human stories to help us understand the relevance and significance of a scientific experiment or discovery.There has been some criticism in terms of accuracy and perspective, but I think it's inevitable when the scope of the book is so vast. Even if he does lose a bit there, I'd say that it is more than compensated by the accessibility he has brought to the subject with this book. The big canvas allows us to see the future with the context of the past and through the lens of all the forces at work. The book left me awed at what nature has achieved, everything humans achieve will only be a subset of that! "

96,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19692450-niel-patel,5,"As a mechanical engineer, I've never particularly enjoyed reading biology. Genes, however, have somewhat fascinated me, partially due to the implications of what genetic technology and its application would mean for future generations - the ability to abort foetuses with deadly genetic diseases, to choose and enhance favorable features, and to write our own genetic information. So to educate myself, I decided to pick up this book.This book reads almost as a story, covering early ideas of transfer of genetic information like preformationism to the modern day applications of genetic research in detecting genetic diseases and curing them using gene therapy. The book also talks about Nazi's ideas of 'Eugenics', use of flawed science for political purposes, and the Buck vs. Bell case (in the US!) which serve as a warning to future generations. I was pleasantly surprised by Siddhartha Mukherjee's philosophical insights on key moments that shaped the research of genetics. His insights kept the book interesting (although it did get a little heavy and I had to take a break for a few days, sometimes just to digest the beauty and the horrors). Here is a nice passage from the book:""All humans—male or female—must have inherited their mitochondria from their mothers, who inherited their mitochondria from their mothers, and so forth, in an unbroken line of female ancestry stretching indefinitely into the past. (A woman also carries the mitochondrial genomes of all her future descendants in her cells; ironically, if there is such a thing as a “homunculus,” then it is exclusively female in origin—technically, a “femunculus”?) Now imagine an ancient tribe of two hundred women, each of whom bears one child. If the child happens to be a daughter, the woman dutifully passes her mitochondria to the next generation, and, through her daughter’s daughter, to a third generation. But if she has only a son and no daughter, the woman’s mitochondrial lineage wanders into a genetic blind alley and becomes extinct (since sperm do not pass their mitochondria to the embryo, sons cannot pass their mitochondrial genomes to their children). Over the course of the tribe’s evolution, tens of thousands of such mitochondrial lineages will land on lineal dead ends by chance, and be snuffed out. And here is the crux: if the founding population of a species is small enough, and if enough time has passed, the number of surviving maternal lineages will keep shrinking, and shrinking further, until only a few are left. If half of the two hundred women in our tribe have sons, and only sons, then one hundred mitochondrial lineages will dash against the glass pane of male-only heredity and vanish in the next generation. Another half will dead-end into male children in the second generation, and so forth. By the end of several generations, all the descendants of the tribe, male or female, might track their mitochondrial ancestry to just a few women. For modern humans, that number has reached one: each of us can trace our mitochondrial lineage to a single human female who existed in Africa about two hundred thousand years ago. She is the common mother of our species. We do not know what she looked like, although her closest modern-day relatives are women of the San tribe from Botswana or Namibia. I find the idea of such a founding mother endlessly mesmerizing. In human genetics, she is known by a beautiful name—Mitochondrial Eve."""

It's starts with history how gene was discovered and ends with what happening right now in biotechnology. Given the advances in genetic engineering I think a book like this which tires to explain the science in simple terms is necessary for us to make better personal and policy decisions."
98,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40480855-viswajith-venugopal,5,"After reading The Emperor of All Maladies, I knew I was going to blindly buy and read anything Siddhartha Mukherjee wrote, no matter what it was about. And with The Gene, I wasn't disappointed. Although I didn't find it as magical as Emperor (although, admittedly, some of it could be put down to the fact that I had higher expectations), this book is still an incredible achievement -- a non-fiction book about a field of science and its history which reads almost like a thriller.But more than that, I would recommend that anybody read this book just for the content. Genes define us, and understanding them will further your understanding of what it means to be human. And you will appreciate just how incredible and fascinating this genetic code is -- there is this DNA molecule, which is in every one of our cells, which is a long sequence of nucleotide bases (specifically, there are four bases, represented as A, G, T and C). And embedded in this code is the blueprint for all the structures and functions of different parts of our bodies -- heart, brain, hands, fingers, different kinds of cells, digestion, breathing, immunity -- as well as all the regulatory logic that makes sure all these different functions co-ordinate smoothly and enable us to do all the things we do. It really is endlessly fascinating.The book starts off by telling the story of how the science behind the gene and evolution were discovered -- from Mendel's and Darwin's studies in the 19th century, to the discovery of DNA and its structure, to the human genome project. In the process, Mukherjee also talks about many interesting sidestories: the story and arguments of eugenics (which is quite scary!); how gene scientists self-regulated the study of combining bacterial and human genes; and narratives of how different groups of researchers raced towards making various findings related to genetics.In the last part of the book, he talks about the Human Genome project, and the possibilities raised by the fact that we can now sequence anybody's genes, and will soon have the technology to even modify some parts of future children's genes, which raises fascinating possibilities and difficult ethical questions. Is it okay to abort a foetus if it is known that it has a debilitating condition? Is it okay to modify a foetus to, say, make it more intelligent? Is such a thing possible, and is intelligence even well-defined?He also talks about important consequences of some genetic studies for society -- from the causes and inheritability of various diseases, to whether all humans are the same species irrespective of race and whether race is a determiner of intelligence or anything else (spoiler: it isn't; there is more variability of traits like intelligence within a race than between races), and whether gender identity and sexuality are genetically determined.Definitely worth a read, because of the insight it gives you into social and cultural issues, into future medical technologies, and into the deep philosophical questions of what human existence is and what it all means."

Her much advertised inscrutability has once more been found an illusion"".The book is a perfect primer for people wanting to discover more about genetics. It is written to influence the common man, it connects the dots with gripping stories, historical facts, intuitively and fluidly explained scientific concepts, and most importantly, almost always touching upon the moral and human aspects of our ever growing knowledge of genes and the implications."
101,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/319030-dan,2,"Emperor of All Maladies was a deeply felt, emotional book. I don't know anyone who got through it with dry eyes. What an exciting thing, then, that Siddhartha Mukherjee's next book would be about biology and genetics. Most pop science is at best witty and entertaining and enlightening but it's rarely emotional, and the characters in them are usually thinly sketched and not particularly lived in. The first two thirds of the book are a history of genetics and heredity, and it's fine but indistinguishable from, say Life's Greatest Secret or The Epigenetics Revolution, or hell, even parts of Emperor. Mukherjee stretches for the life-and-death gravity he wrote on previously, but doesn't get to it. He doesn't seem to give a shit, really. Or rather, it's like he assumed that merely writing on, say, gene editing or whatever would give it depth, but there's just nothing. It's shockingly by-the-numbers, with more than a few spots of eye-rolling faux-profundity. I'll give an example. Towards the end of the book there's a section describing Yamanaka factors, which are four proteins that can be used to convert a non-stem cell into a stem cell. Stem cells are cells that all fully developed cells derive from, so in theory you could take a bunch of, say, skin cells, convert them to stem cells, and then convert those stem cells into brain cells which could be used to treat a stroke victim. Mukherjee pauses to note that one of those Yamanaka factors, c-Myc, can cause cancer. That something that may be used to treat disease could itself cause disease is, I guess, in and of itself profound. Yins are yanged, circles are completed, hands are waved, etc. Nevermind that the other three Yamanaka factors can also cause cancer. Or basically any protein you pick out of the air. There are a few passages of gripping drama concerning mental illness in the author's family, but aside from the opening chapter and a few interpolations throughout, the promised intimacy never appears. For most of the book the stakes never rise above the kind of struggle --> success storyline you'd get in a C+ biopic. If you're not familiar with the history of 20th century molecular biology, this book is fine. It won't kill you to read it, though it's long enough that you might feel like you're wasting your time. Or you could just read a biology textbook. Not much difference. "

"
103,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4783921-david-msomba,5,"Highly Recommended.........................................A great and very long history science book on studying/researching and understanding of heredity and variation among species.Begun on ancient greek to Charles Darwin,The chanp of the field Gregor Mendel to Rosalind,Crick and Watson up to the Genome project;stem cell research and gene editing.Nothing has been left out on this book from the Mendel discovery,discovery of mutation,the pseudoscience of eugenics to science of understanding gender,race,intelligence,stem cell research and recent gene editing science and many more which i couldnt mention them all here.Ofcourse the book wouldnt have been complected without raised ethical concerns surronding all new technologies and what the future holds,also we as human beings what are we suppose to do with all the new discoveries,for instance if a woman found with BRCA1 gene,which predicts 60 - 80 percentage of getting breast/ovarian cancer,what she should do next;get a mastectomy!!!?what about the 40 - 20 percent,since there is a great number of people who live with the gene and dont get cancer.Also the difference and genetic emancipation(freedom from bounds of hereditary illnesses) and genetic enhancement(freedom from the current boundaries of form and fate ncoded by human genome) can we be able to apply human enhacement on our bodies not hurting ourselves along the way!!?These and many other ethical dilemmas questions have been raised by the author,which has to be looked closley by the bioethics and human race as a whole.One thing,I have to give props to Dr.Mukherjee,its the fact that he manage to combine vast amount of information and keep it very interesting,without making a reader feel like ""im feeding too much information into my brain""Anyway I wish had gave something about GMO but as he said on one of his talks,""GMO requires a whole another book,I shouldnt be the one to write it"" all in all,i never had this much fun,reading a historical science book,since Bill Bryson's a short history of nearly everything."
104,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12383154-arnied,4,This was my 40th book of the year. I finished it yesterday but didn't get to writing the review till today. It is obvious that I have a reading gene. I know many others who have the same gene. Genes have to do with pretty much everything we are and do...even our personalities or lack thereof. He really breaks down the discovery of what makes us starting with Aristotle through Darwin and a host of others who have picked away at the why and how we came to be. There is even one scientist who creates his own primordial soup and fires it up with a lightning bolt. And it kind of worked. If he was around centuries later I wonder what kind of God he would be. I always envision the kid with the magnifying glass burning the ants....creepy kid God. The bigger question is what kind of Gods will we be. We've mapped the genome and there are plenty of ways we can rewrite our code. What if China creates a master race? I know they want to. Some giant beings who can breathe in polution and turn the poisons into nutrients. I think about the scene in Dr. Strangelove where he talks about taking the fittest of them down into the tunnels to survive the nuclear apocalypse. What happens when we are all super fit? Who gets to go down in the tunnels or take off in the ship to colonize Mars? Sure the politicians and lawyers but what about the real people. One of the more fascinating facts about our makeup is the mix of fate and choice that exists in each of us all the way down to a molecular level. There are a few things here and there controlled by single genes that are written in stone but not many. Mostly it is a propensity to do this or that or have this or that happen. If you find out these propensities you can become a previvor - someone who is looking to survive something they don't have and might not even get but is in their genetic code. For me I hope I survive this reading gene I have. That being said I am off to the next book.
105,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,4,"The author's previous book, The Emperor of All Maladies was one of the most fascinating science books I had ever read because of its well written descriptions of cancer -- its history, its science, its biology, its impact on humanity. What really made it a 5-star book for me was the numerous first person accounts of how Dr. Mukherjee learned about and dealt with cancer in his own patients and in his own life experiences. The Gene is equally well written. The subject is at least as fascinating and relevant. However, a couple of issues keep this one from getting a 5-star review from me. First, the science seems so much more complex and incomprehensible. This is probably a mental limitation on my part, but I simply could not enjoy this book as much as I had hoped because the information it provided was so overwhelming. Second, even though the author did a good job of describing interesting and often heart-wrenching genetic maladies in individuals, including some in his own immediate family, in my opinion there should have been more of them (and perhaps a little less of the deep science). This really is a great book though. I easily quadrupled my knowledge of the gene and genetics. And Siddhartha Mukherjee is an awesome writer (as well as being a world renowned oncologist and scientist). I will be happy to ready anything he ever writes in the future."
106,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17495858-missy,3,"Mukherjee is a very knowledgeable and interesting writer, but The Gene lacks a bit of focus. He starts with ancient ideas of reproduction, and how scientists eventually developed experiments that uncovered the workings of the gene. But then he launches into a long segment on the politics of the mid-twentieth century. By the time he again picked up the thread of scientific research, I lost my reading motivation. I was only 1/4 through the book. My recommendation: split this book into two separate books. One with a scientific focus could tell the interesting stories of experiments, experimenters and the fortuitous ways knowledge is built. Another book could focus on the social impact of advances in scientific understanding, or lack thereof. Either one of those books written by Mukherjee would be interesting, but not both in the same book. I was provided an advance copy of this book to review."
107,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5289598-marjolein,4," Read all my reviews on http://urlphantomhive.booklikes.com The Genome is a wonderful thing, and whether you - like me - spend daily time wondering/working on it or not, it is always there and could not be more intimate as it is in all your cells. I previously read, The Emperor al all Maladies, and really liked it, so obviously, I was even more looking forward to reading The Gene. Without going in too much detail (you should read the book yourself), I really liked it and the anecdotal way the story is told made there was still something to learn, despite my biomedical training. I would like to end with an anecdote from myself. I once went to an X-men movie (don't remember exactly which one), and they acknowledged Mukherjee for generating interest into the topic. Thanks to the publisher and Netgalley for providing me with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review!"
108,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51634776-dax,5,Definitely in the top 3 books I have read in the past year. Goes over the history of genetics and all the recent discoveries going all the way up to CRISPR and its recent implications. I took a genetics class in college but I feel knowing the history how the discoveries progressed made it much more interesting. I also loved the discussion of how each discovery effected society and policy.

It is dense with research but sprinkled with stories. As a PhD in Genetics, the research was not new to me, but I enjoyed and appreciated how the Author tied the findings together in time to give a better understanding of how each piece of research fit into the whole. He also discusses eugenics and how this movement impacts research to this day.Although he does a good job of describing the basics, it would help the reader to have a basic understanding of heredity (think high school biology). It might otherwise feel more like homework than enjoyable reading.Full disclosure - I received a copy of the book from the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."

Here too much time was spent on disjointed sketches of scientists who laid the foundation of genetics (in the first half) and the narrative didn't flow very well in the second either. Still there were plenty of interesting anecdotes and it serves the purpose of providing a decent backgrounder on how we came here and where we are today in the field of genetics. "
111,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7669532-vashist,5,"This was an amazing read, the writer has a penchant for explaining complex technical issues using simple analogies. I was initially reluctant to read this book since I don't have much background on biology and the title gave an impression of highly technical work. I am glad I picked it up and was proved wrong. It turns out our misunderstanding of many contemporary social issues is essentially due to misunderstanding of how genes (rather hereditary) works and this book covers many of these aspects from scientific, historic and cultural point of views. Had I read this book before I decided my college major, there's a good chance I'd chosen medicine. "
112,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5581571-melissa,5,"A great book (& excellent narration on audiobook). History, science, discovery, and caution interweave in this tale of The Gene, the basic building block of everything, from guessing its form and function, through scientific breakthroughs and horrendous setbacks, what we know, and what we need to be wary of. The last line of the book may be the best takeaway: ""Its stewardship may be the ultimate test of knowledge and discernment for our species."" It's a must read & must listen, both for the beauty and discovery of what we've learned and the warnings about the missteps we've made in the past and most likely will again in the future....after all we are just human."
113,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"An excellent, captivating work of science for non-science people. The first half in particular delineates the history of thought about genetics from Pythagoras to Paracelsus to Mendel to DNA, clarifying an organising a lot of things you half-knew. The second ~half is a little bit scattered, jumping around in time and topic, a grab-bag of interesting genetics stories: genetic medicine, gene modification, the Asilomar conference (which the author attended as a grad student), and the spectre of CRISPR. Still enjoyable, though, and tied together by Mukherjee's reflections on his own family's dark genes. Recommended."
114,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1650596-joyce,4,"Fascinating social history and scientific look at the gene and gene research. I was occasionally (frequently, perhaps?) drowned by the science but always rescued by Mukherjee's elegant prose. He fills his discussion with anecdotes, sometimes personal sometimes medical case studies, to make his points, and he provides a detailed historical perspective--not always positive as when he recounts Nazi research. Glad to have experienced this, but it's a clear indication why I wasn't a science major. Passionate, informative, provocative, accessible. "
115,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2986995-mary-ronan-drew,5,"'The human genome '... encodes about 20,687 genes in total - only 1,796 more than worms, 12,000 fewer than corn, and 25,000 fewer genes than rice or wheat. The difference between ""human"" and ""breakfast cereal"" is not a matter of gene numbers, but of the sophistication of gene networks. It is not what we have, it is how we use it.' A brilliant book by Siddhartha Mukherjee, the author of Emperor of All Malaadies. "
116,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Absolutely fascinating from beginning to end. Mukherjee has a talent for weaving the often highly technical details of genetic research into a spellbinding narrative. The first part of the book is a history of scientific discoveries; the second discusses ethical issues and the future of genetic manipulation. The history is interspersed with human anecdotes, some very personal. A great primer on the science of genetics and a captivating read to boot. A new favorite!"
117,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762743-kendra,4,"A fascinating read. I learned so many things. I thought the science would go over my head because I am WELL unscientifically minded, but Mukherjee has an amazing capability to not talk down to me, yet in a way I can understand.The past stuff was terrible, the future stuff is potentially even more terrible. We humans are capable of so much good, and so much awful. "
118,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3329239-oksana,5,This book was quite an undertaking for me. Imagine reading a densely packed textbook on the history of genetics. Only unlike most of the textbook The Gene brings you an ultimate enjoyment on every page. Now I am looking forward to reading The Emperor of all Maladies by Siddhartha Mukherjee!
119,1476733503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10749761-cree,5,"I loved it. I don't have a problem recommending this to a person who doesn't have a background in biology because he breaks everything down so nicely. I know this is a history book, but I felt like I was reading a story"
