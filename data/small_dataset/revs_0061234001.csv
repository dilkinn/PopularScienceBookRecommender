0,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934648-jim,1,"This was an interesting book. I say it was interesting because I started liking it (a lot) when I first read it, as time passed I liked it less and less. In that way I call it a candy book, tastes good at first but leaves you worse off for reading it. In my opinion, there are two problems with the book: First, Stephen Dubner comes across as a sycophant. Way to much of the book is spent praising Levitt. Secondly, I was disappointed in the lack of detail provided about Livitt's hypothesis. I wanted more. It was like reading War and Peace and discovering that you read the abridged version and in fact the book wasn't 100 pages long. This disappointment may have come from my engineering background and my strong desire to really understand economics. This book didn't offer any of that, only a titillating glimpse of the economics. In some regards one may think my single start rating is to harsh. As mind candy this book was quite good. I did enjoy reading it at the time. Whats more, it did encourage me to study real economics. I am currently enrolled in a masters program in economics and this book did play a very small roll in that decision process. However, as I learn more about economics I realize how shallow the book in fact was. While this is not the forum for a comprehensive review of the topics presented in the book, or an analysis of how good the economics in Freekanomics are, a review in ""Journal of Economic Literature (Vol XLV, Dec. 2007 pp 973)"" quotes Livitt as saying: ""There is no question I have written some ridiculous papers."" The article then goes on to quote a paper by Noam Scheibler(2007) describing Livitt's comparing some of his papers to the fashion industry. ""Sometimes you write papers and they're less about the actual result, more about your vision of how you think the profession should be. And so I think some of my most ridiculous papers actually fall in the high-fashion category."""
1,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/154731-rachel,2,"Sure, this book was a compelling read that offered us all some great amo for cocktail party conversation. But ultimately I think most of what Leavitt claims is crap. He dodges accoutability with the disclaimer about his book NOT being a scholarly work, but then goes on to drop statistics, theories and expert opinions. These assertions laid, he doesn't provide readers with enough information to critically examine his perspectives.Ultimately I have a problem with the unquestioned, unaccoutable role of the public intellectual. Leavitt dances around with his PhD on his sleeve, but is never subject to peer review or any sort of academic criticism. I think it's irresponsible. "
2,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"I loved this book, though I think the title is a bit misleading. It's not really about economics. In fact, he's showing you what interesting things you can discover when you apply statistical analysis to problems where you wouldn't normally think of using it. I use statistical methods a fair amount in my own work, so I found it particularly interesting. The most startling and thought-provoking example is definitely the unexpected reduction in US urban crime that occurred towards the end of the 20th century. Crime rates had been rising for decades, and people were really worried about what would happen if the trend continued. Then, suddenly, they peaked and started to decline. Why? There were a bunch of theories, all of them superficially plausible.Levitt crunched the numbers, to see what proportion of the variance could be ascribed to the different factors. This is a completely standard technique; it just hadn't been used here before. He came to the conclusion that the single most important factor, by far, was the ready availability of abortion that started to come in after Roe v Wade. Other things, like more resources for policing and tougher sentencing policies, probably helped, but not nearly as much. I didn't at all get the impression that he had been expecting this result from the start, and just wanted to prove his point. He processed the data, and went where the numbers led him. That's how you're supposed to do science.The clincher, at least as far as I was concerned, was the fact that crime statistics peaked at different points in different states, the peaks correlating very well with the dates when each state started making abortion available. States that brought it in early had correspondingly early peaks in their crime rates. It's hard to see how that could happen if Levitt's explanation weren't correct.I am surprised that there hasn't been more discussion of Levitt's findings in the political world. Maybe it's just regarded as too hot to handle. But if Levitt is right, and at the moment I would say it's up to his critics to explain why he isn't, then pro-life campaigners would seem be heading in a very unfortunate direction."

Levitt and Dubner and probably the kind of smart arse nerds who snigger at you because you don't understand linux but sneer at you because you've actually spoken to a woman. This book is much like the Emperor's New Clothes, people are so scared about being left out if they don't like or understand it because some sandal wearing hippy in the Guardian said it's 'This year's Das Capital' or some such bollocks that they feel compelled to join some sort of unspoken club where they all jizz themselves silly over a book that effectively is 300+ pages of pure condescension.Only buy this book if a facist regime ever seizes control of your country and instigates a book burning policy."
4,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33765-justin,4,"I guess some people don't like this book because it's not centered around one theme. Instead, it's more about the seemingly diffuse academic work of one of the authors Steven D. Levitt (the other author is a journalist, Stephen J. Dubner). Levitt is something of an economist but more like a social scientist using the tools of Microeconomics applied to other fields that happen to catch his interest (often having something to do with cheating, corruption, crime, etc.). In the back of the book he mentions how he considers himself a student of Thomas Schelling who is kind of like the father of Game Theory (strategy theory?), except much more of a 'man of ideas' than what one might think of when one thinks about game theory today, which is much more mathematical. Anyway, as for the book itself, I thought it was really great. I really like what Levitt is doing as far as using the tools of Microeconomics in other fields. One of my intellectual heroes (I only have a few) is Kenneth Waltz who did the exact same thing in the field of International Relations in the '70's and wrote the seminal book The Theory of International Politics, which pretty much the single-handedly invented defensive (neo) realism. More generally, I think Economics is probably the most formalized of the social sciences and the one to which others should esteem. A lot of the Political Science field concerned with both voter behavior and how legislatures work is now pretty formalized as well, and, I, for one, think this is a good thing. I don't see how anyone could think it's not (good) unless they a)think the scientific method cannot be used to analyze human behavior; or b)have a visceral aversion to mathematical languages. Actually, I am one of the latter, but I, at least, see the value in having a formalized language to work with.As for the book itself, there's some maybe-controversial things in there like Levitt did some work that showed that the legalization of abortion in the U.S. (Roe v. Wade) was one of the main reasons that crime in the U.S. dropped in the '90's and continues at the same rates today. He stands behind it pretty hardily though and it doesn't seem like he has a moral agenda at all. Some might argue that the best writers are those who are best able to disguise their moral agenda, but considering he writes about all kinds of not-very-serious things like how sumo wrestling in Japan is probably corrupt as far as matches g,o and there's stuff in there about how real estate agents sell their houses for more than they sell their customers' houses (which, may or may not be surprising), I really don't think he has a hidden pro-life agenda. Anyway, there's a bunch of stuff in there (the book), hence the 'freak' in Freakonomics. It's well-written. It's not dry. It's written for a lay audience. I recommend it. Read it and feel the power of social science! ;-)"
5,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-cristina-monica,3,"Interesting enough, but the exponential amount of data made it hard to remember what the initial claims of the economist were instead of reinforcing them, strangely! I did, however, learn from this book. It still amazes me that the way to reduce crime seems to be the legalization of abortion. I did not expect that, but it does make quite a lot of sense and I’m all for women having control over their own bodies and futures, of course. Sidenote: I despised the author’s arbitrary uses of female and male pronouns. Like, a teacher is a SHE and then an architect a HE? That certainly didn’t gain my respect."
6,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34789720-cbzlqxw,1,"Well,this is the most terrible book I have ever seen,it was too terrible to read.It’s so terrible that I just want to burn it as fast as I can,and it cost me 58RMB.That was 58RMB,it was to expensive for me to afford.At first.I thought it was a good book,and I spend all my money on this book.And I was pretty annoyed about this I don’t have any other money for my breakfast,lunch,and even dinner.I haven’t drink juice for the whole year.Reading this is a waste of time,no one want to see this book again.It was just rubbish,and smelly book.It tells my nothing.I even want to sell this to the writer,and ask to return my money and some extra.It cost me too much time,and too much money on it.I prefer to see a movie instead!!!"
7,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1794887-cwn-annwn-13,1,"I assumed Freakonomics would be a book that used statistics to debunk various societal hysterias and fearmongering in a semi-humorous way. I quickly realized what I was in for when early in the book when the authors gave their background as Harvard Jews and profiled a guy that infiltrated the KKK for the ADL. The story sounds at least partially made up. It then jumped into predictable white guilt inducing trash and goes into mental contortions using ""data"" and sociological explanations for black criminality and low IQ scores. The writers of this book are also obsessively pro-Abortion. The only surprise was they used statistics to show you are much more likely to die from an automobile or a swimming pool than a gun. This book would probably appeal to upper middle class liberals who like to consider themselves clever and politically astute from their isolated armchairs. For me Freakonomics was a big load of garbage."
8,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia-the-serendipity-aegis,5,"Extremely enlightening! Worthy of 15 stars out of 5! This is a book about the world and not about any science in particular. It's about learning to question the given and see beyond the obvious. An extremely useful gift in the misguiding modern world.Yeah, populistic much too much but neverthless compulsively readable. A definite revisit and reread.Q:As Levitt sees it, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions. His particular gift is the ability to ask such questions. For instance: If drug dealers make so much money, why do they still live with their mothers? Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What really caused crime rates to plunge during the past decade? Do real-estate agents have their clients’ best interests at heart? Why do black parents give their children names that may hurt their career prospects? Do schoolteachers cheat to meet high-stakes testing standards? Is sumo wrestling corrupt?And how does a homeless man in tattered clothing afford $50 headphones?(c)Q:the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and—if the right questions are asked—is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking.(c)Q:“Experts”—from criminologists to real-estate agents-use their informational advantage to serve their own agenda. However, they can be beat at their own game. And in the face of the Internet, their informational advantage is shrinking every day-as evidenced by, among other things, the falling price of coffins and life-insurance premiums.Knowing what to measure and how to measure it makes a complicated world much less so. If you learn how to look at data in the right way, you can explain riddles that otherwise might have seemed impossible. Because there is nothing like the sheer power of numbers to scrub away layers of confusion and contradiction.So the aim of this book is to explore the hidden side of . . . everything. This may occasionally be a frustrating exercise. It may sometimes feel as if we are peering at the world through a straw or even staring into a funhouse mirror; but the idea is to look at many different scenarios and examine them in a way they have rarely been examined....Steven Levitt may not fully believe in himself, but he does believe in this: teachers and criminals and real-estate agents may lie, and politicians, and even CIA analysts. But numbers don’t.(c)Q:Levitt had an interview for the Society of Fellows, the venerable intellectual clubhouse atHarvard that pays young scholars to do their own work, for three years, with no commitments.Levitt felt he didn’t stand a chance. For starters, he didn’t consider himself an intellectual. He wouldbe interviewed over dinner by the senior fellows, a collection of world-renowned philosophers,scientists, and historians. He worried he wouldn’t have enough conversation to last even the firstcourse.Disquietingly, one of the senior fellows said to Levitt, “I’m having a hard time seeing theunifying theme of your work. Could you explain it?”Levitt was stymied. He had no idea what his unifying theme was, or if he even had one.Amartya Sen, the future Nobel-winning economist, jumped in and neatly summarized what hesaw as Levitt’s theme.Yes, Levitt said eagerly, that’s my theme.Another fellow then offered another theme.You’re right, said Levitt, my theme.And so it went, like dogs tugging at a bone, until the philosopher Robert Nozick interrupted.“How old are you, Steve?” he asked.“Twenty-six.”Nozick turned to the other fellows: “He’s twenty-six years old. Why does he need to have aunifying theme? Maybe he’s going to be one of those people who’s so talented he doesn’t need one.He’ll take a question and he’ll just answer it, and it’ll be fine.”(c)Q:There are three basic flavors of incentive: economic, social, and moral. Very often a single incentive scheme will include all three varieties. Think about the anti-smoking campaign of recent years. The addition of a $3-per-pack “sin tax” is a strong economic incentive against buying cigarettes. The banning of cigarettes in restaurants and bars is a powerful social incentive. And when the U.S. government asserts that terrorists raise money by selling black-market cigarettes, that acts as a rather jarring moral incentive.Some of the most compelling incentives yet invented have been put in place to deter crime. Considering this fact, it might be worthwhile to take a familiar question—why is there so much crime in modern society?—and stand it on its head: why isn’t there a lot more crime? After all, every one of us regularly passes up opportunities to maim, steal, and defraud. The chance of going to jail—thereby losing your job, your house, and your freedom, all of which are essentially economic penalties—is certainly a strong incentive. But when it comes to crime, people also respond to moral incentives (they don’t want to do something they consider wrong) and social incentives (they don’t want to be seen by others as doing something wrong). For certain types of misbehavior, social incentives are terribly powerful. In an echo of Hester Prynne’s scarlet letter, many American cities now fight prostitution with a “shaming” offensive, posting pictures of convicted johns (and prostitutes) on websites or on local-access television. Which is a more horrifying deterrent: a $500 fine for soliciting a prostitute or the thought of your friends and family ogling you on www.HookersAndJohns.com.(с)Q:Some cheating leaves barely a shadow of evidence. In other cases, the evidence is massive.Consider what happened one spring evening at midnight in 1987: seven million American childrensuddenly disappeared. The worst kidnapping wave in history? Hardly. It was the night of April 15,and the Internal Revenue Service had just changed a rule. Instead of merely listing each dependentchild, tax filers were now required to provide a Social Security number for each child. Suddenly,seven million children—children who had existed only as phantom exemptions on the previousyear’s 1040 forms—vanished, representing about one in ten of all dependent children in the UnitedStates(c)Q:Of all the ideas that Kennedy had thought up—and would think up in the future—to fight bigotry, his Superman campaign was easily the cleverest and probably the most productive. It had the precise effect he hoped: turning the Klan’s secrecy against itself, converting precious knowledgeinto ammunition for mockery. Instead of roping in millions of members as it had just a generationearlier, the Klan lost momentum and began to founder. Although the Klan would never quite die,especially down South—David Duke, a smooth-talking Klan leader from Louisiana, mountedlegitimate bids for the U.S. Senate and other offices—it was also never quite the same. In The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America, the historian Wyn Craig Wade calls Stetson Kennedy “the single most important factor in preventing a postwar revival of the Ku Klux Klan in the North.”This did not happen because Kennedy was courageous or resolute or unflappable, even though he was all of these. It happened because Kennedy understood the raw power of information. The Ku Klux Klan was a group whose power—much like that of politicians or real-estate agents or stockbrokers—was derived in large part from the fact that it hoarded information. Once that information falls into the wrong hands (or, depending on your point of view, the right hands), much of the group’s advantage disappears.(с)Q:Information is so powerful that the assumption of information, even if the information does not actually exist, can have a sobering effect.(c)Q:It is common for one party to a transaction to have better information than another party. Inthe parlance of economists, such a case is known as an information asymmetry. We accept as averity of capitalism that someone (usually an expert) knows more than someone else (usually aconsumer). (c)Q:If you were to assume that many experts use their information to your detriment, you’d beright. Experts depend on the fact that you don’t have the information they do. Or that you are sobefuddled by the complexity of their operation that you wouldn’t know what to do with theinformation if you had it. Or that you are so in awe of their expertise that you wouldn’t darechallenge them. If your doctor suggests that you have angioplasty—even though some currentresearch suggests that angioplasty often does little to prevent heart attacks—you aren’t likely tothink that the doctor is using his informational advantage to make a few thousand dollars forhimself or his buddy. But as David Hillis, an interventional cardiologist at the University of TexasSouthwestern Medical Center in Dallas, explained to the New York Times, a doctor may have thesame economic incentives as a car salesman or a funeral director or a mutual fund manager: “Ifyou’re an invasive cardiologist and Joe Smith, the local internist, is sending you patients, and if youtell them they don’t need the procedure, pretty soon Joe Smith doesn’t send patients anymore.”(c)Q:Consider this true story, related by John Donohue, a law professor who in 2001 was teaching at Stanford University: “I was just about to buy a house on the Stanford campus,” he recalls, “and the seller’s agent kept telling me what a good deal I was getting because the market was about to zoom. As soon as I signed the purchase contract, he asked me if I would need an agent to sell my previous Stanford house. I told him that I would probably try to sell without an agent, and he replied, ‘John, that might work under normal conditions, but with the market tanking now, you really need the help of a broker.’”Within five minutes, a zooming market had tanked. Such are the marvels that can be conjured by an agent in search of the next deal.(c)Q:They were also a lot richer, taller, skinnier, and better-looking than average. That, at least, is what they wrote about themselves. More than 4 percent of the online daters claimed to earn more than $200,000 a year, whereas fewer than 1 percent of typical Internet users actually earn that much, suggesting that three of the four big earners were exaggerating. Male and female users typically reported that they are about an inch taller than the national average. As for weight, the men were in line with the national average, but the women typically said they weighed about twenty pounds less than the national average.Most impressively, fully 70 percent of the women claimed “above average” looks, including 24 percent claiming “very good looks.” The online men too were gorgeous: 67 percent called themselves “above average,” including 21 percent with “very good looks.” This leaves only about 30 percent of the users with “average” looks, including a paltry 1 percent with “less than average” looks—which suggests that the typical online dater is either a fabulist, a narcissist, or simply resistant to the meaning of “average.” (Or perhaps they are all just realists: as any real-estate agent knows, the typical house isn’t “charming” or “fantastic,” but unless you say it is, no one will even bother to take a look.) Twenty-eight percent of the women on the site said they were blond, a number far beyond the national average, which indicates a lot of dyeing, or lying, or both. Some users, meanwhile, were bracingly honest. Eight percent of the men—about 1 in every 12 conceded that they were married, with half of these 8 percent reporting that they were “happily married.” But the fact that they were honest doesn’t mean they were rash. Of the 258 “happily married” men in the sample, only 9 chose to post a picture of themselves. The reward of gaining a mistress was evidently outweighed by the risk of having your wife discover your personal ad. (c)Q:But if there is no unifying theme to Freakonomics, there is at least a common thread running through the everyday application of Freakonomics. It has to do with thinking sensibly about how people behave in the real world. All it requires is a novel way of looking, of discerning, of measuring. This isn’t necessarily a difficult task, nor does it require supersophisticated thinking. We have essentially tried to figure out what the typical gang member or sumo wrestler figured out on his own (although we had to do so in reverse).Will the ability to think such thoughts improve your life materially? Probably not. Perhaps you’ll put up a sturdy gate around your swimming pool or push your real-estate agent to work a little harder. But the net effect is likely to be more subtle than that. You might become more skeptical of the conventional wisdom; you may begin looking for hints as to how things aren’t quite what they seem; perhaps you will seek out some trove of data and sift through it, balancing your intelligence and your intuition to arrive at a glimmering new idea. Some of these ideas might make you uncomfortable, even unpopular. To claim that legalized abortion resulted in a massive drop in crime will inevitably lead to explosive moral reactions. (c)"

Pretty interesting how much he dislikes criminologists but then (if I remember correctly), only mentions the same one or two names over and over when giving examples of criminologists that had agendas/tricked the public. Also the fact that the entire book, and the issues, feels very simplified. Actually the author puts it best himself: ""The typical parenting expert, like experts in other fields, is prone to sound exceedingly sure of himself. An expert doesn’t so much argue the various sides of an issue, as plant his flag firmly on one side. That’s because an expert who’s argument reeks of restraint or nuance often doesn’t get much attention. An expert must be bold if he hopes to alchemise (?) his homespun theory into conventional wisdom."" This is often how I perceived the book to be written, very simplified, without enough nuance or room for possible explanations - only one right answer. I didn't like how the book was written, how the topics where dealt with, and had a hard time taking anything seriously after all of the self-admiration and the repeated ""all experts have agendas (except for us)"" talk in every chapter.

15,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,3,"I won't deny that this is a very interesting, compelling and thought-provoking book. Even for someone like me whose general response to economics is *snore*. And it's mainly because Freakonomics is not really about economics, but involves applying statistical analysis to many social issues and questions. Very easy to read. Lots of shocking discoveries that seem weighted in fact - Roe v. Wade is responsible for a huge drop in crime? No wonder some people are pissed off with this book. It's really quite fascinating to look at the power of incentives - economic, social and moral - and examine cause and effect. One of my favourite personal experiences with silly notions of cause and effect is diet soft drinks. I confess to being a bit of a coke zero addict. It's not great for you (the sodium makes you more thirsty, a lot of potassium can lead to palpitations, and a lot of phosphoric acid has been linked to kidney problems) but I've lost count of how many times people have cited statistics showing that diet soda drinkers are more likely to be overweight and diabetic. Of course they are! If you're overweight and diabetic you're more likely to drink the low-calorie, sugar-free alternatives, aren't you? So strange how people assume it is A that causes B and ignore the possibility of it being the opposite.Anyway, my issue with this entertaining book is that I think it may be - to be frank - bullshit. Not all of it, sure. But definitely some of it. The writers state their points very confidently (some might say with a touch too much smarm) but it requires you to take a lot of what they say on faith. And some of the jumps they make between statistics and conclusion don't quite add up for me. I know many others have felt the same.But here was the thing that really got me, the thing that made me smell bullshit: I'm fairly confident something they said is not rooted in any truth. And let's be clear: I am a total noob when it comes to most statistics and economics, so if even I can spot something a bit off, it really makes me question the rest of it. Here it is:
Women's rights advocates, for instance, have hyped the incidence of sexual assault, claiming that one in three American women will in her lifetime be a victim of rape or attempted rape. (The actual figure is more like one in eight - but the advocates know it would take a callous person to publicly dispute their claims.)
This, if true, implies two things. 1) Those advocating women's rights are using false data, therefore undermining their credibility, and 2) They have invented a statistic to intentionally support their cause, knowing no one will dispute it (absolutely bizarre that the author thinks no one is disputing women's rights claims, but okay...)Well, being a feminist and someone who has spent an awful lot of time reading and writing about women's rights organizations and statistics, my eyes narrowed a little. See, in all my research, I've never seen or heard any claim that ""1 in 3 women will be a victim of rape or attempted rape"". I have heard the ""1 in 3"" statistic, but a somewhat different one.So, obviously, I went to look it up. I spent a couple of hours going through Google and every women's rights organization page I could find, trying to uncover a single case where that statistic was used. I found exactly: none. The only other thing I found that mentioned it was a Time article attempting to debunk so-called ""feminist myths"": http://time.com/3222543/5-feminist-my...The statistic the authors appear to have misquoted is that ""1 in 3 women will experience sexual violence, or physical violence by an intimate partner"", which is used often. Sexual violence here is an ambiguous term, leaving room for wider interpretations and probably explaining why, with the addition of domestic violence into the statistic, the number is at ""1 in 3"" instead of ""1 in 8"". Furthermore, not only have the authors misrepresented the statistical claim itself, but they have also suggested that women's rights advocates have pulled the numbers from thin air to make a point - on the contrary, this is a study conducted by the World Health Organization on the ""Global and regional estimates of violence against women"".I like the idea of the book, but this really put me off. Perhaps it was a one-off error that I managed to spot. Perhaps. Either way, I started to be less impressed by the facts and statistics they presented. Still, very enjoyable book for the most part."

17,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675162-j-l-sutton,3,"I enjoyed Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner’s Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything; however, I’m not yet sure if it is simply entertaining or is in any way instructive. Levitt and Dubner explore a diverse range of subjects: from linking Roe v. Wade to violent crime, cheating by teachers and sumo wrestlers to an economic model of drug dealing. I’d like to think that the stories told by the authors and the way they analyze conventional thinking would put me on a path to look past easy answers. Having completed Freakonomics, do I look at the world radically differently than I did before picking up the book? It is Interesting to look at subjects from a different angle. Positing that economics and specifically the field of study now dubbed freakonomics has nothing to do with morality is an intriguing concept as well, but deciding which stories to tell is necessarily selective. Indeed, the focus is interesting. So yes I enjoyed Freakonomics, but feel I should have more to say about it and the authors’ underlying premises than I do. 3.25 stars "
18,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2926986-michael,1,"Verbose, repetitive, contradictory: a book of 200-pages that could be condensed to 3-5 pages. Titles that vary from scintillating to insulting, yet are followed by a chapter that doesn't support the title bar. Anecdotal stories, mistaken for data or hypothesis. Interpretations and hypotheses are drawn from data that could still be interpreted in multiple ways.The book claims that it will link the unexpected, but frankly, links the obvious, with many ""well duh"" moments.Needless generations of lists that help bulk out the book, but provide little further benefit for study.Each chapter begins with unnecessary aggrandisement of the author for the statistician, that jars the flow of the book.Overall, a good demonstration of why ""social sciences"" are in no way close to being ""science"", and instead should be termed social philosophy."
19,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174565-red,1,"This book is little more than Stephen Dubner jerking off Steven Levitt, but that's not why it's a 1-star read. here's why:""Women's rights advocates... have hyped the incidence of sexual assault, claiming that one in three American women will in her lifetime be a victim of rape or attempted rape. (The actual figure is more like one in eight-but the advocates know it would take a callous person to dispute their claim.)""In the Notes for this chapter:""The 2002 statistics from the National Crime Survey, which is designed to elicit honest responses, suggests that the lifetime risk of a woman's being the victim of unwanted sexual activity or attempted unwanted sexual activity is one in eight[.]""Here, in a nutshell, is how the National Crime VICTIMIZATION Survey collects information on rape:Every six months, they ask everyone over 12 in a bunch of houses questions like:""41a.(Other than any incidents already mentioned,) has anyone attacked or threatened you in any of these ways -(e) Any rape, attempted rape or other type of sexual attack -""Followed up later with:""29c.You mentioned rape. Do you mean forced or coerced sexual intercourse?""It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the flaws in the NCVS's methodology here. And to use it to glibly accuse ""women's rights advocates"" of somehow manipulating a kowtowed public is incredibly obnoxious. While I'd guess that Levitt might be right more often than wrong, it's not worth his smug, self-satisfied style. I recommend 'Bad Science' by Ben Goldacre. Similar schtick with substance instead of 'hype'. "

21,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/972904-jake,2,"The Basics:Freakonomics isn’t really about any one thing, which makes it a bit hard to summarize. In essence, it’s economist Steven Levitt playing around with economic principles and basic statistical analysis to examine various cultural trends and phenomena. He tackles a variety of questions, from whether or not sumo wrestlers cheat (they do) to whether or not a child’s name determines his success (it doesn’t). He does this all through examining statistics and data, trying to find facts to back up various assertions rather than relying on conventional wisdom.The Good:As a person who is sick of the inability of most people to have a rational discourse on any even vaguely politicized topic, and a self-proclaimed skeptic, it’s nice to read anyone who endorses looking at hard data to make judgments about possibly controversial issues. Levitt does a nice job of not only proclaiming the advantages of this sort of rational outlook, but also of showing that when you actually examine the data, you sometimes get surprising results. Furthermore, he takes the time to point out that there is a difference between correlation and causation, and that many people mistake one for the other. Again, a nice touch.The actual questions that Levitt asks are all fairly interesting, though some will appeal to certain readers more than others. In addition to cheating sumotori and strange names, Levitt also examines cheating teachers, the economics of crack dealers, and the effect of abortion on crime. Crime, in point of fact, seems to be Levitt’s greatest interest, and I wonder if he might not have been better served by writing an entire book on the relationship between economics and crime, as opposed to trying to touch on a number of different subjects that are all largely unrelated. It might have made for a tighter, more focused book.The writing is solid; simple and easy, but solid. Despite being a book about economics, it’s not a terribly dense read, as witnessed by the fact that I finished it off in about two days. Granted, it was two days of heavy reading, but it was still two days.The Bad:For a book that’s so gung ho about statistics, there aren’t many statistics in here. Levitt claims that the numbers back up his research, but he rarely provides the data itself, which makes it difficult to tell how much he might be manipulating statistics to serve his own ends. It makes the book seem like it’s been dumbed down for the plebian masses, which will be very frustrating to any intelligent reader who wants to look at Levitt’s data themselves. Any reader who doesn’t feel like reading the numbers can do what most of us did in undergrad—skip the numbers sections. It’s just sloppy; I can’t imagine Levitt would do this in a formal economics paper.The book also lacks much in the way of an unifying theme, a problem that is acknowledged within the text itself; that isn’t only sad, it’s sloppy. I doubt that a writer of Dubner’s skill and an economist of Levitt’s apparent genius (more on that below) are totally incapable of thinking of and describing some kind of unifying theme throughout this work. It just smacks of laziness, even more so when there’s a half-hearted “well, I guess you could say it’s this…” sort of thing in the epilogue. Again, I have trouble imagining that Levitt would submit a paper that was this disjointed to a serious economic publication; why should the general public be treated less seriously?The Ugly:The self-aggrandizement. Oh, the self-aggrandizement.Every chapter is preceded by excerpts from an article about Levitt, which all tell us what a brilliant and unconventional economist this man is. In the introduction, we’re told that he really wasn’t that interested in writing a book, unless he got to work with this wonderful journalist who had written an article about him earlier. The cover promises that we will be “dazzled” by a “rogue economist” who explains “the hidden side of everything.”For all of this talk of brilliance and dazzling explanations, the book doesn’t seem that brilliant. It seems like a transcript of some interesting dinner conversation with a smart guy, the sort that makes you go home and think, “hey, this stuff is interesting, I ought to go pick up a book about it.” Of course, the problem here is that you’ve already picked up the book.The fact that Levitt wasn’t that interested in writing a book in the first place is telling; this book feels like something written by a person who needed to get the work done, but really wasn’t engaged in what he was doing. Maybe he should have waited until he was a little more motivated."

This is an awful book, yes I read the whole thing, like bitter medicine to a toddler, and had to see what the fuss was about.This Amazon review nails it.  Here's my review/rant. I'm reading this is 2012, maybe the hype in 2005 was different and people ate this kind of stuff up, even then I don't think we were that gullible at this time. There were good social science/stats books out there. This book pales in comparison to the works of Malcolm Gladwell and others. Levitt is making something out of nothing from strange stories he heard, now he's stitching them together suggesting there's a *GASP* hidden side to everything. Because the KKK spoke in code, real estate listings are supposedly in code, and we're all being duped into spending more for our house because of the secret speak between realtors! How about consumers don't just read a real estate listings but check a place out before making the biggest purchase of their lives, one could argue there's secret speak in every industry. For his final chapter (which is in the middle of the book) Levitt's grand finale, Black people name their children differently to White people! The second half of the book is blog posts from their blog more atrocious reading from these ranting lunatics. There's no appeal to science, Levitt is throwing a lot of his own opinion, and making wild estimations and bringing up even wilder conclusions. It's pretty obvious Levitt is a shrewd businessman, he's not just writing books, but has a well to do following with his blog, radio station and yes even movie! This is ""easy to consume"" garbage for the masses. "

Update: I don't recall the specifics as this was over a year ago that I ""attempted"" to read the book. I don't remember how far I got through it before I stopped reading. I can recall that many of the data and ideas presented about crime statistics and correlations were not accurate. The book put claims on cause and effect in regards to violent crime. I knew that the correlations were no more then the Authors conclusion based on one view of statistical data use. The use of statistics is often (many times not on purpose) biased. I have studied and been in law enforcement since 1990 and have worked serious felony level crimes since 1999. I know from experience and studies that some of the ideas he presented as ""fact"" were not fact but more of an opinion that can be easily concluded when someone does not look at the entire data of violent crimes."

I love that they promote the ideas of critical thinking. I love that they promote the idea of thorough research and questioning the status quo. I love that they promote use of numbers and statistics to explore ideas in an attempt to find the truth. But I wish that they were providing as good of a demonstration of the principles as they claim to be.Their conclusions are then presented as irrefutable, as if they are a magic bullet of the truth, rather than a heartfelt (presumably) effort at finding truth, subject to revision based on refined thought or background research. And then there is the assignment of cause to correlation...... In at least some cases, I am not convinced that it is truth that they are after so much as their own agenda (on oh so many levels).

And I am thus indebted to such an extent, that I can confess to arriving early for any flight departing from an airport with a bookstore for the sole purpose of securing a few additional minutes to browse books. If it were not for the practicalities of travelling, I would probably have bought this book much sooner than I did for I had been securing extra minutes in airport bookstores just to read through another chapter long before I actually bought it.You see, my travels are laden with a heavy debate: shall I pack my extra suitcase with books or groceries? I resolve this by alternating. For one trip to the Outside, a spare duffel bag will be dedicated to books and I will shun all opportunities to visit grocery stores just to preserve that determination. On the next visit, I will carry a spare cooler (rather than duffel bag) and splurge on leg of lamb and cheeses free of artificial coloring. The ultimate effect of this system, however, is a backlog in possessing the books I'd like to read.Finally, however, the fates aligned. I was travelling to Iowa on what I expected to be a gloriously grocery-focused trip. But my cooler broke as I was carrying it to the truck that we would drive to our local airport. There wasn't time to fix it. I was sad, of course, as I had been anticipating all the pork I was going to return with from Iowa. But I consoled myself with all those Iowa cookbooks I could now carry, and resolved not to prolong any lamentations over the cooler. And, oh, did I find myself lugging around a heavy library - such hours did I spend in Powells (there was a 1 week layover in Oregon) and Iowa City's bookstores. The day before we left Iowa, Nate told me about how much he enjoyed this book. His description renewed my interest, and I committed myself to buying a copy before we left. But, alas, we ran out of time. We didn't make it to a bookstore. It was sadder than the last-minute loss of the cooler. So when we arrived in Chicago, and had a few minutes to wait for the connecting flight to Alaska, and our gate was right next to a book kiosk, and I was pretty sure there was just enough room in my carry-on to squeeze in one more book - it was this book that I grabbed. I raced through it. Loving each chapter. I really can't recommend it enough. A fun read, for those who like to be entertained by books. Informative too, for those that like to read for knowledge, thought, and/or discourse. But what elevates it to favorite is that it alters perception and challenges assumptions. For what it's worth, I have no regrets that I carried this book rather than Iowa pork.....and I can think of no finer testament to a good book. Then again, most of my entertainment these days revolves around pickling turnips. So if turnips aren't your thing, feel free to take my recommendation with a grain of salt....but you should still read this book."

DubnerFreakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything is the debut non-fiction book by University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and New York Times journalist Stephen J. Dubner. It was published on April 12, 2005, by William Morrow. The book has been described as melding pop culture with economics. By late 2009, the book had sold over 4 million copies worldwide. The book is a collection of articles written by Levitt, an expert who had gained a reputation for applying economic theory to diverse subjects not usually covered by ""traditional"" economists. In Freakonomics, Levitt and Dubner argue that economics is, at root, the study of incentives. The book's chapters cover:Chapter 1: Discovering cheating as applied to teachers and sumo wrestlers, as well as a typical Washington, D.C.–area bagel business and its customersChapter 2: Information control as applied to the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agentsChapter 3: The economics of drug dealing, including the surprisingly low earnings and abject working conditions of crack cocaine dealersChapter 4: The role legalized abortion has played in reducing crime, contrasted with the policies and downfall of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu (Levitt explored this topic in an earlier paper entitled ""The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime,"" written with John Donohue.)Chapter 5: The negligible effects of good parenting on educationChapter 6: The socioeconomic patterns of naming children (nominative determinism)تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هفتم ماه آگوست سال 2008 میلادیعنوان: اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های پنهان اجتماعی؛ نویسنده: استیون لویت، استپان‌ دابنر؛ مترجم: سعید مشیری؛ تهران: نشر نی‏‫، 1386؛ در 269 ص؛ شابک: 9789643129507؛ چاپ دوم 1392؛ موضوع: اقتصاد از نویسندگان امریکایی - جنبه های روانشناسی - سده 21 معنوان: اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها؛ نویسنده: استیون دی‌. لویت؛ مترجم: امیرحسین توکلی؛ تهران: سبزان‏‫، 1385؛ در 197 ص؛ شابک: 9789648249674؛ عنوان روی جلد: اقتصاد علم انگیزه‌ها: مهارت‌های لازم برای کشف ابعاد پنهان پدیده‌ها؛‬کتاب «فریکونومیکس» در باره ی اقتصاد، از اقتصاددان دانشگاه شیکاگو «استیون لویت» است، که نخستین بار در روز دوازدهم ماه آوریل سال 2005 میلادی منتشر شد. این کتاب تا پایان سال 2009 میلادی، بیش از چهار میلیون نسخه فروش داشته است. کتاب با عنوان «اقتصاد ناهنجاری‌های اجتماعی» توسط نشر نی و با ترجمه ی جناب «سعید مشیری»، و با عنوان: «اقتصاد، علم انگیزه‌ها»؛ با ترجمه ی جناب «امیرحسین توکلی»، منتشر شده است. کتاب چندین فصل دارد: درباره حقه زدن در شغل‌هایی مانند معلمی و کشتی‌گیران سومو؛ شباهت‌های کوکلوس‌کلان‌ و افراد معاملات ملکی؛ سیستم اقتصادی کارتل‌های مواد مخدر؛ تاثیر قانونی‌سازی سقط جنین در کاهش جرایم چندین سال بعد؛ نقش بسیار کم تربیت خوب کودکان توسط والدین در بهتر شدن آموزش و پرورششان؛ و الگوهای نامگذاری کودکان در یک جامعه. ا. شربیانی"
37,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/249257-elise,3,"Levitt makes the lofty claim that economics is not swayed by moral sensibilities - it's a pure numbers game of course! However, not knowing much about him beyond his affiliation with the University of Chicago and what was written in the book, I can surmise that he is conservative, or at least what today would be inappropriately labeled ""moderate."" Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily...or at least I don't view it that way. Does it affect his conclusions? Absolutely. Levitt assumes his assertion that Roe v. Wade is responsible for the drop in crime experienced in the 1990s is the most controversial in the book, but I was not bothered by that conclusion at all. What did raise my ire a bit was his statement that ""Minorities commit more crimes."" Perhaps the pure numbers seem to show so, but upon closer examination and more careful thought, one might conclude that minorities are simply arrested and convicted more often. In many cases, Levitt does delve into the deeper ""behind the scenes"" reasons for why things happen, but in this glaring example, he delves no further than to admit that poverty might have a link to crime commission, and with more minorities in poverty more of them commit crimes. Might it also have a link to crime conviction? The white suburban kid who can afford a long and arduous defense, or whose father knows someone who can get the kid out of a jam, has a much better chance of having his case dismissed than a poor minority kid assigned a public defender (not to say that public defenders don't do good work - in fact many of them are some of the most amazing lawyers out there). Suffice to say the system is stacked against people in poverty and minorities, and Levitt fails to fully acknowledge this in his discussion of what causes and helps prevent crime. I wasn't so much angry as I was disappointed. When one of the brightest minds in our country can't see beyond his own prejudices, where is the hope for the rest of us? Levitt might be a genius, but he is woefully culturally incompetent. "
38,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/847862-paulius,1,"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (2005)There are intriguing elements in this book but when it comes to the larger picture, I find it sorely lacking. Levitt is a young star in the economics profession who enjoys playing games with interesting questions. For example, he assembles data to demonstrate that Roe v. Wade was critical to the drop in the crime rate in the 90s. On p. 125 he notes ""So it wasn't capital punishment that drove crime down, nor was it the booming economy. But higher rates of imprisonment did have a lot to do with it."" Also, on p. 139, he says ""Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness, unwantedness leads to high crime, legalized abortion, therefore, led to less crime."" He also addresses the old nature vs. nurture argument or environment vs. genetics when he says, on pp. 175-176, ""Parents who are well educated, successful, and healthy tend to have children who test well in school, but it doesn't seem to much matter whether a child is trotted off to museums or spanked or sent to Head Start....The reality is that technique looks to be highly overrated....adopted children test relatively poorly in school, any influence the adoptive parents might exert is seemingly outweighed by the force of genetics. But...the parents were not powerless forever. By the time the adopted children bacame adults, they had veered sharply from the destiny that IQ alone might have predicted. Compared to similar children who were not put up for adoption, the adoptees were far more likely to attend college, to have a well-paid job, and to wait until they were out of their teens before getting married."" Despite these insights, I would never want to write a book like this because it doesn't go after the betterment of the human condition in a broad sense in the fashion that Adam Smith tried with Wealth of Nations in 1776. Levitt may be rewarded for his fun puzzles by a best-seller, but does any of this really help society toward healthier, happier families in the future?"
39,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4047121-william-moore,1,"Freakonomics: a rogue economist – Is that all there is?The title of Freakonomics tells us that Steven Levitt is a “rogue economist” exploring the “the hidden side of everything.” I have always been up for a rogue telling me about everything. Even a rogue telling me about anything appeals to me; you know that special insight that only a mischievous, perhaps unprincipled, but somehow likeable person has. From the title I even conjured up some noble rogue elephant tearing apart the civilized world after suffering a loss of habitat. I was up for rogue. Economics, I thought, is a damn good place for a rogue.Levitt is an economics professor at the University of Chicago and a winner of the John Bates Clark Medal. That medal is awarded every two years to the best economist under 40. It is given by the American Economic Association. If you know anything about this Vanderbilt University supported organization, it wouldn’t be for their search for rogues (although they got Milton Friedman right in 1951.)Steven Levitt is best-known for his findings on America’s falling crime-rate during the 1990s. Teenage murder rates were predicted to double. Instead they fell by more than 50% in the space of five years. By 2000 they were at their lowest in 35 years. But why? Well, a lot of people were taking the credit. They were citing economic growth, gun control, policing, imprisonment and even the death penalty as the reason. Levitt proved the cause as Roe vs Wade, the Supreme Court decision that lead to the repeal of abortion laws in the US. His research showed that children born into impoverished environments were more likely to grow up to become criminals. His analysis formed the elegant but uncomfortable syllogism: “Unwantedness leads to high crime; abortion leads to less unwantedness; abortion leads to less crime.”Levitt is saying, according to Dubner, that incentives and motivations are intimately linked in driving human behaviour. No breakthrough – my mum knew that! He does come through with some interesting proofs. His ingenious methods of analysing data reveal sometimes startling conclusions: Chicago public school teachers were helping their students cheat on state exams; Sumo wrestlers were fixing some of their matches; real-estate agents don’t really care about how much they sell your house for – only their own house, and my favourite; dope-dealers rarely make a good living. These results do amuse, surprise and even educate. In all these conclusions there is a haunting. Strangely, within these intriguing anomalies we never find that superbly-skilled rogue practitioner of economics. Instead we are left with a peppy little repertoire of cocktail chatter (beer-chat for me) and little else.Something went wrong in the writing of Freakonomics. In the reading there was the echo of Mark Twain’s comment that golf was “a good walk spoiled.” Yes it is provocative and interesting but it has a problem. If Malcolm Gladwell of Tipping Point fame says “Steven Levitt has the most interesting mind in America . . .” then the problem is uncompromisingly simple – we can’t find Levitt or his mind in this book!Without question we can find – actually, we can’t get away from – the other Stephen, Stephen Dubner. He is Levitt’s coauthor and a contributor to the New York Times. Dubner occasionally genuflects to Levitt’s genius, to his unique insight, and treats us to the odd passing anecdote. For most of the book though he relies on the coattails of Levitt to spin his own story.Dubner just doesn’t get Levitt. A flaw, especially given the hype in the title. He tells us that this very special economist is challenging the established lens through which we see conventional economics. The problem is what is conventional is never argued and the nature of the difference is never revealed. This new lens, we are told, uncovers – no exposes – the patterns of conventional thinking. These come by way of conclusive moments, end points really, that are sometimes remarkably fascinating and clearly capture interest. The question is, are these moments, this shopping-list of results, the only point of the book?Although Steven Levitt is apparently (or even paradoxically) the coauthor, he never actually appears. Not only is he not there but his methodology is never fully presented nor explained. Malcolm Gladwell goes on to say “. . . and reading Freakonomics is like going for a leisurely walk with him on a sunny summer day, as he waves his fingers in the air and turns everything you once thought to be true inside out.” Well the problem is we never get to go on that walk with Steven Levitt. He just might be nearby, but you never know for sure.The book is a first-person telling by Dubner. So it leaves Dubner responsible for that walk. It also leaves him responsible for the non-telling of either process or personality. It is an issue of depth. His preamble, along with the very bad An Explanatory Note are ill-chosen attempts at building an arcane, deified and mystical Steven Levitt. When we get into the book, we think we are going to meet Levitt, this “rogue economist” – but we never do.Dubner continually misses the mark. He let a good book and a great opportunity slip away. This is because he thinks the mark is simply some captivating Levitt conclusion. Even though I found myself relishing some of these points and was more than willing to tell these little tidbits to my friends; they leave forever undone some important thinking.The success of the book is that each story is portable. In their portability there is a weakness. If the point is, each story is an indicator of how we can mis-see the world, then how do we understand mis-seeing or recognise mis-telling? The only way to know would be to understand Levitt, economics, and the processes by which we make conventional and sometimes remarkably wrong conclusions.We never do. Instead, in each story there is an echo of missed opportunity. In each he takes us on some short walk on how we might see the world. The trouble is it is only a short walk with no critical path to understand how we got there or just where we might be going.Dubner tells us early on that when the publisher approached Steven Levitt, Levitt didn’t want to write a book. He finally did agree to write it, but along with Dubner who had done a story about him for the Times. So Dubner and the brilliant Levitt agree to coauthor. Freakonomics is the result of that division of labour. Presumably Levitt’s job was to continue mining of the reality of the “hidden side of everything.” Then what was Stephen Dubner’s job? The answer: The weaver of these disparate stories; the interpreter; the pattern-finder – the writer! Unfortunately a substantive telling never happens. It takes about half the book to slowly realize Dubner doesn’t really get Levitt – and neither do we.In the end this book bizarrely peters off into some kind of parenting manual. This is presumably because Dubner and Levitt are young fathers. Who knows? Dubner then thinks he can put Humpty back together by saying in the Epilogue that there is “no unifying theme” in Freakonomics. Well he got that right! Here he is alluding to a quote by the philosopher Robert Nozick where Nozick said that at 26 Levitt didn’t need a “unifying theme” as an economist. This may be right for a young economist – but it is not necessarily true of a book.Dubner’s patchwork attempt at an ending only exacerbates the reality of missed opportunity. Unfortunately it causes Freakonomics to read a bit like: What my really important really smart friend did on his summer vacation.William Moore"

Something like ""freakostatistics"" would make much more sense as the name of the book.2. in the introduction, the writers warn us that correlation does not imply causality. OK, agreed. But the rest of the book is just that: THEY act as if correlation and causality are the same thing (but they just have more ""fun"" explanation for stuff). What exactly is their proof that they are not ""inventing explanations"" based on correlation, without any real evidence of causation?This book is just a pile of interesting nonsense.EDIT (2016): There is another thing in the authors' arguments that really bother me (besides the ""correlation vs causality"" debate). The authors' approach to economics is that economics is all about how incentives play out. While incentives are no doubt important in human behaviour, this is an extremely shallow way of talking about economics. It is also very consistent with ""unfettered free market"" ideology, which says that the best way to organize society is through profit incentive. This is a dangerous proposition (as we have seen in 2008) and scientifically very doubtful."

The worst part was definitely his sweeping assumptions and conclusions based on his oh-so-reliable data. He thinks he can get away with this because the preface of the book says that he doesn't come to any conclusions--just asking questions, but the writing SUGGESTS conclusions. Just look at the subtitle, ""the Hidden Side of Everything."" He manipulates the reader into thinking there are connections between things by placing the data and a possible explanation on the same page. The problem with those explanations is that there is no scientific approach. Most of his data are purely observational--which is inherently flawed when trying to find cause and effect. I think the book started off wrong when the so-called economist claimed that he didn't like calculus. I'm not sure how you can call yourself an economist without calculus...

Avoid if you possibly can."
45,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17533257-jesse-lehrer,1,"The overarching point of this book is absolutely correct: conventional wisdom and what we perceive to be logical often is not. Our society is wrapped up and smothered in incorrect, dysfunctional assumptions that continue to rule our world and ruin our lives. Bigotry, ignorance, prejudice, fear, and the way people in power use these tools to divide and conquer us is at the root of all of our problems.That being said - everything else in this book is mediocre to bad. The writers make repeated assumptions and statements that are just flat out wrong. They make interesting points, and their comparisons are often thought provoking, but they could have used more of their own medicine.This book is clearly written by economists. Economics is one of the most useless, garbage ideologies ever created by humans. This is, of course, my opinion - but this book, I feel, only serves to prove that opinion. Over and over again the authors try to narrow down causes to one thing or another. They try to find the factor that changed everything. The abortion/crime essay is the clearest - abortion being legal is NOT the only factor that led to crime going down. There are thousands of factors that all contribute to everything that happens. Economists like to boil things down to numbers - instead of looking at people, looking at the complexity of life, they want a simple answer. There are no simple answers.In the book the authors do, occasionally, note that just one thing is not the cause - but they then go back on this again and again by making ridiculous statements, ie:""What sort of woman was most likely to take advantage of Roe v. Wade? Very often she was unmarried or in her teens or poor and sometimes all three."" This sentence gives the image of the typical woman getting an abortion to be a poor teenage girl. They don't say that's the majority, but the implication by choosing this example is that it's the norm. This is absolutely false - Planned Parenthood has plenty of information on this - the most common type of woman who gets an abortion is a woman who has already had a kid(s) and accidentally got pregnant and didn't want another kid. No stereotyping, no images of teenagers making bad choices, etc.Then there's this gem: ""Black Americans were hurt more by crack cocaine than by any other single cause since Jim Crow""I almost stopped reading the book there. That is so wrong, so offensive, so ignorant it is utterly ridiculous. There is NO SINGLE CAUSE of anything! This reductionist economist bullshit is exactly why I hate economics. And if there was a single cause - it wasn't fucking crack. It was racism, or structural racism, or criminalizing of young black people, or economic segregation, or reagonomics, or zoning laws, or re-districting, etc. etc. etc. Crack ruining black communities is, in actuality, a myth. Yes, it's a problem, yes, drug addiction in all forms is terrible, but this myth that crack just fell on black communities like a nuclear bomb leaving nothing behind but violence and death is just plain false. Additionally: the crackdown on drugs came BEFORE crack became an issue - it was a political device pre-dating crack used by Reagan to get votes from ignorant white people who feared black people. There are many books documenting this.In short: there are interesting points in this book, and the overall point is absolutely true. We all fall into believing bullshit that feels like it's obvious but is not. It's up to us individually, and as a society, to always seek the truth. However - the truth is not provided in a 20 page article as a single answer. If only the authors took their own ideas further the book might actually be worth something."
46,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/830884-tony-viardo,1,"I was actually quite enthusiastic about reading this book, after having heard all the hype about it, and about Levitt.After I read it, however, I was greatly disappointed.This book is so overrated it's not just funny, it's baffling. To be honest, I really don't see how this author can be taken seriously. This book should be a farce to anyone who has any degree of skeptical thinking; any degree of respect for logic or empirical thought.Leavitt's conclusions are stretched like a rubber chicken (if not shot like one), his correlations are spurious at best, and his conclusions are no more insightful or incisive as what you would hear at a bull session with your friends, sitting around a bar, after knocking back a half dozen brews.Seriously, i really don't get all the hoopla that this title receives. Leavitt's only real talent seems to be collecting lists from public records sources, and then drawing the most asinine conclusions from them, and then writing them up with an ironic tone, just to sound smart. He seems to have accomplished a feat that would make PT Barnum proud... he thought up the most absurd conclusions, passed them off as expert observations, and then by sheer force of will got people to believe him. (You know the saying, ""the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it."")This tripe reminds of ""Who Moved My Cheese"" which was the biggest sham of a marketing snow job ever perpetrated in print, but was somehow widely hailed by business thinkers as a stroke of genius. This happened mainly because the first batch of readers, who got suckered into seriously reading it, didn't want to admit to everyone else that they got suckered into buying (for about 15 bucks) what amounted to bedtime story that any nanny could have come up with on the spot. So they proceeded to tell everyone they knew that the glorified pamphlet was actually wiser than the combined teachings of Confucious. Freakonomics should spend a whole chapter on that.The only real saving grace I found about the book is that I didn't pay full price for it. Ok, so now you know how I really feel about the book.

Also the idea, that is clearly true, but I'd never thought of it before, that people give their daughters crazier names than their sons.The point of this book is to say that sometimes there are very interesting correlations between things that seem quite disparate. The big one (and I haven't checked, but I assume this one didn't go down terribly well with the religious right in America) was the idea that the drop in violent crime in the US was due to the drop in violent criminals and this was due to there being less people brought up in abject poverty which is due to people being able to have access to abortion and not bringing unwanted children into the world.The comparisons between drug dealers and McDonalds as a corporate structure is now received wisdom - Obama quotes this in his book.Overall this is a great little read and quite fun - but really, I can't think of a single book that was improved by self-congratulation."

Maybe I'm stating it a little strongly, but it has been over two years since I read this book and I'm still angry about one of their premises. The authors proposed that crime rates went down due to the increase in abortions some 15 years earlier. Yes, they claim society is better off without the kids whose parents apparently didn't want them ever having a chance to grow up to be the miscreants they'd be destined to become. That may be a correlation but it is a huge stretch to claim it is a cause and effect. (The decreased crime rate is much better explained by Strauss & Howe in  Generations , by the way.)

If pressed, I'd assign this book to a category I'd call ""Books That People Who Love Malcolm Gladwell Might Also Enjoy."" There's no doubt that Steven D. Levitt is an expert number-cruncher, organizer, and researcher. The conclusions with which he attempts to wow the reader, however, are specious, hyperbolic, and generally lame-o-zoid.*Here's an example: The author explains a situation in which a parent will not permit their young child to go over to a friend's house because the child's friend's parents keep a gun in their home. The [first] parent, however, WILL allow their child to visit a DIFFERENT friend's house whose parents do NOT have a gun, but whose family has a swimming pool. The book then goes on to explain the statistics behind how many children die of gun deaths in this country in a given year versus how many children die in swimming pools in this country each year and determines that the [original] parent is not, according to the data, acting reasonably due to the fact that the likelihood of the child dying in a swimming pool far outweighs the likelihood of the child dying from a gun. Now, there's a reason why, when we talk about gun-safety, we don't talk about swimming pools. It's because swimming pools, if you'd believe it, don't have anything to do with gun safety.** In fact, that entire statistic-set, while an interesting mental exercise, is really no help to the parent. The statistic, were I a parent, that I would be interested in learning is something like: Out of all of the situations involving children dying from gun wounds in this country in a given year, how many of those instances took place when the child was visiting a friend's house? I don't know the answer to that, so, I'll just continue to be pleasantly outraged and move on to my next thought.This book, at its root, is arguing that the things we take for granted, like, belief-wise, might not only not be the case, but the actual truth of the matter(s) might be completely and utterly counter-intuitive to what we feel to be right. I think that's a great message and I wish this was simply a thinking-outside-the-box appreciation book. As a matter of fact, that's exactly what the [nearly two page] epilogue is arguing. With that in mind, I whole-heartedly recommend this book's epilogue. If, however, you're actually looking for a book to explain the hidden, counter-intuitive side to everything, like, for RIZZ, I'd recommend ""Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences"" by John Allen Paulos. BONUS THOUGHT: I should make it clear that I feel that the reason that ""Freakonomics"" is famous and ""Innumeracy"" is not famous, despite the fact that Mr. Paulos uses fewer pages to say more things more clearly, has to do with the fact that there is actual mathematics involved in the latter while the former just requires the reader to want to feel as though they're a smart person. FIN*But, some are for defs totes awes!**I certainly understand the value in thinking abstractly about complicated questions as a way to expand one's mind/cognitive-like-sitch; it's the conclusion that I'm attacking here."
58,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18423957-eleni,2,"For a book that so heavily relies on (mostly) untested assumptions, the repeated, passionate references to the distinction between causality and correlation is impressive if not audacious, to say the least. Suffice to say, 
“""As Levitt sees it, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions"".
 Exactly, Stephen. And that would work extremely well as an inside joke too. Unless you are implying that, in contrast with the usual textbooks, 
Freakonomics
 actually uses science to pose those questions. In which case, and given the absolute lack of evidence, statistics and insight on any methodological tools here, I can’t help wondering: Science? What science? Where? GIVE ME ONE PAGE. The other unfortunate thing here is the 
“Revised and Expanded edition”
 issue, which can generally mean a number of things, but in the case of 
Freakonomics
 in specific, it was, as we know, the result of a huge wave of negative feedback from reviewers due to:a) the fact that the authors massively exaggerated some of their assumptions (because, obviously: when you think you’re using science when you really are not, that’s just bound to happen) and, as if this isn't enough already, the authors’ reliance on some quite noticeable mathematical monstrosities.b) The self-praise:“Hi. I’m Stephen J. Dubner. And I’m co-authoring this book. The other author is Steven D. Levitt and he’s such a genius, radical economist that we’re thinking we’ll stuff 
Freakonomics
 with tons of newspaper clippings on how awesome he is. And that’s gonna be all over the place. Yes! Oh, in case you’re wondering what a too-cool-for-school unconventional genius like Steven D. Levitt is doing writing books instead of just being a weird recluse in permanent scientific euphoria, worry not! He wasn't interested in writing anything, silly ones (as if)! Not unless it was with me, because, in case you haven’t figured it out already, I’m a kickarse, amazing journalist too! So please read us. Please. We’ll make you feel important and scientific”.So apparently they got the message and scrapped most of that out of the book, hence the 
“Revised and Expanded”
 edition.But honestly, when I found all that out, for a moment I thought I needed to double check that I was actually reading the revised thing.I was? Really? REALLY? WHAT WAS THE FIRST VERSION LIKE THEN?And it’s certainly not my fault that Nick Hornby has the answer to nearly everything. I don’t remember which issue of The Believer he wrote that in, but it was along the lines of: 
""Freakonomics

But what was it about?”Exactly, thank you.Two stars, because some of the questions they pose have interesting political and social implications, even though all questions are always posed through prose (with the use of loose logic at best) and absolutely not through the use of science.Oh.

It's been on my to-read list for a long time, and after finally got around to reading it, I came away disappointed. The book is mostly a disjointed series of unexpected pairings phrased as questions, like ""What do sumo wrestlers and real estate agents have in common?"" Most of the questions would never be anything an average person would ask or wonder about. The book was a haphazard compilation of these pairings and odd questions but, to be fair, the authors explicitly state that from the get-go. I found the sections on parenting and naming babies to be the most interesting, with the rest of it being on the dull side. Many of these questions felt artificially contrived to create a ""freaky"" spin on economics but it felt forced. That was my chief issue with the book - it felt like it was trying to hard to be edgy and hip, like a geeky kid who tries to impress by looking cool and winds up falling flat.I found Dan Arielly's book, Predictably Irrational to be much more entertaining with a smoother flow. Arielly's book deals with behavioral economics and delves into the reasons why people make the choices they do, some of which seem rational but aren't and others which seem irrational but aren't. Arielly's book left me with a greater insight into my own choices and the mechanisms at work behind them. Freakonomics left me with a general thought of ""Hmm, seemingly unrelated stuff is actually related and vice versa."" For anyone interested in behavior economics presented in a very accessible and entertaining manner, I would recommend Arielly's book over Freakonomics, hands down."

63,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,3,"I once read somewhere that statistics can be used to prove anything. This book is evidence for the same.Steven D. Levitt, a ""rogue"" economist by his own admission, and who confesses that he is terrible at traditional economics, uses the methods of statistical analysis to look at the unexplored relations between things in society - like the resemblance between Japanese sumo wrestlers and American schoolteachers, why real-estate agents are similar to the Ku Klux Klan, whether parenting has any effect on how a child turns out... etc, etc. By the confession of the authors themselves, the book has no central theme - it just explores the ""hidden side of everything"". Levitt and Dubner say that economics has the tools to provide the right answers, but only a very few people ask the right questions.Some of his findings do have credibility (like that of schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers cheating to advance their careers, though I did not find anything earthshaking in those); some seem to be refreshing new perspectives (the similarity between the drug mafia and corporate houses, for example); some seem trite to the point of silliness (like the Ku Klux Klan and real-estate agents being undone through the availability of information); and some seem to have some substance, but require further study of all parameters (how the station in life and the behaviour of parents affect the children). However, One finding, which is lauded by most reviewers of the book as startling, I found I could take with only a very large lump of salt: that the reduction in crime in the USA in the 1990's is due to the legalisation of abortions in 1973. The authors assume that crime is committed by unwanted children whom their mothers could not get rid of, and once they were allowed to, problem was solved! This, while at the same time arguing gun control is not having much effect either way while increase in police force and punishment is a deterrent, seems to me peddling to the right liberal narrative - at the same time totally ignoring the socioeconomic factors behind crime.As far as I am concerned, any kind of simplistic conclusions drawn from statistical data is suspect. Let me make this clear with an example close to my heart.In India, the state of Kerala in the south (from where I hail) tops in almost all Human Development Indices (HDI) such as health, education etc. However, the state also has the highest morbidity levels. What does this mean? Whether higher levels of general health leads to higher incidence of life-style diseases, or simply that since the healthcare and education are good, more people see doctors? Similarly, Kerala is fourth in India on the basis of reported crime. Does this mean that a higher level of education increases criminal tendencies, or that with a more aware population, more crimes get reported? Heated arguments take place on these questions regularly with no clear conclusions - because there are too many factors to make clear inferences.So does that mean Levitt and Dubner are talking through their hat, and are best ignored? No, in my opinion. This book is worth reading, if only for the unusual perspective. Also, it prompts us to think beyond the glib statistics the ""experts"" spout to intimidate the poor layperson, and see for ourselves."

Almost all of this book is filled with unconnected ideas that have no relationship, and he packages these ideas as if they are somehow related and studying them together makes them more real.It's intellectual slight of hand and nothing more. There is no relationship between Sumo wrestling and test scores. Sorry, it just isn't there. The emperor has no clothes.I found his study of abortion and the drop in crime very compelling and very eye-opening. On the other hand, he absolutely dismisses all other possible causes for the drop in crime, which I found arrogant."

77,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9832722-j,1,"About halfway through Freakonomics, and here's the summary thus far:* We are all liars (excepting the authors, apparently).* We are all cheaters (a few of the examples provided: sumo wrestlers; teachers; real estate agents; and pretty much everyone who owns, operates, or works in for-profit business).* We are all bigots (as demonstrated by intensive game show analysis).In fact, most every person is simply horrible. Except for crack dealers. Those guys are just misunderstood by the society that handed them a raw deal from birth.For the uninitiated, this New York Times bestseller (more than three million copies sold) details a lone, prodigious economist's meticulous examinations of some of society's “freaky” questions—debunking conventional wisdom using hard data gathered through deep and unconventional mining, or so the claim goes.Sadly, the book completely ignores its own correlation/causation warning and goes straight for the x-proves-y jugular—not infrequently, but with numerous instances per chapter, if not per page. Here's a simple (and comparatively less offensive) example from today's reading, included in an analysis of online dating:28% of the women on the site said they were blonde, a number far beyond the national average, which indicates a lot of dying, or lying, or both.The assumptions behind such a statement are noteworthy. Must this conclusion follow from the data? No. The authors assume that those who use online dating sites mirror the population at large. What data do they offer to prove this is the case? None. So, how about some alternative hypotheses:* Older adults are greatly underrepresented on the Internet, compared to other age groups. Even considering those who do get online, how many 70-year-old women are posting profiles on match.com? Eliminating most of the grey-haired, white haired, salt-and-pepper haired, and bald women might alter the percentages, no?* Minority ethnicities are likewise underrepresented online. Many minorities who populate the United States (e.g., blacks, Hispanics, Middle Easterners, Asians) are genetically predisposed to having dark hair. How might this fact alter the odds?* For the sake of argument, let's assume blondness to be a characteristic that increases a woman's comparative physical attractiveness. Might it be reasonable that many such attractive women have become distressed by the type of man who hits on them in, say, a club? It's certainly quite possible that such men, who are likely searching for yet another sexual partner and nothing more, would be keenly interested in physical attractiveness. We could reasonably infer that most of the interactions such women have with men are primarily sexual in nature and, depending on her ultimate aims, much less desirable. How about those attractive women who claim they never get dates, because men are too intimidated to ask them out? What are the prospects of a successful long-term relationship for these women? A dating site sounds like a reasonable alternative to me.* Along those same lines, research has found that attractiveness positively correlates with income (i.e., attractive people tend to make more money). Aren't those with money more likely to (a) own a computer, (b) have the disposable income needed to purchase monthly Internet access and subscriptions to such dating sites, and/or (c) be busy enough with work as to make dating a more complicated enterprise—one demographic explicitly targeted by such web sites?* And my favorite, from a philosophical standpoint: what, precisely, defines blondness? One might say that blondness is defined by the having of blonde hair. By this criteria, does it matter if such hair color is natural or achieved by alternate methods (i.e., dying)? Might it not be that 28% of women actually are blonde, if we throw all those who dye their hair into a group with the natural blondes? After all, is the online dating web site's prompt ""hair color"" or ""natural hair color?""And these are just top-of-the-head scenarios offered by a regular guy with very little research background or statistical training. They all seem like reasonable questions to me—questions that should be explored before making such broad assertions. Does our virtuosic economist take every variable into consideration before drawing his conclusions? Because the book provides no clear reason to believe so, I must assume an answer in the negative.This is one of the simplest and, to my mind, least controversial claims made in the book thus far. The other conclusions drawn are more offensive, particularly when one considers the disturbing lack of evidence provided as support. I'll let you know how things turn out. I'm not expecting a sudden mea culpa."

79,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20426-jen,2,"I feel like Levitt is maybe playing a joke on us. That we, in reading this book and buying into his challenges, are part of an economic experiment illustrating how experts use their position to benefit themselves and themselves only. As prone as I am to envision everything as a conspiracy, I think my support for this one is solid.The economics presented in Freakonomics centers around incentives--human behavior is 100% explained by which of a set of options is most rewarding to that individual. Not an outrageous premise, makes sense. This leads to a discussion on information asymmetry, aka the expert and the mark. Here's where I get skeptical. Citing a mixture of anecdotal and statistical evidence on the behavior of doctors, real estate agents and car mechanics, Levitt argues (without challenge from me) that people with an informational advantage use that advantage strictly in a way that is most beneficial to them. So how then would Levitt justify this book and the ""expert"" position he has assumed? Why should we buy into his scant body of data? Because he get to write a bestselling book, get more air time, speaking engagements, and social clout. He claims to be debunking ""conventional wisdom"" but I think he ends up spinning a whole new yarn.Subjects addressed: crime, abortion, experts, parenting, names, cheating schoolteachers."

I realize that statistics can be made to show anything you want them to, but Levitt spends so much time implying that other people are doing this but he isn't is laughable.I am so glad I got this book from the library and that I didn't buy it, what a waste of money that would have been."

84,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,4,"An engaging read but not necessarily the scintillating, mind-blowing experience it had been hyped as.Levitt and Dubner present their arguments well and their style makes the at-times daunting subject matter easier to approach and thus easier to digest. I don't read much non-fiction (for example) and even less stuff about economics but I found this book quick to get through and I was able to take away their message without having to labor through it.That said, a few points:(1) They make some outrageous claims. To their credit, these claims appear to be backed up by the data. Their rhetoric is frequently hyperbolic though. At times it takes some patience to get the point of a given chapter. The arc tends to go like this: outrageous claim > brief discussion of that claim > discussion of parallel claim > presentation of data > analysis of data > tie them together > see if you can tear down the argument via convention wisdom > oops, conventional wisdom falls under scrutiny of the data. That said, the style makes it easy to break chapters up into small read-it-on-the-can chunks; if you read it that way, prepare to bite your tongue on any given objection until you have finished.(2) In light of #1: Levitt keeps mentioning that he's not much of an economist and even poorer with his math. But there's a lot of math in here. (Presented in a friendly, non-mathematical sort of way, but math nonetheless.) So... Is he just putting us on? Or (as A. would say) is it that ""stats"" aren't ""math""?(3) Also in light of #1: I would like to have seen more of the data. We get a lot of ""xx% decrease"" and ""such-and-such quadrupled"" but the figures themselves are obfuscated. There is an extensive appendix of notes at the end of the book which references specific articles; I'm assuming the ""hard numbers"" are in those articles. But my own background (i.e., bio-psych research papers) biases me to expect a more explicit presentation of those data. So that was disappointing.(4) Levitt & Dubner allege at the beginning of the book that there is no unifying theme. That's more/less crap. The unifying theme seems to be: here are some microeconomics, mostly having to do with crime and/or corruption (see also: crime).(5) The ""Revised & Expanded Edition"" was touted to me as essential because of all the additional articles and re-published blog posts etc. that are now included in this binding. I was a bit under-whelmed by these. They were certainly interesting and they do help illuminate aspects of the text but I didn't necessarily believe that they were essential. (The revisions vis-à-vis Stetson Kennedy's KKK research however: very essential.)"
85,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75637-sean-sullivan,4,"There are at least two ways you can read Freakanomics – as a fun and interesting little book that uses data to tell us little things about ourselves and the world. Or, you can see it as econometrics gone apeshit and finally taking over the world. I kind of view it as both.That said, I really enjoyed reading this. I think Levitt has developed some useful tools that can tell us some interesting stuff about the way little corners of our world are organized. I also think it is a little bit batty to think we can use economic models to prove a causal relationship between abortion laws and crime rates. There might be something there, but in order to come to a conclusion about two subjects so complex, Levitt must have had to control for so many other factors that I doubt his research is all that reliable. In comparison, the section on the economics of the street level drug trade is fascinating and probably close to accurate. The researchers were looking at a relatively small data set, sure, but I think it is still probably tells us at something useful about how that world works.I guess what I find most interesting about this one is the effect it has had on the culture. Economics is so hot right now. Everyone is into it, it is the undergraduate degree on the rise and plenty of those kids decided they liked economics by reading Levitt’s book. I am not sure if this is a good or a bad thing, but it is definitely a trend we can track, at least in part to this book. In the end this is a fast fun and diverting read, but don’t take it too seriously, cause I am pretty sure some of these finding are bunk."

(eg racist politicians are often condemned in public but voted for in the privacy of the voting booth.)And the good news...* You can vastly change your life for the better by getting online and doing your own research. Leaving it all to the experts - be they doctors, funeral directors or life insurance agents - is a mugs game.I found this book hugely provocative, but also fascinating, and it has certainly broadened my outlook by a whole stack.

92,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,3,"Levitt is an original thinker who has an ability to look beneath the obvious, using the tools of his trade, economics. As such he has come up with a diverse range of insights into various social issues, finding connections that are sometimes quite surprising. He shows how many notions taken as common wisdom are anything but. The unexpected results of the legalization of abortion – crime reductionUsing statistics and logic to show how teachers and sumo wrestlers can be shown to cheatWhat is the impact of greater spending in political campaignsThese and other questions, and their examination by Levitt make for an educational, thought-provoking, and eminently entertaining read. P 13Morality, it could be argued, represents the way that people would like the world to work—whereas economics represents how it actually does work. Economics is above all a science of measurement. It compromises an extraordinarily powerful and flexible set of tools that can reliably assess a thicket of information to determine the effect of any one factor, or even the whole effect. That’s what “the economy” is, after all: a thicket of information about jobs and real estate and banking and investment. But the tools of economics can be just as easily applied to subjects that are more—well, more interesting. This book, then, has been written from a very specific worldview, based on a few fundamental ideas:	Incentives are the cornerstone of modern life. And understanding them—or, often, ferreting them out—is the key to solving just about any riddle, from violent crime to sports cheating to online dating. 	The conventional wisdom is often wrong. Crime didn’t keep soaring in the 1990s, money alone doesn’t win elections, and—surprise—drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health. 	Dramatic effects often have distant, even subtle, causes. 	Experts—from criminologists to real-estate agents—use their informational advantage to serve their own agendaP 71Armed with information, experts can exert a gigantic, if unspoken, leverage, fear. Fear that your children will find you dead on the bathroom floor of a heart attack if you do not have angioplasty surgery. Fear that a cheap casket will expose your grandmother to a terrible underground fate. Fear that a $25,000 car will crumple like a toy in an accident, whereas a $50,000 car will wrap your loved ones in a cocoon of impregnable steel. The fear created by commercial experts may not quite rival the fear created by terrorists like the Ku Klux Klan, but the principle is the sameP 155…nature-nurture discrepancies were addressed in a 1998 book by a little-known textbook author named Judith Rich Harris. The Nurture Assumption was in effect an attack on obsessive parenting, a book so provocative that it required two subtitles Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do and Parents Matter Much Less Than You Think and Peers Matter More. Harris argued, albeit gently, that parents are wrong to think that they contribute so mightily to their child’s personality. This belief, she wrote, was a “cultural myth.” Harris argued that the top-down influence of parents is overwhelmed by the grassroots effect of peer pressure, the blunt force applied each day by friends and schoolmates.

But I think we should all mistrust an economist who would hitch his wagon to a scribbler on the make (a move that also advertises young Levitt's thirst for fame and lucre). Other superstar economists -- Galbraith or Friedman, for instance -- had a very obvious ideological agenda, and they stated it openly. A superstar beyond his precursors' wildest nightmares, Levitt claims to have no agenda whatsoever, and remains guided by his Bucky-Fuller-esque curiosity and semi-autistic amorality. Or so it seems. I think he'll out himself as a neoliberal, or at least a creepy libertarian, soon enough (maybe he has already? I don't read his blog). No true economic lefty could keep his rep aloft in the current publishing climate for this long, even if his musings are decorated with soulless Social Statics and Revenge of the Nerds style curiosity. Also, damn near everyone calls him ""That Freakonomics Guy,"" while conjuring a Pavlovian drool-drenched image of that Granny Smith Tangerine on the cover. Independent thinker though he may seem, Levitt is obviously the product of brand management now. Until he de-pimps himself from the corporate world, I'd rather listen to Mr. Clean or Tony the Tiger.

Interesting in parts, obvious in others (as in the comparison of the structure of a drug dealing network to that of McDonalds) , apparently methodologically unsound in places, a curate's egg.The major problem is the difficulty the authors have in escaping the gravity of their own biases which then pull them in certain directions. For example the case of fraud and cheating in Sumo wrestling. Statistically we might be happy with the authors' report that after a certain point in competitions fairly fought bouts were not occurring, but that does not prove their claim that money was changing hands. It seems more than a little cheeky to describe one of the authors as a rogue economist when his rogueishness consists not of wayward or distinctive thinking but mostly in commentating upon the work of other researchers. Derivative, moderately entertaining. Take well salted."

I think he tried to tie that into the economy somewhere, but don't ask me to find where.I kept thinking the book would get better. It didn't. His points became more and more bizarre as I progressed.

If you appreciate counter-intuitive thinking and value approaches to discovering what's ACTUALLY true rather than what ""common sense"" tells us is true, then you will greatly appreciate Steven Levitt's methods. If you're after directly practical knowledge only, you will not value this much. If you are big into strictly traditional thinking, you will HATE this. Be ready to separate what you believe to be moral from what actually happens (they don't always agree, even when I don't like it). So assess yourself and decide accordingly. If you want to know interesting truths and value things that are counter-intuitive even when it flies in the face of a deeply held belief, this is for you. Dr. Levitt's approach is so refreshing; ignoring what seems to be true and always wondering what actually is true, then leveraging data he finds to discover what it can reveal (not what he wants, not what you or I want, but what actually IS). He's a refreshing oddball that I wish I could know personally so I would gain more of that fresh look."

I know there was more than this, but the one that stood out in my head was the way he treated rape statistics. (Of course, I remember nothing about the way he treated them, only that it felt wrong to me.)*There was something in here about realtors? It made me very suspicious to buy property.

105,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1134669-galen-johnson,2,"This book is readable, and it is thought-provoking. But the scientist and statistician and academic in me was completely horrified-- this is a one-sided discussion of Levitt's ideas, which a brief glance at the internet tells me have in some cases been disputed in-depth in the economic literature. Many of the cases that claimed to be ""simple questions"" with ""simple answers"", if you just defied conventional wisdom, were improper questions from both a scientific and statistical point of view. Take abortion, which the authors claim reduced crime because ""Unwantedness leads to high crime, abortion leads to less unwantedness; abortion leads to less crime."" A vast simplification on many levels, but it completely simplifies a sociological issue-- what is unwantedness? Is abortion the ONLY means of controlling whether a woman has a child or not? Could you or could you not make the same argument about birth control, and if not, why? The explanations of statistics were laughable-- that statistical analysis is more of an art than a science. No, it is a science, just a manipulable one. The intentional manipulation is not artful, it is dishonest. The treatment of this topic seemed like it was screaming for attention, rather than really trying to understand the topic at hand. I recommend reading this with the same skepticism that the authors recommend for conventional wisdom, which is to say, a lot. I hope, for the sake of the field of economics, that Levitt's scientific writing is much more careful and accurate.If you are looking for a very readable book on economics, I highly recommend ""The Undercover Economist"" instead!"
106,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3943482-larryk,1,"The author starts out saying that money in politics does not affect elections and policies enacted by Congress without stating any arguments or evidence. This is so intuitively wrong and against the obvious opinions of everyone from such moneygrubbers as Karl Rove to every rich contributor to Democrat and Republican candidates that it undermines the rest of the book, which is mostly similar unscientific conjecture."
107,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29230982-dani-casey,1,I was really excited to finally get around to reading this book but I found it over-rated and at most points too simplistic in it's ideas.

108,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6904213-shannon,3,"You know, I really enjoy economics and I used to listen to the Freakonomics podcast so I figured I'd enjoy this book more than I did. I think it's lack of a theme (which the authors clearly warn readers about ahead of time) contributed to my overall ""meh"" attitude. Additionally, I found myself yearning for more than just Levitt's observations and findings. For example, simply stating that data shows higher abortion rates yield lower crime rates and then not delving too deeply into the reasons that underlie this phenomena just didn't do it for me. That's an extremely weighty thing to state, regardless of if you have data to back you up or not. I guess I wanted some sociology mixed in with my economics. Alas, Levitt is an economist not a sociologist or political scientist.I also want to add that as someone with an MBA (thus, I took classes on data in grad school and would be fine to never run a regression again despite how interesting it can be) and who works with data at her job, I know firsthand how easy it is to manipulate data. I want to assume that Steven Levitt was completely neutral in his research, but who can really know except for Levitt himself? And, who funded all of his studies? I realize Harvard comped him for some work, but what about his studies on Chicago Public Schools? I find it interesting that a school system would turn over their data to him whenever it was inevitable that he find some questionable (and illegal) things going on. I don't know. Again, I want to assume that he was completely neutral, but spinning data is pretty darn easy. And even assuming he completed his research with no bias, what about the actual data he was working with. Some of the ""perfect parent"" data (I think it was still Chicago Public School data) seemed very subjective. For example, how exactly was ""a lot"" quantified in the the data point regarding ""parents who have a lot of books in their home""*? I have ~200-300 books and don't really consider that ""a lot."" You might disagree which is my entire point. Won't different people quantify and thus answer that question differently? Ok, I'm going too deep into this. Basically, I know first hand that you can tell whatever story you want to with data, so I wonder what approach Levitt took in order to remain unprejudiced and unbiased.And finally, I imagine I wasn't the only one holding their breath while reading over the low income baby names. Not that it means anything, but it was still a bit jarring to hear how a person's name reflects their parents' income. Some of the names were very obviously high or low income names, but it was interesting to hear how many common names have moved back and forth on the different lists over time. That portion of the book was undoubtedly the most interesting, and seemingly the most objective--both from sociological and data standpoints.*might not be the exact wording used, but I listened to the book and thus can't reference the print."
109,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,4,"Is legalizing abortion responsible for the drop in crime rates? First of all this book is not really about economics but turning controversial concepts around and looking at them from a different point of view. Thereby the title is misleading and really doesn’t represent the contentI absolutely liked the concept and the very engaging and compelling writing style of this book, which reminded me enormously of Malcom Gladwell. It‘s written by Levitt who is professor for economics at the university of Chicago and offers you to look at widely spread political perceptions differently.This book caused an extreme amount of noise and criticism, mostly for claiming that the legalization of abortion caused the 1990s crime drop. Also you learn about how teachers falsify their students test scores to benefit themselfes, how children superman stories on the radio destroyed the klux klux klan, about the economics of drug dealing, the effect of good parenting on education and how naming your children affects their path.Some criticise Freakonomics arguing that it would contain large, impactful claims without providing enough references or just those who benefit the thesis. But from a different point of view it simply can be seen as offering a thought provoking analysis, which is a road I choose to go. I‘m not a reader who ""believes"" every statistic or hypothesis presented to me without reflection , but always think for myself.I absolutely enjoyed reading it, it’s extremely entertaining while offering a different view on the world. Alone the approach to look at every aspect in life from different perspectives makes this worth reading! I recommend this book to anyone who loves nonfiction.Very provocative and full of great insights, I see why this was a New York Times bestseller."
110,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610433-midnightfaerie,3,"Freakonomics by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner didn't impress me as much as I thought it would. A book about economics and finding correlations in things you wouldn't necessarily surmise, Levitt and Dubner seem to be really arguing that the defining indicator behind these studies is incentive. Perhaps it's my background in Psychology, but a lot of this seemed common sense to me. There were some parts I really enjoyed though. The two chapters I found to be the most interesting out of the whole book, were two towards the end. The chapter on What makes a good parent (i.e. What factors of the parent affect the child's success in life?) and A Roshanda by Any Other Name (i.e. Is black culture a cause of racial inequality or is it a consequence?). The chapter on parenting is interesting, and in some ways, not too surprising. Kids that have a lot of books in their home tend to do better in school. Kids born of a low birth weight tend to not do as well. If we think about it, a parent with lots of books cares about and might be more invested in their child's education than one without books, which of course, would lead to the child having better test scores. If we think about it, the child with the low birth weight is probably one with a teenage mother or one who doesn't take of herself as much, maybe a smoker or drinker, thus leading us to believe that she doesn't care about the child as much either. Some of the other factors they looked at that I found interesting were whether the child was adopted, whether the mother was over 30 when she had the child, whether the child went to HeadStart, whether the child frequently watched television, whether the child was spanked, and if the parents were involved with PTA. Some of the results were surprising. I won't give them all away, but they were always what you might expect. The chapter about racial inequality relating to names that parents give their children I found fascinating. They talked about a father who named one son Loser and one son Winner and how they turned out as adults. They talked about a young black girl named Temptress, how she got to be named, and how she ended up court. Were these children just living out their names or was there a bigger factor at play here? A black Harvard professor named Roland G. Fryer Jr. decided to dedicate his life to learning more about it. He looked at where the parents lived, how they paid for their hospital bills, and what their favorite T.V. shows were compared to white parents. They sent in the same resume to different companies with the only difference being names on the resume. The typical white name was more likely to get a call back for an interview. Why? Was it because the interviewer was racist or was it was because that the socioeconomic status of the person who typically had that kind of name tended to not be as reliable? Fryer looked at how likely black parents were to name their kids another popular black name and how likely they would name them something completely different. He looked at the same for white parents. Even among very popular black names, there was little overlap with white. He found that the parent that was most likely to give a child a distinctive black name was an unmarried, low-income, under-educated teenage mother from a black neighborhood who has a distinctively black name herself. Fryer thought it was her choice in solidifying her position with the community. But think about it, how would a black child get treated if it was named something typical white? And think about how you view names when you first hear them? I have to admit I have preconceived notions about names as well. Before I met a member of my husband's family who had two children, I was told their unusual names were because the mother named them using a combination of the mother's and father's names. I immediately asked where they lived, because I wondered if I was going to a bad neighborhood. And I asked if her husband was black. I was right on both accounts, except that she wasn't married. Both of her children were from two different black fathers who were no longer around, and she lived in government housing. So am I racist? Or am I just basing my assumptions on statistics of past experiences? My husband said it was only because I haven't ever really been around black people. I said that wasn't true, I had dated some. He asked me where I had met them, I said college, and he said, well, those don't count, they're different. But why? Because they were educated? Are educated blacks somehow less black because they're educated? I just met black woman at a book club and we immediately hit it off because we both love books and because I found out she home schools her children, something I am doing as well. We immediately made plans to get the kids together. I don't know how educated she is, but she seems intelligent and she obviously cares about education. But is my experience with blacks biased because all the ones I know are educated? I also noticed something else extremely interesting. In Fryer's study, he did surveys and for his sample found the top 20 ""Whitest"" Girl/Boy Names and the top 20 ""Blackest"" Boy/Girl names. I have three boys, and two of their names where on the ""Whitest"" boy names list, and my third, one with a slightly more unusual name, came very close to being called Colin, which was also on this list. Am I unconsciously trying to say something about my children? Or have I unconsciously realized the success rate correlation in names and was hoping they would be more successful due to their names? I honestly don't know. I just find the whole topic fascinating. But I hope I haven't opened up a can of worms. More than likely if anyone reads this whole review I'll undoubtedly offend someone. I've never been a very politically correct person and I don't mean to offend, I'm just a naturally curious person who wants to understand more about the world. This subject has come up in our home recently as well, because I've been teaching my 5-yr-old about Martin Luther King Day. We've had worksheets and lessons about it, and I've had to find ways to describe slavery that my son would understand. Then I started to wonder. Am I teaching this the correct way? Will his curious mind, perhaps like mine, say something one day to offend? But I have no close black friends to ask. I want to know. What do black people want us to know? Should we always use the term African American? What do they want us to teach our kids about MLK? How do we change the misconceptions in culture? Maybe if I end up becoming good friends with this woman I met, I can ask her. Hopefully she'll be open enough to forgive my ignorance. Well, that was a tangent, but it was started because of this book. I enjoyed this book in parts and in others I was bored. I went for a Bachelor's in Psychology and quit when I only had three classes left to get the degree. I just really didn't enjoy it. I've had to take many classes on the subject of Psychology and statistics. And what people need to remember when reading this book, is that it's just statistics. Levitt and Dubner use the words ""more likely"" and ""less likely"" often for a reason. There is no way to prove direct cause and effect relationship on these topics. When I wrote papers in college for my classes, for every study I found on any topic, inevitably I could find a study proving the opposite or at least something with a different outcome. That being said, that does not mean statistical probability does not have merit. It most certainly does, as long as it's taken with a grain of salt. Knowing that even if A + B might = C, there could possibly be a factor Q, which was not seen or not taken into account. I also noticed some of the references they used for their research was stuff they had written, take that as you will. In the end, it's an entertaining book, and the conclusions Levitt and Dubner draw can account for the popularity of this book. Just the idea that abortion could be linked to the decrease in crime is reason enough to read it. "
111,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,3,"One of the most interesting topics in Freakonomics, is that of bad assumptions in causality. These are made when people consider causality regarding a particular event, and they making assumptions that are affected by factors such as self-interest, prejudice, common sense, etc. The book shows that when the right questions are asked and their answers are searched in a bigger context, some unrelated causes may happen to trigger the original event. An example from the book is how crime rate had fallen in the US during the mid-90’s after years of increasing and contrary to the most predictions. The authors noted that legalizing abortion in 1973, which is totally unrelated to crime, is what mainly led to the fall in crime rate. They argue that most unwanted children who are most likely to have criminal tendencies, were not born anymore because of the said legalization. Most people would assume that crime rate had fallen because of the strong economy or because of new police strategies or whatever. But when you look at the bigger picture, the real chain of events may begin to materialize. The book helps knowing how to differentiate good assumptions from the bad ones. A very helpful tool in this is the study of incentives.People respond to anything according to their incentives. An incentive can range from money to something as vague as inner peace. In the previous example, treasury people will want to believe that a strong economy helped bringing crime rates down. The police chief will most likely convince himself and other people that his new police strategies are the major contributor to the fall. Some may think that God intervened and helped. This may seem a very simple idea, but when it comes to everyday life, everyone’s incentive is not that clear. An example to this is that of real estate agents. The book demonstrates how real-estate agents will in all likelihood convince you to sell your house at a price that they would not approve if they were themselves the owners of your house. Their explanation is quite simple and plausible: When you're the owner of the house, an increase of 10000$ means a mere couple of hundred dollars for the agent, whereas that is not the case when the agent is the owner. I’m not an expert in the field, but I believe that statistical analysis and its implications are not always applicable on the individual level because it cannot make cut and dry conclusions, and we don't like that individually. Maybe it can help us be more observant, but that has significant side effects, with the most probable one being confusion. The authors claim that the book will help people individually, but I think it can be of much help to corporations or groups.Another problem I've realized is the correlation of data, which may lead to contradicting outcomes as happened in this very book. In one study, the authors show that parents with high income are most likely to raise a successful kid. Yet, in another study near the end of the book they show that the parents’ economic status does not affect their child’s success in life at all, since other factors may be at play. I know that in statistics, it is very natural that individual cases may contradict with one another which is something inherent in the nature of statistics, but when entire statistical outcomes contradict, I think the method used can fairly be deemed inefficient. This was much more enjoyable than reliable, except for the last chapter about names which I believe was a total waste of time. I think that rather than providing anything new, the book is a practical training about a much older wisdom, the maxim of Cassius, which was quoted by Cicero: 
Cui bono?

115,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve,4,"At a cocktail party you don’t count on quant types to provide much entertainment. In rare cases a data-plying vector-head like me might talk about how some big swinging member at the trade desk got eviscerated when he messed up his numbers. A story like that can be marginally interesting if told in a gory way. But as relatable tidbits go, that had pretty much been the full gamut. Now, with Freakonomics, we dare to dream of audiences appreciating a new set of number-based anecdotes. They came up with examples where their quantitative forensics would yield something clever or fun, often exposing ironic, counterintuitive, or sordid behavior in the process. I suspect the less these examples had to do with economics, the more interesting they seemed. Be that as it may, it was gratifying to see that the modeling techniques quants rely on (like multivariate regression) have been brought to bear to tell these tales.The Freakonomics formula is a smart one. It starts with sound research on non-traditional topics with results that were vetted in academic journals. That was Levitt’s part. Co-author Dubner is the writer. His job was to provide context, explain how results were uncovered, and sell us on why it’s all so cool. And who wouldn’t be at least mildly intrigued by patterns that show how teachers in Chicago cheated to raise their students’ test scores, and how that links them with Sumo wrestlers in Japan. They cited another example discovered in April of ’87. Evidently that year 7 million children in the US simply disappeared off the face of the earth. This was fully one-tenth of the dependent-age population. They speculated that maybe, just maybe, the new requirement from the IRS in ’87 to include a child’s SSN on the form had something to do with the massive decline in dependents.The authors were careful to explain the methodological difficulties in making data confess. Researchers of this stripe are rarely given the luxury of a lab, where one variable at a time can be changed, holding everything else constant. Ceteris is almost never paribus in social science. I give the authors credit, too, for their interpretation of results. For instance, they explained how the old cliché in real estate that your first offer will be your best may have a lot to do with the incentive structures of the seller’s agent. Say they’re slated to get 3% of the sale price. If it’s a matter of getting 0.03 x $300,000 right now and no longer needing to show the home versus holding out for 0.03 x $310,000 at some unknown point in the future, the usual counsel is to take the first offer. They’re only foregoing a potential $300. The homeowners’ incentive is very different. Say they owe the bank $250,000. For them it’s a matter of netting $50,000 or $60,000. Not surprisingly, the data show that realtors selling their own homes keep them on the market for longer and get a higher percentage of the true value.Some of their findings generated controversy. Read their account on the legalization of abortion and subsequent drop in crime rates 20 or so years later if you want an example. They were careful not to engage in moral calculus, but they had to know they were playing with fire. All in all I thought their examples were interesting, but generally not the most important issues we confront today. Still, they may serve a purpose if you’re looking for cocktail party chitchat of a quantitative bent."
116,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,4,"I think I forgot to mention that I finished Freakonomics by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner. I haven’t started the sequel “Superfreakonomics” yet but the first one, well, it started out really interesting but I kind of lost their logic at the end. The book is a collaboration between a “rogue” economist, Levitt, and a writer, Dubner, about trying to discount “common wisdom” and idées reçus with economic analysis and they reach some interesting and also bizarre conclusions. It starts out interesting about cheating which links teachers – perhaps the most interesting study in the book – and sumo wrestlers. The irony here is that in Japan just this year (several years after the publication of the book), the sumo match-fixing has come public and they have even been reduced to giving tickets away for free because the Japanese were so disillusioned with the revelations of corruption and links with the yakuza. Anyway, there are also interesting articles about drug dealers and real estate agents. They also talked about the Klu Klux Klan and mentioned an interesting person, Stetson Kennedy, who infiltrated that organization way back when. What they forgot to mention about him is that he actually ran for president once on an independent ticket for justice – I know that because Billy Bragg and Wilco covered the Woody Guthrie song about Stetson Kennedy on their Mermaid Avenue album (an absolute must if you don’t have it!). Then you hit the controversial section where they blame the sudden drop of crime in the 90s to abortion. I suppose that they could be right and the hypothesis is certainly interesting but I think they were going more for shock value than literary or economic value in the “1 baby equals 8 abortions” – at least I couldn’t really see where they wanted to go with that. Towards the end also, I felt that it starts to wander a bit. I didn’t know what the point they wanted to make actually was in belittling the names that african-americans give to their kids and couldn’t really see the link they were trying to make with grades and stuff. While it is a fascinating read – particularly the first three chapters – the end was a bit, well, confusing to be honest. I hope that Superfreakonomics will keep a more even rhythm. OK so enough blather. I think Burn Notice might be the funnier alternative here with perhaps a dose of Episodes or Shameless thrown in. Enjoy your weekend, dear reader"

118,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve,4,"This was a reread in preparation for a professional development workshop being conducted in my office. I don't remember when I first read it, but it had to have been shortly after the book was originally published in 2005/2006. I'm sticking with my original rating of four stars.The book is well-written and has all the data you can imagine to back up the authors' claims. One area it fails at, however, is that the areas they are trying to tie together really have no relationship. I mean, Chicago teachers and sumo wrestlers don't have much in common, and there isn't a strong correlation between the two. Sure, they may cheat, but the ""whys"" are vastly different.The one thing I was interested in finding for my workshop is the analysis of the data. Data can show almost anything if you look at it long enough. My job requires a lot of data analysis and asking questions, lots of questions. In this respect, the chapter about the young researcher living with the drug dealers appealed to me simply because he started asking questions instead of relying on the status quo or even wrong concepts. His research changed the views of a lot of politicians, and how they approached the gang/drug problem around the country.I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in data analysis and asking, ""Why?""."

For the most part they also do not repetitively reiterate their points, though the last chapter on names was a bit long in the tooth (otherwise the book would have scored higher). I'm interested in reading other books by the author duo and hope they continue to keep tackling controversial topics while supporting a new way of looking at old debates. To me, their work is more sensical, intriguing and built upon stronger arguments with less repetition than the more popular author, Malcolm Gladwell. To be fair, I have so far only read one book by each, but it is a clear preference.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: Morality, it could be argued, represents the way that people would like the world to work, wheareas economics represents how it actually does work.First Sentence: Anyone living in the United States in the early 1990s and paying even a whisper of attention to the nightly news or a daily paper could be forgiven for having been scared out of his skin."

122,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,3,"I’ve been hearing about this book since forever. I have mixed feelings.On the one hand- it asks some very interesting questions and draws some very interesting inferences. It makes fascinating and, I think, important connections. The writers are also unpretentious and readable.However.I have some questions.Question #1:  The authors claim that “women’s rights advocates have hyped the incidence of sexual assault, claiming that one in three American women will in their lifetime be a victim of rape or attempted rape. The figure is more like one in eight- but the advocates know it would take a callous person to publicly dispute their claims.” Oh, really? What are you basing this off of? Police reports? Surveys? How do you know? See, I’m a woman. I’ve been sexually assaulted. Out of my, oh, 15 female friends, almost half have been sexually assaulted in some manner so far, and most of those female friends are upper-middle class (lower rates of sexual assault than working class women). If 1 in 3 were true, it would hardly surprise me; I wouldn’t even be surprised by a 1 in 2 estimate. Now. How many of those friends have reported it to the police? None. How many would answer it honestly in an anonymous survey? I don’t know the answer, but I’m quite sure some would not. So you see, I’m a little suspicious at the certainty with which they say “That's definitely wrong, it's 1 in 8.""I can see some wiggle room to say “This 1 in 3 claim has not yet been substantiated, as it is difficult to establish actual records on this sort of information; perhaps we should not be repeating this statistic so zealously.” I don’t see any room to say “that’s wrong, it is 1 in 8, despite what these bleeding heart Bambi-saving women’s advocates would lead you to believe.”Question #2 centers around the authors’ attempt to explain away those studies that show resumes with traditionally “black-sounding” names get significantly fewer interview requests than identical resumes with traditionally “white-sounding” names. They show some data demonstrating that names we think of as “black-sounding” are actually just names given by parents with low education; because black Americans tend to have poorer access to education, there are going to be more black DeShawns than white Deshawns, so we begin to call Deshawn a “black-sounding” name. A man named DeShawn is more likely to come from a lower-income background, therefore, and have less education. The authors say that’s really what makes employers less likely to request an interview from Deshawn than Jonathan. I can for sure get on board with the possibility that someone named Deshawn is more likely to come from low-income/low-education background and is therefore less likely to do well in life for those reasons (of which his name is also a symptom, not a cause).That said. Do I think employers associate DeShawn with a low-income/education background because they believe that’s what it denotes? Or do they think DeShawn sounds black? Ask a random person on a street if they think a DeShawn is more likely to be a high-education black man or a low-education white man. Think they'll say the former?Yeah. I’ll take that bet. That’s why I suspect the disparity in hiring practices with traditionally black or white names is due to race, not income/education. It doesn’t matter why people are more likely to name their child DeShawn, it matters at how the world views people as more likely to name their child DeShawn. I feel like this is a major, major point the authors miss in this section.On the other hand, things I liked: That chapter on names was quite interesting for other reasons. It notes explicitly a trend I had sort of noticed in the back of my mind, just from interacting with the world and lots of people with names: names popular with high-education parents will, 10-20 years or so down the line, be almost exactly the names most popular with low-education parents. The high-education parents start the trendy names, and then low-education parents mimic them eventually (for example, Amber, Heather, Brittany, and Kayla were, in the 80s, very “high-end” names, used by high-education parents; now, they’re used predominantly by low-education parents; in the interim, they were “mainstream” names running somewhere in the middle). It’s also especially interesting to read this book in 2017, a decade + after this book was written. The authors offer predictive lists of 2015’s most popular/mainstream names, based off high-end names of 2005, when the book was published. And damn they were accurate. They gave 24 names each of girls’ and boys’ names that they thought would be on 2015’s most popular list. For girls, for instance: Ava went from #9 to #4. Avery, 67 to 16. Eleanor, 264 to 60. Ella, 23 to 18. Emma, 2 to 1. Fiona 374 to 219. Maeve 694 to 450. Phoebe 425 to 287. Quinn, 683 to 97. You get the point. Also, I found the causal link the author draws between abortion legalization as of Roe v. Wade and the unexpected drop in crime in the 1990s credible and compelling. While it definitely, if viewed normatively, has a bit of a eugenics vibe about it that uneases one, I think that, rather, it’s actually rather affirming, in light of how he puts it at the end of the chapter: What this link really demonstrates is that “when the government gives a woman to make her own decision about abortion, she generally does a good job of figuring out if she is in a position to raise the baby well.” "

The chapter introductions were so far away from the chapter contents it was humorous. I did notice how the authors' went around their elbows to get to their thumbs and tried to show a correlation, but I found sifting through the multitude of off-topic data tiresome.Also, the way they presented their data took forever for them to get to the point. Often, they contradicted or repeated themselves or beat a topic into the dirt until I just moved on. It was like reading a student thesis. Lots of facts and figures, great detail placed on how those facts and figures were gathered (justification), the ENTIRE story of how those facts and figures came about--including the urination ritual, colors of the buildings and other useless information. Egads!I have the hardcover and though it shows 320 pages (through the index) the actual book information stops at page 191. The rest is ""bonus"" material, notes and index. What's inside:- Numerous ways a teacher can cheat on state testing for their students. Mind boggling. - Great detail into the lives of a sumo wrestler. Good grief.- Interesting info on how a Real Estate Agent can dupe a seller. Hmm. - Way too much information about the Klu Klux Klan. Mercy! That could have been summed up so much quicker!- The study of the college kid that practically lived with a gang in Chicago for 6 years in order to do research was interesting, at first, then it dragged out. Was it necessary to report how they urinated on the 6th floor of the building where they hung out? Was it necessary to report the color scheme of the buildings? Ugh.- The chapters on what makes a perfect parent (I and II) were interesting. They dismantled a lot of current speculation as to putting kids into school as early as possible, reading to them as often as possible, etc will make them better students; thus, more productive citizens in society. Moms who have kids after age 30 tend to be better parents, yet if a mom has her first child before age 30, then has another after age 30 it doesn't matter. Found the section on selecting a child's name to be interesting, but conflicting. Lots of lists of ""great names"" (over and over again) followed by the story of Winner and Loser--two brothers. Guess who became successful and who didn't? Winner=criminal; Loser=detective who went by various names including Lou.I became frustrated in this section, because they contradicted themselves (or left loopholes). Disappointing for This Reader.

My mom, instead of buying me Remember Me? or Change of Heart, handed me her copy of Freakonomics: A rough Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner.Freakonomics was a great back-up book. It was witty, insightful, and really made me think. What does the Ku Klux Klan like a group of real-estate agents? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? Where have all the criminals gone? What makes a schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? How perfect Roshanda by any other name smell as sweet? parents?Freakonomics attempts to tell us along with a few other tidbits of information, like: “In the world of online dating, a heedful of blond hair on a woman is worth about the same as having a college degree-and, with a $100 dye job versus a $100,000 tuition bill, an awful lot cheaper.” {pg. 83}{Forget college and law school! All I really need to do is head on down to CVS Pharmacy or Walgreen’s in order to get my MRS degree.} “Chemistry is best left to chemists.” {pg. 109}} “The likelihood of any given person being killed in a terrorist attack are infinitesimally smaller than the likelihood that the same person will clog up his arteries with fatty food and die of heart disease.” {pg. 151} “Obsessive parents know who they are and are generally proud of the fact; non-obsessive parents also know who the obsessive are and tend to snicker at them.” {pg. 153)"

128,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3387843-celine,4,"What makes Freakonomics so enjoyable is its attitude - no question or comparison is too weird or out there. It's the result of what happens when you let someone with an academic background in economics research whatever the hell he wants. And with chapters like, ""Why do drug dealers still live with their mothers?"", you know you won't get any startling insights into the nature of life, but you will learn some fun facts to impress others with at cocktail parties. Ultimately, I disagree with one of the book's core assumptions: that economics teaches us what the world is truly like. As a humanities student, this seems reductionist and an unsatisfying conclusion. Statistics, while an useful (and in this case, surprisingly fun) tool, does not truly explain anything. Still, the authors take you on an entertaining romp through some random issues. Freakonomics, though not universe-shifting or mind-blowing, is well worth your while."

132,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/546603-shannon,0,"Economics is not widely considered to be one of the sexier sciences. The annual Nobel Prize winner in that field never receives as much publicity as his or her compatriots in peace, literature, or physics. But if such slights are based on the notion that economics is dull, or that economists are concerned only with finance itself, Steven D. Levitt will change some minds. In Freakonomics (written with Stephen J. Dubner), Levitt argues that many apparent mysteries of everyday life don't need to be so mysterious: they could be illuminated and made even more fascinating by asking the right questions and drawing connections. For example, Levitt traces the drop in violent crime rates to a drop in violent criminals and, digging further, to the Roe v. Wade decision that preempted the existence of some people who would be born to poverty and hardship. Elsewhere, by analyzing data gathered from inner-city Chicago drug-dealing gangs, Levitt outlines a corporate structure much like McDonald's, where the top bosses make great money while scores of underlings make something below minimum wage. And in a section that may alarm or relieve worried parents, Levitt argues that parenting methods don't really matter much and that a backyard swimming pool is much more dangerous than a gun. These enlightening chapters are separated by effusive passages from Dubner's 2003 profile of Levitt in The New York Times Magazine, which led to the book being written. In a book filled with bold logic, such back-patting veers Freakonomics, however briefly, away from what Levitt actually has to say. Although maybe there's a good economic reason for that too, and we're just not getting it yet. --John Moe (From Amazon) ______________________________Forget your image of an economist as a crusty professor worried about fluctuating interest rates: Levitt focuses his attention on more intimate real-world issues, like whether reading to your baby will make her a better student. Recognition by fellow economists as one of the best young minds in his field led to a profile in the New York Times, written by Dubner, and that original article serves as a broad outline for an expanded look at Levitt's search for the hidden incentives behind all sorts of behavior. There isn't really a grand theory of everything here, except perhaps the suggestion that self-styled experts have a vested interest in promoting conventional wisdom even when it's wrong. Instead, Dubner and Levitt deconstruct everything from the organizational structure of drug-dealing gangs to baby-naming patterns. While some chapters might seem frivolous, others touch on more serious issues, including a detailed look at Levitt's controversial linkage between the legalization of abortion and a reduced crime rate two decades later. Underlying all these research subjects is a belief that complex phenomena can be understood if we find the right perspective. Levitt has a knack for making that principle relevant to our daily lives, which could make this book a hit. Malcolm Gladwell blurbs that Levitt ""has the most interesting mind in America,"" an invitation Gladwell's own substantial fan base will find hard to resist. 50-city radio campaign.(From Publishers Weekly)"
133,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2060997-samantha,2,"Freakonomics is an engaging read and I read it quickly despite the fact that I was annotating it as I read it for my AP English class. Yet I can't say that I liked this book and at times it deeply frustrated me. At best, I found it to be irritating because the whole theme-less work left me wondering, what's the point? At worst, I found that Freakonomics reinforced some negative classist and racist stereotypes. Authors Levitt and Dubner come right out and say that Freakonomics is a book that ""has no 'unifying theme.'"" It was certainly all over the place, exploring questions from How is the Ku Klux Klan Like a Group of Real Estate Agents? to What Makes a Perfect Parent?. This all-over the place style of book is not my cup of tea but even I will admit that the book had a point if not a unifying theme. Levitt and Dubner encourage the reader to challenge conventional wisdom in order to arrive at new ideas. What troubled me about this book was that for a book with no set theme and with supposedly no agenda, it spent a lot of time supporting negative stereotypes with its statistics and algorithms. Several chapters of this book dwell on how poverty stricken and uneducated most black people in America are. It also asserted that many black people are drug dealers and just have less of a chance of being successful in life. While some of this may be true, why confirm these negative stereotypes about African Americans with speculative economic findings? Maybe it's just me, but as a person of color I'm getting tired of the negative light shed on black people. I would like for authors to write something uplifting about black people for a change or share some promising new statistic about their social improvement. Writing about the downtrodden black American is only reinforcing the view that black people are by default inferior and less successful. It's starting to really tick me off. Also, Levitt and Dubner support that nature has far more to do with a person's development than nurture and uphold that upper-class people's children will be more successful than their less advantaged counterparts. Again with reinforcement of stereotypes! The way Levitt and Dubner write, you would think people are born into a set of circumstances and can never move out of them. I frankly found these authors' worldview to be bleak and disheartening and I wish that it wasn't cluttering my mind. If you have to read this one for school it's not a total bust. Dubner and Levitt have a piquant writing style that will keep you turning the pages. Some of the questions they explore are fun in a speculative way. I can't say I'd recommend it though, unless you have to read it."
134,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2940271-undrakh,4,"Freakonomics should definitely be listed as one of the books I'm glad I read them. Instead of directly writing about any sort of theories or laws of economy, Steven.L focuses on social issues that could explain many things previously ignored (or intentionally avoided). The overall writing style and structure of book are very similar to those of Malcolm Gladwell's books. Interesting and unexpected questions such as ""What do Schoolteachers and Sumo Wrestlers have in common?"" or ""Why do drug dealers still live with their Moms?"" are followed by convincing and simple explanations based on Levitt's and other researchers' works. Even if it's sorta called economics book, you don't really need economics background to read Freakonomics. However, this book can be a good inspiration to students who like doing researches on their own. Delivering ideas to the common readers is considerably important skill because one's brilliant idea can easily get squashed when not being presented well enough. In the expanded part of the book, Steven Levitt explains how he focused on writing research papers in a way that could be both interesting and simple to understand. Ignored by his colleagues because of his eccentric tendencies of seeing the world of economy, he proclaimed many persuasive ideas I never paid attention before.""Information is a beacon, an olive branch, a deterrent- all depending on who wields it and how. Information is so powerful that the assumption of information, even if the information does not actually exist, can have a sobering effect"" ""I gave up a long ago pretending that I knew stuff I didn't know"""
135,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2898486-la-pointe-de-la-sauce,2,"Freakonomics is a book that correlates data. The problem with correlating data, as the authors - Steven D. Levitt & Stephen J. Dubner -rightly admit, is that you find that there are many truths but no universal principle at work. And so you get a book that in one instance says parents with a higher level of education have smarter kids and then right at the end factors in that genetics may have more influence on a childs IQ level than highly educated parents that adopt that child. Honestly, it's hard to follow. The questions one has to ask is whether you trust the data; I for one think it's very alarmist. If you do trust the data then do you trust the conclusions reached. Personally, i think they come up with bits of the truth but there are so many other factors that have to be considered that any observation made is limited and probably only partially true for the specific instance being studied. I was particularly concerned that my daughters name -aleeyah- is the commonest black name of low income families (gasps, shock horror) I can only hope a good education, stable family, genetics, good neighbourhood, in house library, etc. etc. offset this obviously glaring disadvantage she may face. lol.People, if there is anything I can do short of changing her beautiful name please let me know.On a serious note, the book is half baked, it needs someone like Malcom Gladwell to really make some sense with all the collected data and find some real correlations.

139,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77527711-j-c-ahmed,2,"Some parts of Freakonomics are interesting, especially the parts about real estate agents, sumo wrestlers, and baby names. However, the book seems to rely on controversy and turning conventional wisdom on its head, to draw attention to itself, rather than on deep analysis. Some of these controversial claims have validity.One of the most controversial claims, that abortion leads to lower crime rates, may make many people uncomfortable, but it is pretty obvious. Forcing women to have kids they aren’t ready, willing, able to, or interested in raising will have many negative outcomes (on both a personal and societal level), one of those being higher crime rates. Mothers forced to give birth will in many cases resent their children for trapping them in poverty or in abusive relationships. However, the authors don’t address another possible factor that led to the declining crime rates that began in the 1990s. With the rise of multiple TV channels and video game consoles, kids had more to do. Various studies have suggested that young people who have more things to occupy their time are less likely to engage in antisocial behavior. Yet Freakonomics never even addresses this possibility.Another problem with Freakonomics is that it relies on very limited data to draw sweeping conclusions. One of these sweeping conclusions is that what parents do doesn’t matter. It’s what parents are that matters. Test scores on a specific standardized test are the means used to prove this. Reading to children isn’t important because kids who were read to and kids who weren’t had similar test scores. However, there are several problems with this conclusion. Test scores only tell us so much about academic competency. Two students could do equally well on a standardized English test but one may have much stronger essay writing skills than the other. Two students may do equally well on a math test but one may have to put in three times more effort than the other to achieve the same outcomes. I wondered if children who were and weren’t read to had similar grades in subjects like Language Arts and History, where reading skills are very important. Are their writing skills on par? This isn’t addressed because the book doesn’t go beyond looking at scores on a specific test. The authors also don’t consider the problems with much of the data coming from self-reporting. When asked if they read to their children, isn’t it possible many parents lied? Parents may be too embarrassed to admit they rarely or never read to their kids. There’s also the question of how much kids are read to and how many books. Reading to young children is supposed to be important because it builds their vocabulary and exposes them to new ideas. One parent may read the same few books over and over, while another parent goes to the library every week for a fresh supply of books. Was this taken into account? The authors don’t address that. ‘What parents are’ may seem to be more important than ‘what parents do’ because ‘what parents are’ is far more accurate and simpler to measure. It’s easier to verify income than it is to verify whether or not a parent reads to their children as much as they claim to.And then there’s the apples to oranges comparison that concludes swimming pools are more dangerous for kids than guns because there is one drowning for every 11,000 residential swimming pools while there is one fatal shooting for every one million guns. But this is an odd comparison. After all, swimming pools are large and many young children use them regularly. Guns are small and easily hidden from children. I wondered how often kids come into contact with pools versus guns? Let’s say for example that children under 10 are 100 times more likely to come into contact with a pool than a gun, what impact does that have on the statistics? How many kids die for every 100,000 kids under 10 who come into contact with pools vs guns? If kids were given the same kinds of access to guns as they were to pools, what impact would that have on death rates? The authors never address any of this. The big problem with this book is that it’s a mile wide and an inch deep, so don’t throw out your booster seat or park your kids in front of the TV instead of reading to them based on what these authors have to say."
140,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11281532-lita,4,"I'm not a fan of economics, far from it. I usually find economics extremely boring. But this is no usual book. It tackles topics and questions that are simply interesting (if maybe not always relevant). It's a 'love child' of a scientist and a journalist or writer which makes it readable and understandable to everyone (I hope). At least, it should spark some critical thinking among those who are not used to address the issues beyond our basic human reactions.Admittedly, I was expecting a bit more (or I was promised, I cannot tell anymore). And considering my background in research, quite a few things seemed simply logical or straightforward (I guess I was missing out on some element of surprise). However, I have to give the authors (or just the scientist?) credit for some creative thinking in using the available data. All in all, it's worth a read just to have interesting topics to discuss at any dinner party."
141,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212447-sharon-barrow-wilfong,4,"I am always skeptical of explanations based on hard numbers. Statistics do lie as any one in a career that has anything to do with numbers, averages, and odds would know.Nevertheless, I found this book to be a worthy read. For one, it was quick. I read it in three sittings. Of course, in order to sell a book you have to go against the grain of popular or conventional attitudes about a subject, otherwise you wouldn't sell your book. But again, you better provide a convincing argument or at least know how to manipulate words so it sounds as though you are supporting your unique slant on subjects that have been taken for granted by the general populace.This is what the authors, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner attempt to do. By that I mean that sometimes they support their assertions and sometimes they never get around to really backing up their claims.The most interesting chapters dealt with cheating teachers, the Ku Kux Klan and Drug Dealers. In chapter one they discussed how the heavier accountability placed on teachers for the students test scores led to some teachers cheating. There were a variety of ways they could do this- give the answers, help the students along- but the best way to avoid detection was to simply go over the tests and change the students' incorrect answers.Now the smart teacher did not change every answer or all the students' answers. They are educators, after all, and weren't stupid. But it was suspicious that since the teacher accountability some students with a history of failure were suddenly comparing favorably with their peers. At least for one year. The next year many of them sunk back to their previous level.Now to suspect a teacher of cheating and proving it are two different things. Correlation does not prove causation as the authors demonstrate throughout the book. The solution was rather involved and I won't attempt to show it here, and anyway, it only resulted in the firing of a handful of teachers, however, it did send a warning call to the rest and the cheating stopped.The Ku Klux Klan history was very interesting because it showed that their reputation was larger than their actual work of terror, which slowly declined with time. In 1890-1899 there were 1,111 lynchings. This number dwindled until by 1930-1929 there were only 119. For the decade of the sixties there were 3. One man decided he would rid the country of the Ku Klux Klan and he did it in a surprising way. He ridiculed them. Stetson Kennedy joined the Klan, found out all their secrets then broadcasted them on the radio. All the secret handshakes and crypted messages became common knowledge with children playing good guys, bad guys using the same hand shakes and coded words. No longer were the Klans members a secretive powerful group, but an object of fun, even by their own children. Klan membership plummeted.Ironically, there has been a resurgence in white supremacy groups as a kind of push-back to the ""Cry bullying"" that wants to make every minority a victim and every white male a villain, but that is a topic for another day.Another chapter discusses the logistics of drug dealing and gang business. It was fascinating how drug lords ran their business not differently from the hierarchy of Amway. Young kids join the gang and sell the drugs on the streets. They make the least money and run the greatest risk of arrest and death. But if they are successful they can work their way up the ladder until they are a part of the board making an incredible amount of money. The book describes the overhead the Drug Lord pays to his subordinates while keeping the most money for himself and it's a lot of money.Of course there are risks involved, such as eventually getting arrested and going to jail for many years, which is what eventually happened to the Drug Lord in this story. The information was accumulated by a Sociology PhD student from the University of Chicago who spent several years with a gang from one of the poorest black neighborhoods in Chicago. His experience is as harrowing as it is engrossing.The final chapters was on what the statistics have to say about effective parenting. They show hard numbers as to what sort of households had successful children and which kind did not (did a child growing up in a house full of books make a difference? Does Head Start make a difference for underprivileged children? Does staying home during the formative years help?) Not surprisingly, it boils down to parents who are involved in their children's education and those who are not.An interesting conclusion came from names. Do children with ""black"" names lack success due to racism? It turns out that a certain demographic names their children certain types of names and it's not the names that provide or steal success but, again, the parents. Apparently there are traceable trends as to what kind of people name their children outlandish names and their correlation to success. Uneducated, people from poor neighborhoods tend to name their children ""Rashan"" and ""Bomquisha"" and lest you think that's a color-related issue, white people in trailer parks tend to name their girls ""Heavenly"" and ""Dreamer"" and call their boys ""Bubba"" and ""Booger"".While I felt some conclusions were based more on speculation (Since 80% of abortion centers are in poor, black neighborhoods, does abortion really lower the crime rate or the kind of person who would abort their children be the kind to abuse their children and produce a criminal element?) it was still interesting to ponder.Certainly this book should not be the sole source of any kind of information concerning statistics, but it is certainly a thought-provoking read."
142,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856247-david-sarkies,3,"A new take on the dismal science16 September 2009	This is a book on statistics, not a book that lists statistics but a book that uses statistics to attempt to answer some interesting questions, such as whether teachers and sumo wrestlers cheat, why drug dealers live with their mothers, and why has the crime level dropped. The content is interesting, though not something that I entirely agree with.	First the teachers and sumo wrestlers: personally I would not need statistics to prove this, however the statistics do assist in supporting the argument. My opinion is that human sin will say that teachers and sumo wrestlers cheat, however with sumo wrestlers there is also a question of pride, and with most sports people the question of pride sometimes (but not always) over rides any desire to cheat. However cheating always has and always will exist. With teachers, when standardised testing came into the US (and now to Australia) this created an inventive to cheat. If ones' performance is measured on the class's performance then bad teachers are going to want to cheat to raise the performance of their class. Teachers who don't like performance testing are likely the ones who are bad and don't want their bad performance to prove that they are bad.	Now for drug dealers: what he explores here is that the gang that he was looking that was run like a corporation, therefore the drug dealers at the bottom of the chain would not be earning as much as those at the top. This is nothing new, whether the dealer is self employed (that is buying wholesale and selling retail) or be a member of a gang (that is being an employee), it is always the ones that the top that make all of the money of the workers at the bottom. Nothing new here.	He also explores real estate agents. Once again, human self interest suggests that real estate agents will work harder when selling their own home, where they pocket most of the proceeds than when selling somebody else's home, where they only pocket commissions. However, in my industry, where I deal with a lot of lawyers, I have noticed that lawyers tend not to put more effort in their own claims than they do when working on other people's claims, which to me suggests that lawyers do tend to be honest and ethical people, which is most likely also true of teachers, real estate agents, and sumo wrestlers (but not drug dealers, who are doing something illegal). "
143,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,5,"On the surface, ""Freakonomics"" is a collection of interesting factoids and anecdotes leading to conclusions, some of which are very counterintuitive. One of the most interesting chapters is the analysis of the economics of crack-dealing, based on a graduate student's ""fieldwork"" where he hung out with a gang for months and learned just how the business worked. (Bottom line: it's just like a typical corporation, where the low-level ""footsoldiers"" do the gruntwork for very little pay, hoping to make it into middle management and eventually the ""executive"" levels.) The authors aren't afraid to examine inflammatory subject matter, either, all while trying to remain strictly neutral regarding the political and moral ramifications of their conclusions. They point out that swimming pools are far more dangerous to children than guns, but don't take a position on gun control. They examine the hysteria about ""superpredators"" that you may remember from the 1980s -- what was supposed to be an apocalyptic crime wave of sociopathic teenagers which never materialized. They argue rather convincingly that legalized abortion did more to lower crime rates than anything else, but they do not present this as an argument in favor of abortion and take great pains to point out that there is no racial component to this argument either.But, what is ""Freakonomics"" about? The authors say at the outset that their book really has no theme; it's just a book about interesting things you can learn by looking at economic data. I suggest, however, that the book really does have a theme. It's about examining evidence impartially, being willing to look at what the numbers tell you, even if they lead to conclusions that contradict conventional wisdom or your own beliefs. Most importantly, the authors spend a lot of time taking the reader by the hand in studying the difference between correlation and causation. That is, the fact that two phenomena appear to be related does not mean that one caused the other. They give many examples of correlated statistics, and then demonstrate how one can go about determining whether or not there is causality involved.In this respect, ""Freakonomics"" should be required reading for every high school student, as it explains clearly and in an interesting manner some basic critical thinking skills that would go a long way towards a more educated public. "
144,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/724958,2,"This book wasn't bad, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It's a quick read and gives the feeling of learning interesting things while also not challenging your brain too much (which after a day of reading academic works in your non-native language, is definitely a GOOD thing).Its drawbacks are the following. The first I realize isn't quite fair, because the authors come right out and state that the book isn't intended to have an overarching point. But it simply feels disjoined and, ultimately, unsatisfying without one.The second is the authors' lack of attention to systemic issues in the US that are directly related to some of the topics that they take up. In particular, I feel that systemic racism needs to be addressed in this book and it's not. On the one hand, I realize that what the authors are trying to do is to simply describe what's going on, rather than make moral judgements or prescriptions. I respect that and don't expect this book to be a treatise on the evils of systemic racism in the US, much as it would be personally gratifying for me to read that. At the same time, it feels like a rather large elephant in the room and deserves at least a little explanation as to why the authors choose NOT to address it in the context of the issues they take up.My third sticking point is rather hard to nail down, but I felt an overwhelming male-ness and only a passive presence of women in the book. This is particularly weird because an entire chapter is spent on abortion. I realize that most economists are male, and basically every actor in this book is male, and that happens. But I had a creeping sense of the invisibility and passivity of women as portrayed in this book, and it nagged at me. It prevented me from really enjoying this book as I might have otherwise.Overall, I feel like it is a fun read but was also filled with quite a few ""no duh"" moments - you don't say, people like in polls about how they are going to vote when race is part of the question? I wouldn't recommend to anyone not to read this book, but I would also recommend getting it from the library before making any kind of investment."
145,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1719442-jen,2," Quotes from the book's epilogue: ""And now, with all these pages behind us, an early promise has been confirmed: this book indeed has no ""unifying theme.""  ""Will the ability to think such thoughts improve your life materially? Probably not."" ""...You might become more skeptical of the conventional wisdom; you may begin looking for hints as to how things aren't quite what they seem...the most likely result of having read this book is a simple one: you may find yourself asking a lot of questions. Many of them will lead to nothing. ""I could have skipped large portions of this book and just read the epilogue and notes at the back. I already was skeptical of conventional wisdom and full of questions. I already knew that the book wouldn't improve my life materially, but jeez, just him telling me that in print was a big bummer. When they say that the book is from a ""rogue economist"" they really mean it. Like Manny's review suggests, the book is more statistical than economical. Statistical sociology, really. I think. If that exists. There were interesting bits in here, for sure. I will be more wary of my real estate agent and for sure nix future gambling on any sumo matches. I liked his dive-bombing into obsessive parenting and also was relieved to learn that me getting a job before my kid goes to kindergarten is statistically a-ok for his future. I will think twice about selling crack now.My two star rating was originally a three. Make of that what you will. "
146,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5241673-keren-threlfall,4,"Many people think only of finances when they think of economics, but Freakonomics uses the matrix of economics to explore…well, the hidden side of many things. Some things may be commonsense, like the fact that owning a swimming pool is statistically more dangerous than owning a gun. (But how does that cause you to react to a gun vs. a swimming pool?) Other fascinating topics were how the name you give your child can affect him/her, the role a real estate agent can play, the KKK, Babywise On Becoming Baby Wise: Giving Your Infant the Gift of Nighttime Sleep and other parenting methods, crime rates, and drug dealers. Perhaps the most controversial issue in the book is the link between legalizing abortion and the resulting lowered crime rates. While this does indeed make sense given the facts and data presented in the book, I don’t have to accept that as a reason to believe abortion is ever right, and rather to realize the failure to make changes in other areas that would help those seeking abortions also heavily plays into this factor. Overall, this was a wonderful, stimulating read. I posted a quote from this book here."
147,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7891507-rose,2,"The title should actually read ""Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of a Few Things"". See in the synopsis how it gives five sample questions? Those are it. They spent 320 pages on those five questions. They were interesting questions and their answers made total sense but they went on and on in their ""explorations"". I can see some people liking this. Some do like to know every little facet but I would have preferred a book with four times as many questions with only a quarter of the explanation. I should have known better by the synopsis. Do you see how long that thing is? I'm going to do a comparison like they do in the book and come up with a possible conclusion. The story is 320 pages long with a full computer screen of synopsis. Lord of the Rings is 1200 pages long with a half computer screen synopsis. My conclusion: The author just likes to write and write and write some more. If you don't bore easily with endless statistics and comparisons stating the same thing over and over, then this is the book for you. If not, then wait for the 20 page abridged version to come out.

And this book may well be the first of the human economics genre, though I prefer Malcolm Gladwell and Dan Ariely (perhaps because I read them first). In any case, this was a fast and absorbing read, especially the section about crack dealers. The point about abortion and crime is so well-argued, I don't think I can deny it. . .except that it's morally appalling. But the book fell down for me at the parenting chapters. The abortion argument states that children who are wanted by their parents have the best futures ahead of them. So how can the author then argue that parenting style just doesn't matter that much?

If selling drugs is so lucrative, why do drug dealers so often live with their mothers?2. What do sumo wrestlers and teachers have in common? (turns out a tendency to cheat)3. Which is more dangerous--a gun or a swimming pool?4. Why did Roe v. Wade lead to a drastic decrease in crime?5. Why the reports of excessive amounts of money being spent in political campaign is a myth.6. What impact does a child's name have on their ultimate success?A real page-turner.

After finishing, I looked up reviews and saw scores of people who had the same response I had.I agree with one reviewer who said this is really just ""sociology,"" not a new, exciting branch of economics that deserves a new name because the authors are so brilliant to have discovered it.The book appears to be lacking in intellectual integrity and good scholarship from cover to cover.

155,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422229-joe-kraus,2,"Part of this book is right up my alley. It chronicles how a really clever economist applies the tools of his field to questions seemingly outside it. He tries to show, for instance, that we suburban parent types worry more about gun violence than about our swimming pools as life-threatening hazards for our children. Or he shows us that real estate agents have incentives to sell our houses for less than they might otherwise get. Or that sumo wrestlers have incentives to cheat when they find themselves in the crucial rubber matches of their events. Or even that there’s a way to determine which Chicago public school teachers were feeding their students answers on standardized tests.Each of those anecdotes is presented cleverly, and there’s something satisfying in seeing someone make such clear sense of the world. Dubner chronicles Levitt’s breakthroughs with a pleasant enough pattern: we come to understand a problem, Levitt asks a clever question, and we see the sorts of data that give him insight no one else has ever gleaned.This takes a notorious turn, though, when Dubner talks about Levitt’s most famous proposal. That is, in trying to figure out why crime dropped as dramatically as it did in the early 1990s, he determined that was the era when children were coming of age who would have been born if not for Roe vs. Wade. That is he proposes that crime dropped as it did because a generation of likely criminals were aborted.To be fair, both authors acknowledge the dicey morality of that claim. Dubner takes it head on by declaring that morality is the story of the world as we would like it to be while economics is the story of the world as it is.The two also dance around, at times thoughtfully, over the possibility that there are errors in the methodology. And maybe there are.But the morality that seems violated here isn’t merely the Thou-shalt-not of abortion politics in either direction. Instead, it seems as if Levitt has violated a central tenet of his own work. He has, that is, oversimplified a complicated scenario.A proclivity toward crime, like his airy assertion that IQ is hereditary (which it might be but, if so, it warrants a lot of explanation before it can be used as a stand-in for functional intelligence), is just something too full of variables for such a clearly declared premise. It may be that children whose parents didn’t want them – the potential children who were aborted – do have a higher likelihood of committing crime, but surely there’s more to it than that. More skilled economists than Levitt – like Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein – have traveled similar territory, and they’ve done it by acknowledging more ambiguity. And by making less sweeping claims.This starts with the pleasure of watching someone who builds a fascinating case insight by insight and term by term. By the time this ends, though, it feels as if our authors have tried to slip a couple of major terms by us, as if they’ve gotten us to accept premises we never signed on for.There’s cleverness here, but it falls short of Michael Lewis’s The Undoing Project, and it leaves something of a bad taste in the mouth.And I’m tempted to dock it another half star for reprinting the original articles Dubner wrote on Levitt. It seems an unnecessary appendix, and it’s awkward to get the same anecdotes delivered in a different tone, sometimes with ancillary information that might have had more effect earlier in the book."
156,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,2,"
We and others have noted a discouraging tendency in the Freakonomics body of work to present speculative or even erroneous claims with an air of certainty.
- Gelman and FungEntertaining but misleading. Levitt's proper work deserves admiration, for its ability to make dry econometric bs exciting, and for its willingness to push strong counterintuitive policy based on the available evidence. But presented without the error bars, like in this book, it's not to be relied upon.The most important claim in this, that legalising abortion caused a big permanent fall in crime rates two decades later, is (to my surprise) actually much the same status as it was 20 years ago: plausible, contested, surviving its errors, unsure.Go for 'The Undercover Economist's or 'Filthy Lucre' or 'The Armchair Economist' instead."
157,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75748905-elizabeth,3,"Will it cease to be awkward to give 3 stars when you found a book legitimately interesting? That’s rhetorical. Anyway, Freakonomics was a fascinating exploration into seemingly weird phenomenon, and in case it wasn’t obvious, Levitt and Dubner are using an economic lens to survey a broad range of topics—how the Ku Klux Klan and real estate agents are similar, why abortion caused a drop in crime rates in the 90s, for example. Those inherently pique your interest, and rightly so. For every closet nerd out there, it’s always cool to pick apart the complexity of daily life and see what funky patterns lay beneath. Yes, it’s economics. But also it’s about psychology and sociology and all the -ologies that make nonfiction books interesting: investigating people. In giving us short case studies, however, the book ends up feeling very podcast-esque. This isn’t bad, per se, but I think this does bring into question how I would rate this as a “book.” As much as Freakonomics presents some compelling logic alongside valid numbers in order to support its findings, I ultimately found the book taken together as disappointing. By the last case study, my impression was that the whole was less than the sum of the parts. In fact, Levitt and Dubner admit and emphasize more than once that there is no unifying theme. But if there’s no theme, no thesis, how can this book be more than just a breezy foray into an economic view of the world? Interesting, but I’m left wanting something more. To be mind-blown? That would be cool."
158,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65139505-naga-teja,1,I couldn't stand this book. 
159,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28613204-sara,3,"Wasn’t as blown away by this book as so many other folks—seemed like yet another way of combining pop psychology, deductive reasoning, mathematics, and economics. Kind of fun but not necessarily purposeful. (I lean more towards “chaos theory” as described in “Jurassic Park”—“life finds a way.” :)"
160,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,3,"How is Freakonomics like the television series, “The Wire”?....The question is, of course, posed in the authors' unconventional style. Dubner, a journalist, expands on the ideas of Levitt, the economist, whom he profiled in a 2003 article in the New York Times. The book is liberally sprinkled with excerpts from the article and constitutes a series of case studies with intriguing chapter headings like “How is the Ku Klux Klan Like a Group of Real-Estate Agents?”. Dubner denies there is a unifying theme to his book. Some of the cases address the power of proprietary information (informational asymmetry). Others explore the arithmetic of risk assessment. However, there is a unifying theme, and it is an important one. Bolstered by journalists and experts the general public too often reaches for the comfortable and familiar explanation like Homer Simpson reaching from the couch for his beer and chips. Dubner has assembled this book to assail what John Kenneth Galbraith called “conventional wisdom.” He has found the ideal partner for his attack. Levitt is that rare economist whose questions impinge on everyday life and whose reasoning can be expressed without resorting to complex equations and academic equivocation. After reading this book, the reader will react instinctively, like a feral animal sensing peril, when conventional wisdom is invoked to support a position. One of the most intriguing chapters asks us to consider a relationship between the drop in crime statistics and the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. Of particular interest to me was a much more straight-forward discussion of the effectiveness of fines to discourage late pick-ups at a daycare center. The same chapter goes on to investigate the unintended consequences of high-stakes testing in the Chicago Public School System. Both positive and negative incentives do not always lead to predictable or desirable results. The chapter also describes a sophisticated cheating scheme in professional Sumo wrestling, persuasively. Not only was there statistical evidence, but two would-be whistle blowers met suspiciously untimely deaths. In the chapter: “Why Do Drug Dealers Still Live their Moms?” Dubner cites material from Roland Fryer Jr.'s anthropological study of Chicago gangs. In reading about these cases, I could not help thinking of “The Wire.” “Juking the stats.” and Stringer Bell's entrepreneurial business model felt like dramatic iterations of the information from these studies. Dubner is at times hyperbolic in his praise for Levitt. The title itself trumpets self-importance. The book was first published in 2005 and since that time numerous books have come out along the same lines. Finally, the concluding chapter on trends in children's names felt superfluous. Not only was the material of less interest, but the conclusions fall into a familiar template described in the sociolinguistic literature on pronunciation and social status. This is a book written to invite questions, not provide answers. In that sense, Dubner and Levitt are successful."
161,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23233462-clare-o-beara,3,"I read the expanded version, which offers blog posts repeating and summarising some of the main material as well as briefly giving impressions of the two authors' visit to a Google office. The book would have made a better impression on me if there wasn't so much repetition, and continued references to how splendid one of the authors was at being an economist. My assessment quite early was that the book was not about economics, though some principles of economics were being applied; it is a mix of sociology and statistics. For instance, what names are given to American children, how names change in popularity over the decades, whether families on the white side of the tracks give children different names than on the black side of the tracks, whether well off and well educated people give children different names than poor parents, and whether the names themselves affect the kids' chances of having a good social standing and chance of prosperity, or whether their upbringing alone has that effect. I felt that this experiment had already been tried in Northern Ireland and probably in many other countries, where the first name, surname, address and school on a CV speak volumes to the person doing the hiring. The first name could be omitted or changed to little effect. The hero of this book to me, is actually a man named Venkatesh who as a student went out armed with an assigned sociology project, to ask people in the housing blocks how they felt about being poor and black. He walked in to a den of teenage crack dealers and was almost shot. He was held all night and only kept alive by a more mature dealer higher up the organisation who dropped in a few times and spoke with him and the gang members. After being released this young man was determined to embed himself with the crack gang and find out what their lives were like, how the finances of the gang functioned. After some years of this life he was handed the gang's trading and organisational records. These form the nucleus of the chapter asking why, if drug dealers make so much money, they mostly still live with their mothers. Well done, Venkatesh. I'm certain that this is the section which caught the imagination of the journalist half of the book's writing team.After that, the section on whether estate agents hold out for more money when selling their own houses rather than when selling a client's house for a small commission (well guess yes or no?) or whether wrestlers in the small, interlinked, worth-it-only-if-you're winning life of sumo wrestling sometimes rig bouts (guess again) seem less incisive. Certainly Freakonomics is worth a look, if only to look at what Americans think about America and wonder why it's all black versus white in the California stats, no Indians, Japanese, Vietnamese, Native Americans, Latinos. As for whether more children die in swimming pools than in gun accidents, again, only in America. "
162,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1721246-garrett,3,"**Update** 01/16/17Whether this book has aged poorly, or not, can be debated reasonably from either angle. On the one hand, this book is credited with popularizing behavioral economics, has yielded two other books by the same authors, and spurred a similarly popular podcast. For a while, I listened to that podcast, and now I don't. For whatever reason, I just don't find their material especially compelling or interesting.On the other hand, for reasons I can only defend in a Gestalt fashion, I don't think they bolster their presentations with the kind of data and logic that I've found in similar kinds of material, like Malcolm Gladwell's work, or even This American Life - the latter a generally presentational podcast as opposed to a statistical one. The work in Freakonomics generally strikes me as too much back-of-the-envelope analysis in the service of making a ""neato"" proposition sound plausible. I still think this is a solid 3.5 star book. For a long time, I had it as a 4, then a 5, and now a 3. Why the downgrade? I can't blame the boring last chapter about names. It's just the fact that it didn't stick to my ribs. I read and seek out everything Malcolm Gladwell makes because I find his work compelling and interesting, even though he is neither a statistician nor a scientist. Within the frameworks he allows himself as a writer, his logical arguments and supporting data impress me.In the end, though, it's really just a matter of my own tastes. Levitt is a real-deal economist, and I am not in a position to legitimately critique him; maybe it's not you, Levitt - it's me. So, ever the curmudgeon, it's a 3 and not a 4 because, even though it's fun, it's not as fun or as serious as I would like.More here**Review from 2012 is below**Interesting, but uneven and a lightweight analysis. Fun to read, but any serious critical thinker is going to be left wanting as a lot of the proof behind the reasoning is left out, perhaps because the analysis is difficult for non-economists, but more probably so the book would have mass appeal, particularly to young college and high school students, persons for whom these ideas will be more original. Despite all this, it does what I want a non-fiction book is meant to do: it made me think, it was engaging, and it was (mostly) unpretentious.I would have given this 3.5 stars: I cut a half star for the totally useless last chapter regarding names."

Though the book Freakonomics is full of statistics, it compares very interesting things. Do you like to read? Or do you like math? The book of Freakonomics is both. Though some people don’t like to do math they don’t have to look at the pictures that involves the math because it right there in the reading, and for the people that like math there is an area with the math worked out that way the reader can see how they figured it out and maybe even try doing it themselves. In the book Freakonomics there are different cases and scenarios. What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? The book compares what schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have common though the reading may be difficult and can confuse the reader the book gives you statistics to help the reader out.

The Ku Klux Klan in chapter 2 the truth come out about the Klan many things that the reader may not of known after they read this book the reader was very well more educated on the Ku Klux Klan. The book mentions that the Ku Klux Klan actually had more lynching’s of blacks between 1900 and 1909,when the Klan was dormant, than during the 1920’s, when the Klan had millions of members which suggests the Ku Klux Klan carried out far fewer lynchpins than is generally thought. In the years of 1880 between 1899 there was1, 111 lynching’s of blacks when in 1960 between 1969 the was only 3 lynching’s of blacks. In probably anyone’s mind you might have thought later in life there would be more lynching’s because there were more people in the Ku Klux Klan at that time. The book is about the riddles of everyday life. Do you think you can figure out the riddles in each chapter or even help solve the statistics inside? I Read the Book Freakonomics for my 11th grade English class. Yes the book was difficult for me to understand but due to all the pictures that involve statistics to go along with the reading it helped me as a poor reader understand what was going on the whole time as I worked my way through the book I suggest reader or even math lovers to take a seat back and open this book Freakonomics for the ride of your life to understand the everyday riddles of life.

164,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/213761-sean-cooney,3,"I read Freakonomics last year, but I've continued to enjoy it more and more as I share parts of it with my English classes. It's a great nonfiction work to bring into the classroom, and the way it's divided into independent chapters makes it easy to do so. Kids who in general do not read find this writer's hypotheses (and proofs thereof) fascinating. Kids in general classes have asked me to borrow it.The way the Steven Levitt is a ""rogue economist"" is ironic. Although I'm sure the term applies to his unconventional topics (Why do drug dealers still live with their moms?, How is the Ku Klux Klan like a group of real estate agents?), to me he's different because he truly has no agenda except to express what his numbers tell him. Usually, when an author publishes a work researching controversial topics, he/she at least has some preconceived notions (if not an agenda) in mind. He/she wants to come to a conclusion that matches his/her beliefs/impressions of the world. So immediately, some level of objectivity is lost, because the research is biased from the beginning. We're all biased, after all.However, the more one uses quantitative, rather than narrative (qualitative) data, the more convincing the findings become. Enter the economist. Finding out whether the decrease in crime rates during the 90's has anything to do with when Roe vs/ Wade went down and exactly who was born since then, to most people, is immediately going to evoke an emotional reaction. Not this guy. He just follows the numbers and comes to some startling conclusions, whatever they may be. I'm convinced he does it with that ever-elusive ""view from nowhere,"" and that's refreshing."
165,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1847371-michael-scott,3,"I read this book over a year ago, so an actual review is a bit off-hand. In short, it's a book in which an economist (or several) apply a simple statistical technique (or several) to crunch data and prove (or claim to prove) theories from a wide variety of domains. I hated the tone and the writing in the book, and I hated the far-fetched conclusions about mostly anything. (In principle, you could find a million datasets and theories that would match in the same way Levitt does in this book; using such an approach you could prove, in principle, that the increase in the number of motorcycles in Italy is the main cause of abortions in the US.) What I liked in this book was the sports-related part: how Sumo wrestlers seemed to throw matches. Too little, I thought, and promptly gave this book two stars out of five. However, I have to admit now I was wrong and Levitt was almost prescient: around February 2011, a scandal broke out with rikishi (fighters) such as Kiyoseumi involved in match fixing for hefty sums. (As a result, the Japanese Sumo Association had to cancel its spring tournament and all the other country tournaments for the whole year, for the first time in over 50 years.) While I maintain my opinion about the other ""findings"", the Sumo chapter is now worth alone for me three stars. "
166,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/749530-beckie,5,"I'm a little bit late to the party on this one, I realize. I'd heard so much about ""Freakonomics"" that there didn't seem to be much point in actually reading it. But I had a prolonged airport experience yesterday and devoured the whole thing.I hadn't realized Steven Levitt had lost a child, and knowing that changed the way I looked at a lot of his ideas. Even thought I had heard many of the arguments Levitt makes before reading the book, I found his ideas compelling and provocative. His argument that legalizing abortion lowered crime rates is especially fascinating, but hard to decide what to do with. I guess that's the tension between economics and morality.I also loved the anecdote about Rod Blagojevich proposing the state mail books to every child in Illinois, as this was mentioned in some of the recent scandal coverage.The writing is excellent, and it's nice to see a first-rate journalist and a first-rate thinker collaborate in this way. It also warmed my heart to hear a brilliant economist say he's not much good at math. If you are behind even me in reading this, you should."

This book offer insights into application of economics in day to day life of anyone. Often books covering academic subjects utilises routine pedagogy making it unappealable to wide range of readers who do not posses a necessary familiarity with author's work. However this book explores bold examples often within the experienced range of any bibliophile. I certainly cannot comment personally on validity of robustness of each and every study made by authors in this book but my background check shows that economist community has show positively favoured mixed reviews. Regardless of looking a perfection in results by authors it would be encouraging to use this book as guiding ribbon while walking through labyrinth of facts and figures surrounding us and making sense and useful correlation among them. Instead of a course book or a case study where exact documentation is utmost important, anyone with fascination towards breaking the norms of conventional studies and opportunity of combining academic and non academic front should mark this book as must to read."

A mind candy as they say it, it also teaches you think on how to use regression analysis and statistics to most complex questions to get mind-blogging results. Well, Data is the best thing you can have if you are an economist. It's like you are coming with those ideas(by looking at problems from a totally different perspective) and so Freakonomics was a thrilling page turner for me. Although it had some problems as I see it, like when the author asked a question,""Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool"" and answered that swimming pools are 100 times more dangerous for a child than letting him play with a gun, it's unclear from the question as to why it's considering the fact that only children can die due to those butOnly one in 5 people who die in swimming pools(unintentional drowning) was a child. In 2013, there were about 33,636 deaths in USA due to gun violence and only a small fraction of children were affected. My point is that not everything in this book was correct yet I liked it because it all made sense.3.75 stars."

If you can introduce me to new thoughts, ideas or facts then more power to you as an author. Those things are what Freakonomics does for me.Leavitt thinks of questions that no one has ever thought before. Or if someone came up with his questions, they couldn't figure out how to answer them. I had a blast reading answers to questions that I would have figured were unanswerable.It took me awhile to finish this book, because I had to wait until I could just sit and finish the book with no interruptions.

I believe there are more than a few parts where Levitt and Dubner seem to cross the line between objective analysts and implicitly offensive ones, most notably in the chapter dubbed ""A Roshanda by Any Other Name"". Accordingly, I won't deny my slight reluctance to praise them, though I'll do so regardless. From its scrupulous citations to the clever, biting analysis each new storyline birthed, I fell in love with Freakonomics after reading its first data chart.

There were certainly a lot of ideas that I had not really given a lot of thought to, but then others where the data just tends to validate the obvious.Some of the best parts were about Sumo Wrestlers, Estate Agents, Crack dealers and Teachers. I think the most eye opening conclusion of the author was that the drastic reduction in crime in the early 90's was a result of the legalization of abortion about 16-17 years before. The later chapters were focused on education and differences between black and white culture that effect school scores. Not everything here was as obvious as it at first might seem.

194,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/272430-daniel,3,"This book is quite interesting, even if not as ""dazzling"" as the cover claims. One thing refreshing about it is the very old-fashioned spirit of dispassionate analysis that Steven Levitt clearly brings to his research questions. Although I tend to be opinionated, I have always thought, following my father's guidance, that one must first acknowledge the truth. (It seems like a simple rule of thumb, but my impression is it is not universally practiced.) So, for example, it disheartens me to think that the reduction in crime was heavily influenced by Roe v Wade, but I confess Levitt's case is compelling (though there is work out there claiming to debunk it; see, for example, http://online.wsj.com/public/article_...). My biggest beef with Levitt is that he is too infatuated with regression analysis. As a statistician, I know a little bit about this topic, and I won't go into details about his use of it (largely because he doesn't describe in detail what he did). I can say with reasonable confidence, however, that if you create a statistical model that tells you something stupid, you should *not* accept the 'conclusions' in an effort to show how willing you are to be persuaded by the evidence. Let's take a simple example: if I told you that I did a fancy regression analysis and found that the amount of time children actually practiced the piano had no effect on their performance skills, you would ignore my findings (and justly so). That's how I feel about his reading of the Chicago data that suggest having books in the home (an 'indicator' of intelligence) is correlated with test scores in READING ABILITY (!!) while having the parents read to the child every day is not. Let's take this finding one step further: actually reading books is not as correlated with reading ability as owning books is (he pretty much makes this claim). However he did his regression, that's just silly on the face of it. Keep reading!"
195,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2255181-dave,3,"I've heard about this book for years. The ""cool"" section of Econ 110 read this back when I was in the uncool section reading about historical economic theory. Needless to say, I was jealous, and Freakonomics had an allure even since. Now that (after checking it out of 3 different libraries in 2 different states) I've actually sat down and read it through, the allure is gone. When I compare Freakonomics to other manifestations of accessible economic thought and discussion, Levitt and Dubner focus on telling a good (and sometimes rambling) story instead of working hard at their real goal, which is to engage a large audience in intelligent economics-based reappraisal of conventional wisdom. They flash their audience with the results of deep and critical thinking, but never really model how their audience might go about doing the same in their own lives.They start with interesting stories, whether it's the connection of school teachers to sumo wrestlers or the relationship between levels of gang level pyramid schemes, and end with hazy maxims familiar to anyone who (like me) stopped their formal economics education after a single college course. That's not to say there aren't startling and original thoughts here. The disturbing correlation (and, they argue, causation) between legalized abortion and violent crime is a brilliant analysis of unforeseen costs and benefits, but the rest of the book never quite catches that same power. Instead, the school teachers and sumo wrestlers story forms a less-than-graceful attempt to discuss incentives, and the other chapters follow suit.I recommend Freakonomics to anyone who isn't at all familiar with economic ideas of incentives, supply and demand, opportunity cost, or the like. At the same time, Naked Economics or  provide equally well-written but more substantial fare. Or listen to any number of the economically minded radio programs produced by NPR and APM."
196,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16994140-bianca,4,"Freakonomics is a non-fiction book that cannot easily be categorized. It is about economics, yes. But it is also about crime, corruption, cheating, lying, real estate, parenting, sumo wrestlers, teachers, drug dealers, and more. The authors, Steven B. Levitt and Stephen L. Dubner (Levitt, an (unconventional) economist, and Dubner (a financial/economics journalist)), are trying to dispel the theory that economics and everything surrounding it is a boring subject...because it is not. One of the biggest topics explored in this book is that of incentives...AKA what drives or does not drive people to do the things they do.I picked up this book because I had heard a lot about it and wanted to expand my knowledge on economics. This book seemed like it would do it for me, but in a more engaging and entertaining way. Some of the topics in this book were interesting and I couldn't help but agree with them, like the study that showed how abortion helped with significant drops in crime rates. The authors even went so far as to say that Roe  v.  Wade is the single biggest cause for the crime drop in the US, which obviously is a controversial statement to make. But, this is one of the aspects of the book that I liked: the open-mindedness and frankness. The chapter that irked me the most has to be the one on first names and their usage in different socioeconomic classes across the US. It was repetitive beyond belief and the numerous tables on first names annoyed me. Otherwise, this book makes for an interesting short read for beginners to the vast world of economics."
197,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4017921-mckenzie,3,"I've been meaning to read Freakonomics for years, and finally decided to listen to the audiobook on a road trip. Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner wrote this book before podcasts became a viral phenomenon, but it is essentially several podcast-like chapters of exploring random non-related human behaviors and trying to understand the underlying explanations. My favorite chapters were on teachers cheating on their students' standardized tests, the selection of baby names in the context of race and socioeconomic status, and how experts like realtors don't always serve their clients the same way they approach their own business in that field. I did find the connections that Dubner and Levitt drew between unrelated things unnecessary, particularly in that they pretended their original research questions were things like ""how are teachers and sumo wrestlers the same?"" While it might make sense in trying to create a semblance of order for the book, it misleads the audience into understanding how this research begins, driven by questions relating to cheating in different industries for instance, rather than starting out with two specific industries and seeking patterns after randomly choosing where to look. Despite this qualm, I am glad I finally ""read"" Freakonomics, and I definitely recommend the audiobook as a great way to pass the time while driving. I do think the more contemporary podcasts, which take this concept and apply it in a concentrated way, are more effective and equally interesting."
198,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32234183-neveen,4,"Alright this book was thought provoking and fun read it mainly teaches you to discern data. It reminded me of the book how to lie with statistics which I read earlier last year. Therefore I also have some reservations in the book content too. I’m not an expert in the field, but I believe that statistical analysis and its implications are not always applicable on the individual level because it cannot make cut and dry conclusions, and we don't like that individually. Maybe it can help us be more observant, but that has significant side effects, with the most probable one being confusion. The authors claim that the book will help people individually, but I think it can be of much help to corporations or groups.Another problem I've realized is the correlation of data, which may lead to contradicting outcomes as happened in this very book. In one study, the authors show that parents with high income are most likely to raise a successful kid. Yet, in another study near the end of the book they show that the parents’ economic status does not affect their child’s success in life at all, since other factors may be at play. I know that in statistics, it is very natural that individual cases may contradict with one another which is something inherent in the nature of statistics, but when entire statistical outcomes contradict, I think the method used can fairly be deemed inefficient."

I loved the concept of picking up extremely diverse subjects like What do school teachers and Sumo wrestlers have in common and I thoroughly appreciate the efforts taken correlate it as much as possible (even though I wasn't very convinced).This book is more like a badly prepared research paper that got rejected because of its vagueness and casual nature, It reminded me of those pretentiousness-know-it-all kids in school who thought saying vague interesting stuffs to showoff was cool even though they could barely pull it off eventually.

It's probably reflective of my overdeveloped humanities background that I need to read books to figure this stuff out, but so be it....Anyhow, where I thought that the other book I read earlier was too shy of what you could do with economics beyond conceptualizing and measuring the GDP, this one kind of errs in the other direction, uncovering, as the title says, the hidden side of everything, but for me at least, doing it all behind a screen of obscurity so that I felt like I was watching a computer in an episode of the old Batman TV show, where you input random data and suddenly it tells you where Egghead will strike next. The stories this book tells, about the data and the conclusions, are deeply interesting. But I think an attempt to achieve mass appeal needlessly sacrificed all the math from this-- I mean, I couldn't do the math, but this book doesn't even admit there's math involved-- so that I felt sort of puzzled about the conclusions, and that made me want to argue with them, and on into a vicious circle. In other words, a good book, but another one that gives a really limited view of the field. Next, I think, is a book on investment. I'm thinking _Are the Rich Necessary"".... can anyone else suggest a different title?"

It has no unifying theme, as the authors themselves admit. On the one hand this made it enjoyable to read, since the authors didn't feel a need to stress certain points to death; and on the other hand, without a unifying theme, it also made the book as a book a bit pointless. Sure, Levitt's unique way of thinking is interesting: to posit that crime rates dropped due to the legalization of abortion, who would've thunk it? He goes from abortion to cheaters, to sumo wrestlers to racism. The book comes off as being too random. It probably was better served as a series of academic articles.As for Levitt's methodologies, I have some reservations. One of his arguments in the book is that experts have incentives to promote their own points of views. Well, what makes Levitt different from any other expert? We all know statistics can be manipulated, so numbers do lie."

What he does is use statistics to examine whether our typical way of thinking about these individuals and how they act can be proven (in more cases disproven) by using statistics.The book is a series of fascinating anecdotes wrapped up with statistics to help us understand how they might be significant. I couldn't devour this book fast enough. If you are analytical and curious about people, you will love this book. After reading this book, I moved on to the Tipping Point and found that to be a fascinating book and a very good pairing with this one. Highly Recommended!"
204,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5338330-shriya,4,"'Freakonomics', undoubtedly a masterpiece of Steven D. Levitt happens to be the book I procrastinated a LOT about while reading it but which I thoroughly enjoyed once I was done. An incredibly engrossing read for both economics and non-economics people, it studies that side of economics which we never consider and emphasizes the fact that economics, first of all, is the science of human behaviour.No doubt the book is completely absurd, even impossible at times, but 'Freakonomics' happens to be a bizarre reading experience for anyone who lays his hands on this book. Be forewarned: you cannot finish this 'seemingly small booklet' in a day,nor will you find it too engrossing initially but once you start to get the hang of all the logic specified, you won't (because you simply can't) put it down! "
205,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2763719-john,4,"It wasn't the information in this book that blew my mind, but rather the revelation that economics can actually be interesting. Sure, the results that the authors come up with are sometimes a bit underwhelming, but I like how they have to do a lot of detective work to get the information they're looking for. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would have loved it. The downside of the book, however, is that a lot of the information is very repetitive. First you read something in the Introduction, then it's repeated in the main body of the text, then it's reiterated yet again in the bonus material afterwards. It's also way too short. The main text is only two hundred pages. Still, it was good enough to make me want to pick up the sequel, SUPERFREAKONOMICS. I'm a sucker for any book that demonstrates just how unreliable conventional wisdom generally is. "

I usually stick to crime and suspense/thrillers, but I liked the concept of this one and it's been on my ""to-read"" list for a while. I had an opportunity to read it for a course I'm currently going through, and was thoroughly pleased. I've always appreciated numbers, and I've always been curious about weird topics. Though I can't say that I thought much about the specific topics touched upon in this book, it did satisfy on both of those counts. The evidence presented in support of the theories discussed are quite compelling, and it's a quick read overall. I definitely intend to read its sequel and pay attention to the authors' blog."

I suspect econometric would have been easier to stomach if the questions we studied reflected the content of this book. My favorite line so far is in the Introd where Levitt confesses he knows nothing about the economy, interest rates, etc - now if only all the other economists would admit this fact too then maybe govt policy wouldn't slavishly adhere to economic theory and modelling and the first world would be in a better place! Oh and how many economists does it take to change a light bulb? None, they just assume the light bulb can change itself!"
209,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15506496-maggie,5,"This book is a must-read for anyone who likes thinking outside of the box, or in this case, outside of conventional wisdom. Especially if you've studied any kind of data analysis before, Freakonomics will stretch your brain and teach you new ways of drawing connections between seemingly unrelated events. The key is understanding the difference between correlation and causation and then taking the steps to understand how they play off one another when considering long-range trends.I've always been a scaredy cat where anything using the word ""economics"" was concerned, but I was shocked at how easy their data analysis principles were to understand when applied to concrete trends rather than financial ones. Everyone should read this book!"
210,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5010988-laura,3,"3.5 starsThis is my second time reading this book. There was a lot I had forgotten, so I'm glad my book club picked this to read. It was a good refresher.While I appreciate the reliance on facts & data, & the willingness of the authors to ask & answer tough & provocative questions, there seemed to be more grey areas than I recall, more room for some interpretation. And I know it was not the intention of either author to offer any kind of public policy. But debunking the conventional wisdom while offering no substantial interpretations seems ... a bit reckless. With nothing to take someone to the next logical conclusion, I think some of the finer points of their findings might get lost."

Or why the crime rate in the USA dramatically dropped in the 1990s? Or whether, as a parent, you are actually having any effect on your child's intelligence? You wouldn't think that these questions could be answered by an economist, but that is exactly what this book does. It takes data, crunches numbers and comes up with some fascinating insights into some very real and often controversial questions. It is an entertaining read and convincingly argued. I can see why the book was controversial, but does the data lie? I think it probably depends on who is looking at it!"

I'm not sure why they keep saying it's about ""economics"". It's about human behaviour and maybe socionomics. Well, call it what they might, I guess the main takeaway from this book is to think in broad terms, think out of the box and learn to ask (and answer) interesting questions. And what's more - learn to answer them by finding actual data. Basically a cool intro into research. I hope to see less yellow journalism and more this kind of analysis.Maybe there's a central theme in this book after all - you need to be creative and openminded to find interesting connections. This book made statistical analysis cool!"

Such as a home with a swimming pool is more dangers than a home with a gun in it. He looks at teachers who appear to help students cheat and Sumo wrestlers who fix matchesTo me this continues to suggest that numbers are not always what you think they are. The answer is not always clear. Yet numbers can help - it is a matter of finding and looking at the right numbers. I love the book as it encourages you to think twice on numbers - I would suggest to also think twice on the numbers in this book :)"

Though I may not entirely agree with the findings, the whole process of performing an actual root cause analysis with the data to instantiate the occurrences of a few events over time is an engaging exercise. I am now tempted to read the follow up to this book, but I guess I'll wait. Also, it'd be an interesting read if an Indian writer did this to events that followed the partition, Sanjay Gandhi's sterilisation drive and perhaps the IT boom and shown how a few changes that occurred in India could be attributed to those events.

215,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38756767-jon,4,"I've been listening to the Freakonomics podcast for a few months now and decided to give this book a listen. It's a great conglomeration of topics in the social science field and has lots of interesting ideas and information, but sometimes it felt a little thin on the proof. Many topics were already familiar to me and I actually think that Dubner's podcasts delve deeper into the different subjects when compared to this book.Overall, it's worth checking out the work that started it all, but I think the Freakonomics podcasts have a lot more to offer. The discussions with experts add something that's missing from here."

Sometimes we say, ""oversimplification!"" And then we discuss. The driving time flies by.My main takeaway is incentive.

But the different factors related to making the best incentive policy really jibed with my idea of what a good non-fiction should offer. Definitely commendable"
218,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79404495-suhail-ansari,2,The book presents itself as some of a major problem solver but the author Levitt just seems to be obsessed with the blacks and whites in most of the chapters. He just compares the data and tells you to make a decision out of that. However it was just another super-hyped book that just does not live up their expectations. Though I don't regret reading this book but I think it is not good as it seems.

231,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,2,"The short form of my recommendation is to watch the movie Freakonomics and skip the book. The ideas are the same in either place. My copy was under 240 pages and the style is kind of a gee wiz chatty with a touch of nerdy- so a fast read.When Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner first published Freakonomocs in 2005 it was widely promoted as breakthrough thinking and an important challenge to the common wisdom. I am not sure why I held off reading it because I was much impressed by the press and the interviews. Now, almost 13 years later it seems stale and hardly breakthrough. Since then there have been a number of other books based on the advantages of thinking from different perspectives and going beyond the common wisdom. It now seems that the very expression common wisdom is the kiss of death on any idea. We have all become so expert on everything that too many feel empowered to challenge as equals anyone who has actually studied and earned the right to publish on even the most esoteric topics.One major thing not addressed by the authors is the terrible way much of the product of science tends to be consumed. Two examples. Often opinions about research are based on second hand analysis of the paper under discussion. Hear this analysis from within our respective our respective echo champers, means starting from a position of bias, driven by the slant of the preferred media outlet. That the speaker has mis-read, or selectively read the paper has to be part of an individual’s analysis. Or better yet, read the paper in its original. What is most infuriating to me is the confusion over what is meant when a paper concludes that something tends to cause something else. If you know of one or fifty examples counter to the paper the paper is NOT necessarily wrong. What the author(s) proved was that within their data set the –this causes that - is likely true is for some statistically significant percentage of the total occurrences of that. Your counter examples may prove that the paper is wrong or just that you are more aware of the ‘That’s’ not related to a particular causative “This”.Back to the book. Much of what the authors have to say about crime was of particular interest to me. I am employed to provide support to some of the new creative policing strategies that grew out of NYPD’s COMSTAT Process. He never directly criticizes the approach but it can be oversold. The claim that is most famously made that readily available abortion has contributed to a fifteen year plus reduction, nationwide, in crime. I do not hear this claim given any discussion within the profession. Yet there is no agreement within the profession as to what does explain the decline. Not having any agreement on this side of the trend leaves us all exposed when this trend, like others makes its turn around.What I came to dislike was the short intros to each new chapter. All those paragraphs about how great and unique is Stephen Levitt. It all tends to read like so much P.R. If the man needs so much sell, why?The Section subtitled: Would a Roshanda by any Other Name Smell as Sweet? Brings us to the limits of Levitt’s approach. Early in the section he tells us of a number of studies that people with the same resume content and names that signal different ethic/racial backgrounds get different rates of acceptance into job interviews and Colleges. These are discounted because (1) they do not tell us if the bias was race based or based on the association with these names and economic/social conditions. The person seeking school entrance or a job, this is a distinction without a difference. Whatever the probabilities of a successful interview is in fact known. No interview means no job. The non-interview is a 100% certainty, the other merely an imponderable probability. Later there is a brief mention of studies that show lower long term outcomes for the people with the wrong names. Again why is less important than the fact these studies tend to reinforce the decisions made by the schools and employers. For the record, this reinforcement not based on the individual achievements of the individuals applicant. It is the association tied to the name.We may have needed Freakonomics in 2005. What we need in 2018 is reinforcement that facts do exist and take primacy over opinion."
232,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102773267-amal-abdulla,1,"Emily May half-killed the book for me. If it is as she says, that the numbers in a number book are manipulated to help prove points, then this cannot be any good. The authors of this book constantly ask the readers to question the incentives and it's drawers in any situation, and such serious allegations against the statements of this book as Emily may raises tempt the readers to question the incentives of the authors themselves. Reading through this book, I think their main incentive was to amaze the readers. Make them marvel. And you will be marveled and I am not saying this for every issue discussed here, but for many of them you are being fooled if you are not asking questions and demanding information but mindlessly consuming as eating chips while watching a football match.I, as an aspiring data analyst, is intrigued when anybody attempts to explain a cause with tons of data of previous similar occurings. I was fascinated by the book ""The Numbers game : Why everything you know about football is wrong"", because one, I am a fan of football, and two, numbers and data. And that book was all data. There were not many premises that you had to take the word of authors for situations. Everything started and ended with data. But coming to this book, Freakonomics, you can see it is ""rogue"",as claimed, even in the first chapter, because there is so less data in this for a data book. You have to depend on google if something appears indigestible, since there is no data to check. If you are not a ""data enthusiast"", then it may appear fine, but you are at least a vivid, attentive reader-truth seeker. You can't sit arms crossed if an author walks to the land of fiction in a non-fiction work, with the help of some 'data' to which you are not exposed.Above is only the least of my worries. When authors kind of confesses there is no theme for this book, you are kind of happy for you are a rogue. But they then goes on to address certain questions as chapters, and with each of such chapters you become less and less happy that this book doesn't have a theme. Let me explain. We have a question like, how are the test scores of student? We goes through all the reasons(that the authors had 'data' of, of course), and find that a student is more likely to score such and such if such and such happens. Question answered. But, what of the student as a person? More than once, the authors eagerly explains how a student is not affected by what the parents do, but by who they are. It hurts you when you use a lot of indices of teenager's life but only can say,that too not very convincingly, about a very weak index of his life, which has much more to do about who he is(Test Scores!Pfooo) It is mainly because they ditched the idea of a theme even for a chapter, and settled upon some easy questions.And..Oh No..We are not done yet. There is another important thing that you may overlook when you read. The causes and effects. See, the book doesn't look for a comprehensive 'effect' but only at a weak part of the effect, a question. But what may happen is, some reasons which are discarded as 'conventional wisdom' because it does not have an effect on the concerned 'question', may appear as unimportant for an idle reader. Many things parents 'do' are deemed as unimportant in the test scores of a student. Now, test scores is a question. It is a very weak part of an effect which is the life of the student. Now, when the authors argue that many things parents 'do' are inconsequential to the student's marks, the vibes a reader get is what all the parents 'do', it is inconsequential on the student's life. And it is never so.And many premises you can see are set up to amaze the reader, by offering a simple cause, very different from all the causes we can think of, for a tempting effect. But, in many of cases it is simply naive. When the authors argue that the money spent in a campaign does not really influence the number of votes, this book completely gave up on me. You see, when you are dealing data, you can't be shortsighted. You cannot merely see the effects something can make in the very next day. You cannot be blind and naive to go searching for causes in great grandfather's grave but not think of its effects years into the future. Coming from India, I have seen how money can be used to ignite people's sentiments not for the coming elections perhaps, but as a long term plan, to convert into votes. Money may not buy people directly. But money indeed buy things that buy people instead.Maybe readers will find many things that convinces in this book. There may be many pretty accurate cause and effect lines drawn too. Users may find things so amazing that they may later use it in speeches, conversations to amaze others. But for me, a data book has to be foolproof. No bullshits. A hole in a boat makes the whole boat unreliable. This book is a boat with just too many holes."

""Wait a second, what is that?""""What? Do you mean the satire? No? Oh, yes, that happens shortly, we're not up to that bit yet. Oh you mean that,"" Levitt's left head said smoothly, realising his friend was referring to the screen displaying the quote; it appeared on the huge screen in front of them, ""That, my friend, is the most brilliant discovery since the Improbability Drive itself!""""Oh wow,"" Dubner said, wide eyed, clearly not remotely sure he understood what his friend's left head was even talking about.""Oh no, you don't mean it's a--? Oh heaven help me,"" Marvin, the ultra intelligent but rather paranoid android said softly, off in a corner that Levitt's right head refused to acknowledge and who's left head gave a piercing, angry glare.""Yes, Dubner,"" Levitt's left head said, while his right head merely nodded sagely, ""That is indeed a non-random quotes generator from our insurpassable book Freakonomics right there.""""Dear God, when did we write a book?"" Dubner said, gazing into space. ""I thought you wrote one, and I merely championed it?""""Nonsense, dear Ludner,"" Levitt's right head, the economics genius with a boyish lisp, from the University of Chicago finally broke his silence. Unfortunately the right head was generally disinclined to speak, and instead his rather bothersome left head did most of the chatting. In fact, even if it would have made the prose rather more fraught with perilous danger of grammatical anomalies or less easy for a 'non-expert' to grasp (presumably the reason for Dubner's involvement), if Dubner hadn't been involved, then at least the book might have been a little less focused on Levitt's left head.""You know,"" Marvin said, ""Not that anyone listens to me anyway, but there is actually some occasional snippets of wisdom in this book.""""Oh shut up,"" Dubner said harshly, while Levitt's left head frowned petulantly at the robot, ""You're one of those 'experts' we make a point of deriding in this book, aren't you?""""Just saying,"" Marvin said, ""For once I thought I'd give you a compliment. That stuff about real estate agents not bothering as much for clients as for themselves, since the financial incentive wasn't there, was good. And then the end of the book was decent."" Marvin was on a roll. ""That stuff about names having an effect on life opportunities was really something. And then... Oh forget it,"" he muttered in the general direction of his metallic knees.
""The typical economist believes the world has not yet invented a problem that he cannot fix if given a free hand to design the proper incentive scheme.""
""Oh geez, Blundner, did we say that?"" Levitt's right head said.Suddenly the Improbability Drive activated. Improbability factor of 25,604 to 1 against!""Um, well, yes, we did say that...? Problem?"" Dubner said, determinedly ignoring the Improbability Drive.""OF COURSE WE SAID IT!"" Levitt's left head said, getting angry for no real reason.""Well,"" Levitt's right head said hesitantly, ""That implies that we just need sufficient incentive and people will learn to fly unaided... you know, just by flapping their arms. If we provide sufficient incentive of course.""""Don't be bloody ridiculous."" Levitt's left head retorted. ""You don't have a leg to stand on, a stupid comment like that. You're starting to sound like you think you're one of these pin-brained 'experts' we derisively referred to throughout this book.""
""'Experts' - from criminologists to real-estate agents - use their informational advantage to serve their own agenda.""
""Oh, hurrah for the 'economists' -- not so easily fooled,"" Marvin wallowed, before promptly turning himself off. It was trying enough merely existing, let alone being awake for the experience.
""That is, Candidate A today is likely to be similar to Candidate A two or four years hence. The same could be said for Candidate B. If only Candidate A ran against Candidate B in two consecutive elections but in each case spent different amounts of money. Then, with the candidates' appeal more or less constant, we could measure the money's impact.""
The Improbability Drive went crazy. Improbability factor 2,754,543 to 1 against! We are heading towards infinite improbability!""Dear lord, we didn't say that, did we?"" Levitt's right head said, ""Didn't we think about how much things almost invariably change between elections? A scandal here, a triumph there?""
""A player's trivia-answering ability is presumably the only worthwhile factor to consider [in The Weakest Link]; race, gender, and age wouldn't seem to matter. But do they? By measuring a contestant's actual votes against the votes that would truly best serve his self-interest, it's possible to tell if discrimination is at play.""
""Oh no,"" Levitt's right head seemed despondent, while his left went on nodding at the big screen with the quote on it. Levitt's right head pursued the point, ""We're assuming here that the contestants actually know what the optimum strategy is, that one can objectively determine who should be voted off the show... Oh never mind.""
""[Levitt] already had a million more riddles to solve than time to solve them.""
""Yes, yes,"" Dubner was saying, ""Did we ever get around to saying what a genius Levitt is?""""Of course you said that,"" Levitt's left head said hotly, while his right head merely blushed crimson, ""Why do you think we started the book with An Explanatory Note talking about me and my many wonders?""""Ohhhh, that's right.""
""As we suggested near the beginning of this book, if morality represents an ideal world, then economics represents the actual world.""
""Phew,"" Dubner said, clearly relieved the improbability factor was dropping.
""He [Levitt] was the guy, who, in the slapstick scene, sees all the engineers futzing with a broken machine - and then realizes that no one has thought to plug it in.""
Dubner was clearly moved. ""THAT'S MY MAN!"" he said, tears sparkling in his eyes.
""Be honest about your weaknesses. Has there ever been a prize-winning scholar as honest about his weaknesses as Steven Levitt? He doesn't understand economics, he claims, or math. He's a little thinker in a world of big thinkers. He can't even open a jar of spaghetti sauce at home, poor guy.""
""Dear Lord, who wrote that piece of crap?"" Levitt's left head asked of the room at large.""Truest thing in the book, I fear,"" Levitt's right head said without even a hint of an attempt to veil the despondency he was now feeling.The Improbability Drive had just about lost it, by this point.Suddenly a voice rang out from heaven.HUMANS! YOU CALL THIS A REVIEW? IS THIS SERIOUSLY MEANT TO BE A REVIEW OF THIS BOOK?""Of course not,"" Levitt's left head said irritably. ""It's clearly some nonsense written by someone who's had too much red wine. Frankly it's a disgrace.""A DISGRACE! WOW, YOU'RE NOT BACKWARDS ABOUT BEING FORWARD, ARE YOU, HUMAN?
""On the flip side, for me - and I think this is the thing that makes me an economist ultimately - I just can't get away from the idea that people are active decision makers trying to get what they want in a reasonably sophisticated fashion.""
DEAR LORD, the voice from above boomed, dripping so much with sarcasm that they all ended up drenched, IF ONLY PEOPLE OTHER THAN ECONOMISTS CONSIDERED THIS MIRACLE OF LOGICAL THINKING!""""Hmm, yes, I agree.

Dubner said, either missing the sarcasm, or, more likely, simply refusing to acknowledge its existence.The Improbability Drive had completely subsided.""Anyway, I'm glad I mentioned how horrible that restaurant in Manhattan was,"" Dubner said, just out of the blue.""You did WHAT?"" Levitt's right head asked.""Well, I couldn't bring myself to actually stand up to the waitress, so I decided I'd publish my complaint in full in the second edition of this bestselling book.""""THIS IS A BESTSELLING BOOK?!?!"" both of Levitt's heads asked at once.INFINITE IMPROBABILITY REACHED! the Improbability Drive reported cheerily.PS I highly recommend The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as a rather more enjoyable set of answers to the ultimate questions in life."
234,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74358199-miriam,4,"I read this for school for a several reasons. 1) It’s on the list of potential non-fiction books for my AP Lang students to read over the summer or for one of their quarterly books. 2) Every student of mine who chooses to read it tells me they like it and that it has opened their eyes to new ideas. 3) One of my teaching besties teaches it and loves it (shoutout to Katie). 4) I just bought another book by these authors, called Think Like a Freak, which I’m going to be using to help my AP Research students think about questioning at the beginning of the year next year. 5) It’s always been on my radar as a book I should read, but I never seemed to get to it because I thought it would be over my head (I was pretty terrible at Econ in college). I was happily surprised by how accessible it is. Even though I listened to it, which is not always the best learning mode for me, I was able to understand the whole thing, and I do feel more informed about various societal and worldly topics. I was even interested in most ideas covered here, which was another happy surprise. There are some instances in which the way the authors discuss race might not have aged well, but the overall message isn’t racist at all (at least, in my opinion, and I’m open to discussion about it). Regarding the audiobook: there are weird musical breaks at seemingly random times in the middle of each chapter, which serve no purpose other than, apparently, to break the listener’s concentration on what is being said, which I obviously did not appreciate. But one of the two authors reads it, and he does so very nicely. I feel good about keeping this on the AP Lang rec list, and it always helps when I’ve read the book one of my students is reading, so I’m glad I read this. I’m also excited to see how Think Like a Freak can help my AP Research kids explore topic ideas!"
235,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92934393-d-dyer,2,"So maybe I read this book a dozen years too late. The writing wasn’t particularly bad just completely unengaging and entirely to adoring of economist Steven Levitte. And while some of the questions asked were provoking the science wasn’t very good. Even as a layperson with a very basic understanding of economics I found myself poking holes in the legitimacy of the conclusions drawn here based not on any discomfort I may have felt with those conclusions but on potential problems with the data used. This is meant to be a bit of a pop science book and that’s fine, but it also needs to present solid scientific arguments and it doesn’t do that. I could forgive that if the writing were stellar or if I felt like the mind behind these conclusions was fascinating enough to deserve the fawning attitude that the author takes but I never really got the sense that he was or understood why the author felt so drawn to write a book collaborating with this particular economist and the writing is only OK. "
236,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6226405-yasiru,3,"(I originally rated this at two stars going by the Goodreads rating legend, but in case this is perceived to be less than an indifferent read, I've upped the rating to three.)Freakonomics was, to be honest, something of a disappointment.It starts off rather well with the sprightly and (it is claimed) unorthodox premise of applying economic principles (predominantly microeconomic) to sociology, and there are some good questions (and methods of resolving them) strewn through the book (the cheating and information imbalance (as perpetuated by experts) analyses for example, were a highlight), but some of the most important claims made seem perilously hopeful, and only the result of playing hard and fast with the statistics concerned (presumably the reason for the lack of detail).Two particularly cringe-worthy examples are slipshod extrapolations about how campaign spending makes little in the way of impact come voting time and the wholesale attribution of reduced crime rates to legalised abortion. In this latter case legal, cheap and widely available abortions may well have been a factor in stemming crime, but it seems deliberately overstated. The most important observation in the chapter is that which readers are warned they may be offended by (advice which for their sake I hope is ignored)- if one settles into a middle ground between the established pro-life and pro-choice camps (truth tending to lie on the difficult ground between extremes, as we often like to forget), one is able to value a newborn against some number of foetuses. Since the chance of a foetus eventually becoming a newborn is obviously non-zero, in the face of the resulting numbers (however small one may wish to push for, keeping in mind that a large number of abortions occur despite the widespread availability of more convenient means of birth control) it's difficult for those who believe a foetus and a newborn cannot be valued in the same way to muster up a counter. There's apparently a great deal of controversy regarding Levitt's claim, but it's no endorsement of abortion.See also the Roe effect.The Stetson Kennedy issue also has the whiff of poor research (however well told the story is) which undermines the alleged economic picture it attempts to paint.Numbers may not lie, but they can certainly be twisted about and freed of context to serve whatever untruth (intended or not) if our assumptions and manipulations aren't justified. It's well to remember, as the authors at times bring up, that economical analysis is just a portrait of the way things are (but crucially an informed and rigorous one utilising available data and refined methodologies). They may allow us to extrapolate trends and hence paths of lesser resistance, but a clear vision of how things ought to be (however difficult and untested the approaches to this may be) should precede this. Incentives are powerful, and a consideration of their consequences, side-effects and long-term outlook ought to be to facilitate what we intend in an 'economic' way.The writing style is clear, but sometimes ambiguous and devoid of detail. It was noted by another reviewer that Dubner sometimes seems sycophantic in his writing, and whether or not this impression is a fault (presumably of overzealous marketing), it is reminiscent of the rather oily 'learn from the guru' promotions characteristic of books claiming to uncover secrets to success or offer self-help advice (which tout the 'master' whenever they're no spouting pointlessly general fluff). It should be said then that the book stands well apart from such and is a case of a genuinely fascinating idea with reasonable presentation that is sometimes let down by too sensational extrapolations and loose research.For someone who wants a concise introduction to economics and economic thinking (more rigorously applied), I would rather suggest Economics: A Very Short Introduction and the wonderful Global Economic History: A Very Short Introduction. Beyond this, to actually get an idea of how the tools of economics work, there really is no away around the mathematics which authors of these popular accounts often like to disdain (even as they utilise it to whatever effectiveness). The best you can expect from a popular work like this beyond the morsels, titbits and tantalising glimmers of results thrown your way (from which conclusions are inferred on your behalf by the authors) is motivation and impetus to explore the discipline systematically and in greater depth or an around-the-edges appreciation for what it's about and a never too specific notion of how it works.(That said, access to data today is ubiquitous, and there are certain tools designed to allow a general feel for trends without too rigorous analysis. GapMinder is a good example.)The present work is certainly fascinating enough in the close to life issues it tries to tackle (sometimes with enthusiasm that disregards the necessary caution and qualifications). The lack of rigour can often be remedied (in that claims can be taken with a grain of salt) by due scrutiny- for instance, the relative importance of parents in a child's development does not take into account what may well be very significant differences in parenting practices across cultures.The exotic and the unexpected are doubly shocking when found colourlessly subsumed in the mundane, and there is always a sense of power in overthrowing reigning wisdom- these count for the great appeal here, and certainly make for an entertaining read."

So the book made some really startling comparisons of teachers to sumo wrestlers. I was really shocked and mystified at this comparison. What i really like about the book is that is is really clear and never uses big words to confuse us.The book first sets up this example and uses it to show that people can be use monetary benefits to overcome their guilt and moral conscious. It used statistics from an Israeli day care to show that people are more likely to be tardy to pick up their kids when they are fined. I also like how the author include very detailed analysis of the situation combined with research. For example, there was this experiment that involved control group and analysis of data over a progression of years which really showed how serious the problem is. They also mentioned the same problem in sumo. Sumo wrestlers who had a 7-7 win to lose ratio were suppose to win 49% but in reality winds 87% of their matches against higher level opponents. This is the reverse when they meet for a second time in a different tournament."

I don't really like to read about economics, but this book made it sound like a story. This is a non-fiction book, so I can't really find a theme, but as the title suggests, it talks about the hidden side of our world. I found out that a lot of things are surprisingly two-sided, and sometimes, people can misinterpret data. Anyways, a pretty good book that isn't what I normally read, but it's fun to step out of your comfort zone. There are a lot of facts and hard vocabulary, though, and I spent around 10 days reading it."

While the style of writing was disjointed (""unified"" as the authors prided themselves on creating) and was a little bothersome, and while the beginning was strong and the ending weaker and abrupt...the themes were a good food for thought about socioeconomics, society, and to a degree, human nature. Some takeaways: loved the how economics was described as the study of incentives, how your the name you're given isn't cause your outcomes (only indicators), how parenting doesn't necessarily determine how your kid will turn out because studies suggest how your kid will turn out is decided before they are born (re: parents and their level of income, education, etc).

But it also felt like it was an attempt by Dubner to kind of make a book for Real People about Levitt's more academic studies, some of which in this politically correct age (even though this book didn't come out that long ago) would raise some hackles. So, it's fun but ... Michael Lewis creates a better continuous narrative from similar data. "

244,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"Freakonomics. What is it?What is isn't, is an economics book. Which made me happy because I tend to bleed from the ears when I try to learn about economics. I've had people try to explain why it's such a good idea to invest my money, and when I wake up, everyone is gone and there's a leather-wrapped stick in my mouth. For some reason, this is something that I just can't get my head around. Probably because, as near as I can tell, economics is less a matter of science and more one of mass psychology. I mean, no one really *needs* Beanie Babies, but let me tell you, they were an economic juggernaut at World of Science. For a little while, anyway.This book is more about statistics than economics. It's about the statistics of conventional wisdom, looking at the things we all ""know"" are true. Like the more a parent is involved with their child's education, the better that child will do in school. Or the miraculous New York turnaround of the 90s - the plummeting crime rate and all that came with it - was singlehandedly engineered by Giuliani and whasshisname, the police commissioner. Or that while students will always find ways to cheat, the teachers are honest.The unifying theme of this book, even though the authors swear that there isn't one, is that numbers don't lie. Of course, that brings to my mind the old saw that there are three types of untruths in the world - lies, damn lies, and statistics. While I admit it looks like Levitt and Dubner have done exhaustive work in putting together this book, I always keep in mind that while the numbers may not lie, they don't tell you the truth either. Statistics have to be interpreted, and therein lies the potential for error.Still, if these guys were trying to massage the numbers to gain popularity, they did it in a really weird way. Mainly by trying to piss everybody off.The most well-known part of this book is where they propose that the nationwide drop in crime in the United States in the 1990s could be traced to the legalization of abortion in 1973. More abortions, they argue, leads to fewer unwanted children, children of poor, uneducated, single, and/or teenage mothers, who are statistically more inclined to turn to crime as they get older. The children, not the mothers. By allowing women to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, they effectively removed a group of potential criminals eighteen years in the future.This is, to understate a little, a controversial position to take on the issue. What leads me to think that they may be on to something is that, if they had wanted to be praised and lauded, they would have tweaked the numbers to give any other possible explanation. They even went so far as to do a hypothetical cost/benefit analysis on abortions versus homicides, setting the rate of 100 fetuses=1 baby, which they admitted would probably enrage or disgust most people. But hey, thought experiments are fun!Another unpopular conclusion that they come to is about parenting. How important is parental involvement in a child's school performance and success? Their conclusion - not very. They were lucky enough to have detailed data about students and parents from a study done by the US Department of Education. This data included vital statistics on the families, as well as interview questions about home and family life, discipline and reward. Levitt and Dubner got the data, which was huge, and then asked questions. Do the parents speak English in the home? Did they recently move to a better neighborhood? Did the child go to Head Start? Did the parents read to the children? Did the child's home have a lot of books? Were the parents in the PTA? Did the parents have a higher socioeconomic background? And so on....Their conclusion was that while parental involvement certainly isn't a bad thing, and bad parents are certainly able to make a child's life worse, it's not the key to success that many people think. A great many of the factors that determine a child's success or failure are determined long before the child is even born, and lie with choices the parents make before they even consider having a child.This ought to piss off the ""helicopter parents,"" whose kids are now reaching college age unable to make decisions about their lives without texting Mom....Anyway, they make a lot of very brave statements in this book. Like I said, every time someone says, ""Statistics show,"" I think you should count the silverware, but these guys seem to have solid work. I say ""seem to have"" because I took exactly one class in statistics in college (it was required for the PoliSci major) and all I remember of it is that the teacher was a mumbly guy with a mustache, and the final project involved telling the computer to fetch some data and process it, and handing in whatever it was the computer spit out. So I'm far from qualified to judge how on-point the conclusions in this book are. I don't know the truth, but I know the truthiness - if they wanted to lie, they would have made their lies more pleasant.Regardless, it's a quick and entertaining read. I finished it in less than twelve hours, and that's on a work day...."

What attracted me to this book is not the catchy name or the ""A Rogue Economist..."" title. It was recommended to me, a BSc student, by a few of my other Science friends. In our discussions about Arts subjects, we would talk about how essential it is for us to know economics. But it is so hard to keep your concentration when there is such few numbers on the paper. What this book did was capture the true essence of economics and give it to the reader in the most capturing narrative. I probably wouldn't have understood the implications of ""information asymmetry"" which when googled gives: ""In contract theory and economics, information asymmetry deals with the study of decisions in transactions where one party has more or better information than the other."" Instead of giving us this yawn-inducing definition, Levitt talks about the Ku Klux Klan and the similarities it has with Real estate agents...telling the reader a story with facts and figures and finally the manifestation of ""Information Asymmetry"" in our daily lives."

It is certainly safer to keep a child in the rear seat than sitting on a lap in the front seat, where in the event of an accident he essentially becomes a projectile. But the safety to be gained here is from preventing the kids from riding shotgun, not from strapping them into a $200 car seat."" Obviously car seats are still important and are safer for the child than not using one; the author was just pointing out that they weren't the main factor in decreasing the number of child deaths in car accidents. And it isn't airbags, either. ""Fewer than five young children a year have been killed by airbags since their introduction."" -School choice in Chicago study: Statistically, the students gained no academic benefit by going to a ""better"" school.

256,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18710672-archit,4,"Freakonomics is a non-fiction book written by a young economist and John Bates Clark medal winner Steven D. Levitt and his journalist friend Stephen J. Dubner.Stephen J. Dubner, a New York Times journalist, was doing some research on psychology of money. As a part of this research he was interviewing many economists. During one of these interviews he met Steven Levitt. Dubner realized that Levitt was different. Unlike his peers who were mainly interested in monetary issues – inflation, deflation, tax policy etc. - and rarely spoke in English while answering , Levitt’s interests were crime, corruption, cheating and he had a knack for explaining things. The interview went quite well. Later they published some articles in New York Times and they were an instant hit among the readers. Later on, acting on the advice of publishers the two agreed to write a book – Freakonomics.Freakonomics is unlike any other book. In most of the books, various chapters are written to arrive at a conclusion or support a theory that writer believes in. These books have a unifying theme. Freakonomics however has no such theme. It is simply a collection of riddles from Levitt’s wide areas of interests – crime, corruption, cheating.What makes the book most interesting is Levitt’s ability to ask interesting questions (and I will admit that some of them sound quite absurd when you first hear them).Each chapter starts with a question. And then starts a journey (narrated by co-author Stephen J. Dubner) featuring Levitt as a curious explorer, sifting through a pile of data, flipping and turning things over, using a explorer’s paraphernalia (here, tools of economics such as regression analysis) in his quest for answer. And this answer more often than not surprises everyone, perhaps even Levitt himself.One chapter in the book that I enjoyed reading more than any other chapter was- “Why Do Drug Dealers Still Live with Their Moms”? In 1990s when crack cocaine arrived in America the drug dealers were often shown by the media as people with most fancy cars, and houses in posh areas of the city (which was true). The media portrayed crack dealing as one of the most lucrative jobs in America. But if one spent a little time around the housing projects where crack was actually sold he might realize that not only most of the crack dealers lived in the housing projects but most of them still lived with their moms. Why is that? To answer this question we need a lot of data about crack dealing business. This data was collected by a University of Chicago student- Sudhir Venkatesh as a part of his research while pursuing a PhD in sociology. Later he was awarded a three year stay at the Harvard’s Society of Fellows. There he met Levitt who at that time had crime topping his list of offbeat micro-curiosities. Venkatesh agreed to share his research with Levitt and the two decided to collaborate on a paper. According to Levitt’s analysis of Venkatesh’s research (that involved data about a crack selling gang- Black Disciple) - the hierarchy of Black Disciple gang is divided into four levels. At the lowest level were foot soldiers who sold the crack on streets. Above them were three officers. Their job was to ensure gang members’ safety, to watch over gang’s liquid assets, and transport large quantities of drugs and money to and from the supplier. Above officers was gang leader and above them were board of directors (twenty in case of Black Disciples). Gang leader had to pay 20 percent of his revenue to the board of directors for the right to sell crack in a designated twelve-square-block area. According to Levitt’s calculations the salary of each board of director was about $500,000 a year. Gang leader’s salary was about $100,000 a year. Officers earned about $700 a month or $7 an hour and foot soldiers earned a meager $3.30 an hour, less than minimum wages. So the answer to the original question- if drug dealers make so much money why do they still live with their moms? - is that, except for the top cats, they don’t make much money. They had no choice but to live with their mothers. The book is filled with interesting questions like the one mentioned above. Throughout the book the writer has included several anecdotes and also some revealing data to reach an answer. All these elements combined make you keep reading it till the last page. "
257,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Funny, provocative and very readableThis is an excellent, very readable book by a couple of guys who like to go against the grain.Steven D. Levitt is the economist who teaches at the prestigious University of Chicago school of economics, and Stephen J. Dubner is the talented wordsmith. They come off a little on the self-satisfied side here, but who can blame them? They have a surprise best seller in a new edition.What really powered this book to national attention was their argument that the sharp nation-wide drop in crime starting in about 1990 was not due so much to having more cops on the beat, or smarter, better policing, or to having so many criminals in prison--as most of us thought--but instead the reason the crime rate dropped is that Roe v. Wade became the law of the land in 1973!Arguments about this unintended (to say the least) consequence of making abortion legal raged as soon as this book hit the stores (or maybe before) and are raging still. Personally, put me down among those who find the argument persuasive. But I don't want to rehash all that now. Instead let me point to some other topics in the book.Most interesting is the chapter entitled ""Why Do Drug Dealers Still Live with Their Moms?"" The authors tell the story of Sudhir Venkatesh who was working on a PhD in sociology at the University of Chicago. He was sent to do some sociology in Chicago's poorest black neighborhoods and ended up spending several years learning about the crack business at the street level complete with--oh, how the economists loved this!--spiral notebooks with four years worth of the crack gang's financial transactions. Venkatesh discovered that the gang worked a lot like ""most American businesses, actually, though perhaps none more so than McDonald's."" (p. 89) The drug dealers still lived at home with their moms because most of them were making less than minimum wage. Why do a dangerous job for such low pay? Answer: like basketball dreams, the upside potential and the glamour of it! The middle level manager, ""J.T.,"" a university educated dude, was making tax-free about $100,000 a year while the gang board of directors each earned about half a mil per. After J.T. reached his level of incompetence as a member of the board of directors, the gang got busted and he went to jail.Also fascinating is the information on the socioeconomic and racial status of parents as revealed by their choices in first names for their children. Whitest girls names: Molly, Amy, Claire, Emily... Blackest girls names, Imani, Ebony, Shanice, Aaliyah, Precious... Most common names given to girls of high-education parents: Katherine, Emma, Alexandra, Julia... Boys: Benjamin, Samuel, Alexander, John, William... Low education boys names: Cody, Travis, Brandon, Justin...But it'll change, as Messrs. Levitt and Dubner explain. Names go in and out of fashion and sometimes come back in. ""Susan"" was the most popular girls name in 1960. It didn't make the top ten in 2000. ""Emily"" led the list followed by Hannah, Madison, Sarah...Interesting is the tale of Robert Lane who named one of his kids ""Winner"" and another ""Loser."" Winner Lane went on to become one of life's losers, and Loser Lane (called ""Lou"" by his friends) graduated from Lafayette College, Pa. and went on to become a police sergeant in New York City. So much for the effect of names--or maybe it's like ""a boy named Sue"": you overcome your name or you fail to live up to it.There's a chapter on parenting that also raised some eyebrows, but again I think our clever authors got it right. Basically parenting skills are overrated. What really counts is who your parents are, not so much whether they read a lot to you or bought you Einstein tapes or even if they sent you to Head Start. In the ""nature vs. nurture"" debate, clearly nature is in the ascendancy.This, the revised and expanded edition contains a New York Times Magazine article about Levitt written by Dubner before this collaboration, seven columns from the New York Time Magazine, and some entries from the Freakonomics blog on the Web.Bottom line: an irresistible read and a book biz phenomenon. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
258,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59755093-ha-thu,4,"This is a book contains lots of anecdote of unexpected and contrary between the ""conventional wisdom"" and ""the truth"".I read super-freakonomics first, and enjoyed it more, but this is also an easy reading, entertaining, suitable for any regular reading circumstance. I powered through this book on an 40 minutes commute train in about 5 days.Along side with other books on statistic theme, this book inspired us to look closely for every hidden sides that data can reveals.What I got out from those un-unified theme anecdotes is not to believe easily in what you are told, even by those who are considered ""experts"" in the fields. Always question, test (if possible), and question the incentives of the ones who provide the information against your incentives. Are they different or are they in common, if yes then in what level? SCHOOL TEACHER, SUMO WRESTLER CHEATSSince Chicago Public Schools, a system that educates 400,000 students each year embraced high-stakes testing in 1996, it changed the incentives that teacher now have reason to cheat because student test result affects to his teacher rewardCheating teachers could be detected by using algorithm analyzing student performance.A cheating teacher tends to be younger and less qualified than average.It was the teachers in the lowest-scoring classrooms who were most likely to cheat.Sumo wrestler on the other hand, also cheat.A wrestler's ranking is based on his performance in the elite tournaments that are held 6 times a year, fifteen bouts per tournament. If he finish the tournament with winning record (8 victories or more), his rank will rise. The eighth victory in any tournament is therefore critical.Data reveals that, when look at a 7-7 (7 winnings, 7 losings) against a 8-6 or 9-5 wrestler, the actual winning percentage of the 7-7 wrestler is far more that that of predicted percentage (80% to 48%). Results of rematch between the same wrestlers went back to normal predicted percentage.It seems that the Sumo - the most prestigious ritual sport of Japanese also has match rigging.THE KU KLUX KLAN, THE REAL ESTATE AGENTS AND INFORMATION ASSYMETRYThe Ku Klux Klan - a group of conservative white American in late 19th century was a group whose power was derived in large part from the fact that it hoarded information. When Stetson Kenedy, an anti-fan tried to public the group's secrets, much of the group's advantage disappears.It is common for one party to a transaction to have better information than another party. In economics, such a case is known for information assymetry. But information asymmetry everywhere have in face been gravely wounded by the Internet. Expert in all fields always try to keep information asymmetry as asymmetrical as possible. They abuse information all the time with their client's fear. In the case of housing transaction, a real-estate agent do not have the same incentives with the house seller.A study found that when selling his own houses, an agent keep her own house on the market an average ten extra days, sell them for over 3 percent more that when he sell others' houses.The problem is that the agent only stands to personal gain an addition $150 by selling others' house for $10,000 more, which isn't much reward for a lot of extra work.The agent's main weapon: the conversion of information asymmetry into fear.DISCRIMINATION CHANGED, NOT ENDEDDiscrimination against certain groups has become unfashionable because people take pains to at least appear fair-minded, at least in public. This hardly means that discrimination itself has ended, only people are embarrassed to show it.The 'Weakest link' game show date showed two types of discrimination: taste-based discrimination against the elderly and information-based discrimination against the LatinosPEOPLE LIE ON DATING WEBSITESData mining on people's ads and the level of response gleaned by any particular ad has shown that people often lies on dating website.They are a lot richer, taller, skinnier, better-looking than average.Most impressively, fully 72% of the women claimed ""above average"", including 24% of ""very good looks"". 68% of the men call themselves ""above average"", including 19% of ""very good looks"". This leaves of about 30% of the user with ""average"" look. 28% of the women on the site said they were blond, a number far beyond the national average. Those indicates the typical online dater is either fabulist, or narcissist, or resistant to the meaning of ""average"".People include a photo on his profile do better on online dating.Race are declared to be no matter, but in fact it actually matters.Haft of white women and 80% of white men on the site said race didn't matter to them. But the response data showed that 90% of those men's email goes to white women, 97% of those women's email goes to white men.CONVENTIONAL WISDOMThe conventional wisdom is convenient, comfortable - though not necessarily true.Advertising is a brilliant tool for creating conventional wisdom.WHY DO DRUG DEALERS STILL LIVE WITH THEIR MOMS?Sudhir Venkatesh's research has shown that a crack cocaine gang work a lot like most America businesses with a director board, a CEO leader on each branch franchise, lots of employee known as 'foot soldier'. The top 120 men in the gang represented just 2.2% off the gang membership, bit took more than half of the money. A foot soldier earned just $3.3 an hour. They have no choice but to live with their mothers.The reason that they still took the low pay, dangerous job of cocaine dealing is the same with a girl who want to be a Hollywood movie star. They all want to be succeed in an extremely competitive field. Immutable law of labor: when there are a lot of people willing and able to do a job, that job generally doesn't pay well.----------------------------------CRIMINAL RATECriminal rate reached its peak in US in 1990, risen 80% after 15 years of increasing. It began to fall in early 1990s.Many experts tried to explain the crime-drop due to innovative policing strategies or tougher gun controls, strong economy etc.. but little touched the truth.*Strong economy do not explain the phenomenon because it only the case for direct financial motivated crime, as opposed to many others more. In the 1960s, when the economy went on a wild growth, as did violent crime.*Increased reliance on prisons did attribute to the drop. The evidence linking the increased punishment with lower crime rates is very strong/In the 1960s, for fear of sounding racist (since African-Americans and Hispanic commit a disproportionate share of felonies), politicians were growing softer on the crime. But between the 1980 and 2000, the political turmoil curtailed. There was a x5 increase in the number of people sent to prison on drug charge. *The increased use of capital punishment did not help drive down the crime because of its rarity and the difference paper charge and real executions.*The increased number of police relates to the crime drop. In the months leading up to the Election Day, incumbent mayors routinely try to lock up the law-and-order vote by hiring more police, even when the crime rate is standing still. So by comparing the crime rate in one set of cities that recently had an election and those didn't shows the extra police actually lowered the crime rate*Innovative policing strategies in NYC which were largely considered contributed to stop crime, on the other hand hardly related. First, the crime in NY had already fallen before any strategies started. Second, crime went down everywhere during 1990s, not only in NY.*Tougher gun laws do not explain crime Gun raises a complex set of issues that change according to one factor: whose hand happens to be holding the gun.There are more gun in the US more than the adult population.2/3 of US homicides involve a gunThe most famous gun-control law is the Brandy Act passed in 1993, which requires a criminal check and a waiting period before a person can purchase a gun. But this act has proven to be practical impotent in lowering crime because regulation of a legal market is bound to fail when a healthy black market exists for the same product.*Changes in crack market did relate to the crime drop. The reason is not that the crack itself went away, but the price of cocaine had been falling for years, and it got only cheaper as crack grew more popular. Internal wars between crack dealer gangs got fewer because the market had lost it allure. It was no longer worth killing someone, or being killed.*Over all, the 1973 Roe v Wade abortion legalization is proven to be the main cause of 1990s crime drop. Women seek for abortion typically would give birth to children more likely to have a criminal future. Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness, unwantedness leads to high crime; legalized abortion, therefore, led to less crime. The Cohort that would had made the crime in 1990s wasn't born in the first place. POOLS ARE MORE DANGEROUS TO CHILDREN THAN GUNSThe likelihood that a child killed by drowning in the pool in 1 in 11,000 versus death by gun is 1 in 1 million plus.FLYING AND DRIVINGThe per hous death rate of driving versus flying is about equalSCHOOL CHOICE DO NOT MATTER Statisticaly, those who won the school choice lottery and went to better school did not show any difference in performance compared to those who didn't. What this means is that students and parents who choose to opt out tend to be smarter and more academic motivated to begin with.BLACK AN WHITE GAP IN SCHOOL.A typical white child attends school that is only 6% black. The typical black child meanwhile attends a school that is about 60% black.Black schools and white schools are similar in terms of traditional measures such as class size, teacher's education ect.. But they have a far higher rate of troublsome indicators such as gang problems, lack of funding. This lead to poorer performance in black schools' student - not only the black, bu t also the white, compared to white schools' PARENT'S INFLUENCE ON CHILDREN SCHOOL PERFORMANCEa wide ranging data set offered that who parent are (parents who are educated, sucessful, and healthy) related to their childen's outcomes. Things that parents do doesn't seem to much matter CHILDREN NAMING AND THE NAMING EFFECTThe data showed the black-white gap in naming their children to be a recent phenomenon.More remarkably, nearly 30% of the black girls are given a name that is unique among the names of every baby, white and black born that year in CAIn an audit study, the resume with 'white names' have always gleaned more job interviews.There is also correlation between a baby's name and the parents' socioeconomic statusBy comparing popular names in the past up to present, data indicates that popular names in a certain community could cycle in and out of use. Once a name catches on among high-income, highly educated parents, it starts working its way down the socioeconomic ladder and eventually falls out o the rotation entirely."

Maybe it would have been better received (...by me) if I'd read it when it was first published, but a lot of the stuff that the authors seemed so smug about sharing really didn't strike me as that groundbreaking or creative. There were some interesting stories that might have gone down better if a different author had written them. And for people whose sense of superiority seems to stem mostly from how they think so differently from everyone else, there sure is a lot of conclusion-jumping taking place.If I sound harsh, it's mostly because the overall tone of the book rubbed me the wrong way and snarky skepticism is my knee-jerk reaction to feeling patronized, not because this was the worst book I've ever read or anything. There's a lot to recommend, it just wasn't my cup of tea."
260,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,3,"In Freakonomics Levitt and Dubner devote their time to looking at the hidden side of everything. They do this by challenging conventional wisdom and seeking out unusual similarities. At times, it makes for striking reading.For example, it turns out that economists can find a similarity between the business model of McDonald's and an inner-city gang selling crack. I was a little disappointed that this chapter was called ""Why Do Drug Dealers Still Live with Their Moms?"" The other chapters focus on the similarities found, which is reflected in titles like ""How is the Ku Klux Klan Like a Group of Real-Estate Agents?"" It's a catchy title, but I found myself thinking that most people would find a less offensive way of discussing real-estate agents.The title that annoyed me the most was ""What do Schoolteachers and Sumo Wrestlers Have in Common?"" Apparently, they, like anyone else in a certain situations, will cheat. A more interesting chapter might have focused on the difference between why school teachers and sumo wrestlers choose to cheat. School teachers in the USA have reported being told that they should cheat on standardized tests by their administrators -- at least if they want to keep their jobs and their schools open. These tests do not predict anything except how a student will predict on that specific test. Freakonomics actually discusses factors that lead to high standardized test scores, and it finds that things like socioeconomic status play a major role. In fact, teachers account for 10 to 20% of a standardized test score. The authors might at this point take the time to point out that people cheat when they feel they have no legitimate alternative, but they don't bother.Of course, Levitt and Dubner are not really all that concerned with policy or even with anything beyond the statistic. They just want to show off the power of economics -- it's not so dismal if viewed properly. They introduce fancy stats to capture our attention, distinguish between causation and correlation, and make economics seem like a pretty cool subject. And for the most part, it makes for great reading. In fact, I read Freakonomis over a few hours. What's disappointing about this lite reading is that these statistics do require careful interpretation, but the breezy nature of this book makes that, at best, optional. Sometimes, this careful interpretation is optional for both the reader and the writer. The case of the hidden racism supposedly revealed in online dating websites is confirmed when white clients interact with other whites 90% of the time. This does not take into account he demographics of the people using the site or even the location of the people using the website. Or if it does, Levitt and Dubnar don't bother to mention it.Worse, statistical analysis actually has a great deal of influence right now, so I often found myself thinking that a less frivolous approach and a less joyful tone would have been more appropriate. Perhaps the best example of this frivolity was the chapter on crime rates. Although Levitt and Dubner talk about the universality of incentives, it turns out that the most effective way to reduce crime is through abortion. Beyond that, there are no incentives to save juvenile offenders in the aggregate. This should be a sobering thought, but nothing Freakonomics offers is sobering to its authors. Although they try to warn that their statistics are disturbing, I never sensed any actual or sincere concern from the authors, which is great for science and analysis but disturbing in a popular work.Which is why I eventually found myself thinking of Homer Simpson's great statement about statistics: ""statistics can be used to prove anything. 14% of all people know that."" And let's not forget Uncle Ben's advice, ""with great power comes great responsibility."" Ultimately, Freakonomics is a diverting read, but I am not inclined to take it as the final word on any subject discussed in the book."
261,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clouther,3,"This book deals a lot with the causes of crime (with regards to abortion, bagels, crack dealing, and guns ) cheating (in education, real estate, and um, sumo wrestling), and the prevalence of racism.The thing that I like about this book is that it relies on data for it arguments on cause and effect in public policy with little to no regard for whether the results happen to align with liberal or conservative ideologies. For years I've argued that our political parties are a mish-mosh of beliefs that don't necessarily fit together in any logical way.There are a number of things I don't like about this book: 1) It explains some general statistics and regression analysis only towards the end of the book, even though a lot of the data referenced in the book depends on an understanding of this. When they finally explain correlation, even where their isn't a relationship of causation, the authors offer a number of guesses about why the two factors are correlated. Can we do better than guesses? Also these correlation guesses also seem to bias the reader.2) For those of us who do have some understanding of statistics and studies, the authors don't provide enough information about the studies and data to let us decide for ourselves how accurate the data, or how rigorous the studies are. This despite the fact that the authors talk at length about inaccurate causes from other sources.3) Because the book jumps around between topics with ""no unifying theme"" as the authors claim, there is no real deep examination of any issue that allows the reader to form a fully informed thought on an issue. Certainly I'm more interested in the causes of crime now, but I don't particularly have a handle on all the available information or applications of the information. For example, on the issue of guns, the writers present a number of interesting points. Gun ownership in Switzerland is high and they don't have as high a crime rate so ""guns don't cause crime."" Okay, but do guns cause more death? Why isn't there a comparison with Japan which has no guns, but still has crime- and compare how many crimes result in death? Data divorced of real context is pretty useless. Unfortunately the book jumps around too much to provide adequate context and data for any of the issues it discusses.4) I understand that morality is not the job of economists but at the same time some application of some moral system is necessary when examining these issues. A number of time the writers joke that a sufficiently high disincentive would cure the problem. For example, if you want to cure bagel theft, you could consistently apply the death penalty. (I'm not sure if this was an actual example in the book but it's close.) Of course the writers are joking! Sort of. They're not joking that would work but they concede that it's out of bounds for most politicians. This leaves the reader unmoored in the very real world of their statistics of cause and effect. It's not enough to say that ""some Americans are uncomfortable with number of citizens"" in jail, but to apply a real analysis to applying the solutions of imprisonment instead of increasing education, opportunity, and quality of life. Instead the writers seem to dash those off by negating the effects of an improved economy. Is it possible that the gains of a good economy are not affecting all equally for example? Likewise, the emphasis the writers place on abortion is not in any way balanced by the same exploration of increased opportunities, contraception, education, or even incentives to put babies up for adoption for disadvantaged populations.I get it, data is king. I'm a believer. But failing to paint a complete portrait of the issues results in the partial data. This partial data can be just as misleading as the absence of data. By focusing on one problem at a time and considering all the related issues and data for thinking about the problem holistically the writers might help clarify thought rather than just further confusing it.Still 4 stars."
262,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42618312-saket-nihal,4,"A fast paced book which can disrupt the way one thinks and reasons casual events. The duo, Stevn D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, does a great job in keeping the readers hooked to the book while the reader experiences an ""aha"" moment on every third page. Though, the number of back referencing will require you to stay on your toes throughout the book, its a must read for those who want to sit tight and take a dive in a rogue economist's pursuit of unveiling the hidden side of everything."
263,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8000487-simon-a,2,"This is a book of 'popular economics'. It reads well, it is enjoyable, but with little depth. I enjoyed reading the first pages and chapters but less and less as the book went on. Through various real life examples from the USA, the book tells us to look beyond the direct apparent relations between socio-economical observations, and to be critical about the assumptions that we hear in the media from ""the experts"" to explain those relations."

265,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716255-andrew-breslin,4,"One of the most popular misconceptions about economics is that it’s all about money. Sure, money is involved, but it’s no more “about” money than algebra is “about” lower-case letters. Economics is about how people respond to incentives. You learn this when you open an introductory economics textbook to page one and read that page. No, that’s the title page. You can skip that. And the forward and introduction to the 5th edition. The pages with roman numerals at the bottom don’t count. Just jump ahead to Chapter One. It’s probably titled: “People Respond to Incentives.” Sadly, a lot of people who have strong opinions on matters of economics have never opened an economics textbook. Many of them have recently been elected to Congress. Levitt claims not to be very good at mathematics. I suspect he is just being humble, or perhaps is appealing to the growing culture of ignorance, which reacts violently to intellectualism and believes that real-world questions can best be answered by consulting ancient scripture, rather than, for example, linear-regression analysis. He has an uncanny ability to examine raw data and use mathematical approaches to pull more information from that data than meets the untrained eye. He also has enough testicular fortitude to state his results, regardless of the fact that truth has never been very popular. If uncomfortable truth and appealing bullshit were running for class president, truth would never stand a chance, nor would it ever get to nail that cheerleader in the front row of its history class.  I’m continually amazed by the number of people who simply reject empiricism, though perhaps this shouldn’t be too surprising, as I’d be willing to wager that a majority of Americans don’t know what that word means. It’s astounding how unconventional a notion it is that if you want to figure out how the world works, the best approach is to actually observe the world. Or several worlds. Galileo rejected accepted dogma about planetary motion based on the then (as now) radical notion that the way to understand reality is to observe it, and then do math. His critics nearly burned him at the stake. Levitt and Dubner fared better, and had to endure a few negative reviews and a litany of comments on their blog, which, though short on reasoning and shorter on math, did at least make up for it with an abundance of exclamation points. Galileo also contested Aristotle’s assertion that objects fall to the earth at rates proportionate to their masses, a premise accepted for nearly two millennia because, in all that time, nobody bothered to check. He accomplished this by a disarmingly simple experiment: He dropped two different objects off a tower and watched them fall. He didn’t even need to do any math, although he probably did anyway, just for fun.Levitt strikes me as a modern-day Galileo, rejecting accepted ideas based on untested but widely accepted theories in favor of actually looking at the data. And, like Galileo, he’s pissed a lot of people off. Oftentimes, he simultaneously pisses off groups of people who are traditionally pissed off at one another, a rare and commendable accomplishment I aspire to emulate. Whether this is because I am truly in pursuit of truth regardless of popularity, or because I just like pissing people off is a subject of extensive personal speculation. In seeking an answer, I should probably dispassionately examine the empirical evidence and use mathematical tools to discern and quantify my response to incentives. Alternately I can just accept without evidence the answer that makes me happy and convince myself that it’s true as long as I believe it strongly enough. And then maybe I’ll run for Congress.  "
266,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/518434-meera,3,"On my regular weekend trip to Crossword one Sunday I picked up this book that had an interesting title ‘Freakonomics’ and was on the list of Sriram Recommends. Since I usually tend to judge the book by its cover as the saying goes, I generally put my faith in the books on Sriram’s list of ‘must reads or money back’. On hindsight this method has proven to be quite a safe bet for me. I absolutely hate to invest time and money in a book that will not provide value to me and by that I don’t mean a collectors edition. Cut to the chase, Freakonomics (Authors Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner) turned out to be quite an interesting pick unlike an economics discourse would generally read. I recommend this book to anyone who is open to having their pre-conceived, conventional notions of ‘How the World Works’ turned upside down and inside out. Steven D. Levitt's (a non-conventional economist, a Harvard undergrad, a PhD from MIT and a John Bates Clark Medal recipient (awarded every two years to the best American economist under 40) Freakonomics is a compilation of unrelated topics and questions with Levitt’s kind of empirically derived answers to them. Levitt does not provide readers with humongous sets of data, which would serve no purpose whatsoever other than to attempt to confuse an already confused common populace. Nor does he rant off various profound economic theories. After all if not for theories dipped in obscurity how would we know a great mind from the rest of the… well not so great minds. No offense to the great minds here, really. Levitt very simply compiles the data, wonders what is it that he should be looking at thereby cutting to the heart of all the numbers, identifies a trend and voila, he has the answers. From exploring the commonality between schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers to discovering that cheating to lose is worse than cheating to win. From understanding that incentives are really a trade-off that needs to be balanced especially when faced with morality to the Chicago Public School teachers and University of Georgia professors’ cheating expose that put a question mark on the noble profession of teaching. Freakonomics is a repertory of an ingenious economist’s answers to seemingly uncomplicated stuff and riddles of everyday life. The most intriguing of all his findings was the real reason behind the drop in crime rates in the late 1990’s in America. What would you attribute to an astounding decline in crime rate, when criminologists, political scientists and the administrators of the country had all predicted an enormous crime wave to hit the country? A roaring economy maybe. Or a new gun control law or more effective methods of policing maybe. Sounds logical and that’s what the great minds would like us to believe. But would you believe it, the most powerful factor, which had taken shape 2 decades ago, was legalized abortion. This and many more like the racial connection or rather the absence of it in the career prospects of two young men named Jake and DeShawn. Or that it is in human nature to cheat, especially so when a person rises higher up in an organization. All in all, this book is a light read, devoid of any complexities. For a change in a curiously simple style, Freakonomics exposes us to some interesting realities of our world. Definitely worth reading… Well this was my review of the book. In case any of you have read the book I would love to hear what you have to say about it."
267,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36823521-anurag,3,"Ever tried to read a book of economics but found it to be full of jargon, full of equations and terms not so familiar to a layman? if not, then read a book like The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money by John Maynard Keynes. You will find how difficult it can be to read an economics books for someone who does not has economics background. Ever thought that sociological or criminology incidents can be explained using economic principles? Ever thought that economics can be blended with Pop-culture? Well, Freakonomics is the answer. Written by Steven Levitt, a professor of economics at University of Chicago, in collaboration with Stephen J. Dubner, a journalist, Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything is an interesting read. What makes this book stand apart from other books on similar topic is the interesting approach to data and statistics. Levitt uses data and data analyzing tools to reach conclusions which would not have been possible by simply analyzing social behavior and sometimes the results are contrary to what is considered norm and accepted in society. His work is mostly in the area of crime, social behavior and economics of incentives. These incentives can be financial, social or moral. The topics which Levitt and Dubner discussed in Freakonomics are not considered strictly topics of economics but they fall more into the area of sociology. To illustrate the theme of the book let us consider one of the examples. In this book authors discussed how instances of cheating by the teachers of Illinois public school system increased. This happened because the incentives were increased for the teachers if their students performed well in the respective subjects. After analysis of years of data, authors reach to the conclusion that cheating peaked in 1996 and it made sense also because teachers were paid more for the inflamed but empty performance of the students. In the same category he also puts the sumo fighters of Japan who lost the matches intentionally so that most of the fighters stand as gainers. This created a controversy and investigations were ordered into sumo fighting championships. Another example which created controversy was the correlation between abortion and crime. Authors argued that Legalization of abortion in 1973 led to reduction of crime in 1992 because youths between 18 to 24 are most vulnerable to crime. The arguments they put forward was that those parents who did not take care well of their children had their children more likely to become criminals keeping in mind other factors like less average income which will play its role in proper bringing up of the children. This resulted in a series of rebuttals and rebuttals of rebuttals by the big names of economics. Read this book for an insight on social problems and what data says about them. Other problems mentioned in the book such as Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and working of real estate brokerage industry are also good arguments by the authors. What is true about most of the topics is that we can give counter arguments and so the debate will go on. Encouraged by the success of this book, authors have released a film in 2010 and then second part of the book named SuperFreakonomics. Do not expect to gain understanding of any path-breaking economic theory, this is just a pop approach to economics. Originally posted at:http://www.yayawar.in/2015/01/book-re..."

Similarly, Freakonomics proudly makes the proclamation that it has no unifying theme. However, in reality, it is a book whose unifying theme is that it takes data to make objective conclusions on several touchy social issues.Unfortunately, the book tries a little too hard to fulfill it's proclamation of no theme by jumbling together many disparate subjects into a single chapter and making tenuous associations. An example would be linking the discussion of how the KKK used fear instead of action to influence behavior (by mid 20th century, they didn't actually do much lynching) with a discussion of how real estate agents use fear to influence their clients (the fear in this case isn't physical violence but the fear of not being able to sell your house and taking the first reasonable offer instead of waiting for more money - it's better for the agent to turn sales over more quickly and accept a commission that is $100 or $200 less rather than to really work for more money for their clients). My other criticism is that the book at times makes conclusions based on single studies. In order to really make solid conclusions, scientific data should be confirmed through multiple studies.However, the book is successful in making many provocative conclusions on subjects by objectively analyzing the data that is available - objectivity is sometimes missing from popular sociology. The answers may not be what we want to hear, but it's what the data show. An example is debunking the idea that crime went down in the 90's due to the better economy but was rather due to the legalization of abortion leading to a smaller generation of young adults brought up by poor, single, uneducated parents in crime-ridden neighborhoods. The authors try not to make this an argument supporting abortion. Clearly, a more popular subject would be to find data that show that abortion is morally wrong, particularly considering the imbalance of incidence among socio-economic classes and racial demographics. Similarly, the discussion of the importance of parental behavior is likely not something that we want to hear - that the academic performance of children is determined more by who the parents are rather than how they perform as parents. In the midst of constant publication and publicizing of biased studies that catch on with the public only because they tell them what they want to hear or because they support what we regard as ""conventional wisdom"", it's refreshing to see a book become popular for the opposite reason.Another note on this book is that it has nothing to do with economics. Although the author whose theories are the basis of the book is an economist, the subjects covered are social issues that are examined through data mining and statistical analysis. Based on the fact that they even provide a simple and interesting explanation for what a regression analysis is, a clever name based on the word 'statistics' would have been more appropriate. Overall, it's a quick read that may have at least some influence on how readers view the world even if it doesn't change their lives."

I find economics a little interesting, so it was interesting to read about thing from an economists perspective. The randomness of this book was also refreshing. The book wasn't really about something, which made it fun to read. It read more like a bunch of scattered thoughts condensed into some very specific cause-and-effect analysis. I suggest this book to anyone interested in how some things work that you may not think of. This includes the economics of selling crack and the corruption in sumo. Overall, this was a really cool, funny book written by a very smart person. "
270,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5017705-lulu-rahman,3,"What happens when a journalist with a sense of humour meet an unorthodox economist? The answer is the birth of Freakonomics, a book that debunks various conventional wisdoms. Back in the summer of 2003, Dubner, a New York Times journalist, was sent by the paper to profile Levitt, a young economist who created a buzz in the industry with his robust and unconventional ideas and had just won the John Bates Clark Medal. Both were impressed with the other and decided to collaborate to write this book. Well, actually the deal is, Dubner will write while Levitt investigates and solves the mysteries of everyday living. Though after reading this book, one will find out that these mysteries are not so mysterious after all. Levitt explores real everyday issues and solves them by relying on facts and data he received on the topic, which is then presented by Dubner in the most logical and simplest manner that makes economics seems fun and easy.Of all subjects explored, the most interesting, in my opinion, is why do drug dealers still live with their parents if selling drugs is such a profitable business? To answer this, he collaborated with Sudhir Venkatesh, a PhD student in sociology and a mathematician. As part of his field work, Sudhir was sent by his professor to do a survey in one of the poorest Black neighourhoods but was instead held hostage by a group of drug dealers. After he successfully persuaded them not to kill him, he strike a deal with their leader, J.T, to get himself imbedded into the Black Disciples Gang so he could study them closely.What he actually found out about the gang is really surprising – it operates exactly like McDonalds. Black Disciples is actually a franchise of a bigger Black Disciples Organisation. J.T, who is college-educated, reports to a central leadership of 20 men, much like a board of directors and pays them 20 per cent of his drug revenues. Below him are an enforcer (who takes care of the gang’s safety), a treasurer and a runner (who transports drugs and money to and from the supplier). Then comes the foot soldiers, ranging from 20 to 75 of them and way down below the ranks are those who were not employees but pay dues to the gang. Similar to any other MNCs, the top 10 per cent in the organisation get paid the most. After paying revenues to the board, J.T pocketed about $8500 a month. His employees’ salary equals $9500 - $700 each to his top three guys and the foot soldiers just get about $3.30 per hour. In other words, J.T gets paid about as much as the McDonald's regional manager (sans income tax) while his foot soldiers get about as much as the burger-flipper. With such low pay and dire working conditions, the drug dealers will have no choice but to stay with their parents.The above is just one of the many examples of Levitt’s creative use of economic theory. However, even though Levitt’s ideas and interpretation takes centrestage, credit should also be given to Dubner for being able to put across Levitt’s ideas in a simplistic manner without trivializing the matters at hand. This duo has successfully debunked the scary subject that is economics by making it more ‘digestible’. Nothing freaky about it; a fantastic read for the masses!"

Sadly, I could not finish the course as I felt that I am not talented to understand it or I lost interest.But when I started reading this book, it genuinely created interest in economics.The book is all about how people behave in the real world. It just the way of looking at the things differently and getting the data to prove your thinking.It is a very well written book with rich insights and full of surprises. "
273,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069403-abby,4,"Guess what? I have a lot of books on my shelves here with the word ""Freak"" in them. I know because I just tried to find this book by searching for the word ""freak"". Apparently my reading has a theme.Anyhow, I paid 85 cents in late fees in order to read this book long overdue from the library, and I think it was worth my spare change. I was a sociology major in college (which statistically is a totally pointless major, I'm sure) and I had a favorite teacher named Richard Johnson. I swear, we talked about almost every topic in one class or another that I took from him. I would almost think he had used this book as a reference, except that it was published several years after I graduated. Maybe THEY used HIM as a reference. So, was my college education worth it? It made me think in the new ways that this book tries to make people think, and I've been doing it for several years now. To think, thousands were spent on tuition, to teach me what I could have learned for 85 cents from the Lehi library.One new thing for me, though - the discussion on car seats. As a mom of two small people, I was brainwashed into thinking that car seat safety was the ultimate test of a mother's concern for her children. I drove 30 minutes away to take a car seat safety class by the county health department, and I am always doing the weird things they taught me, like putting the handle down and spending five minutes trying to get it adjusted in right and tight enough. I am sort of a rebel however, because I let Benjamin just sit in the front seat with me when driving close distances (like to church, a 13 second ride at 7 MPH.) I always make him duck down if we drive by the moms who buckle their children in for a drive to the neighbor's driveway (which is dumb, because why would you drive to your next door neighbor's house anyway?).This book pointed out that while car seats are a good thing, they are statistically waaaay less important to your children's safety than a bazillion other things that parents neglect everyday. You take your kid swimming and look away for a second? Does your baby play on the floor with toys with small parts while you go to the bathroom? Your kid is way more likely to die from that than from the seat belt harness being adjusted three inches too low.So rather than getting all stressed from not getting the car seat in perfectly, I am letting it go and saving myself from high blood pressure. It is a freeing feeling. Statistics are interesting. It's a fun book to read. If you finish it, consider yourself as having a bachelor's degree in sociology."

275,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12520618-mayank-gupta,3,"This book explores the hidden side of everything. If morality describes the ideal world, then economics describes the actual world. Further, Freakonomics studies incentives and how different people in different professions respond. A nice read overall. "
276,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/670054-jess,4,"I don't know why it took me so long to read this book. Maybe there was a long wait at the library. Anyway, I ended up getting the audiobook, which means, of course, that I inadvertently exposed the kid to some Freakonomics when we were driving around. And he liked it, so there you go. Play it for your baby and they will end up smarter.I am actually rushing to finish this review before I head about the door, because I know if I let it go any longer, I just won't remember enough of the book. And that's why I started reviewing shit on goodreads: Because the swiss cheese holes in my brain are failing at keeping in the knowledge. So I have had the good fortune to be close to some people throughout my life who are just sublimely smart and interesting. Like, get drunk and talk all night and feel like you are learning big truths about the world. Freakonomics is kind of like hanging out with those people, only I wasn't drunk because, well, I was driving and that's dangerous. There's lots of anecdotes, some light math, but nothing injurious to your brain. However, it definitely provides a jolt of electricity to the parts that are fossilized (i.e. the part of my brain that turned off the same day I took my final exam in Statistics class in college). There's good material here for cocktail conversations, i.e. ""I'll have a dark & stormy. So, what do you think about the economic phenomenon of crack dealers who make so much money but still live with their moms?"" Ladies love that stuff. I really like the perspective that Steven takes - economics already has the tools to find the answers, but most people aren't asking the right questions - and the book feels like it avoids an agenda and lectures on ethics, even though Freakonomics addresses the underbelly of human nature - cheating, lying, criminal behavior, etc. The final section - on baby's names' popularity - was so deeply intriguing to me, I almost wished I had read the book on paper instead of audiobook. It was hard to follow along with long lists of names in audiobook format. Right after I finished this book, I was walking into the grocery store and this girl was wearing a jacket that said her name really large on the back (AMBER) and I just thought, ""I would not publicize that if I were you..."" Anyway, I feel like this book has greatly contributed to my nerdiness in a multitude of ways, and possibly made me a better person. It is vastly interesting and I recommend that you read it. "
277,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71191432-paul,3,"Freakonomics Book ReviewI thought this book had loads of interesting information and comparisons. This book brings economics into real life and finds different sides to everything. I loved this book because I learned so much from it. The only problem is that the book can get very confusing to understand about half the chapters because it is pretty advanced.The author in this book brings up a variety of issues, and talks about them economically. I thought it was amazing how the author could put that many facts inside a book. This book is for the person that wants to learn about economic issues explained in great detail. The conflict in this book is all of the economic issues that the author talks about. The author concludes that there are many problems, and if you look at them in a different perspective, you may think differently.	In this book, there are 6 chapters. The chapters get smaller and smaller hinting that the book starts out with the biggest problems and goes down to the smaller problems. The amount of detail put into this book is astonishing considering how many pages there all. 	In my opinion, this is a very good read and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to add to their vocabulary and knowledge. The only problem that I had with this book, is that some of the chapters go deep into economics and I sometimes got lost while reading it. The author definitely achieved his purpose about informing us about problems that can be thought about economically. A part that really stood out to me is how sumo wrestlers can be easily bribed. The book says that a sumo wrestler 8-7 plays another sumo wrestler 7-8. The sumo wrestler with the better record would purposely throw the match so that both of them could advance to the tournament. 	The thoughts in this book are somewhat wild and crazy, but at the same time they are genius. The author of this book is an economics professor at the University of Chicago and is highly qualified to be teaching the world about economics. I agree with the author's point of view. I think that thinking of stuff in a different way can really change opinions and help see the other side.This book definitely made me economically smarter, and was very well written. Overall I give this a 5 out 5 star rating. I would recommend this book to the people who have a basic background of economics, because that would be necessary to read this book.Paul Gregory 3rd Hour"
278,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28788642-szymon-warda,2,After being a listener of Freakonomics Radio I had very high expectations for this book. After reading it I fealt like listening to the best of the podcast. Only longer and with a lot more repetitiveness and self-promotion. It felt like it's purpose was to describe Levitt and his papers. Not much more.This might be because the book was released a long time ago and this field evolved significantly. Many more books were released that took the idea further.I don't think book is worth the time if someone listens to Freakonomics Radio and/or read other books in this topic (like Everybody Lies).
279,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5486168-dyuti,4,"Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to read a book on Economics and Statistics would you make such a skeptical face?There would be a high probability that you would.But going against all odds, as a statistician myself, I would implore you to give it a try. As it's 
NOTHING like what you'd expect it to be!
Its as much fun as jumping naked from a plane, while revolving a hula-hoop around your waist! (Unable to provide a suitable picture) Ok. Maybe not THAT MUCH fun. But, ya, you get the gist.It's like one of those 'Science Is Fun' book: targeted for a mass audience, informative, and yet delightfully funny! First of all, the book has no unifying theme. It just addresses seemingly bizarre questions, and gives fantastic answers. Questions like:1. What do sumo wrestlers and teachers have in common?2. How did the legalization of abortion affect the rate of violent crime?3. If dealing crack cocaine earns so much of profits, then why do most dealers still live with their mom? ... and many more...It just takes two completely unrelated topics, and shows how by making the proper connections, we can make wonderfully 
redefine the way we think!
 As the authors say, the objective of the book is to make the reader ask questions, and ponder on them... not always will you get the right answers, but where's the fun if you don't try?I completely enjoyed it, and give my highest possible recommendations. Its a pretty thin book, so go ahead, grab it, and learn to think differently!P.S: Those who are studying economics or statistics, and sometimes feel bogged down by the sheer weight of numbers and theorems, take a look. It'll once again make you fall in love with the subject. There are so many things waiting to be explored..."
280,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3034846-melanti,4,"This is a great book as long as you're not expecting it to be something it isn't.Oddly enough, despite the title and the author's claims and profession, it's more about sociology and statistics than about economics. Granted, most of his points have some economic impact but the approach is more of a sociological one.This is a book full of tidbits of social information and statistics as well as Levitt's take on their implications and causes. None of it is in depth, but there's generally multiple points made about each topic. Some topics are work-safe, others are extremely controversial. There's lots of topics of thought provoking conversation here and much of it is contrary to popular thought and media hype. That, I think, is one of the major reasons the book was/is so popular.One of it's biggest messages is to not believe everything that you read and/or hear; that there's sometimes other explanations that aren't media friendly or politically viable. Levitt has a lot of interesting claims and interesting data but I'm not sure I can whole-heartedly and blindly agree with all of his conclusions. Because it's written for a lay-person, there's very little depth to the majority of the discussions. There's little true evidence given to substantiate his claims and very little detail about his methodology and technique. Instead, he states his claims, explores their impact and meaning, then moves on to his next topic.Presumably, more rigorous proofs exist in the articles mentioned in the notes at the end since those were published for a professional audience, but I would have preferred even just footnotes with more substantial data than ""a study showed that..."" Actually, most of the chapters has enough interesting information that an in-depth study would probably be book length.But something that serious and in-depth most likely would never have become the pop-culture phenomenon that this book became 5 years ago."

282,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2610244-arjen,4,"The pattern is as follows: I plan to buy a book at Amazon or Bookdepository or whereever. The way the sites are set up, ok, the way the Internet works, I see a lot of interesting other interesting books which are too cheap not to buy. So I buy them as well. All that results in a pleasant stream of literature arriving in my mailbox over the next 1 - 5 weeks. At every new arrival, I start the ritual of unwrapping, browsing the pages, checking the index, the TOC, some reviews, read the preface, introduction, the first page of the first chapter, ok, the whole first chapter because it's so short. Begin at the second chapter, and so on and so fort. Usually, the 'books I didn't really need but were so cheap I couldn't leave them' arrive first (they are so cheap because there's piles and piles of them driving up warehouse bills). Usually, those books reach their pinnacle after 20 pages. That is, after reading the introduction, you already know what it's all about. I've written some reviews before about these kinds of books; why doesn't the other write a good essay or article about his idea? A book is most of the times too much.Same here. Or so I thought. I started reading the TOC, introduction, first chapter, second chapter, third chapter, fourth chapter, I feel asleep, woke up, read the other chapters and finished the book. Well done authors! Didn't expect that at all. This is actually really interesting case studies about economics, that is, the incentives why people do, or don't do, stuff. I liked the chapter about drug dealers and sumo wrestling the most.Recommended as an airplane book or when you visit your parents in law and want to bring up an interesting discussion about real estate agents. Finally you can say 'well, you know, that's not my opinion, that's a fact'. Done.Great. "
283,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17386712-katemc,0,"I'm torn about this book. And, because I think it would take more extra-curricular research than I am willing to do to come out on one side or the other, I think I'm just going to make peace with no rating starts and a question mark of a review. This book draws some mind-bending connections and presents some very cool ways of looking at the world. The piece that I can't quite settle with is that is it not at all clear to me how heavily individual biases can play into some of the conclusions when you pass a threshold number of obscure connections stacked on top of one another. I raced through the first few 'case-studies' which are entertaining to read and bursting with facts about areas I know nothing about. I loved it. But I slowed significantly when I hit the chapter ""where have all the criminals gone?"". It happens that the prison system is an area of interest for me so I found myself reading more critically and was less readily swept up in the dazzle. There were a number of facts and conclusions that I found myself flagging as I went through - folding old receipts between the pages so I would remember to go back to things that didn't feel quite as cut and dry as they read. I also felt that some of the language indicated that the author(s) started from a personal place of 'tough on crime' and a pretty othering mentality (""the kind of person who want to commit a crime""). This made me wonder if others more familiar with the subjects covered in other chapters had had similar reactions I just didn't have the background to notice. All of this made me think and stretch my brain which is always a great quality in a book, but I am wary of taking it all at face-value. I wish I had read it back when it was all the rage in 2005 and could talk it out with a devoted fan. "
284,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,5,"This book shows a number of ways in which one can apply economic reasoning to areas that either don't seem appropriate to economic reasoning or else are extraordinarily difficult areas in which to collect and analyze data. All of the chapters are terrific -- and they should be since they are based on some well worked out ideas and previously published papers. My favorite is the local analysis of drug dealing as an occupation versus other job prospects open to inner city teenagers - such as working for McDonald's. The analysis of real estate transactions is also memorable.While some may object to this line of reasoning and analysis, I don't buy the criticisms at all. The book shows how robust economic principles are and how they permeate varied aspects of social interactions. I really have come to think that understanding incentives, market imperfections, information problems, and related topics is critical for people as useful knowledge to help get by in the world. This should be required reading for anyone seeking to run their own business.This book is also well written and accessible. Levitt brought on Dubner to assist in writing the book and the readability of the book is one of its greatest strengths. Anyone who has plowed through economics journal articles will know what I mean. It also does not have much math, either in theoretical arguments - such as you find with Gary Becker or the other U of C stars or in data analysis such as in finance or industrial organization studies.I think the critical praise accorded this book is well earned and I highly recommend it."
285,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87531-benebean,3,"at bequest of Katie I'm expediting the writing of this review.Levitt writes a funny preface explaining that he and his book have no unifying theme which is amusing and entertainingly playful at the beginning but ultimately makes the book become a bit repetitious and flat as it drags on (mind you I'm a rather lazy reader and prefer to be well entertained when reading-- textbooks are out of the question). So as you read on the book feels more like a collection of summaries of interesting statistical studies. Perhaps the only unifying fact that was continually reinforced throughout the book was that correlation of data does not mean that one factor necessarily caused the other. This coupled with what can be summarized as ""think before assuming convention is always true"" are the only insightful concepts communicated by the book, and while they are valuable-- I had good teachers that taught me this throughout grade school, so it wasn't so revolutionary for me.the statistical studies themselves were interesting, but as with all papers/studies, even if the theory makes sense and seems to have stats to back it up, they all must be taken with a grain of salt seeing as the intellectual community will often change its mind on what a set of data really means even in a very short space of time. So the summaries of all these stats and accompanying theories are interesting but most I wouldn't necessarily label as insightful."
286,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47212-the-book-maven,5,"So the Book Maven's a little late to the party when it comes to this little rabble-rouser (rabblerabblerabble!) of a book, in which a nonfiction journalist and an economist team up to explain a number of seemingly unrelated phenomena--such as the relation between the legalization of abortion and lowered crime rates. Or, perhaps slightly less controversially (although not by much), how KKK members are similar to real estate agents. (I won't be floating that one past my real estate agent, and I strongly encourage you to follow my lead.) If you think that this book would be either bizarre, or confusing, or boring, you would be mistaken; it is none of these things. Author Dubner takes Author Levitt's facts and explanations and anecdotes and weaves them into entertaining and understandable stories, and more importantly, weaves them together into a book that is both coherent and well-ordered. The book is packed with facts, of course, and all sorts of interpretations of data, and if you are anything like me, soon enough these facts will be gone from our brain. But the ""moral of the story"" (or, as the authors put it, the ""unifying theme"") will, or at least 
should
 remain with us for a good long time: dig a little deeper. Don't be so ready to accept ""conventional wisdom"" at face value. Question everything.And if you already DO question everything, well, yay! you. Go and get a cookie. And read this book anyway."

And the really good stuff -- cheating in sumo wrestling and the link between legalized abortion and the drop in the crime rate --have been so widely discussed in other places that they didn't have the same impact on me that they would have had, if I had read this book a decade ago. But Leavitt does deserve some credit. In some of my best moments I have followed the same techniques that he applies here: (i) asking interesting, though sometimes obscure, questions that others have not thought to ask, (ii) trying to find the answers by looking at the questions from fresh perspectives, always being wary of conventional wisdom, (iii) considering all of the possible alternatives, even when they seem improbable or obviously wrong, and then (iv) finding large data sources that seem reliable and using them to rigorously test hypotheses. This stuff is fun and often can lead to surprising answers that can put you ahead of the curve when it works. Of course, it doesn't always work, and there are a lot of blind alleys and drudgery that Levitt keeps neatly hidden behind the curtain. But if even a few readers of this book can get past ""Wow, he's clever"" to ""Interesting, that's not so hard; I can be clever myself,"" then this book will have served a good purpose and will be more than just a collection of parlor tricks."

But life happened, I never got to it, and instead I got to read more serious books explaining people's decision making patterns, social behaviour and, most importantly, that ""conventional wisdom"" is often wrong.So now, to me, this book is nothing more than attempts to analyse some of social patterns or curious correlations using statistics and an absolutely brilliant and revolutionary mind of Levitt. Only revolutionary in economics, though. Sociology, behavioural psychology and systems theory explanations have been around for much longer and they actually explain all the anecdotes from perspective of reviewed science and universal frameworks, not as ""curious guesswork"".And frankly, many problems seemed so uninteresting to me. Especially with conclusions that idiot parents give idiotic names, and it's the stupidity of parents that matters more than the stupidity of the name. Duh! Or re-iterating so much about the crime rate, which was interesting in the introduction and dull with all the details of how many times which wrong reason was mentioned in press.Real estate agents, cheating teachers and a few other things were interesting, but the fact that people do what they are incented to is hardly revealing."
289,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7701118-garrett-cash,4,"Freakonomics is a fun, thought-provoking read. It's not really about economics at all, more sociology with an emphasis on numbers. I think the reactions to the book are wildly overblown by both its detractors and supporters. Both the co-author and the book's fan base seem to see Levitt as some sort of astonishingly fascinating genius (even going as far to say he is the most interesting man in America). I never got that impression as I read the book. More like he's a normal guy who asks the same kinds of silly questions I do and then proceeds to find evidence for an answer using statistics. How this makes him so incredible to people I'm not sure, either the influence of this book has been so pervasive that its nature appears normal to me by now, or perhaps I'm similar enough to Levitt to not see anything conspicuously unique about him. Anyway, this book will not give you any information about economics or anything beyond a few anecdotes over dinner, but it might spark an interest to pursue meatier works that pertain to subjects surrounding the book. It's simply a fun, intelligent, popular quick read. Why not? "

This was absolutely an intriguing read, sometimes taxing, and certainly compelling. I'd read about the controversies surrounding the book. Statistical reasoning for abortions and arguments against expert advice were amongst the most disliked aspects of the book. It was interesting to see how this pair's minds work, even though I found it fascinating that, as the reader, I was to nullify the findings of experts who ""doctor"" information for their own best interests; on the advice of two experts serving thier own best interest! Ah, se la vie. At times I felt like I was reading the ramblings of a narcissistic attention-deficit white male (most probable!) I can still come away from it with fondness. Though I found some discrepencies in the ascertions of the book, I can say, as a waddling qualitative political scientist, that it was by far the best statistical reading I have yet to come across. "

I skimmed the apendices--they seemed just repetitions worded differently of the other stuff, which left just a 200 page book. It seemed like the two main sections about parenting and education were concerned solely with the quantitative aspects of test scores, when the idea that maybe taking your children to a museum don't matter for test scores but they certainly matter when it comes to the qualitative feeling of feeling loved, of having important shared moments, etc. The same can be said with divorce, it may not alter your acceptance to the elite universities, but it leaves its imprint on other areas outside of SAT scores. I began to have the realization that nearly everytime they mention ''economics allows us to ...'' the more accurate thing to say is, ''statistics allows us to.'' But there's something less sexy about a rogue statistician than a rogue economist. One is the tools and the other is one of many fields using those same tools."
292,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56071004-some-random-book-lover,4,Truly enlightening book for people who don't have deep knowledge on economics but still keen on finding answers to simple yet strange questions.I am certainly not equipped enough to validate or disprove the ideas said in the book but it was certainly presented in a manner where one could easily grasp the meaning of the things discussed. The extreme humility expressed by the authors and their open admittal to being ignorant on some of the basic requirements in the field somehow clicked with me and I felt like having a conversation with just another friend who has a wider view on life unlike many others.Of course there were instances where the economist in the author came out in paragraphs that I could not understand at all like the last chapter where it was all just datas and tables and I just skipped through those parts but the fact is that they did not affect the overall enjoyment of the book at all.

I was by no means expecting an enjoyable narrative, but that is what this book provided me.Freakonomics provides an interesting insight into a way to look at the world in numbers; defining the word 'economist' completely differently from how common culture might. He defines an economist, more or less, as a person who identifies incentives and applies variables to make sense of human actions. He tells this story in an easy-to-read, conversational tone that makes even his statistic-heavy logic easy to get carried away with. If you've ever wondered the math behind cheating, the connection of Roe v Wade to a drop in violent crime, and the economics of crack dealing, I HIGHLY recommend this book. (Even if you just want some great non-partisan debate points on gun control and abortion alike.)Enjoy!"

295,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1383487-mary,0,"So that chapter on parenting not making much of a difference after the genetic input of biological parents is quite interesting. In essence it emphasized how much of school preformance is correlated with IQ and so if you have smart parents-no matter their color, you will likely do well. Actual parenting may have more to do with within group variability than the between group variability. For example, among all kids who have parents with high IQ's and books in their home those who have stronger relationships with their parents will ""succeed"" better in life. Of course for an economist success is usually in terms of money and it is much harder to measure charector traits like virtue, wisdom, and so forth-and these are the things ""active, positive parenting may do more to instill. It is at least worth a thought."
296,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4781397-gina,4,"So I heard Steven Levitt speak at ALA this past summer and it was like hearing an awesome professor talk- he was witty, humorous, and delivered his material in such a way that you were dying to learn more. He did get on a soap box at the end of that talk and lost me for a while but, overall, it was a good opening talk. His book was kind of the same way: imagine sitting in a class with your favorite professor in college who uses real world and relevant cultural examples to teach you. While I am not sure how much better I understand the field of economics after reading this book, I had a good time reading his examples about why events turn out the way they do (why does the crime rate rise and fall?, why do some kids do better in school?, etc.). A good economics book for the lay person."
297,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34442147-nuno-r,4,"This was my introduction to behavioral economics. After reading the brilliant Michael Lewis's story of the founders of this field, ""The Undoing Project"", I wonder: was this the book that caused the simplification ""behavioral economics is about how stupid people are when making decisions?"" Steven D. Levitt's podcast is brilliant and goes beyond the focus of his discipline. And even when the founders of this field of study were alive, some people tended to make that simplification. Maybe this comes from the history of how (some) social sciences have been involved in politics and marketing. And how some (on the side of power) have exagerated expectations on how much they are able to control people and others (those trying to escape control) have sometimes an inflated fear of unknown tools of manipulation."
298,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7298986-sarah-former-nefarious-breeder-of-murderous-crustaceans,1,"This book as less to do with economics than it has to do with statistical analysis which, to me, is its main flaw. I had vaguely heard of the book when it was first published and, given the good reviews, I thought I'd give it a try, thinking it was actually about economics. I guess I should have read the synopsis beforehand.The book has no unifying theme and is simply a series of uninteresting interpretations of various statistics. I found it completely anecdotal and really fail to understand why it has been such a success. The other annoying thing about this book is the perpetual references to Levitt's supposed greatness and sheer brilliance. It gets to such a point the whole thing becomes entirely ridiculous.Definitely not recommended reading!"
299,0061234001,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28328133-jerome-kuseh,3,"3.5 Stars. It makes for a fun read but it oversells itself and the ability of ""economics tools"" to explain the ""hidden side of everything."" For a start, regression analysis is not unique to economics and other social sciences are not stuck on how things should be instead of how they are.But this does not mean I did not find the book useful or enjoyable. Far from it. From black names, to sumo, to real estate and public schools I have been introduced to many interesting questions and information. (But the comparison of the KKK to real estate agents because of information asymmetry was a hell of a stretch.)Still a book I'll recommend to anyone. But with the caution that they shouldn't think we have the tools to answer just about any question we can think of. "
