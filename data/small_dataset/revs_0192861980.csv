0,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4508542-mark-lawrence,3,"I've been reading this one since June and it's now 3 days til Christmas!Roger Penrose is a famous mathematician who worked with Stephen Hawking on black holes and who has done ground breaking work elsewhere (including on the surprisingly fundamental issue of tiling 2D spaces!).The book is about the nature of intelligence and whether it really can be an emergent property of algorithmic procedure (i.e. Turing Machines, i.e. computers as we know them). Many people believe that intelligence can arise from sufficiently complex algorithms operating on sufficiently powerful computers. Penrose is in a minority that doesn't.In order to make his point Penrose starts with issues of non-computability. A Turing Machine represents every possible algorithmic computer (including all the ones we've made), and there are many questions (regarding whether certain processes will stop or not) that Turing Machines can be proved to be unable to answer. This relates to Godel's proof that in any formal system (like mathematics) it is possible to pose questions that can't be answered within the system.Penrose says that the human brain can answer many such unanswerable questions (in a similar way to that in which it discovers new mathematics) using inspiration.In order to consider how the brain might be capable of things that Turing Machines are not Penrose then spends 85% of his fat book on a tour through science. And I mean pretty much the whole of physics plus some more. This is of course a whistle-stop tour, through mechanics, relativity, electro-magneticism, quantum mechanics, the formation and death of the universe etc ... To someone with a physics degree it constitutes a refresher course. I'm worried that to pretty much any one else it would be dull and incomprehensible. Additionally, given that most readers will not, in the time and detail available, really grasp much of it ... it's fairly pointless. The basics/feel of his final arguments could have been delivered by a less extensive tour of the whole of physics.At the end of it Penrose needs to postulate a quantum mechanical source for the brain's proposed ability to do what a computer (of any Turing Machine sort (including quantum computers, apparently) can't. This is a hard sell as entanglement and other quantum phenomena don't seem to have macroscopic impact in a hot/noisy environment such as that brain. However, Penrose does lay out an interesting possible architecture for quantum gravity and the way in which the quantum and classical world may be unified within a theory. These suggestions also play interestingly into the business of time/the flow of time/the fact we perceive a present, past and future. And yes, at the end of it all he even manages to get his tiling into it. Most of all, for me, this a heartening book not so much for the solutions it offers but for showing/reminding me just how much we don't know and that there are plenty of dark spaces in our knowledge/theories where all manner of surprises (including ones about the nature of intelligence) may lurk.A good read wrapped around an over-long physics 101 that's too complex for pretty much anyone without a physics degree.[it should be noted that I do have a physics degree, a math-based PhD, and years of experience working on research problems in the 'AI' area.] Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes...."
1,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"I suggested that one could imagine Albertine's gang in A L'Ombre Des Jeunes Filles En Fleurs as a kind of wave function of girls (see my review), and that made me think of The Emperor's New Mind. Given that it's all about quantum mechanics, I suppose it's appropriate that I have two different and completely incompatible reactions to it. On one hand, I am annoyed with Penrose. OK, he is a great genius in his own field, but why does that give him a license to come in and pronounce on the things I do, hardly even bothering to quote anyone who actually works in Artificial Intelligence? How would he feel if, say, Peter Norvig were to write a book on quantum theory, quoting only AI and computer science people, and making it sound like all the real quantum theorists were irrelevant? Many other AI people I know who have have read the book feel similarly.On the other hand, Penrose's suggestion that we should think of people's minds as quantum-mechanical systems is interesting. In fact, I'd go further than that: it's sometimes a useful thing to do in real life! At least, I find myself thinking that more often than you might suppose. Here's what I mean. Often, it makes little sense to ask whether a person ""really"" thinks A, or if they rather think its opposite, B. It's more useful to imagine that they are in a superposed state, which is a combination of A and B. You can perform an observation, and force them into an eigenstate: then they will indeed have to take a stand as to whether it's A or B. But doing this changes the situation; you may wish you'd been sensible enough not to carry out the observation, and just left things superposed.I think these observations are particularly relevant in serious romantic quarrels. Next time you are unfortunate enough to get into one, and if you are sufficiently interested in these issues to remember the experiment you're supposed to do, consider whether it's intuitively reasonable to model the other person's state as a superposition of ""actually still loves you"", ""totally pissed off, had enough"", and possibly other eigenstates. If you do think this is reasonable, consider whether your best strategy is to try and force them into an eigenstate, or leave it superposed. (I would LOVE data here). Personally, I think it's often best to try to leave the state superposed. Is this just a fancy way of describing a conflict-avoiding cop-out strategy, or is it some kind of insight? Again, my answer would be the one you so often get in quantum theory: both, even though they seem to contradict each other. As you can see, I am eagerly awaiting the publication of A Quantum Theory of Love. Please, won't someone hurry up and write it? But I think Penrose is the wrong guy to do this job."
2,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28709846-manuel-ant-o,5,"If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.Physics and Computer Science for Laymen: ""The Emperor's New Mind"" by Roger PenrosePenrose certainly has a generous idea of his readers' mathematical ability. It's a kind of running joke among Penrose-fans: he always starts his books by saying you'll find it tough going if you haven't got a 12th Year (in Portugal)/GCSE (in the UK) in math, but that he'll explain it as he goes if you haven't. Twenty pages later you're on Gödel and conformable geometry. He doesn't do it deliberately; he really does believe his books are popular science. How can you not love him? I purchased an on-line kindle edition of this book back last year via Amazon and it was more about bringing myself up to date (I read it for the first time in 1991 when the book came out), although such things are never truly current due to Theories being debated and tested for very many years within Scientific Realms. Roger Penrose's books are as stated often inclusive of more mathematical devises than many books aimed at more laymen realms, so I often regard them as perhaps Bridging that gap between Solid Science Headaches and Laymen 'I read an article and am a common law know-all expert'.

4,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1653131-mitch,4,"It's hard for me to rate this one:the bulk of the book was a great deal of fun,in the vein of ""Goedel, Escher, Bach"";the concluding section seemed astonishinglyill-conceived. There's a big debate aroundthis, but the connections he makes strikeme as terribly wrong. Incompleteness doesn'tprove the human mind does something no machinecan do, and microtubules do not allow brain-widecoherence for special quantum-supercharged thinking that results in consciousness.But watching Icarus crash and burn might be as muchfun as watching him soar high and proud until then,so I certainly recommend this book to anyone whoenjoys following a brilliant mind broadly exploringmath and science."
5,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5361322-ivan-vukovi,5,"First of all, I absolutely love Penrose.His style simply amazes me! There's this feeling that he wants to tell you SO MUCH and that he's trying hard to control himself so that he doesn't end up with a book several thousand pages long. Also, it's obvious that he enjoys science and mathematics on a really profound level. Those two things are really what kept me on the edge of my seat (when I wasn't reading while walking) while I was reading this book!As someone interested both in neuroscience and mathematical physics I found this book absolutely brilliant and fascinating. If you came to this book from the purely neuroscience side and really don't like mathematics and physics, then MAYBE this book isn't for you, but personally, I like how Penrose isn't afraid at all to go into mathematically detailed stuff when he feels it is necessary to do so... and some things are not so trivial to understand!One more thing... I've seen many people (including a decent number of reviewers here) claiming that Penrose is nuts and that this book is filled with bollocks and nonsense, that he isn't logical, factual and whatnot... So, I was very careful and skeptical about this book and I have to say that people who say so are not fair to Penrose. Whenever he introduced something that wasn't widely accepted or something extremely speculative, he explicitly stated so, over and over again!Besides, it's not like he doesn't know what he's talking about... we should never appeal to authority as an argument (and I'm not doing that), but keep in mind that he isn't just some crazy old guy who doesn't know anything!Bottom line, you should form your own opinion about it, but I strongly recommend this book and I'm looking forward to reading Penrose's Road to Reality!"
6,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2310818-peter,4,"Here's what I think: Roger Penrose is wrong, and smart enough to convince himself he's right. I know he's smart because the journey he provides to his thesis is so rich with disparate concepts (I awarded an entire extra star just for the chapter that introduces quantum mechanics, for example). Unfortunately the logic that ties the whole thing together doesn't speak to me.The purpose of the book is to argue that strong AI is fundamentally impossible. He argues this from the last place I think is left for such a position. If we can simulate the action of a neuron, and if it's possible to know how neurons are connected, then in principle we can duplicate a brain and thus, it seems, a mind. Therefore, strong AI is possible, UNLESS brains depend on exotic physics not yet understood. He's very careful to distinguish between intelligence and consciousness: technical advances may make it possible for software to write symphonies, but that software, he claims, won't be conscious without taking advantage of certain quantum gravity effects which have not yet been observed and which are currently explained by no rigorously tested theory.There's a lot of suspense building to the thesis at the end, which he keeps well hidden up to then, intentionally or not. The author doesn't jump ahead to give a peek at how the chapter in question fits into the big picture; rather, he restates his thesis and promises again and again that he's about to prove it. In the end, the logic is underwhelming. Part of his argument actually rests on the impossibility of genetic programming, a technique that became popular a decade after publishing.I can easily allow the possibility that brains take advantage of exotic physics to perform computations; biology is a top down discipline, and in many respects the bottom, the basic physical reality of the phenomena in question, is nowhere in sight. But I'm less convinced that consciousness can't arise without those effects; and, anyway, it remains possible to simulate THOSE effects in a computer, and thus to build a strong AI. The whole thing smells like the scientific writings of an intelligent, scientifically read creationist, doing whatever logical gymnastics are necessary to prove the desired point, as much to oneself as to anyone else.One possibility the author allows for is that the quantum gravity effects he's postulating are deterministic, but non-computable. That is, that the state of a system, if it were known, implies how the state will evolve next with no possible randomness, yet the state in the future cannot be CALCULATED, even in principle. It's a neat idea that may or may not be sensible and I don't have any more to say about it.It's a good book. The math, physics, and computer science are all intensive, but Penrose is a good writer and pleasant to read. I don't regret the several weeks it took me to finish."
7,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206483-dj,3,"First, the good. Penrose weaves tales of science, philosophy, and history that few others can, due to his wide-ranging and vast intellect. He touches on a wealth of interesting subjects in this book and his enthusiasm for them bleeds through the pages. In particular, this book offered the most illuminating introduction to entropy (in the ""Cosmology and the arrow of time"" chapter) that I have ever read. In short, before I read it, I didn't believe in the second law of thermodynamics. After I read it, I could interpret the entire world through ""entropy goggles"". In other books, entropy was some esoteric concept; here it is a beautiful and central feature of our universe.Now, the irritating. Penrose's stated goal in this book is to convince the reader that strong AI will not be realized. In other words, what human brains do, no computer ever could. Yet, however many fascinating ideas he introduces, his core evidence is little more than hope that what he does as a mathematician is unique; that human ""aha!"" moments are somehow distinguished from anything a computer ever does.Penrose fervently declares that he is no ""formalist"", claiming that the mere idea of a computer arriving at mathematical proofs makes the pursuit of mathematical truth ""meaningless"". Why? A computer may arrive at such a truth, but it is the human's role to make human meaning out of it. Meaning isn't some quality embedded into the fabric of our universe. It is a manufactured human ideal - a wonderful, enjoyable one at that.Penrose goes on to cite the vague notion of ""reflection principles"" (the imprecise methods by which the human mind discovers mathematical truth ""upon reflection"") as above and beyond algorithms. He uses these ""aha!"" moments as support for his argument that algorithms cannot possibly imitate what we do. Yet, how can we be so sure that these ""aha!"" moments do not arise from some complicated algorithm themselves?Perhaps, any human-created set of mathematical axioms will always be subject to ""reflection principles"" and only a more intelligent species could create a set for which there are no human-generated ""reflection principles"". Perhaps the notion of computability simply refers to a hierarchy of skill among complex adaptive systems. (If anyone knows of a book or research on such an idea, please let me know)Finally, on Penrose in general. Penrose's books tend to occupy a literary no-man's-land between popular science and technical writing: too technical for the average hobbyist yet not deep enough for a student in the sciences. It seems he's just too damn smart to recognize what falls into each category (for example, he might spend half a chapter explaining fractions and then breeze through Hamiltonians in half a paragraph). For me, he's best as a connector of mathematical and physical ideas after I've been formally introduced to them.As any good book should do, this one did leave me with a few questions (besides the above):

   Which is a deeper truth - math or physics? 
   In reflecting on the story non-Euclidean geometry, what else are our evolutionary adaptations leading us to falsely assume? 
   Has anyone checked whether Hamiltonians would be deterministic for computable universal constants and discrete input? 
   Can we really separate dynamical equations from boundary conditions? Are not boundary conditions simply consequences of other not-yet-understood dynamical equations?

8,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8048692-paul-kieniewicz,5,"After scanning the host of negative reviews of this book, I feel compelled to speak my piece. I've read this book more than once, and often return to it and find a few more nuggets. Is seems to me that there are few other books that grapple as honestly with the nature of consciousness. The AI community, and materialist scientists who start with the premise that --- it's all in the brain; we don't know how or where but one day we will know, are the people that Penrose challenges. This book predictably annoys them. Since the book's publication in 1989, when Penrose asserted that the nature of consciousness will not be explained in materialistic terms, his prediction has proved true. We're no closer to understanding consciousness than we were then.Perhaps, as Penrose suggests, we're like scientists trying to build a perpetual motion machine, who still don't accept the second law of thermodynamics, stating that such a machine cannot be built. It's a blow to our human hubris when a scientist makes a proposition that begins with the words: ""It is not possible..."" Using arguments based on Godel's theorem of incompleteness, and the work of Turing, Penrose makes a credible case for why consciousness will never be explained in materialistic terms. In so doing he steps on a lot of toes. But maybe he's right. 2 plus 2 will never be 5 either."
9,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25304792-g-r-reader,2,"I did a back-of-the-envelope calculation and told Roger that the decoherence times were at least ten orders of magnitude too low for the brain to be a quantum computer. No response. Then Max did it more carefully and said they were twenty orders of magnitude too low. Any advance on twenty?Sigh. I love Roger, but sometimes he just won't listen."
10,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7654396-samir-rawas-sarayji,1,"I got so bored... too much formalism with having to explain all the mathematical and physical principles from the ground up before adding his own thoughts to the theme of consciousness. It all became too mucky to follow and keep track of, it felt more like a textbook for Penrose's ideas rather than an enlightening conversation that could offer me food for thought which I could digest."
11,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3522435-tom,5,"Penrose sets out to prove that strong AI (minds simulated on digital computer being equivalent to biological minds) is impossible. He argues that minds depend on a physical process which, while perhaps deterministic, is non-computable and therefore can't be simulated on a Turing machine. This was quite convincingly argued, and in the process Penrose takes you through probably the most comprehensible description of quantum theory that I've read in popular form. Not shying away from using the odd formula helps keep the ideas concrete and generally didn't freak out this reader too much.His reason for covering so much physics in order to explain his opinion on AI is that he thinks the process that turns quantum physics on the very tiny scale into classical physics on human scales is the non-computable process essential to consciousness (and is necessarily tied to quantum gravity).The discussion of the limitations of current theories seems much more insightful than the typical very speculative and fantastical projections of possible future physics found in popular cosmology. In particular, Penrose makes an interesting prediction about a future more complete theory: it will be time asymmetric (whereas current theories don't care what direction you run time in), and a low entropy start to the universe will be an essential feature of it (explaining the 2nd law of thermodynamics).He does have the (rather odd) idea that the 'platonic world' of mathematical truths can be reached from the mind (via this non-computable physical process), which is how mathematicians can 'see' the truth of mathematical propositions which would stump a purely algorithmic mind (since that algorithmic mind can't figure out the truth of its gödel sentences).I think it is more likely that these propositions are being analyzed in a more heuristic and error-prone way. But this implies cognitive closure which would be a shame.This book didn't resolve any of my philosophical problems with consciousness... Anyway, you should read this."
12,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660547-ka-yap,5,"This is a great mathematical book, which goes deep into many mathematical and philosophical ideas.I was 17 when i first picked it up at a library and this book was my introduction to many mathematical concepts and quantum mechanics.The basic premise of the author in this book is that human consciousness cannot be simulated computationally.his hypothesis that the human brain is a quantum-mechanical structure is very interesting.Not an easy read, but definitely worth going through."
13,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/979520-douglas,4,"I read this book when it first came out and I was still a student of science so my memory on specific details is sketchy. There is no doubt that it is interesting and lively. I recall agreeing with Penrose's skepticism about artificial intelligence through his discussion of the Chinese Room Problem and the idea that if it were possible to write down the ""program"" of a person's mind in a book then the book, in a very slowed down sense, would be intelligent. From this I recall that his skepticism is about what some call the Strong AI hypothesis, which the Chinese Room Problem and the example of the book illustrate. His argument is that the functioning of the mind is inherently a quantum phenomenon and, because of the indeterminacy of states inherent in quantum systems, the mind cannot be embodied in a machine (like a Turing machine) that progresses through definite states. In fact, Penrose (again from distant memory!) says that the human mind is uniquely and inextricably bound to the human brain. Thus all the grandiose claims of the proponents of AI are in a way like the praises the fabled naked emperor receives from his courtiers as he bestrides his throne room and thus the book's title. All of this is very good and, I think, weakens the plausibility of materialism which is the philosophical pedestal on which most scientists stand; though I realize this was probably not Penrose's intention. (It weakens it because it illustrates a reductio ad absurdum of the materialistic point of view.)Another interesting book, expressing skepticism toward AI is Hubert Dreyfus', ""What Computers Can't Do"". Dreyfus is a phenomenologist and tackles the problem from that point of view and not one based on modern physics."
14,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8284707-louisa,3,"Computers can defeat humans in a game of chess, and perform mathematical operations much faster than humans can. A robot can be built that detects when its batteries are running low and when this happens, goes off to find a power socket to plug itself in and recharge. Computers can be programmed to answer questions as a human being would. But can a computer solve every problem that a human being can solve? Could computers ever be aware of, and actually understand what they are doing? Could the entire contents of the brain be stored on a digital device? To state that a computer behaves as a human being, is it enough that it gives us answers that are indistinguishable from those of a human being? Can computers actually be intelligent; will they feel, think, and have minds?The defenders of ""strong-AI"" say yes, but Penrose doesn't think so. He argues that there is a lack of understanding of the laws of physics at the scale of the human brain that prevents us from penetrating the concept of ""mind"" in physical or logical terms. In other words, there is a piece of the puzzle missing. To explain his viewpoints, Penrose takes us on a ride through the developments in artificial intelligence (as it was in the end of the 1980s when he wrote the book), the workings of the Turing machine, the foundations of mathematics and Gödel's theorem, quantum theory and electromagnetism, and he does that really well. Penrose is a very creative thinker with an astonishing mastery of many fields of science. It is therefore disappointing that what follows in the last few chapters is no more than speculation; his suggestion that consciousness is the result of quantum gravity effects in certain areas of the human brain has since been refuted by other scientists. I am still glad to have read The Emperor’s New Mind, as it provides an interesting contrast with Hofstadter's views on artificial intelligence, and I certainly learned a lot from the science chapters. However, I doubt whether it is worth going through such an awful lot of math for a somewhat outdated theory."
15,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27131192-arko,5,"This is the first book of Sir Roger Penrose that I read by now and it left me mesmerized by the originality of his ideas no matter how much speculative they may be. Sir Penrose is a mathematician of first rate and it is very evident from his take on the hard problems which is beyond the mainstream approach of physicists. I am very much biased towards new ideas that can knit a multitude of problems together yet possessing a scientific ring of falsifiability, predictability and testability. This book was written back in the late 80s with so rich ideas which can leave one thinking about it even today.In this book the author speculates an approach to answer the nature of consciousness which necessitates a modification of quantum and classical physics to an unification of both. Such unification is the holy grail of physics and much work is done on it and still ongoing. But the approach which Sir Penrose posits is quite a different one from the conventional line of thought of our present times. Moreover such approach ties not just classical and quantum worlds but also that of our consciousness as well. Although very speculative and much work needs to be done on this (even the author presently has somewhat moved on from his theory of one graviton criterion presented in this book) the essence of his approach remains the same and active research is being done at present. This approach being a gravitational collapse of the quantum wave function. To describe the book:Firstly the author questions the possibility of present day digital computers of having a mind or not. Such computers are run on algorithms which much of our brain functionality also does however the attribute of a conscious interpretation or judgement need to transcend this algorithmic nature and be non-algorithmic. The author describes computers that pass the Turing test and AI with complex algorithms have a good calculation power but the essence of understanding is something non-computational that remains lacking in these machines. The Author then delves into the meaning and details of algorithm, stretching to its limit of the most important insolubility of Hilbert's Halting problem of finding a mathematical procedure to ascertain the solution of all mathematical problems belonging to broad well defined class. It turns out to have no general algorithm to find such solutions in general for various mathematical problems. The famous incompleteness theorem given by Kurt Gödel does present to us the very limit of formalism of any one kind in particular which is applicable for all formal systems nevertheless. There are problems of Hamiltonian circuit and travelling salesman problem which belongs to the category of problem whose solution doesn't have an algorithm in specific determined time range. These are termed as NP complete. The more general algorithms being referred as P which possess algorithm for its solution in deterministic time. As of now P and NP are understood as different. Also the famous mathematical problem of tiling in which the author himself is a significant contributor towards aperiodic tiling structures, has no algorthimic decision procedure of its solution.Armed with all these concepts and the famous branch of non-recursive mathematics, the author posits that there should be a non-algorithmic nature of our consciousness which is much capable of judgement and insights.The best part of reading books by such high rank mathematicians and physicists as the author himself is that the reader's basic ideas in the field of mathematics and physics gets well strengthened. Sir Penrose magnificently described the world of mathematics , classical and quantum physics in each of which there are hints of non-algorithmic , deterministic but non-computational & non-local attributes respectively. Penrose is a Platonist giving the timeless realm of mathematical world a certain reality of its own.Finally the author arrives at his speculation namely one graviton criterion. Here Penrose tries to provide a possible mechanism as to how the complex weighted linear superposition of quantum wave function collapses to form a observable aspect of our classical world out of the several orthogonal alternatives which coexists in quantum world giving it a non-local feature. Locality gets imbued , according to this theory , when the difference between initial and final mass distribution as a part of the superposition achieves a gravitational field difference to that of 1/100 of Planck mass.With several interesting phenomena of quasicrystals where a 5-fold symmetry ( tiling in 5fold symmetry was worked out by Penrose ) occurs need a nonlocal quantum superposition description to attain it in a minimum energy. With such an analogy the author speculates the growth and contraction of dendrites (having synaptic connecrions) of neurons of our brain can occur in a similar fashion then such a superposition would collapse upon meeting the one graviton criterion within a certain small amount of time. Within this time several nonlocal activity may be achieved simultaneously which when collapses takes the form of a judgement or conscious decision.This collapse which slides from the deterministic Schrödinger wave function(superposed) evolution to the stochastic reduction of wave function requires a new quantum gravity theory with a non-algirithmic property.Also in this book Penrose subtely touches on an interdependency of quantum state vector reduction and a null value of tidal flow field given by the Weyl curvature tensor of the equations of the famous Einstein's general theory of relativity. This constraint of Weyl curvature tensor being zero is theorized to be present at the Big bang singularity imparting our Universe the second law of thermodynamics which states that irreversible events occur towards a higher entropic state with a lower entropic state preceding it.The nature of brilliant insights or spark of ideas which comes up in our mind altough having a non-algorithmic nature it nevertheless depend on the otherwise various algorithmic/computational activities of our brain carried out involuntarily. This book is a collection of several deep and insightful ideas. I have seldom written such a lengthy review in goodreads owing to my inability to manage time. But for this book I lost track of time and length of my review. This book is a mandatory read for those who strive for diverse ideas for various mysteries of our reality."
16,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13526-keith-koenigsberg,4,"Another longtime companion of mine, this book is by turns brilliant and exasperating. It's a bulky layman's discourse on Artificial Intelligence, seeking the answer to the question ""Can a computer ever possess true intelligence?"" Its brilliance lies in fascinating and lucid coverage of a variety of subjects in mathematics, classical and quantum physics, relativity, and all of the philosophical underpinnings. Unfortunately in the tumble of information Penrose neglects to pull the threads together and support a thesis. I always looks back, say, at a chapter on the Mandelbrot set or Godel's Theorem, or whatever, thinking - that was great and fascinating, but what does it have to do with the nature of intelligence? Exactly what is the link between black holes and brains? Penrose's thesis - that human thought and self-awareness are non-algorithmic - is supported indirectly, if at all."
17,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1802502-kevan,3,"My reaction to this book and its follow up, Shadows of the Mind, were pretty much the same.Yes, it's true we can't reconcile gravity and quantum mechanicsYes, reconciling how intelligence arises in a purely mechanical system is not understoodYes, Godel's incompleteness stuff and Turing halting stuff are weird and not at all obviousBut, no, I am very far from convinced that a mechanism that allowed us to reconcile General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics would allow us to understand how intelligence can arise and avoid the Godel paradoxThat being said, Penrose is a tad smarter than I am. Maybe it's a case of the reader blaming the authors for the reader's shortcomings"

In this book, Penrose argues that it can't. I don't buy his quantum mechanical explanation for consciousness. For me, it is either computation or it is nonphysical. I don't think there is a quantum mechanical third way. But nobody knows. We know a lot more about the brain and brain function and computation but we have not made much progress since Descartes on the consciousness issue.

Its central idea: That the nature of human thought is ultimately non-algorithmic...a fascinating point of view in this AI dominated era 2. Being privy to the inner workings of Roger Penrose's mind. In an era in which scientific specialization is the norm, it is refreshing to read someone that jumps from chaos mathematics to computing and quantum gravity to answer questions about consciousness. If Hesse's ""Glass Bead Game"" was real, Roger Penrose will no doubt be one of its most accomplished players"

I was sold!Penrose is, IMHO, the best writer about physics. His style is friendly and relaxed but thorough. I do not follow his thesis that it is not possible to construct hard AI and brains need an quantum physical element to be understood. But this book deals with such interesting subjects and themes about the universe and our place in it, it is impossible not to be fascinated."

27,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12966934-j-c,3,"Although this book brought to my attention some interesting ideas, I felt that as a whole, these ideas weren't communicated very succinctly or convincingly. I was constantly annoyed by the copious amounts of speculation. In the meanwhile, the main chunk of the book that sought to provide an adequate background was pretty okay, but Penrose has a penchant for overexplaining certain trivialties while underexplaining other more important points. Penrose also has very strange views wrt to the philosophy of mathematics, he seems to believe in the notion that mathematics is ""out there"" in a perfect Platonical sense, although som eof his arguments convinced me of a soft Platonism -- idk what label philosophers attach to it, but it's the idea that emergent mathematical properties, which have their own ""beauty"" or ""platonic truth"" are embedded within the elegant and symmetrical structure of our mathematical axioms, but are not separate from them. In other words, truth is found in the axioms, and although not necessarily provable from axioms alone, can be ascertained by an external (self-referential?) observer. Overall it left me confused but enlightened in my own way - I am more interested than ever in consciousness and brains. So for my own sake, I'm gonna revisit the book from the beginning and enumerate my thoughts.-----------------------------------------------------------Chapter 1: Can a Computer have a mind?The book begins with an introduction to AI, listing various ways to determine if a computer possesses consciousness. So there's the turing test, which essentially says that any simulation of an output of consciousness that is indistinguishable from the output of any odd human being, under the judgement of an observer, is good enough to be called ""conscious"". Then there's a refutation, Searle's chinese room, which essentially plays on the necessity of 'understanding' or 'meaning' in the process of consciousness. I haven't given these enough thought, but obviously the first one is unsatisfactory because you have to specify a domain and range of ""acceptable outputs"", which is essentially information that can be subject to algorithmic laws. I guess you could put on trial an algorithmic/statistical programme by demanding from it certain acts of creativity and a certain flexibility that we would normally associate the imagination, a feature of the mind often thought of as the pinnacle of human evolutionary achievement, but programmes such as the jeopardy flouncer have shown just how easily (well maybe not for its programmers) a programme can simulate lateral thinking. It does so by drawing on a countless database of human culture and ingenuity. Essentially stuff like Searle's Chinese room support the argument that any attempt at AI via algorithms produces a philosophical zombie. I sort of accept this for the most part, except that there's a possibility that through a modular algorithm possessing components of complex self-referrence is all that's necessary for a digital computer to perceive itself, and perhaps the sensation of being in the front seat of awareness is nothing more than this sort of self-referrence towards one's internal states. I for one am troubled by this notion, and it is still difficult to fathom what exactly this self-referrence would be. Perhaps it is a constant comparison of perception with stored data in a space which is constantly, in turn, perceived. But it's difficult to say just at what point it is that awareness would suddenly emerge.Chapter 2, 3 & 4: Algorithms and Turing Machines | Mathematics and Reality | Truth, Proof and InsightThese chapters were a little less problematic. I got an introduction to Turing machines and the binary language we use at the mechanical(mainframe???) level of computation. Got my first introduction to incompleteness and uncomputability, which was almost astoundingly trivial. It was just like that game we play with language: ""this statement can't be proved"" or ""this statement is false"". I am still in the dark about the full ramifications of this for mathematical truth, or 'insight'. Nevertheless, I was genuinely surprised by the fact that we, as external observers, can decide the provability (or truth) of a statement ""If this is a statement that can decide the unprovability of all statements, then there is no statement that can prove this statement"". The trick is that we are able to see that the statement is indeed unprovable, but the statement within the algorithm/formal system is not. or something like that.I had a moment of lucidity but I think it's now been lost. But the discussion of the Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set was pretty convincing for me, at least enough to adjust my position from strict formalist to one more accommodating of ""external"" mathematical truth. Before this I had always thought that enumerabillity of a set meant the enumerabillity of its complement, but apparently not, although I couldn’t grasp the significance of this. There was also in the book a subsegment on complexity theory and coarse-grained algorithmic models of aggregate behaviour which I later (perhaps going off on a different tangent) found out a little bit about.Chapter 5 & 6: The classical world | Quantum magic and Quantum MysteryMostly for these chapters I got smatterings of stuff I understood only implicitly but not at all in a rigorous way. Nothing much to be said.Chapter 7: Cosmology and the Arrow of TimeI finally got some clarification of what entropy means: the aggregate dissipation of ‘order’ in a system. The effects of entropy, are not, in actuality, irreversible if left on its own, just that such a scenario is highly improbable. So order here has less to do with energy than with “a state of probabillity” or something. Something to do with time and random motion. Though I didn’t really get white holes or phase space of particles…Chapter 8: In Search of Quantum GravityI didn’t really get QM so it’s difficult to say what I gleaned from this chapter. I remember learning that the probabillities of QM don’t seem to split when moving backwards in time, but instead seem to conjoin into one state. Is this like some sort of “supraposition”. Irdk don’t trust myself on this.Chapter 9: Real Brains and Model BrainsThis was written at a time (I think) before the FMRI. Nevertheless, some interesting discussions about language, and multiple-regions of conscious awareness. I think it is silly to think that consciousness developed in tandem with language and is therefore privy to human beings. Language merely allowed for an explicit account to be made of one’s consciousness, forcing perhaps one’s societally aroused “self-consciousness” due to the awareness of other ‘minds’ in a very strong sense. I thought it was prety cool that in split brains, each side may only be dimly aware of the conscioius activities of the other.Also, isn’t it the case that emotions are only useful to a conscious animal. Thus it must be the case that emotions are essential to consciousness, or at least the part of it that deals with “meaning” and “importance/salience”. (actually I’m mistepping here. Emotions also have physiological effects)But it’s interesting nonetheless that a whole spectrum of information is processed in a non-conscious way, whether algorithmically or otherwise (what is otherwise? Analogue?). This part of the brain is probably no less interesting, but is definitely easier, at least, to compare with a computer fitted with an appropriate programme.QM is suggested as a possible source of free-will. Personally I’ve found it useful to think of it this way. Seemingly deterministic systems are only the aggregate behaviour of random processes. The emergent indeterminism of our brains, by contrast, somehow have arisen in an ordered fashion, not totally random, not strictly determined, and is scientifically categorised as “complex”. One thing I was struck by recently was that if we were completely animal, we would be driven by our emotions entirely, and if we were able only to reason based on non-emotional, algorithmic assessments of our environments, we would be entirely bound by reason. Somehow our freewill lies in our abillity to mediate our emotions with reason, in turn, and for emotions to colour our reasons. (reason here referring to our ability to form and work out cause and effect -- or cost and reward -- within a functioning model we have.) Chapter 10: Where lies the Physics of the Mind?It is an interesting idea that there must have been a evolutionarily viable reason for consciousness to emerge. I think one reason is that algorithmic systems simply cannot assess meaning of environmental changes as well as a conscious awareness can. If environmental awareness was coded directly into the brain, the abillity for generating new ideas not found directly in perception would be absolutely limited. Look at what consciousness has given us instead: the ability to adapt complex spatio-temporal models of the world that suit our needs. It gives us true imagination and creativity, much unlike the derivative statistical model of the Jeopardy-playing programme. It has also given us the ability to interact well with others of our species, and by extension, a better understanding of ourselves. The power of the human mind does not lie in its ability to reason (statistically) based on environmental changes, but its ability for unreasonable leaps in the imagination.Just look at culture -- an essential part of communal organisms: the massive leaps in understanding we have of the world are not at all physically encoded through genes, or algorithmically processed, but are conceptual -- we inherit habits and understanding from others, very very quickly, through our conscious ""modelling"". We are able to form spatio-temporal narratives about an otherwise chaotic world.I believe some scientists have recently pioneered work in ""dynamic quantum modelling"" or something like that. The idea is to use this unique ability of the brain to identify special structures that we would like to study, a tactic applied to big data where there is a lot of noise. I have a feeling consciousness lies precisely in this conceptual ability to model. Penrose in some sense thinks it is silly and says a video-camcorder pointed at a visual image of itself does not have self-awareness. Of course not. It does not have an internal modelling abillity. Unfortunately there's no saying what the substance of this conceptual modelling is. It seems, from introspection, that a model is simultaneously formed while being perceived, rather than being similar to a computable ""algorithmic model"". Therein lies its flexibility.Okay, so what then? There still remains a question whether conscious awareness can result from the appropriate algorithms. While I find the possibility disturbing, I don't find Penrose's objections very convincing. Except for the fact that turing machines have not been fed algorithms in a composite enough way to produce this elastic, highly visual and emotionally charged modelling throughout the past 60 years, there is nothing to say that it cannot resolve this impasse in the foreseeable future.Human ""insight"" is not at all some sort of algorithmic process, I believe, and neither is it statistical. It's associative, what ever that means. It takes disparate parts of conceptual models and combines them in the appropriate way we're searching for. Furthermore, just because an algorithm cannot prove all the statements within itself does not mean it cannot make non-logical guesses. This is essentially the basis of human reason, imo, the ability to arrive at the correct conclusion through a non-algorithmic process, even while the engine of that process may itself be algorithmic.So non-algorithmic decision making does not preclude the fact that its underlying structure is algorithmic in a certain way. Why can't pure consciousness with all its undecidability emerge from some non-static algorithmic process which constantly corrects and destabilises itself? Isn't that the function of consciousness, evolutionarily? To arrive at spontaneous and creative decision-making?Argh so many unanswered questions, and so many dim thoughts. Perhaps I should take a nap and give my conscious awareness a well-deserved break."
28,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19222551-russell-woolgar,3,"The Emperors new mind. This has been a long and at times difficult read. Penrose’s book poses me a paradox; the clarity it seeks through the complex explanation of maths, feels like it excludes those who are linguistically able. As Penrose himself states; language is not required for all thinking.I have taken away interesting concepts and a better understanding of the strong AI/consciousness debate. My understanding of this is as follows....What is consciousness? Can this result from complexity of structure and function, would such a conscious machine with complex algorithms have a mind? (Strong AI). The Turing test suggests that when algorithms convince us there is no difference, then we prove that this could be the case. However the Turing test is in effect a mathematical question, a binary representation of numbers and instructions. Is real Maths able to describe the real world, it exists yet we do not know everything, there is a difference between truth and provability, as proofs can live outside of Maths. The abstract world of Maths exists (Platoism) away from our minds, algorithms similarly help us prove a theory, yet it may not be real/true. In complexity theory; order and pattern can arise from separate complex units. Penrose believes there are three categories of theories. Depending on their ability to accurately predict, they are: 1. SUPERB – those that are inviolable; ancient Greek maths, motion, area, time 2. USEFUL – good at explaining many e.g. quantum & big bang 3. TENTATIVE – newer unproven Theories help explain how waves and particles move in space, quantum theories help explain how they keep their shape, and electricity & magnetism are waves, also effected by gravity, light and time. Physical objects are either particles or fields and interact within space/time in a relative way. When mass is lost it transfers to energy, energy flows from particles to fields, at a macro level – classical and a quantum level; it becomes a probability, there is an uncertainty, the location of particles becomes a probability (electrons, photons, neutrons etc) and hard to prove definitively. Quantum field theory, helps with this, particles and anti-particles exist together, measurement becomes both possible & impossible. But extrapolating from the single particle to the real world is too complex. Does this help us understand consciousness or require us to explore how many worlds/ universes co-exist. Single particles only exist in the context of others; an increase of complexity and relativity. A new theory is required to unite quantum and real world physics. The concept of entropy (decay) may help. We consume items with low entropy; fossil fuels, food, O2 and discard in high entropy form; heat, CO2, excretions, pollution. In physics high entropy is increased in gravitational bodies that clump e.g. stars, black hole, less so in gases. There is a gap in our knowledge; quantum gravity that attempts to explain how gravity works on the universe's smallest particles.The central theme of consciousness may be explained better when such gaps are filled. Is it mid-brain plus thalamus? Or plus other areas with the interaction of and product of language? If using maths to understand AI, but likely limited due to the complexity of the brain and its structure.The conscious/ unconscious mechanisms, and non-algorithmic action of the brain make things complicated. What is consciousness; it is active, self-aware, aware of others, creative, learning/decision making, truth seeking, the result of natural selection? How to judge algorithmic validity? What about experiences of ‘inspiration’ and the globality of an idea, combined with quantum randomness/ free-will these seem to be at odds with even complex mathematical models. Algorithms need to be decoded, requires intentionality. What is the link to the real world, some maths is non-algorithmic, there needs to be a connection between maths/theory & the real experienced world.What if language is not required for thought, that is a learnt and honed skill. In Plato's world of maths and truth, thoughts can exist outside.The future/time as compatible but not wholly determined by consciousness. Consciousness is strongly selected for as an advantage. Brain growth is a function of complex growth/nature – interaction of neurons and at an atomic level is non-algorithmic. Does consciousness effect how we respond or is it more automatic? But what if consciousness acts after an action to describe and rationalise, and the holding of an idea over time is the more active role. It is here where we become aware of our own universe, and where consciousness is likely to sit."
29,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68605174-damon-taylor,4,"This was a tough one. I appreciate in the first instance, of course, that the substance of the work is well beyond me - and having now finished the book I cannot help but feel I am marred by misapprehension. I have therefore taken that into account when giving a review. The unfamiliar but generally observant reader may have a working understanding of some of the ideas that form the core of Penrose's argument - Turing machines and computation; quantum gravity; split brain experiments, and so on. However, the length and depth of the work makes a mockery of the impressions the casual reader may have gleaned. That was certainly my experience, in any case - madly comparing my own, gossamer thin understanding of, say, Godel to its position as employed by Penrose. For this reason, it is well to take Penrose's early advice and take the time to understand and familiarise yourself with the equations and concepts employed. They are not there for window dressing, and in the final chapters these strands are braided into Penrose's conclusion - that 'correct quantum gravity' (a homebrew putative theory which explains how and why curvature of space time carries the features that it does) will, if proven, give us the technical skill necessary to explain consciousness. To so aggressively summarise, without context, what is a complex form of argument is unfair of me, which is why my review is not about this conclusion. Rather I have decided to judge this book on its capacity to contribute to my own personal response to the mind body problem. That is: is the me that is me - the thinking feeling awareness that *feels* unconfined while very clearly hemmed in by the brain - manifest only during the specific functions of a specific assemblage of specific cells? In other words, if a carbon copy of me was to be summoned into existence, would he and I share a consciousness? Or is that a distinct, discrete consciousness to my own - another, thinking feeling thing. Penrose's book provides insight in several respects. Firstly, much of the early text is occupied with the Strong AI theory - that consciousness is a consequence of complex computational systems, and therefore consciousness is not linked to a specific assemblage of human brain cells but is rather an emergent property of any complex system, regardless of medium. Penrose disagrees - he goes to great lengths to establish that computations of this kind cannot be the cornerstone of consciousness. This therefore encourages the reader to at least accept that something non computational, but still mathematical, about the way in which the brain consciously perceived information. The second is a personal challenge - Penrose marshals evidence against the claim that consciousness is bound up with language by providing examples, such as split brain experiments, of cases in which language manipulation and conscious thought were shown to be distinct. This is a personal challenge because I find it seductive and intuitive that consciousness and language should be tightly wound. Again, without technical expertise, fidelity I cannot provide to my intuition, so I shall not mount a counterargument. However, I should say that the case is hard to ignore, and one which will inform my views on the subject going forward. So how does this book contribute to my self-searching question set out earlier? - well I cannot say. Rather it has challenged my own proto-conclusions and views on the topic. As ever, the only real answer is to continue reading and writing - to expand my library and hope, someday, to better consider the world in which I live. For that, Penrose deserves 4 stars at least. "
30,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89321805-reddle,4,"What a book. This book only gets 4 due to the overwhelming technical detail, around the mid-part of the book I was probably giving it 3, towards the end I would've given it a 5 but I must not forget my earlier turmoil. It's hard to condense this array of technical explanations that attempts to manoeuvre to a theory of consciousness distinct from biological/quantum processes. Let's get into the book:For me this book had two parts: 1 was the technical juggernaut of the first half of the book which involved a lot of diagrams, new concepts previously unknown to me and this reflected in the length of time it took to finish this. Sometimes I felt I got through a substantial amount of the book only to find a meagre 3% increment, this largely resulted in me letting this book sit unattended on the shelf. Though, as I got to around 51% mark of the book the gears had kicked in and within a period of a day I had propelled through the rest with ease.At the start you're introduced to Classical Mechanics, the evolution from Newton to Einstein and then into Quantum Theory. This book addresses all manor of fields in physics illustrating how we measure behaviour and how it is often an approximation: Newton's laws of motion relating to macroscopic bodies are an approximation of the mass of an object omitting quantum behaviours that determine its structure and state of matter. Einstein with general relativity omitted quantum behaviour (with the exemption of the wavefunction), as we all know through his popularised quote ""God does not play die"". Then, we get into even the quantum mechanical descriptions of the universe where Quantum physicists don't accept The Vector State Reduction (R) over unitary evolution (U), R being just as feasible and essential to explaining quantum behaviour but due to its indeterminism it is omitted. What is the purpose of this book you may ask? Simply to express how some are so assured that algorithms rule the brain and how they produce consciousness, such that given a significantly complex classical computer program (an AI) could arise consciousness through emergent complexity from all the parallel processes a computer is tasked with doing. He does this by illustrating the lack of knowledge relating to both our universes: the internal one of the brain, which its still unsure how consciousness arises from neurons, and the external one of the universe: Why doesn't quantum behaviour scale to macroscopic size and vice versa? Most of what we think we know should be taken with a grain of salt, even the dominant science that prevails today. This was a fantastic journey for me, Penrose is widely accredited and he doesn't water down his explanations, which in the popularization of Quantum physics and AI has produced a lot of simplified books, erring on the mystery and allure of QM and AI. His second book 'Shadows of the Mind' is up next. Lastly, I want to address that indeterminism of the world around us shouldn't result in a default of mysticism. Rather, we should be skeptical that we know as much as we do and by default should question our assumptions of what is possible. Penrose went out in a limb here and there has been evidence supporting his idea of Quantum behaviour in the form of microtubules in Neurons, though this argument is not presented until his next book 'Shadows of the Mind'. If you have came here looking to read up on that particular theory then know it is not present in this book as I had previously thought. However, I didn't regret reading this one bit."
31,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8173124-george-marshall,4,"So, the last chapter felt like grasping.Putting that aside, the book is well written. The author's descriptions are vivid, graspable and powerful. I gladly look forward to reading more by Penrose, whether I am more inclined towards a strong AI bent or am eventually convinced of his speculations. I do feel the weight of his reasoning - the challenge: can an algorithm's complexity really give us intelligence, and more, consciousness? Whether quantum effects (or some deeper truth bridging the gravity/wave collapse picture) are the answer remains to further study.While initially I felt astounded by the audacity of a placement test for physical laws (superb, useful and tentative), it was an effective tool throughout the book. Even if one is uninterested in consciousness or AI, but appreciates physics, there is a lot to recommend here. It covers in breathtaking fashion both classical and quantum mechanics, though necessarily at a level removed from intense study of equations. Information theory is handled in part, though I kept feeling it should intrude more heavily. The book poses good questions and repeatedly gives a feel for what we don't know. Its optimism that we can find the answers, and that the answers will be better and more wonderful than we have settled for, is contagious.Bottom line, I enjoyed it immensely and think you, my friends, will too."
32,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,3,"Good introduction to common theoretical physics topics. An eh introduction to neuroscience. A good introduction to the mindTo compare it to Tegmark's ""My mathematical universe"" due to that book being a very similar text within the genre of ""intro theoretical physics"", penrose seems somewhat more open minded, but also much stranger. Much much stranger. He asserts the existence of plato's forms (in some iteration) , and even stranger, and goes so far as to propose the relation of quantum phenomena to sentience. Tegmark talks to the reader like they are a somewhat intelligent freshman in college, while penrose seems to presume the reader has a pretty solid grounding in physics. Maybe even on par with that of third year physics student. He often would state ""I'm sure the reader is familiar with.."" and then start talking about some esoteric topic that only physicists would know about. It makes you wonder about who he wished to read this..Penrose has a higher stress on quantum mechanics and math, tegmark on cosmology and the multiverse..Overall, even though I gave tegmark higher stars (due to my emotional response after first having read that), I preferred this text.."
33,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,5,"We are in 1989, Penrose starts with the hypothesis that consciousness is non-algorithmic therefore cannot emerge in computers. He is challenging AI researchers with a great deal of speculation before multi-core processors, the web and smartphones. But he did his massive homework and there is a sense of intellectual honesty throughout this book. He starts with Turing machines, passing through Gödel’s theorem, fractals, classical physics, quantum physics, the human brain and to end with the physics of the mind. Wow! The whole thing is edifying because he always point-out that physics in an unsatisfactory state (inconsistent) but keeps going with his speculative guesses. Perhaps his hypothesis is probably wrong for the same reason physics is currently inconsistent (classical + quantum), our machines are not so smart and we don't know how to simulate brains. That is, we are not so intelligent as we think!"

I took a slightly different approach this time and it was actually a much better read than I expected.The first parts are filled with hugely complex ways of looking at concepts that I thought I was already familiar with. It was (mostly) comprehensible as I read it, but I don't know how much I could repeat from memory now that I'm done.The author pretty much lost me at the end, where he's finally getting to the point of the whole book. His careful, pedantic style softens considerably as he goes off in a number of highly speculative directions. I see where he is heading with it, but I think he's taken too many liberties to get there, which leaves the conclusions somewhat muddy and, in the end, inconclusive."

Penrose, as a reaction to Hofstadter's ""Gödel, Escher, Bach"", claims that this is not possible without us first developing a missing piece of physics: Quantum Gravity, that would unite the Quantum standard model with Einstein's General Relativity.After reading the book, I have more questions than that I found answers. On the one hand that is dissatisfying, on the other hand a good book makes you think and does not necessarily present clear-cut solutions.

On second reading, I enjoyed the harder parts much more. Central to the book is Turing's contention that true, independent AI was not possible. Alan Turing must have been an amazing person; lurking in the back of my mind is what he might have achieved in the long term. He wrote a staggering, amazing paper on how leopards get their spots, morphogenesis, and another on oscillating chemical reactions, all of which have fundamentally shaped our reality.

63,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7915393-simon-mcleish,3,"Originally published on my blog here in July 1999.It is easy to lose track of what The Emperor's New Mind is about. It is intended as an examination of the claims of 'strong AI' from a fairly sceptical viewpoint (as the title indicates). The style aims at popular science, but it is difficult to follow and occasionally, I suspect, dauntingly full of complex mathematics (as a mathematician myself, I find this a little difficult to tell).The strong AI position is basically that it is possible for a sufficiently complex computer program to mimic the workings of an intelligent mind. In computer science terms, this is more precisely expressed by saying that the workings of the mind are algorithmic or computable in nature. Penrose's book naturally starts, then, with an explanation of these terms, together with a discussion of related ideas by Turing (the famous Turing test, and the Turing machine, which is one of the more accessible ways to define computability). He also talks about results showing that there are concepts which are not algorithmic in nature: the halting problem (there is no algorithm to determine in general if a computer program will ever complete its task) and Gödel's incompleteness theorem (which implies that there is no computer program which can mechanically prove every mathematical result about arithmetic). This first section ends with a digression into the lambda calculus, an alternative formulation of computability, which is extremely difficult to follow.The second - and longest - section of The Emperor's New Mind is an exposition of the physics that Penrose expects to lie behind the aspects of the mind that would be non-algorithmic: quantum mechanics and, in particular, the resolution of the differences between quantum mechanics and relativity. (This is one of the most important and most difficult problems in modern theoretical physics.) He postulates that the way this incompatibility will be overcome will involve the incorporation of an asymmetric time element into the theory, and this requires a discussion of thermodynamics and entropy. (The question of why time appears to flow and many events seem irreversible when the major physical theories behind them are indifferent to the direction in which time flows is another important problem in today's physics.)It is in this section, dealing admittedly with three of the most notoriously difficult parts of physics, that the limitations of Penrose's ability to write for the layman become apparent. His explanations seem to simplify in the wrong places, and complex mathematics is presented without sufficient textual exposition to make it palatable. He has not a great deal of space, but does tend to digress to explore areas of the theory that he finds interesting, but which are not relevant to his main theme. That would be fine in a book about quantum mechanics, for instance, but is misplaced when quantum mechanics is being introduced for another purpose.Following a brief description of the physical construction of the human brain and some experiments to do with consciousness, Penrose rounds off the book with his explanation of how the brain might work, contrasted with the ideas of strong AI enthusiasts. He is not in fact particularly concerned to detail reasons for finding strong AI unlikely, but is more interested with coming up with a physical description of consciousness which would be intrinsically non-algorithmic in parts. He does list some arguments against strong AI, including a most interesting couple of pages about mathematical thought, often considered to be one of the most strongly algorithmic modes of consciousness (because mathematical writing uses a style which can make proofs look rather like algorithms).The level of detail into which Penrose goes when explaining quantum mechanics and general relativity is unnecessary, and he would perhaps have been well advised to cut this section of the book considerably, expanding the final discussion about intelligence and consciousness instead. That discussion is, after all the main point that Penrose wants to make, the reason why he wrote the book. It is also the most interesting and lucid section. If you already know something about relativity and quantum mechanics, the rest of the book may well seem fascinating, but it cannot be recommended as an introduction to either subject.If I have been rather critical of Penrose's writing, it is not because I disagree with his position on strong AI, but because I feel that his style is not suited to a popular approach. (I would tend to think strong AI unlikely on intuitive grounds - the way I think and feel doesn't seem mechanically determined to myself - and therefore I would say that the burden of proof lies with its proponents.)"

66,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,3,"I was hoping for a deeper exploration. While interesting, Penrose's writing is clear and concise. He deals with exceptionally difficult topics in a lucid manner. Yet the book can be broken into three parts the last of which is weak.In the first part he talks about the computational aspect; human minds as computers. He details Turing machines and some of the complexities of making a logically consistent computational machine. Part of the problem, as he does not state clearly, is that logical systems merely mechanistically route consistency to a desired parameter. Our minds may be metaphorically computational, but they do have limitations that allow us to make quick decisions without calculating to the Nth degree. To solve this, he jumps towards physics.In the second part, he talks about classical and quantum physics, highlighting the reduction aspect in Schrödinger's theory as being a manner by which computation can make snap decisions. As always, Penrose is comfortable with high level abstraction, but seems unable to add more to the question of intellectual reduction beyond his whirlwind tour of quantum mechanics and physics theory.In the third part, which is meant to be a synthesis of the two, he examines the human brain as an organ and then tries to crowbar this reductionist aspect into the brain. His synthesis of the first and second parts is more than wanting. In fact, he spends so much time talking about physics just to introduce the reduction aspect, that this last part is less than 100 pages, less than 20% of the book. The first part is done extremely well. He is clear and concise. The bulk of the book though, 40% is with physics; and most of it is not used in explaining his highly speculative theory of intelligence.I think he could have spent more time tackling what intelligence was, and utilizing this reduction aspect (which admittedly fairly poorly understood as to why) to try and meld the gaps in Turing machine theory and computability. In a way this book isn't theoretical even though it deals with theories. Rather, it is speculation with theory -- although it is loose at speculation. Penrose merely presents one idea and says, hey maybe this works! With little to no explanation beyond that. Throughout the book he throws out ideas and hooks us with hey, maybe quantum mechanics and intelligence! And then says nothing much else on the subject. It is an intriguing idea, although he seems at a loss how to explain this without the use of math. I would suggest that perhaps he should try and find a way; it would be a stronger book if he was able to define the problem that reduction solves, and explain why that aspect would in fact entail intelligence and a mind.I could offer a conjecture but why should I? This is a review of his book. Despite his clarity and obvious intelligence it is a somewhat disappointing book. As an exploration it is well written but lacks a compass as to what he needs to do to make these abstract ideas work in the manner he suggests they should."
67,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4995129-richard,3,"I re-visited EMPEROR's NEW MIND recently because I have been reading and thinking (or trying to think) about consciousness. I didn't understand 75% of the book when it came out, and not a vast deal more now, but I persevere because of a (on my part largely groundless) conviction that Penrose is right to dismiss the proud Pollyannas of Strong AI, who claim it's inevitable that suitably complex, suitably structured computers will (not just behave as if they are conscious but) actually have qualia. I have an inchoate suspicion that EITHER Penrose is right (for reasons we don't yet understand, it will turn out that the AI program was always barking up the wrong byte altogether), OR there's a middle position along the lines of ""It's possible in principle - in the way that it's possible in principle to go out there and build a cube-shaped planet."" (In other words, it's never going to happen on the basis of anything that's within even the horizon of our current ability or understanding.) Something is missing in the AI arguments. Most of Turing's epigones, like the Master, speak as if consciousness is a matter of intelligence, or computational power. But most of our computation (how to balance correctly while dodging traffic, say) is wholly unconscious. Consciousness (and most of what's interesting in human communication through language) is actually about emotional states: this is why language is driven by metaphor and simile. And those states flood into our brains through our bodies' responses to what (mediated by the brain) our bodies perceives. (Think of this quale: walking down a street, seeing someone approaching, and then the AHA moment when you RECOGNIZE the person.) You can't have this 'thought' (= emotional state) without a body, and you can't have that sort of body without an actual, biological, evolutionary history. Which computers lack.OK, so this argument is garbage, and I'm way out of my depth. But still. It never ceases to amaze me that Strong AI people can write whole books about the mind, or anyway the Artificial Mind that they'll be building in their spare time next week, and end with a three-page section that says ""Oh yeah: conscious experience! Nearly forgot to mention it. That does remain a total and utter mystery. But it's a detail, and, you know, we'll figure it out."" The hubris is breathtaking. Penrose will have none of it, for which he is due some respect.For explaining horribly difficult technical ideas, he's a mixed bag: often far too mathematical from the outset (e.g. with most of the material on q-mechanics), sometimes the best there is (e.g. when explaining why v > c leads to paradox). But Roger! You need an editor who forces you to scale back on the exclamation marks! Please! It's really irritating! It's like being constantly nudged in the ribs! By someone in a pub who's not sure that you got the joke! Which wasn't all that funny anyway!"
68,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101336-stephen-dranger,5,"Anyone who enjoyed the popular Godel, Escher & Bach should give this book a shot. While it's not as ""fun"" as GEB (there's no dialogues or music or poetry), and not nearly as well-written, it IS every bit as instructive and mind-bending, and is almost a counter-argument to GEB's main thesis: can human thinking be modeled by a Turing machine? GEB says definitely, but Penrose says no -- and they both use Godel's incompleteness theorem to show it! Penrose even draws inspiration from art -- in this case, methods of tiling polygons -- to show that nature itself employs methods that do not correspond to an algorithm. (In my personal opinion as a computer scientist, since the 80s (the time these books were written), history has heavily favored Penrose's point of view: strong-AI continues to elude us.)This book takes you all through learning about Mandelbrot sets, computability theory, Godel's Theorem, tiling problems, to learning about the world view of classical physics and quantum physics. He finally pulls it all together with examining the brain itself. His ultimate conclusion is that the brain must use some as-of-yet undiscovered facet of quantum mechanics in order to non-algorithmically function. The book is very math heavy, but he apologizes for it profusely and insists that if you just try to understand it, you will get enough of what he's saying to enjoy the book. I myself am mathematically inclined, so I can't speak to that. This book is more logically terse and straightforward than GEB's poetic strokes, but I actually prefer Penrose's approach over GEB's: they both engage in wild philosophizing rather than mathematical rigor, but Penrose is much clearer when what he's talking about is, like, totally his opinion, man.(The proof that Penrose gives for showing that the brain cannot be modeled by an algorithm is, in a nutshell: Godel's theorem shows that given a set of mathematical operations and theorems of those operations, you can show that at least one theorem is true, but cannot be proven. However, mathematicians are able to communicate the truth of the above theorem to other mathematicians. If the brain were itself a Turing machine, then a algorithm would exist to prove the truth of that theorem; otherwise the mathematicians would not be able to communicate that truth. contradiction, qed.)"
69,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65288642-jeffrey-sung,1,"Roger Penrose is a brilliant mathematician and physicist, and I learned a lot about many things here, from the theory of computation, to quantum states, but honestly, the conclusion kind of comes out of nowhere. "
70,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/297848-mattie,4,"Penrose's basic premise is that, in his opinion, computers will never really be able to attain what we conceive of as human consciousness. Sounds like a pretty simple premise, huh? Don't be fooled. In order to really delve into what this means and assess the reasonableness of that deceptively simple premise requires the reader to think long and hard about sophisticated mathematical concepts, physics (classical and quantum), cosmology and even philosophy. Fortunately, Penrose seems to be not in the least daunted by this task and neither should the rest of us. Although its not an ""easy"" read, Penrose does an admirable job of trying to make all that complex information accessible(without hopelessly dumbing it down). Thus, for the reader willing to dive in, The Emperor's New Mind provides both a nifty compressed education and a bunch of utterly fascinating things to think about. There were some parts of his argument that I'm not sure hang together, but I'm also not sure that those parts were the keys to the premise. On the other hand, I think he is on to something in postulating that there is some theory that (1) we haven't yet figured out bridging the gap between classical and quantum physics and (2) that theory is likely going to tell us something important about the mathematical/physical nature of the ""mind."" Of course, I have to admit I don't really have a good enough grasp of the underlying science to offer an assessment that should be relied upon....After all this discussion of highly conceptual material and deep questions, and given Penrose's obvious desire to encourage a general readership to embrace the journey, I feel rather churlish in complaining about one particular aspect of Penrose's writing style. No book, especially no book about serious science, needs as many exclamation points as this book has! (!) Either Penrose needed fewer lattes while writing this, or his editor needed to stop trying to follow the math and pay more attention to the English. A nit pick, to be sure, but sheesh."
71,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024731-jonathan,4,"Phew! Roger Penrose certainly likes to write long books - my copy was 600 pages long. I may leave it a while before starting Road to Reality though!I first started reading this about ten years ago when I was studying physics and abandoned it once I reached the physics sections as it was too similar to what I was studying at the time. As I feel that I'm rapidly forgetting everything that I learned at Uni I decided to pick it up and start reading it again partly as a revision exercise (for the physics & maths) but also because I remembered being intrigued with his approach on my first attempt on reading it.I think the trick with reading this book is to enjoy the journey. I certainly found it difficult whilst reading the book in knowing 'why' certain chapters were necessary for Mr Penrose to make his point, but he does tie it all together in a way at the end. The main conclusion of the book is essentially that computers (as they are at the moment) should not be thought of as the same thing as a (human) mind as the mind does not just compute algorithms. The author supposes that the difference may be due to the quantum mechanical nature of the processes of the mind and future investigations into quantum gravity (a scientific theory that will hopefully combine General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics) may hold the answer.While reading the book I kept wondering who the book was aimed at. It surely can't be the usual target audience for popular science books as Mr Penrose certainly doesn't take much notice of the Hawking Equation Hypothesis that states that a book's sales will halve with each equation included. It's difficult to see anyone persevering much into the book who hasn't studied maths until 16 years of age at least. Though for anyone who is currently in their first year studying maths, physics or computing at Uni this should be an interesting read. I wish I had finished reading it on my first attempt and I'm glad that I took the effort to read it now. Enjoy!"
72,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/357277-dax,3,"If Ray Kurzweil is the biggeest advocate of intelligent machines that surpass human intelligence, then Roger Penrose may be the appropriate counterbalance to this enthusiasm. I followed Penrose in some of his black-hole research (with Hawking) but never read this ... I need to correct this omission. Well, *that* was a long book. Overall, I very much enjoyed the book and Penrose's writing. I will say that like Richard Dawkins, Roger Penrose can be a bit verbose and could use a good editor. The book is truly as advertised. It is a whirlwind tour through mathematics, computer science (complexity theory), physics, cosmology, and a bit of pyschology, physiology, and biology. That is a ton of 'ologies' and I found myself easily out of my depth on more than a couple topics here. Penrose does a great job of outlining the important takeaways of a chapter and reassuring the reader that it's okay if you don't follow the mathematics. He provides plenty of depth for those who want to dig more but also keeps things accessible for those who just want to get to the punchline. My biggest disappointment was that the book really didn't start putting forth his own theories on whether conciousness could be algorithmic (can a machine of sufficient complexity be a human?) until the last 100 pages of the book. I understand that Penrose was being timid about putting forth ideas that were unproven, however, I would have loved to hear all his thoughts on the subject and go into more detail on his theories even if they are out there.The book does do a good job of tying togeher the great mathetmatical theories in a way that school did not teach me. He explains how the theories of Maxwell and Einstein, etc, interrelate and how each added to their fields. Quite fascinating in it's own right but it just took a long time to tie that all back into his theory that the mind is just not a complex computer that works at the classical level today."
73,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33125404-eric-layton,3,"I can see why this book is considered a classic in this field. That being said, though, this book is HEAVY. I mean that it is a difficult read. Penrose has interesting ideas, but one can get the gist of his thesis by reading just the last 100 pages or so. The rest of the book is a build-up explaining the basics of Physics, laws of Nature, some human Biology, and a LOT of Mathematics explaining proofs of the discussed theories. This is definitely not for the general readership.I have a Science and Mathematics background along with years of studying Physics on my own, so I was able to muddle through alright. It's still a difficult read, though. Abstract thought and Mathematical proofs do not make for zippy reading. Penrose actually realizes this and apologizes for the the excess of both in his introduction. To be fair, he did warn his readership ahead of time. Don't shy away from this book if it's something that interests you. It took me a week to eat up 580 pages. I often had to reread sections two or three times to grasp what Penrose was trying to explain. This isn't a fault of his writing skills, which are excellent. It's because sometimes it's best to read something twice just to make sure you grasp the concept before moving on to something else. Foundations must be laid in order for full understanding to be achieved in writings such as this.Enjoy!"
74,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1263487-ezra,5,"i can't get enough of penrose. if you have any interest in artificial intelligence, or the computability of the real, you should read this. it was written in the late 80's, when the ""hard AI"" of marvin minsky et al was utterly ascendant. this is penrose's well-researched criticism, and it leads down some very interesting roads of quantum theory and noncomputable determinism to essentially argue that the human brain/mind is really not much like a digital computer.of course, since the 80's most people in the AI field have figured this out. embodiment and I/O is key, quantum computers are on the horizon. yet most popular discussions of machine intelligence center on a conception of the subject that was (i'm convinced) utterly destroyed by this book. i don't know that the conclusions are right. they're probably premature, and are certainly, to some degree, polemical, born of frustration with the then-prevailing strong-AI dogma. what's funny is that so many aspects of that dogma are still kicking around (like the number of people who think we can really ""simulate a neuron"" - we can, of course, only approximate one) - as numerical analysis becomes increasingly, totally accepted as an exact mirror of reality. there are things to be absorbed from this book that just seem to roll off people - like the fact that discrete-time models are *fundamentally* different from reality, no matter how fine you slice them.i think everyone should read TENM. penrose is such a brilliant, enthusiastic teacher, such a joy to read, and i feel smarter and more fired up after every chapter. by the way, i don't understand people who think this is ""too hard."" try ""The Road To Reality"" - many of the same topics, but it will kick your ass hard."
75,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17738039-michael,3,"Roger Penrose is a bright man. No one doubts this. He knows a lot about physics and math. No one doubts this either. Given those considerations, he should have cut most of the first 373 pages and got to his point. That point is, I think, that ""Strong AI"" won't happen because of a number of reasons, most of which aren't well formed. Many pages are devoted to discussion of processes being algorithmic (or non-algorithmic) and conditions being computable (or not). What's lacking is the consideration of the unknown versus the unknowable. Penrose is not shy about equating what is not understood (consciousness) with the unknowable or incalculable. But he is shy about why. And he hides behind 350 plus pages of (admittedly interesting) math and physics hoping you don't ask. What we have here is almost an appeal to status instead of a convincing argument. It isn't enough to invoke Gödel's incompleteness theorem and the mystique of quantum mechanics. If Penrose feels strongly that something is impossible, or even highly unlikely, he should make his case and support it with evidence. Instead he ambles through number theory and modern physics for quite literally hundreds of pages. I still don't understand why a chapter on quantum gravity is in a book about artificial intelligence. What happens is it comes off as ""I'm smart, trust me."" The first part we already knew as true. The second part, however, is something we should never do.""When a distinguished and successful expert states something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.""—Clever Trevor"
76,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5117764-ron,4,"This book sat on my shelf for a while and the pages started to yellow. It is dated also in the sense that Fermat's last theorem has been solved since the imprint I possess and no doubt other advances have been made in areas he touches upon. However, frankly it is one of the best reads I have encountered for a while. I suspect Penrose is a very good teacher and he is certainly a good writer. He is neither patronizing nor assuming of his readers. A lot of (popular) science writers make huge concessions of the audience and provide no mathematical detail, which alienates some of us, but Penrose navigates with great dexterity between possible audiences. He forewarns suitably where one might have to struggle with concepts but keeps the thread going nicely. The main concern of this book is computers, artificial intelligence and consciousness although at times you may wonder how some of the areas he describes might impinge on any of these areas at all;however Penrose is adept almost in a spooky way of anticipating and reassuring if not immediately meeting the reader's concern. He is not a supporter of Artificial Intelligence and makes strong points concerning algorithmic processing and computability being inadequate on their own to model a self conscious mind. Some parts of this book are harder going than others in the sense that they all might not be quite suited to the somnolent mind at bed time; indeed some may be better read with pen and paper to hand. However, worth persevering. Huge book, vast ideas and very very rewarding. "

Penrose takes us on a ""tour-de-Physics"" covering everything from Newtonian mechanics, to Einstein's general relativity, quantum mechanics, Turing's universal machines, computability, decidability, to Gödel's theorem, all of it in an attempt to make the reader reflect on the nature and the necessity of consciousness. Certainly Penrose's arguments and the pieces of evidence he discusses can be updates as the book was originally published in 1989. A great starting point nonetheless for whomever is interested in issues of this depth."
78,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2624548-robert-kroese,3,"Disappointing. Penrose spends an insane amount of time talking about mathematics, turing machines, physics (classical and quantum), and all kinds of other stuff before finally settling down on page 376 to talk a little about brains. (I'll admit to skimming much of the preceding stuff.) After a brief tour of brain biology, we get to the crux of his argument, which boils down to the fact that it's hard to imagine how any algorithmic process could produce what appears to be non-algorithmic thinking. ""Thus we are driven to the conclusion that the algorithm that mathematicians actually use to decide mathematical truth is so complicated or obscure that its very validity can never be known to us. But this flies in the face of what mathematics is all about!""This is a little like arguing that a man who wakes up at a bus station with no memory of how he got there must have been transported there by magic, because he has no memory or evidence of having been on a bus. Just because you aren't aware of the mechanism by which you got somewhere, it does not follow that that mechanism was something completely outside of your normal understanding of how the universe works. Not only is his argument flimsy; it's only tangentially related to the 300 pages of stuff you have to wade through to get there. My suggestion is to skim the book for stuff you find interesting but don't expect much in the way of a central thesis."
79,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1915261-scott-lupo,4,"Whew, finished it! These long books are killer. Roger Penrose first published this book in 1989 but has updated it along the way. I was hoping for more discussion on consciousness and artificial intelligence but it ended up being a long set-up first about quantum physics and classical physics and where/when one becomes the other. I'm not complaining. Penrose meticulously builds this knowledge brick by brick, even using formulas (eek!) and mathematical terms (double eek!). The breadth of knowledge is pretty amazing including Turing machines, entropy and flow of time, Godel's theorem, a little Plato, evolution, determinism in classical physics, all the craziness of superimposition in quantum physics, black holes, and then finally consciousness. In all, Penrose is arguing that algorithms alone cannot recreate a human mind. There is something unique that gives rise to consciousness that AI will never achieve. He believes it's located in the space between quantum physics and classical physics. We still don't understand when the strangeness of quantum properties become the familiar classical properties that we observe and measure on a daily basis in the reality we currently live in. It is there that Penrose believes we will discover where consciousness arises. Wow. That would be amazing but I'm skeptical. Overall, this book has a ton of information and is laid out in a way that makes it comprehensible. "
80,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4893739-jose,4,"Nice book, but if found it a bit hard to read (specially the quantum physics part). Also, I'm not sure the author linked its argumentation with the final conclusion in a very solid manner.Roger Penrose is a very well known prolific scientist. Many of his works have achieved international acknowledgement (e.g. have you heard of Roger Penrose's tesselation? Sure).This essay explores several aspects of ""Computation in the nature"" and in mathematics. Turing Machines, Quantum Physics and many other topics. Some of them were hard to me, as I am not very familiarized with Quantum mechanincs, for example.Besides its interesting topics, the book is an essay about whether computers would be able to have a continuousness and be 'self-aware' (self awareness). The author believes the answer to this question is NO and tries to defend its arguments mainly based on quantum mechanics.When I read this book I was much younger and agreed with the author. Currently I don't: Is the continuousness a quantum phenomena? The author believes it is, but to the moment this has not been proven. Even if it is, future machines might base on quantum computing."
81,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7022676-herman,5,"An excellent tour through the philosophy of mind. But be warned: this is no ordinary popular science book. Penrose dives deep into many different areas: algorithms, mathematics, philosophy, cosmology, classical and quantum physics, cognitive science and even some biology on the inner workings of the brain. The reader is guided through these areas in search of an answer to the question: ""Can a computer have a mind?"", or conversely, ""Can our minds be simulated by a computer?""Penrose argues against the Strong AI school of thought, which asserts that the human mind, and our consciousness, is a (very complex) algorithm that could in theory be simulated by a computer. In the end, I cannot say that this book convinced me of the truth of his standpoint, but it certainly does raise some doubts as to the truth of the Strong AI hypothesis. The Emperor's New Mind not only offers a look into the human mind, but also a look into the fascinating achievements it has made in the fields of science, mathematics and philosophy throughout the ages. I hope to read many more books like this one, but I doubt there will be many to find. Truly an exceptional work of popular science."
82,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7220776-toni,3,"I enjoyed reading this - Penrose's hypotheses of quantum mechanics and Godel's Incompleteness Theorem playing a part in ""consciousness"" is an interesting one, and he does a good job arguing it. As a determinist and someone who believes brains are Turing complete, I am firmly in the camp of those who would debunk his work - but it can't be denied Penrose is an very intelligent physicist and argues logical concepts well. I think the primary issue is, he is not a neuroscientist, and outside inherent fallacies that his arguments may or may not have, there are simple physical problems with Orch-OR that have already been brought up, such as Tegmark's paper. Penrose is firmly in the camp of those that see ""consciousness"" as something incredibly meta that needs to be explained by the ""magic"" that is non-deterministic quantum mechanics. However, as neuroscience learns more and more, this is less and less likely. Not an easy read by any means, but if you're interested in ideas of consciousness and quantum mechanics, definitely a good read."
83,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12687034-nicholas-teague,5,"Penrose spends almost the entirety of the book building the groundwork for the reader to absorb the meat of the book's final chapter. It is tempting to skip around such as I did in chapter 4 (while I thought to myself ""what on earth could this possibly have to do with the thesis"") but even that chapter's take on tiling and fractals turned out to be building an important concept central to one of final chapter's conjectures. As for the final chapter itself, it is gripping and ambitious, with most of the rest of the book a review of other's work, it is here that the author bridges key concepts and moves into new territory. I found a lot of similarities between the structure of this book and another from the author - the road to reality - a road I struggled with at times and unfortunately put down midway through, now I feel I have to pick up again if for no other reason than to see if the emporer's final chapter can be topped. My thanks to Scott Aaronson who recommended both books in an essay available on arxiv titled ""the ghost in the quantum Turing machine"". "
84,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19157485-justin,4,"Despite the premise of the book, most of it does not really deal with the subject of intelligence directly, or even indirectly in many cases. This book was a good overview of some of the most important results in math, computer science, and physics (mostly physics) throughout history. In my opinion, it was very technical, and I have a degree in electrical engineering, so I think most readers would find the book fairly un-readable. A degree in physics is probably necessary to truly understand the entire thing. His hypotheses about consciousness in the last few chapters are very interesting. Basically, he seems to believe that human consciousness and intelligence cannot result from any type of algorithm, but rather there must be some deeper more complex phenomena going on, which may have to do with results in physics that have not yet been determined, like the unification of general relativity and quantum mechanics (correct quantum gravity as he calls it)."
85,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25567974-darius,3,"""The Emperor's New Mind"" by Rodger Penrose is an attempt to survey the question of mind which takes two forms: the possibility of creating an artificial intelligence and what is mind in it's deepest nature. To achieve this goal he gives a very broad background and context which encompasses the whole reality as understood by modern physics. However, this physics is the standard textbook physics that one would find in university undergraduate courses. From this context consciousness (mind) doesn’t follow. The book is only an ""attempt"" to look into the ""possibility"". The reader doesn't get the answer to the question what is mind. It is only the first step, and this is the main drawback of the book. Of course, now this book may be seen as outdated (first published back in 1989). More than 20 years after the first appearance of ""The Emperor's New Mind"" the standard for tackling the problem of natural or artificial mind is much higher."

Roger Penrose has my highest esteem for writing such a lucid and deep essay on the mathematical nature of reality, consciousness, and quantum mechanics. I went into this skeptical about the claims regarding quantum entanglement I'd read about second-hand that Penrose makes in here, but they're actually quite modest and admittedly speculative. Penrose strikes me first and foremost as an empiricist and second as an extraordinarily capacious mind, one that can synthesize cognitive neuroscience (ca. 1990), quantum mechanics, and mathematics. The cognitive neuroscience stuff I tended to skip over since I don't need to read it (being a former prof of the subject myself) and so I cannot speak to its quality. But everything else was sublime.

But he nevertheless is able to make the case that the human mind is able to understand things no computer that operates according to any known principle will ever be able to do. He sites Gödel's completeness theorem as demonstrating that humans can stand outside logical systems. He also accepts that mathematics partakes of an independent reality from the human mind, also known as Platonism. Bob Godwin describes it thus: ""Platonism...claims that mathematics is descriptive of abstract entities, of numbers and sets, that exist separately from our attempt to understand them through our mathematical systems.""

The book's themes are superficially reminescent of Deepak Chopra with trying to connect quantum mechanics with consciousness, although Roger Penrose is much much smarter than Deepak Chopra and at least he accepts that he may be wrong. I wouldn't quite call it woo-woo like Chopra-talk but it is close. His assertation in the preface that microtubules inside our cells are the most likely place for consciousness (with no evidence) basically makes him lose all credibility in my mind.I will quote Michael Shermer, which I think sums up Roger Penrose.""Smart people believe weird things because they are skilled atdefending beliefs they arrived at for non-smart reasons"""

I also in particular disagree with the idea that pain or pleasure and/or other feelings are not algorithmic processes. I think we have explained those impulses as being directly related to electrical/chemical signaling processes in the brain, which operate in an algorithmic fashion. "

There is no evidence for this, simply the assertion that since consciousness must arise from somewhere, and it's not obvious how it arises from neurological function, then it must come from something more fundamental -- quantum physics. The problem with this thesis is twofold: 1) just because we don't understand how consciousness arises from neurological processes doesn't mean that it can't and 2) even if it comes from something other than neurology, why should that something be quantum mechanics?

154,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42000575-ian-murray-watson,4,A little long-winded but fascinating. It generally takes me 3 reads of a Penrose before I understand what he's talking about.

157,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44684447-frederick-smith,3,Penrose's logic is faulty. This book is well written and engaging but the logic of the argument was fallacious.
158,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50210102-kevin-shen,4,I need to reread this after studying A. I. for 2 years. Penrose's ideas are generally unpopular in the CS community which earns it merit to be reexamined.

Exploring a dazzling array of topics--complex numbers, black holes, entropy, quasicrystals, brain structure & the physical processes of consciousness--he demonstrates that laws even more wondrously complex than those of quantum mechanics are essential for the operation of a mind.Note to the ReaderAcknowledgmentsForewordPrologueCan a computer have a mind? --Algorithms and turing machines --Mathematics and reality --Truth, proof, and insight --The classical world --Quantum magic and quantum mystery --Cosmology and the arrow of time --In search of quantum gravity --Real brains and model brains --Where lies the physics of mind?EpilogueReferencesIndex "
172,0192861980,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7309374-romanas,5,"A bit old book on some subjects (AI), but still very inspiring and well written. I will probably read it once more. I like the way how Roger Penrose opens many new universes and some mind-boggling stuff for the reader."
