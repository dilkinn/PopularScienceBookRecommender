0,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"So, you are about to tuck into a lentil burger with chia seed extract for that omega three boast you know your body has been crying out for since your last detox, especially since you aren’t completely sure if the cannabis oil you’ve been baking into your gluten free cookies has given you indigestion or if it is the start of the stomach cancer you thought you might have had and was the reason why you started eating the damn things in the first place. The guy on the Internet who sold you the oil sounded damn convincing, but, then again, so did the guy who told you that you needed mega doses of vitamin Q – an extract from goat urine and krill that, if taken in large enough doses, might even make your hair curly.If this sounds like Tuesday, rather than a WTF moment, then this is a book you really, really need to read, and right now. Actually, no matter what your religion, you need to read this book. This guy is both very funny and very clever – these are, truth be told, two of my favourite things in the whole wide world. As much as I hate to admit it, I would probably forgive just about anyone anything if they can just display these two qualities – even only every now and again. But this book is also insanely important for you to read as well. In it you will learn stuff. Let me explain how I came to read it.A couple of weeks ago there was a newspaper article – no, a flood of newspaper articles all over my social media feeds – all about research that proved that you get cancer by bad luck rather than any of that other crap you thought you got cancer from – you know, ‘life style’, smoking, stuff like that. This might sound like bad news, but since there is stuff-all you can do about bad luck – even if you are a management arsehole who ‘makes his own luck’ – that then has a reassuring ring to it if you think about it for long enough. Pass the smokes and yes, I will have a double, no, stuff it, just leave the bottle. Except the next day or so another article appeared in the Guardian that said this first series of articles were all crap – AND that the reason why they were all crap was because journalists are too bloody stupid to know if a bus is up them, well, unless the passengers get out, and if you want to avoid being fooled again, read this book. So I did. And they were right. This is a necessary read – you’ve been repeatedly told that now – and I’m going to tell you again – what are you waiting for?What will you be told by reading this book? Well, one of the main things is that there are two things that have been repeatedly shown to lead to a healthy and productive life – eat food, mostly vegetables with lots of fruit thrown in for the colours if nothing else, and exercise. There is no magic pill, there is no secret wonder food, there is only that to know – eat stuff that is good for you and exercise enough so that your body doesn’t atrophy and you’ll probably be ok. No guarantees, by the way, life doesn’t come with guarantees, but do that and you are doing your bit, do less than that are you are building up Karma that’s going to get you, sooner or later. When people tell you that you need to do more than this eating food and moving your arse occassionally, they are selling you something, and the most likely thing they are selling you is bullshit. As he says, someone who tells the truth or someone who lies are similar in that at least both of them know there is a truth that is worth lying about – however, someone who bullshits doesn’t even give the truth that level of respect. It is embarrassing to admit the amounts of bullshit I assumed must have a bit of scientific backing behind them before reading this book. The most obvious one being the whole fish oil idea, hmm. But I’m guilty with an excuse. I am someone who really doesn’t like the taste of fish. There are times when I will eat fish – those times are directly correlated to when I’m in a Japanese restaurant – but I’m really not going to thank you for giving me fish. Particularly something strong and oily like sardines. I can understand why some people might want to put sardines into other people’s mouths – just as I can understand waterboarding – but to willingly do this to themselves is a form of flagellation I’ve never quite understood – torturing others, fine, but yourself? Not even Dick Cheney water boards himself. I know, there are international conventions on this sort of thing, but they are all so 1945, don’t you think? So, if you want to put sardines in your mouth – and I feel a bit queasy even suggesting such a thing - well, that’s up to you, but I still have to come down on the side of Nuremberg when it comes to doing this to other people.This reluctance of mine to eat fish in general, but oily fish in particular, has made me prone to the idea that I probably should have fish oil supplements to make me smarter or to prevent arthritis, or one of the other wondrous things these oils do. And, if ‘odourless’ wasn’t a cruel hoax, I would be using these tablets today. Fortunately, the problem is that there doesn’t seem to have ever been any conclusive evidence that taking these tablets does any of the things attributed to them, or at least they don’t make you smarter.This is where you are supposed to say, ‘Yep, and that is because of the drug companies – there’s no money in patenting something natural and so they refuse to pay for the research’. Except, the people who do make these tablets make bucket loads of money – so why don’t they pay for the research? Simple answer, they are not interested in ‘proof’, they are only interested in your general feelings of unease mixed with a medical sounding science-y enough sort of vague idea with the right ‘vibe’ that encourages you to buy the damn things in the first place – they don’t expect them to ‘work’, other than psychologically to let you think you have done your bit to improve your health without that ‘bit’ involving you actually eating better food or shifting your arse now and again. How sad we have become when we actually seem to believe that all cures come in pills.This bit of the book, the bit on fish oils and how the company that produced them gave out millions of the damn things in a study (well, not really a study) to see if they would make high school students smarter, is perhaps the most disturbing part of what had been up to this point a quite disturbing enough kind of book to be getting on with. Want to know why kids might not do so well at school? Well, then start looking at the actual diets they have, look at their social class and the stresses and strains that puts on their lives and their ability to study (you know, like not enough food in their stomach, no where quiet to do homework, constant humiliation because they can’t afford pens, paper, uniform, excursions, sports fees) before you give them some crap pill as a cure-all. As is pointed out here, the pills given to these students would have cost more than the school lunches they got.The other things this book will help you understand are, in no particular order – the Hawthorn Effect, the Placebo Effect, why you shouldn’t listen to someone who gives you statistics that are based on percentages, rather than in actual numbers in the population, why your kid needs their MMR jabs – just frigging do it - and how to know if something about medicine is probably bollocks – HINT: if a journalist is telling you and it sounds exaggerated, it probably is and you should probably ignore what they are saying. In fact, one of the best cures to most social ills would probably involve banning journalists from, well, just about everything. Unfortunately, it seems that journalists main qualification in life is that they can write rather convincingly about things they know next to nothing about – how we have not descended into utter oblivion already is one of the mysteries of modern living and one that is still open to speculation. That rational people constantly predict the end is nigh isn’t surprising, that we haven’t all drowned in a sea of pomegranate juice is what is surprising.Like I said at the start – you need this book. Not least so that when you decide you are going to start eating berries with names you can’t even pronounce it won’t just be because Oprah has them on her superfoods list, but because they taste nicer than raspberries – which is basically the only reason one should eat just about anything."
1,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"10-star book Edit - I have edited the review as the book is now available in the US. Truly a worthwhile read, one up for us against big Pharma!Until recently this book was not available in the US as books that attack big Pharma, alternative medicine gurus (especially the tv variety) and sacred cows like the MMR-Autism myth get sued just to stop publication even if there is no hope of winning the suit. This is an important book and illuminates the part the media plays in the dissemination of information - truths, half-truths and outright (but very profitable) lies in the medical, health and nutrition fields and why we are taken in. Why the truth is both deliberately and in a very cavalier manner hidden from us by all that stand to make a buck, even peripherally like some columnist for a news rag. It also explains, after a fashion, the still not properly understood placebo effect and why therapies that can have no possible physical effects whatsoever, particularly homeopathy with its dilution of the active ingredient to the nth degree, still work! We are amazing! The book is too."
2,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a marvelous book about people getting science--mostly medical and nutritional science--really really wrong. I was struck by an amazing coincidence from the very first page. Just two weeks before I read this book, a friend described to me the foot bath that he had undergone, exactly as described in the book Bad Science. He is scientifically oriented, so he was just flabbergasted when the procedure left a brown sludge in the foot bath, but the treatment removed all the pain in his knees from some injury for a couple of weeks. He had no idea how the treatment ""worked"". Very likely, the placebo effect was working.Dr. Ben Goldacre is a psychiatrist, and a weekly columnist in The Guardian. He describes many techniques for spotting ""bad science"". He traces the history of all sorts of wild, so-called ""science-based"" gimmicks, like ""Brain Gym"", homeopathy, anti-oxidants and nutritionists. Goldacre analyzes why people like to believe in stupid things. Goldacre does not beat around the bush--he calls a spade a spade. He calls the pharmaceutical industry ""evil"". He describes dozens of subtle, hard-to-catch statistical gimmicks that are frequently used to justify licensing pharmaceutical drugs. I just loved the quote by Richard Feynman: You know, the most amazing thing happened to me tonight. I was coming here, on the way to the lecture, and I came in throught the parking lot. And you won't believe what happened. I saw a car with the license plate ARW 157. Can you imagine? Of all the millions of license plates in the state, what was the chance that I would see that particular one tonight? Amazing... Goldacre traces the history of the anti-vaccine movement, starting with paper written by Dr. Anthony Wakefield on the relationship between the MMR vaccine (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) and autism in children. It was published in The Lancet in 1998. Wakefield immediately earned about $70,000 for his research, by lawyers who were suing on behalf of parents of autistic children. Eventually he was to receive ten times that much from a legal aid fund. While the paper was truly bad, Goldacre finds most of the fault in the anti-MMR scare not in the paper itself, but in the media frenzy that followed it. The media picked up the story and uncritically pushed the story to the public. Goldacre writes, ""... bullshit has become an extremely important public health issue, ..."" The media fail science spectacularly. While newspapers have specialized health and science correspondents who understand science, but ""editors will always--cynically--sideline those people and give stupid stories to generalists, for the simple reason that they want stupid stories. Science is beyond their intellectual horizon, so they assume you can just make it up anyway.""This book is definitely eye-opening. It is well written, engaging, humorous at times, but at the same time completely serious. And, after reading this book, you will be in a far better position to objectively evaluate the quality of medical research. Highly recommended!"
3,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"This book is both fascinating and frustrating, and illustrates that the only way to get the real info on anything is to be a scientist. Data scientist, research scientist, medical scientist, science scientist, mad scientist... But the good news is that one doesn't need to be a PROFESSIONAL scientist in order to get to the truth of an issue, but one just has to have the kind of critical thinking that a good scientist applies. After all 87.3% of people know that 77% of statistics can be made to show anything at all, and 31% of statistics are made up on the spot. It's a real problem, because 68% of all people believe 54% of all statistics they encounter, and question only 1.8% of them. And those only because they are less than 45% in agreement with their pre-determined position on the topic. So, what all that means is that you should dust off your bullshit detector. I know that I've had to pull mine out of storage. (There were birds nesting in it. I've relocated them to a lovely tree in my back yard. They're settling in nicely. ) There is just so much conflicting information out there that it can be hard to know what is real and what isn't, and this book seeks to help you educate yourself on how to find out. And it takes work. You have to be willing to dig for info, and not just fall into line with the first scare-tactic headline you read. You have to be diligent in not only doing your own research but being analytical enough to make sense of it, and open minded enough to accept it as the truth, even if it's not the answer you wanted. You would think that so much of what is related in this book would be common sense, but it is kinda scary how much stock people put in a sensational headline, or a passionate celebrity with anecdotes to spare. I totally include myself in that, and I don't fault anyone for trying to raise awareness to an issue that they feel passionately about. But manipulating facts to make a claim, or having no facts at all and just going by what sounds plausible or ""feels"" right is not OK, especially if it means that society is put at risk because of a fear of vaccinations. For example. This book is kind of a hybrid of The Panic Virus: A True Story of Medicine, Science, and Fear and Idiot America: How Stupidity Became a Virtue in the Land of the Free (both of which I highly recommend), but with more scientific method... and bringing more awareness to the bullshit method. And it was great. Enlightening and eye-opening, but there's a flaw in Goldacre's reasoning about some things, and it bothered me just enough to drop a star. Throughout this book, Goldacre talks about manipulation possibilities for clinical trials, ways that they (drug companies, etc) can make the product they are testing (and spending many millions of dollars to develop) look as beneficial as possible. This runs the gamut from testing them against placebo, or inaccurate doses of a competitor's drug, so that theirs comes out performing better, or the competitor's drug causes side-effects from the inaccurate dosage, or running a trial for longer than originally designed (until the data bears out better results) or shorter (so that the results don't start going downhill after a good start), or selectively choosing people more likely to respond well, or not randomizing, or not blinding the study, or moving the goal posts (drug was developed as a pain reliever, but didn't perform well for that purpose, but people are dropping weight like a bad habit, so now they're calling it a diet pill), or just not publishing (or purposefully publishing the study in an obscure place), etc. All these methods of manipulating the results or making it hard for people to find out what was actually in the study, and yet Goldacre still puts a lot of credence and trust in published studies in general. While I, the cynical one, am sitting here thinking: Why do you assume that they aren't lying? Why do you assume that they are going to publish that they gave the improper dosage of a competitor's drug in the trials? They have a stake in ensuring that their drug comes out on top, and it's clear that manipulation happens, so why would anyone think that it would then be published in their report? Is it not likely, if they lack ethics enough to manipulate the data in the trial itself, to then report that they did not? I just felt that assuming that reports are going to accurately reflect EXACTLY what was tested is a stretch, especially when we're talking about people and companies with a financial stake in marketing their product, and questionable, shady ethics. Anyway... aside from that one thing, this book was great. I really enjoyed it, and felt that it was the right mix of serious and humor, as well as the right mix of science and narrative. I definitely recommend this. The audiobook is pretty great as well. I liked the reader a lot. "
4,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60866073-baba,3,"Actual real proper medical doctor Ben Goldacre disassembles some of the biggest :cough: bullshitters supposedly sharing medical, health and/or nutrition theories or even cures at best just placebos, or at worse harmful, who in many cases have their voices amplified by the media. Although this book is really informative, interesting and at times funny, it also has an elitist edge to it, one that I can see Goldacre really tried not to give.He also was at pains not to make it like a text book, bit it sure felt like it at times, and maybe this is the reason why false narratives do so well, because they are made to be easily assimilated; whereas the truth, like what Goldacre produces here cannot be so simply put, because reality is not simple. 7 out of 12."
5,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2858613-tania-kliphuis,2,"I wish that I could give this book 4 stars. I tell you what, I give the idea for this book 4 stars. Unfortunately though, the execution wasn't so fantastic. That said, I do think that anyone interested in the way that the media are able to influence public opinion about serious matters, and in the recent explosion of health-related reality TV should give it a read. It is an interesting book if you can get over the shoddy editing and Goldacres' pomp and ceremony.Goldacre insists that this should be ""an entertaining read"" but it just falls short. Whoever edited it allows Goldacre to be all over the page, which is unnecessarily distracting. Certain catchprases are also overused, which again makes me wonder who the editor was. That said, he probably fought his publisher tooth-and-nail to ensure that his precious book didn't lose its ""essence"" or something. For all of his insistence that ""Humanities graduates"" (the journalists) don't have the knowledge and wherewithal to write scientific news reports, Goldacre and his fancy-pants BSc perhaps should have hired one to help him write an entertaining non-fiction book.Which brings me to my final gripe about the book. Goldacre has a condescending attitude towards anyone who does not have a BSc. In fact, people who do have a BSc but have not had the opportunities to find a career in which to use it also get an irritating ""oh shame"" moment from him. Actually, Ben Goldacre is just condescending. This is a great pity because these are the very audience he has written this ""entertaining read"" for. So, yes, it's ok. It will certainly put you off homeopathy. "
6,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66513638-gtf,4,"After reading 'Bad Science' I don't think I will believe another health fad ever again. Ben Goldacre's impressive aptitude for scientific analysis and research reveals how science is more complex than we realize, which unfortunately doesn't always satisfy our want for quick fixes to our health problems. Although more complex in nature, Goldacre stresses that people are not incapable of understanding scientific facts or findings, it is often just a matter of people receiving false information through the media by people who believe they have figured out solutions to certain health problems. Goldacre covers everything from the power of the placebo affect, the MMR and the MRSA hoaxes in 90s, mainstream medicine, homeopathy, nutritionists cherry picking the truth, and he even takes an unbiased stance on the pharmaceutical industry, and admits that while there are sometimes unethical tactics used by some people in the pharmacy industry, it does not mean that science and medicine are out to deceive people. Goldacre repeatedly mentions that there are plenty of people in this field who care about the truth, and who are vying for the truth to receive recognition. It is amusing to read about Goldacre simply debunking a lot of mickey-mouse-science out there, but there is a more serious side to this reality, including how some scientists don't know how to correctly interpret research, how a worrying amount of incorrectness is being taught in universities in nutrition courses, and how actual scientific findings are being ignored for not being fun or marketable, and thus people not receiving possible treatment for potentially deadly conditions. This book would be a very enlightening read for anyone. My four-star rating is purely due to the fact that I prefer to read fiction, not because I can refute anything that Goldacre says."
7,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44824883-paul-e-morph,5,"This book has some important lessons to impart and, as loathe as I am to tell anybody what they should or shouldn't read, this is one of the few books I wish could be made compulsory reading.Goldacre writes with passion about subjects that are clearly important to him and yet still manages to write conversationally and with good humour. Parts of this book made me laugh out loud and parts of this book, sometimes less than a page later, made me both angry and desperately sad. One chapter (on the MRSA debacle in UK hospitals) actually brought tears to my eyes.Lessons this book illustrates extremely well:1. Correlation does not equal causation.2. 'Anecdotal evidence' barely qualifies as evidence at all.3. Research must be performed correctly, with a control group and a large enough trial group for the study to be statistically significant. Oh, and without a pre-existing bias, obviously.4. Evidence should be checkable and from a reliable source. If medical 'research' has only been published in a colour Sunday supplement in a tabloid newspaper, it's most likely not worth the paper it's written on.There are many other lessons to take away from this book but if I add more I run the risk of just paraphrasing the entire book and the author has explained it all a hundred times better than I could. Just read the book. I promise you you will learn something and be entertained along the way."
8,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,4,"Ben Goldacre is a man with a mission. A UK doctor who writes a column for the Guardian, he'd like it very much if people would stop making their health decisions on the basis of crap science.Unfortunately, there is an awful lot of crap science out there. So Goldacre does his best to educate people about how to tell the difference between the good, the bad, and the ugly.Along the way, he entertainingly uses the usual suspects of homeopathy and foot detox baths to illustrate his points. But he also takes on something called ""Brain Gym,"" a UK school program supposedly designed to improve learning, the rather outlandish claims of cosmetic cream manufactures, famous (in the UK at least) TV ""nutritionists"" pushing their own lines of fancy supplements, and the entire pharmaceutical industry.In the process, he strives to help readers understand why so much of the science reported in the media is unreliable. His section on media distortions of science was among the most valuable parts of the book. He highlights the malignant tendency of the media to publish sensationalistic scare stories based on only the thinnest of evidence. One of his hints to keep in mind when reading a new story - if a doctor announces an incredible new breakthrough via press release, rather than peer reviewed journal, be very, very skeptical.The book was written in 2008, after Andrew Wakefield's paper linking the MMR vaccine to autism had already been withdrawn, but before he was found guilty of the outright fraud he actually perpetuated. Goldacre spends a section reviewing this scare in detail, pointing out that the media's later vilification of Wakefield would never have been necessary if anyone with a basic understanding of science had written the story to begin with - the original paper was so flimsy it didn't warrant the attention it got even if it hadn't turned out to be fraudulent.It's Goldacre's discussion of the MRSA scare in the UK that is even more disturbing, however, as he demonstrates how this scare was essentially fabricated by a media hungry for sensational news. I'm not sure I agree with him that this is the fault of humanities-trained journalists who think science is subjective and therefore feel justified in giving equal time to totally unqualified ""experts,"" but there's no question the media's habit of reporting shaky sensational findings and completely ignoring follow up studies showing the original stories were in error is seriously hazardous to our health.It was also interesting to hear his theory that part of the reason that pharmaceutical companies are prone to sensationalizing mediocre results is because the low-hanging medical fruit has already been harvested. During the middle part of the century, phenomenal life-saving breakthroughs were happening all the time. Since the mid-'70's, however, very few of these have occurred, which Goldacre suggests is the reason why Pharma has turned to ""medicalizing"" common complaints and pumping up iffy research findings in effort to preserve profits.His chapter on HIV denialism in South Africa was also very enlightening. He explains the cultural and political factors that combined with bad science to result in a devastating governmental policy of recommending beetroot to AIDS patients instead of antiretroviral drugs.Goldacre has real faith in the ability of non-scientists to understand the basics of what makes good science if they have the motivation to do so. But the overwhelming abundance of crap science in all areas of our lives has resulted in what he calls ""corrosive intellectual side-effects."" While it may be harmless in the short term for people to indulge in a little homeopathy every now and again, the damage and death from things like declining vaccination rates and HIV denialism is all too real. This book offers a powerful inoculation against that disease. "

You knew that, I know. Can't just be me whose mind is stuffed with the lyrical junk of six decades.Onward to the review.Ben Goodacre is the sworn foe of all modern-day medical mountebanks, and there's a whole internet full of those around, more than you can shake a juju stick at, so he has a lot to do and he bounds out of bed each morning and rattles off his Guardian column about – let’s say – homeopathy and just how REALLY INSANE it is – then jumps in his E-Type Jag and straight to the airport where a plane is waiting to take him to Minnesota where the local tv station in St Paul is about to interview Dr Cleothilde Barnfather who is recommending everyone to take fishoil pills every day, but only particular ones enriched with antioxidants and infused with chlorophyll, yeah that’s right, only his own brand Barnfather Live Forever Fish Oil (tag line “they’re easy to swallow because they come from a fish”) – now then, brave Ben is about to reveal the author of the bestselling Fish Oil Will Enable You To Outlive Your Great-Grandchildren as none other than... (gasp) Randy Merckenschlitzfer, failed used tumbledrier salesman and no doctor at all – his PHD was obtained through the post from some institution in Albuquerque which frankly no one has heard of including the janitor of the block of flats in which it is supposed to reside (Ben has checked) - hah! Take that! And that! Where’s your double-blind randomised clinical trial for your fishoil pills “Doctor Barnfather”, or should we say Randy? Oh, there never was one? How not surprised I am! Viewers, this guy is a FAKE. Naturally, everyone goes on buying the fishoil pills and Randy buys another swimming pool, this one made in the shape of a haddock, and Ben Goodacre writes some even angrier columns about it and feels marginally better, just as Randy’s customers do.Knockabout aside, this book exposes the shoddy thinking and egregious lust for non-existent breakthroughs, miracle cures and health horror stories which bedevil the British press and which are perpetrated by humanities graduates who do not understand scientific method or basic maths. Two are given the full treatment (the MRSA hospital superbug non-epidemic and the MMR-vaccine-causes-autism hoax) and many other rubbish claims are debated in a breezy manner which – alas – all sounds like preaching to the converted to me, and also scores uncomfortably high on the science-nerdometer for this English/Theology graduate.There are graphs. You have been warned."
10,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"I knew there was a lot of bad science & horrible media coverage out there, but I had no idea just how bad. This isn't a book just about that, though. While Goldacre does give some very good examples, he spends a lot of time teaching the reader how to spot bad science specifically in the field of medicine. I knew a lot of it, but the only statistics class I took was quite a while ago. The refresher was needed.As Goldacre so aptly shows, numbers can easily lie, especially when blasted on headlines & interpreted badly to sell the news through sensationalism. ""Deaths rise by 50%"" sounds like a major crisis. It might not be a lie, but when the reality is that deaths are up from 4 in 10,000 to 6, I feel lied to. That's tough on the people involved, but not statistically significant.He takes both homeopathy & big pharma to task, shows where & how both lie. He also shows where they don't. Homeopathy might not physically be any good & is full of hucksters (He says they're not liars, just bullshit artists.) but he goes into some detail about the healing powers of our minds. The Placebo Effect is a lot more involved than I had thought. It explains a lot about all sorts of faith healing.He spends quite a bit of time showing the media irresponsibility when they cause public panics especially in the case of the MMR vaccine. That began back in the mid 90's & the effects are still haunting us. While the media reported the sensational & absolutely fraudulent claims linking MMR vaccine & autism, they didn't devote any effort to correcting the story. That means we still have idiot actors telling people about the imaginary evils of vaccination & outbreaks of debilitating & deadly diseases that were almost wiped out before the current insanity.All in all, a great read. I recommend it to everyone, even if you don't agree with his take on everything. The tools he teaches are needed in today's complex world. If you want to know more, check out his website:http://www.badscience.net/"
11,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"A readable romp through the misuse and abuse of health related science in the media. The analysis of homeopathy, mrs McKeith and the brain gym seemed like shooting fish in a barrel, but then I remember that people make a lot of money marketing that kind of nonsense.Although it is all very entertaining a book is perhaps not the right tool to use against such a Hydra (unless the edition is so very big and heavy that it requires a Hercules to wield it in battle), this is perhaps an example of the move from blog (view spoiler)[column in fact but that does not alliterate  (hide spoiler)] to book being in the wrong direction. Every season will bring its own quackery."
12,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"""Just as the Big Bang theory is far more interesting than the creation story in Genesis, so the story that science can tell us about the natural world is far more interesting than any fable about magic pills concocted by an alternative therapist."" Well, no. Stories are important. They tell us what people's preoccupations are, what people want and what they're scared of. Scientifically, Goldacre's right -- but science isn't the only thing to be concerned about. I'm sure he'd think this reaction typical of an arts student who has a belief system that, wishy-washy, may or may not involve a god, and who rather defends people's right to believe whatever damn fool thing they want to as long as they don't force it upon me. That's very much Goldacre's style -- flippant, funny, but at the core you get the sense that he'd like to hit you over the head with the book to batter the concepts into you. Science Is The Only Thing. If You Can't Test It, It Isn't Real.For what he's talking about -- ""brain gym"", which I was subjected to, for example, or homeopathy -- he's totally right, but the way he talks just sets my teeth on edge. I'm quite sure we couldn't get on if we got onto questions with subjective answers. So yeah, his writing about science is good, and perfectly clear to a relative layman (I did a biology AS level, and my mother's a doctor, though), but something about his attitude just narks me.I mean. ""The people who run the media are humanities graduates with little understanding of science, who wear their ignorance as a badge of honour. Secretly, deep down, perhaps they resent the fact that they have denied themselves access to the most significant developments in the history of Western thought from the past two hundred years...""That's a direct quote from Goldacre. And watch! I can do it too: ""The people who [write books like Bad Science] are [science graduates] with no understanding of [the important things in life], who wear their ignorance as a badge of honour. Secretly, deep down, perhaps they resent the fact that they [do not understand the power of stories, and resent their limitation of thinking that Western thought is the pinnacle of human achievement].""Oh, and SSRIs: to be honest, I do subscribe to the theory that if they work for me, I'd rather not question it. (And they do. I haven't reacted to them in the exact way I'd been told I would: I had no side-effects, for example, and they began to work fairly quickly. Within a couple of weeks, all the major symptoms of my depression were gone, and though I wept when my grandfather died while I was on antidepressants, my feelings were in proportion to the event, unlike when my dad's mother died and I took to my bed for a week. I have not experienced any increase in anxiety, or that much trumpeted criticism that SSRIs make people want to kill themselves.) So I'm probably too biased to accept a word that Goldacre says on the subject, even forgetting the fact that a close relative has done research into antidepressants and I typed up their results! Of course it would be galling to accept that SSRIs are rubbish and I've been duped. But still, even trying to keep my own bias in mind, that doesn't sit right with me. I wonder -- has Goldacre written anything about his own biases? My humanities degree has at least taught me that no one acts without some kind of stimulation. If you're looking at post-colonialism in literature, it's probably because the theory speaks to you (in my case, because I'm Welsh and some postcolonial theory can be applied; for others it's the issue of kyriarchy, the way that all kinds of things intersect, so that racism sometimes looks and acts a bit like sexism or homophobia, and so the theory can be applied elsewhere). If you're a feminist, you can find sexism in every text you read (and I'm not saying it isn't there, or you don't experience it as there). More harmlessly, perhaps, I'm a lover of Gawain, and I can interpret any given text as sympathetic to Gawain based on the social mores of its time -- or it's a shitty book, of course.So yeah, watching Ben Goldacre froth in this book made me sort of want to know why it's so important to him. That's a bit of an ad hominem attack on his work, I suppose, but I do wonder how careful Ben Goldacre is to make sure he doesn't just find the results he's looking for, as he accuses other people of doing, or if he assumes that because he's debunking it in other people, he's immune.ETA: As I am now more than halfway through a biology degree, I'm tempted to revisit this book and see what I think now. Watch this space!"

It's not that he thinks purveyors of crystal healing, homeopathy or the wannabe scientific but far from terrific ""nutritionists"" should be soundly horse whipped weekly or even fortnightly, but that he wishes they would stop pretending to be what they are not which is science. The other target of his ire is the media, the scare-mongering, the cry wolf-ers who were up to their necks in the MMR scare-mongering without understanding more than a tiny fraction of the whole story. With regard to MRSA he gob-smacked this cynical reader with the information that the ""scientist"" who was coming up with the +ve results for the newspapers was working from his garden shed, done up with pieces of kitchen fittings and sub-standard scientific apparatus: The Walter Mitty of the world of micro-biology no less!He's also interesting, though it is by no means a central part of the book, on the attractions of the quick (quack?) fixes to deal with complex problems within society. The account of the Teeside Fish oil fiasco is fairly disturbing, as is the bizarre (and trademarked) exercises that are apparently carried out in hundreds of schools across the land. Hopefully this aspect of his writings will be explored further in a later book.Totally recommended, Goldacre is an effortlessly witty writer and by some slight of hand. . . sorry . . . by rational explanation he makes statistics, especially those relevant to the study of the efficacy of medical treatments, entirely comprehensible. 100% recommended. A first step to immunising yourself from irrational medical nostrums, saving yourself a pile of money as well as having a well earned laugh."
14,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14386596-christopher,4,"Audiobook. The guy doing the audiobook has a ton of passion.---------------------Bad Science is an excellent book about how to approach news articles about scientific papers. He goes over what flaws to look out for in the studies themselves, as well as the common ways journalists completely screw up reporting about subjects they don't always understand. In particular, he focuses a lot on homeopathy and the MMR autism link (which doesn't actually exist), both of which he destroys. The takeaways from this book are how to identify shoddy reporting, what questions to ask about research to know if it is shoddy research, and a deep distrust of anything you're ever told. :pThe most interesting bit to me, as someone who is used to not trusting reporters' science articles, was the bit on the placebo effect. This was by no means a new concept, but the depth of it is staggering. That four sugar pills are better than two sugar pills for treating pain is insane. That red pills are better than yellow pills for treating pain is nuts. There is more, but I am wary of misquoting it, so I'll stop. Just note that the placebo effect defies every bit of good sense you have. My primary complaint about the book is the tone. It is amazing when he is preaching to the choir as he is with me, but he calls a spade a spade. He has no problem calling Big Parma evil, nor some researchers frauds (by name), nor calling some journalists incompetent. If you currently believe in homeopathy, you might find yourself insulted too much to listen. He doesn't mean to. His anger is firmly directed at greedy businesses, stupid/unethical/greedy researchers, and terrible journalism that is telling you lies as truth. But I can see how one could take his attack on homeopathy (and various other things) as attacks on themselves. They are not though, so do attempt to look past his flippant and challenging tone to what he is presenting."
15,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7458029-amanda,1,"I am so incredibly disappointed by this book. I expected a comical look at some of the more popular science misconceptions sweeping the world (okay, the UK and US). Instead, I struggled paragraph by paragraph to not just light the book on fire. In terms of content: many of the points raised by the author are good, and I think that more people need to read and understand how the world around them works (esp. medicine). But the tone of the book... the author is a jackass (sorry, not sorry). He is arrogant and rude and at every turn is insulting both the readers and the authority figures who are ""deceiving"" the public. I really wish I could recommend this book because the content is important and even interesting. But I just can't support a book that alternates between calling the readers idiots and just plain laughing in your face. That is a sure way to alienate everyone who is looking for answers in a world of misrepresented science."

17,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,4,"This is the kind of the book that I would make everyone read when I get to rule the world. There’s so much nonsense going around these days in the name of science and research that a lot of people would be quite shocked with this book. Examples are endless. Detox treatment? Just a big hoax. Homeopathy? Even a bigger hoax. All those fancy and expensive cosmetic products that supposedly do magic to your skin? Just a waste of money. Vitamin C prevents and treats cold? Not really. Antioxidants slow down aging? No – more of it may actually be even bad for you. You think fish-oil pills make your children smarter? Let’s just hope they haven’t inherited your science genes. How about all those vitamin and mineral pills and food supplement products? Useless and waste of money if your diet is half decent. Does everything really either cause cancer or cure it? As impossible as it may seem to believe given what the media tell us every day, the answer is no.Goldacre does more than debunk these popular myths. He digs deeper into why bad science gets disseminated and why the public believes it. A lot of it has to do with simple commercial self-interest. Take the case of ""nutritionists,"" for example. Their biggest achievement is brainwashing the entire population into believing that what they say is based on scientific research. They may occasionally say something sensible, like: eat more fruits and vegetables, but that doesn’t make them any money. To push the pills and the products on people, they resort to science-y-sounding misinformation. Despite what most think, calling yourself a nutritionist does not require any scientific qualifications. Some of them may have science degrees, but these people are not scientists and what they say is not backed by real scientific research. Then there are the overworked and/or under-qualified journalists who don’t know how to read and interpret scientific papers. Statistics is not an easy subject, and there’s always the pressure to come up with something catchy, better yet alarming. So they get it all wrong when they supposedly transfer knowledge from the experts to the laymen. There many other social, cultural, and psychological factors discussed in the book that are contributing to the prevalent presentation of mumbo-jumbo as science.Unfortunately, bad science doesn’t only result in ridiculous but harmless situations like a Hollywood celebrity going for a laughable detox ritual or Tony and Cherie Blair taking their children to a New Age healer for dowsing with crystal pendulums. Bad science can cost many, many lives. The handling of the AIDS crisis in Africa is only one such sad example. "

Although written in the context of the UK, its lessons and advice apply to anyone anywhere.Covering everything from CAM (including chiropractic and homeopathy) to vaccinations to self-proclaimed ""TV professors"" (like Gillian McKeith) to the pros & cons of the pharmaceutical industry, the author shows the reader both sides of the story, shows the evidence, and explains the problems. But these are not just his proclamations on the issues: he points to scientific papers, additional resources, metastudies, and sites like the brilliant Cochrane Collaboration. While some of it is about correcting the egregious falsehoods proclaimed by journalists and snake oil peddlers, it is mostly about arming the reader with the tools to determine for yourself whether a topic or a position is as described or worth further investigation. Critical thinking, logic and skepticism... skills that everyone needs, but most are lacking.Everyone should read this book.Kindle note: I bought the Amazon Kindle version of this book. While it has all the expected footnotes and endnotes linked nicely, the text makes frequent references to graphs, tables, diagrams and images that do not appear in the Kindle version. This is not a shortcoming of the Kindle or ebook format (I've converted a number of ebooks I already own into Kindle format, complete with images, graphs, etc) -- this is simply laziness on the part of the publisher. You might want to consider this before buying any Kindle ebook that may contain non-text items.Update: This ebook has been updated since my initial review in 2010 and the previously mentioned Kindle formatting shortcomings have been resolved."

He does this in an entertaining way using ripped-from-the-headlines stories.Last week I was in the mood to read some non-fiction so went to the shelves of one of my goodreads friends and made a list of her 5 star health and science books. Armed with that,I found several of those books at the library and have been happily reading ever since. Goodreads is a wonderful way to discover good books published years ago. Unlike a just published book that you have to wait months for at the library, good books published 2 or 10 or 76 years don't have a waiting list (see  Rats Lice and History: Being a Study in Biography Which After Twelve Preliminary Chapters Indispensable for the Preparation of the Lay Reader Deals With the Life History of Typhus Fever  for another good one I found this way .)

That said, it was a real eye opener to see just how biased and flawed some of the medical studies were and that very reputable medical journals regularly publish findings and studies that should be very suspect to the professional scientist.The only problem with this book, and why I only gave it three stars is that the author tends to get a little bogged down in the technical details, and so sometimes he can stray between aiming as the layman (such as I would consider myself) and someone in a medical/scientific to whom the more complex aspects of a trial could be very interesting, but turned into bit of a science textbook for me.I also think he spent a little too much time going into the charlatan fields like Homeopathy etc, one chapter on pseudo science would of been enough to get his message across without rehashing the same argument over and over, which got a little laborious, even if I do agree with him.Some editing could turn this from a good book into a excellent one, and one final point is that while the book is humourous in places, it isn't really that funny, which isn't really a valid criticism as I don't think it particularly is trying to be, but a lot of reviews and product pages list it as a laugh out loud expose of what's wrong with science reporting which might mislead some readers."

His emphasis is on making people question ""facts"" and double check the evidence.However, people don't have the time for a lot of this, and when you're offered a glimmer of hope people tend to take it. The placebo effect is explored here and he does admit that it works and works well if people load it with belief, so maybe examining everything doesn't always work as well as it might.It's a book worth reading, if only to read why he is so virulently opposed to some people's ""science"", I must admit to having read some of the books involved and having some reservations but it wasn't until I actually read this that I truly realised what was bothering me about them. This is part of the problem, I do have a background in Science but I really didn't have enough energy or time to really exhaustively research some of the ""facts"" given to me by some of these writers.

I would have given it a 5 star rating if I had anything to do with medicine, but for an average person who knew nothing of MMR & MRSA, four stars would suffice. Sorry Mr. Goldacre.Bad Science is a book published to specifically to unveil the masks of those who pretend to be real scientist. As the author states; he wants his readers to know what bad science looks like to identify the real one. The book covers ""sciency"" myths in the fields of medicine. Examples that will be tackled: Detox is a fraud. Ear Candling is a big fat joke. Brain Gym activities are pathetic and Homeopathy is just one of the biggest scams of the history of science. Goldacre will explain how experiments can be held to study the validity of these claims, and what are the basis of real experiments.He will tackle the Placebo effect and how it can be part of controlled randomized trials with which we can know if, say, a homeopathic approach is actually working or not. While reading this book you will get to understand the factors that governs the way a placebo effect works as well, including the characteristics of the given drugs or the state of the doctors who are giving them too.Then he will take you to a world full of wonders about the magical power of Nutritionists and pharmaceutical institutions. are Antioxidants really good to fight aging? Can carotene fight lung cancer? You may not believe it, but some of the so-called nutritionists don't even know that Chlorophyll helps produce oxygen (while still in an alive tree), but don't store oxygen in green leaves. Something a 12-year old child knows by heart. Do fish oil pills improve child intelligence? A scandal of what these companies will do to attract the public is widely detailed in this book. They will invent new illnesses for pills they already have, They will manipulate facts or refer to non-existent or already disregarded studies to support their claims. They will refrain from publishing their invisible research to prove the work-ability of their drugs, or they will cherry-pick whatever suits them to give them the positive results they hope for. Goldacre will tell you about the journey of the drugs and the phases they go through before they see the light, and if you were one of those who want to play tricks on the mind of doctors to convince them that your drug really works, you will find some tips here and there as for how to do it, except that for people who will study your research from A to Z, and they will, these tricks won't work. The author dedicates a large chunk of this book explaining the effect of media on spreading these scientific myths. How journalists love health scares stories, how they can be manipulated, and how numbers can play a great convincing role, especially when they are misinterpreted. The claims of MMR vaccine causing Autism in children is greatly covered (which was a bit hard on me to understand).Regardless, the book was informative (even though I did not understand everything as so many topics were alien to me) and entertaining (the sarcastic style of the author made the book much lighter than it could be). You may not be a doctor or a medical student, but some stuff here are for every one. You will learn something; who knows, you could be the next victim of some nutritionists who will try to convince you that some oranges don't have Vitamin C, so that you will buy the box of pills that have a picture of themselves right on top, with a big fake smile.

28,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4619775-fay,3,"The passion of Ben Goldacre on his topic of ""Bad Science"" is undeniable. This is a doctor with a bee in his bonnet, a snarky tone and no qualms about telling it like it is and whom he might offend. Undoubtedly, I imagine, most readers will be offended - scientists, researchers, naturopaths and other alternative ""quacks"", journalists, statisticians, university deans, nutritionists, Big Pharma, the average you and me - we all will get a swipe in Bad Science.What I liked about this book was the message: Don't believe anyone about anything. You alone must adequately arm yourself with the knowledge and skills necessary to decide what you believe to be the truth. Be prepared to understand that the truth is probably going to be temporary. In this book, Goldacre provides the reader with the tools to make these decisions, however, I'd guess that without any shred of science background, you will be lost.It's amazing to think that what the journalists and self-proclaimed experts state as Fact is usually no more than predigested and double distilled traces of (possible) truth. Why are we so credulous of this? It's mainly because science is better understood and accepted when delivered by a friendly interface (journalist, pseudo scientist) rather than a nerdy spectacle wearing professor. Heck, we believe celebrity endorsements and colourful advertisements! How many of us would read a peer reviewed scientific article to get information? Where can we find those anyway?? It's not hard to see why it's become this way.On the negative side, Ben Goldacre is so passionate, that you get the sense that he was writing really fast because he has so much to convince you with, and you end up getting lost in his blizzard of examples. That's OK, there are some really astonishing things if you manage to cope with this bombardment. He uses humour to take the edge off his snarkiness, but I thought it made it worse. His tone is off-putting at times.The biggest bomb is that some bad scientists only report their science work or reviews to the common denominator media or (heaven-help-us) the totally unregulated Internet and Facebook! This is because these are not open to peer review or properly regulated scientific scrutiny. In other words, any old BS can be made available to the masses. A lot of what the masses believe today is due to the irresponsible publishing activities of the pseudoscientist (and in some cases real scientists) and the journalists/media alike. Suddenly this becomes ""The Truth"". People ask why scientists are so old and fuddy duddy, why don't they keep up with the times? Well it's probably because they are busy having their studies properly reviewed to provide solid evidence before making grandstand statements. And that peer review process is likely to be arduous.You need look no further than the chapter on the MMR Hoax. That was ""Bad Science"" in full blown badness. It starts with only 12 children in the original study!And just because someone is called a ""Doctor"" how much do you know about this? Look up Gillian McKeith and Prof Patrick Holford and prepare to be let down. These people are influential and high profile. They carry responsibilities related to our health and wellbeing. Don't blindly believe what they say.Without reading this book, I imagine my belief system would remain the same - to be cynical and skeptical of what is in broad-stream media reports, the pontificating of ""experts"" and even real doctors who challenge the mainstream view of things. Instead, after reading this book, I am even more cynical and skeptical. I will never take anything on face value. I have been armed with information to delve deeper if choose to. My axe has been sharpened.I am a scientist myself, and this book has made me realise that how science is taught and reported is sorely inadequate and embarrassingly in need of a massive overhaul, so that true science, not bad science, will prevail."

More or Less
, the popular statistics radio programme on BBC Radio, and I always enjoy Ben Goldacre's appearances on the show. At one point, I remember Tim Hartford introducing him as something like ""the perennially angry Guardian columnist,"" to which Goldacre responded, ""I am not perennially angry!"" or similar. He got quite heated about it, much to everyone's amusement. But Bad Science makes it clear, in the most entertaining way possible, why he's always angry. Homeopathy, alternative medicine, vitamins, fad nutrition, cosmetics, the MMR scare, the South African government's refusal to espouse antiretrovirals... he covers all of them, provides plenty of hard data, and eloquently and entertainingly discusses both the problems with the science and the potential dangers with the way they're advertised. I really enjoyed the book. My only complaint--and it's pretty minor--is that Goldacre's commentary can be a little patronising; he studiously avoids what he terms the ""tedious"" technical details, warns the reader of any impending math, and at one point goes into a diatribe that seems to assume the reader is an MMR scare believer. He also shies away from using probability, preferring natural frequencies, because he considers probability both unnatural and unnaturally difficult, but given that the UK weather only started using probability in 2011, I guess it's a cultural thing.Even though I guess I knew a lot of the substance in the abstract, this book was still an eye-opener for me. I knew the claims of the vitamin industry were questionable, but I had no idea how many studies actually disputed the common wisdom. (By the way, did you know that the ""beta carotene is good for your eyesight"" thing was a myth propagated by the British during WWII? They claimed their pilots' aim was due to a high-carrot diet, not to, say, radar.) I had no idea of the tragedy of Matthias Rath's influence on the South African government and the millions of lives lost because of it. I had never heard of Brain Gym, and I hope to never hear of it again. (By the way, Dr Goldacre, will you please go after Lumosity? Their ads drive me nuts.) He details the media mayhem surrounding the MMR-vaccine-causes-autism saga. He eviscerates, in an entirely fact-based discussion, the claims about homeopathy and other alternative medicines. My favourite part was when he bought a ""certified professional membership"" to the American Association of Nutritional Consultants, the same august institution claimed by a famous nutritionist, for his dead cat:""I mean, I don't sign my dead cat up to bogus professional organizations for the good of my health, you know. It may sound disproportionate to suggest that I will continue to point out these obfuscations for as long as they are made, but I will, because to me there is a strange fascination in tracking their true extent.""I think Goldacre has isolated the core problem with this popular anti-science: it trains the populous to trust white-lab-coated authority figures, not facts. It teaches us not to question, but to blindly believe. And that is the true tragedy of Bad Science.And now on to Bad Pharma..."

Knowing there’s so much ‘bad science’ and misinformation around, it went a long way to dispel myths and point out bad science and breakdowns in the scientific process. It certainly does help you to spot and understand any less than optimal ‘science’ around! With reportings and science in the media, business and consumer backed ‘science’ (with the all too common bad statistics to go with it)And covering topics from ‘detoxing’ (and why it’s all bogus), cosmetics and the ‘miracle creams’, the effect of placebo in trials and how it may affect the outcome of analyses and results, so called ‘experts’ in scientific fields and the problems in mainstream medicine to name a few. It also went into many examples of bad science including named studies and why their techniques or methods were flawed or less than optimal.

33,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1725471-gordon,5,"This is a very good book about very bad science. The author is a British physician, psychiatrist and journalist who writes both a blog (www.badscience.net) and a weekly column for The Guardian newspaper in the UK.Goldacre's focus, not surprisingly, is the form of bad science that that thrives so riotously in the field of medicine and health -- including everything from homeopathy to food supplements to anti-vaccination nuttiness to Brain Gym. Common to all these forms of bad science is an aversion to the practices of real science. Real scientists, he says, do the following: they take pains to design good clinical research trials (randomization, double-blind, and all that), expose their research to critical review by their peers, publish their results (and make their methodology and data openly available for scrutiny), use sound statistical methods, interpret their results in an unbiased fashion, and correct their errors when they're proven wrong. At least, that's the ideal. And Goldacre is both a practical guy and very much of a scientific idealist. Medicine is a frustrating place for people with scientific ideals -- although the rampant chicanery of the medical world does provide wonderful grist for his journalistic mill.Two villains who stand out from the rest of the pack in this pack are Andrew Wakefield and Matthias Rath. Wakefield is of course the British doctor, now defrocked, who spread the hoax that Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccination causes autism. This finding was based on a tiny study of 12 British children, whose parents had come to him specifically because they suspected an MMR-autism link and had heard that he could help them prove it. He himself was paid a very large sum of money to serve as an expert witness in the lawsuits subsequently launched by the parents of 11 of these children. The study was badly flawed in design, ambiguous in its data results, and very small in scale, but none of these problems prevented the good doctor from calling a press conference and announcing that MMR was dangerous and that parents should stop having their children vaccinated with it. The British press went wild with the story, vaccination rates dropped quickly, and, unsurprisingly, infection rates of M, M and R rose correspondingly quickly. Children died. Soon, a backlash began to mount against Wakefield. He relocated his operation to Texas, and the same story began to play out again on a new continent. From Austin to Marin County to backwoods Idaho, parents became convinced their children were being put in danger by MMR and stopped vaccinating them. Predictable results followed, and once again the backlash mounted. Matters weren't helped for Wakefield when the British medical authorities stripped him of his license to practice medicine. The hoax is losing much of its momentum now, but a lot of damage has already been done and will take years to reverse.The story with Matthias Rath was even worse in its consequences. Rath is a German food supplements entrepreneur who made a fortune peddling his vitamin potions, initially in Europe and North America. At that point, Rath's impact on public health was pretty much harmless, however overblown his claims of the miraculous health benefits of his pills may have been. However, matters became serious when Rath decided to enter the South African market, found himself an influential South African lawyer as his business partner, and managed to convince the government that, just as that government already suspected, AIDS was really a Western hoax. The real problem was simply a lack of vitamins! So the government abandoned its already lukewarm support for proven retroviral treatments, Rath sold lots of pills, and hundreds of thousands of South Africans who might have lived were condemned to unnecessary deaths.Goldacre tells his story well. He has a light touch yet manages to explain complex topics -- such as research design, placebo effects and statistical analysis -- remarkably clearly. It's not often that a quick read like this one is so satisfyingly meaty. Strongly recommended."

He's fair about trying to explain how some people can honestly believe nonsense. Of course, some nonsense is deliberate fraud. The section on placebos was the most interesting to me, because it gives the history of the notion that placebos are unethical. In light of the opioid epidemic and massive burnout in physicians in the U.S., it seems like we have thrown the baby out with the bathwater in terms of healing and medicine based on an obscure British legal case.

35,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21232850-ned,4,"Should we meet in real life, the author and I would likely have lively and boisterous debates. We both detest and are dismayed by the way media covers science and the insidious manner in which confusion is engendered in the public. Critical evaluation of data is sorely lacking, and the incentives for doing so further withering. This book was initially published in 2008, most information stopping @ 2006, so it is mostly dated. However, most of Goldacre’s concerns have led to an enhancement of the phenomena against which he rails. I absolutely loved this book, and violently agree with 95% of it. It misses a star because the section I know best, about “big pharma” contains some rather egregious errors (I hope the author has learned since the publication date). This book is very UK-centric, so in fairness the issues he raises may be more true than in the US (but an iconoclast of this ilk should be able to understand that). The author does not understand the role of FDA and how drugs are evaluated for safety and efficacy (I suspect he would want to argue that – and I will read his other books). The author is about a decade my junior, but we study the same things and for the most part share common concerns.It is shocking to think that the infectious nature of transmission of infectious disease (germ theory) credited to Pasteur was discovered, reported and ignored decades earlier. And politics, suspicion of western conspiracies, etc… led to millions of South African’s dying of AIDS (those in thrall of natural treatments and in denial of the cause leading to alternative treatments). Understanding science, data and conducting proper trial design is not a nice to have – it is like and death! I learned about Homeopathy, apparently popular in the UK, and completely hocus-pocus and not founded on any science. Further, the anti-vaccers in the UK led to a re-emergence of childhood diseases that had been largely eradicated. Shockingly, these eruptions of disease are created in wealthy urban areas, where the people are educated yet oddly susceptible to crazy theories and conspiracies. The weak education system in science and, truthfully, the lack of regulation in marketing of nutrition, food and drugs has led us here. The author excoriates nutritionists in general as the most blatantly fraudulent (his newspaper has spent a small fortune defending him in court) – giving the best expose of the “Antioxidant” nonsense I’ve read. Studies have been done, they don’t improve health – obvious to anyone with a degree in the basic sciences, yet the fad was perpetuated for a variety of reasons (even a nobel winning scientist got on this particular bandwagon). The onslaught of unproven supplements in the public domain is enough to drive a scientist mad.Goldacre writes with an acerbic style, but I loved his sardonic humor and his superb writing talent. I’m jealous, actually, because I spend my life trying to explain basic concepts to laypersons, and usually fail. He explores “statistical significance” in a practical way that is understandable. He shares my hatred of the misuse of “X” causes a 50% increase in “Y”. For example, something affecting 2 in a million now affects 3 in a million – that’s 50% but is it meaningful as a risk? This book is chock full of examples where statistics are not properly contextualized and the headlines scream the wrong message. Today we still feel the remnants of bad science, and people are not getting proper, modern treatment.  The author describes his battles as a journalist with the powers that be in homeopathy (p. 63): “It’s rare to find a homeopath engaging on the issue of evidence.... they send hate mail and accuse you repeatedly of somehow being in the pocket of big pharma (falsely, although you start to wonder why you bother having principles when faced with this kind of behavior). They bully, they smear, to the absolute top of the profession, and they do anything they can in a desperate bid to shut you up and avoid having a discussion about the evidence.”Goldacre gores all the oxes and shows off his own prodigious writing talents (p. 87): “Food has become an international obsession. The newspapers sometimes seem to be engaged in a bizarre ongoing ontological project, diligently sifting through all the inanimate objects of the universe in order to categorize them as a cause of- or cure for- cancer. At the core of this whole project are a small number of repeated canards, basic misunderstandings of evidence that recur with phenomenal frequency. These intellectual crimes are ferried to you by journalists, celebrities, and, of course, “nutritionists,” members of a newly invented profession who must create a commercial space to justify their own existence. In order to do this, they must mystify and overcomplicate diet and foster your dependence upon them. Their profession is based on a asset of very simple mistakes in how we interpret scientific literature: they extrapolate wildly from ‘laboratory bench data’ to make claims about humans; they extrapolate from ‘observational data’ to make ‘intervention claims’’ they ‘cherry-pick’; and last, they quote published scientific research evidence that seems, as far as one can tell, not to exist.” On the entrenched problem of scientific reporting and how statistics are abused in mass media (p. 186): “Newspapers like big numbers and eye-catching headlines. They need miracle cures and hidden scares, and small percentage shifts in risk will never be enough for them to sell readers to advertisers (because that is the business model). To this end they pick the single most melodramatic and misleading way of describing any statistical increase in risk, which is called the relative risk increase.”Goldacre is brilliant on statistically flawed reasoning and the problem with numbers (p. 205): “…unlikely things do happen. Somebody wins the lottery every week; children are struck by lightning. It’s only weird and startling when something very, very specific and unlikely happens if you have specifically predicted it beforehand.” He then tells a humorous story about the magician James Randi who woke every morning & wrote on a piece of paper that today is the day I will die.Occasionally the author gets sloppy, the problem with this sentence obvious (p. 211): “The drug went to market, and between 1958 and 1962 around ten thousand children all around the world were born with severe malformations, caused by this same drug, thalidomide.” I don’t think he really meant “all” – I happen to know this story well."

And given what I am going to save now that I stop buying omega-3 capsules for the kids, one of the best investments I've made.The down-side is that it is very British. Goldacre ripped into British personages (McKeith) whom I had never heard of, and English news (Durham fish-oil trial, MSRA scare) which similarly were new to me. A lot of it was really criticism of the British press, which wasn't too relevant to me.The new chapter on Rath, and the handling of HIV in South Africa hit far closer to home, showing that bad science isn't just a way of freeing suckers of their money (omega-3), it can be murderous."

To deal with heuristics/biases/confounding variables etc.) and social sciences (media/marketing/bullshitting/profiteering). --The aforementioned themes are brought to life in the following topics: homeopathy, the placebo effect, pills and the medicalization of social issues, marketing, nutritionists, Big Pharma profit over people (with laundry list of devious tactics), publication bias (the systemic bias of simply not publishing negative findings!), bad stats, over-claiming using surrogate outcomes, media health scares (MMR)...On anti-vaxxers: --Like most messy topics, there are traces of legitimate concerns to untangle from the slippery contradictions and misunderstandings here. Goldacre ties in themes from previous chapters and applies them to anti-vaccines; I do appreciate this patient, nuanced approach.

But because people don’t understand exactly how big pharma is evil, their anger gets diverted away from valid criticism—its role in distorting data, for example, or withholding livesaving AIDS drugs from the developing world—and channeled into infantile fantasies. “Big pharma is evil,” goes the line of reasoning; “therefore homeopathy works and the MMR vaccine causes autism.” This is probably not helpful. […]People come in many flavors, but all corporations have a duty to maximize their profits, and this often sits uncomfortably with the notion of caring for people. An extreme example comes with AIDS. […] drug companies explain that they cannot give AIDS drugs off license to developing world countries, because they need the money from sales for research and development. And yet, of the biggest U.S. companies’ $200 billion sales, only 14 percent is spent on R & D, compared with 31 percent on marketing and administration. […]But the pharmaceutical industry is also currently in trouble. The golden age of medicine has creaked to a halt, as we have said, and the number of new drugs, or ‘new molecular entities’, being registered has dwindled from fifty a year in the 1990s to about twenty now. At the same time, the number of ‘me-too’ drugs has risen, making up to half of all new drugs.Me-too drugs are an inevitable function of the market: they are rough copies of drugs that already exist, made by another company, but are different enough for a manufacturer to be able to claim their own patent. They take huge effort to produce, and need to be tested (on human participants, with all the attendant risks) and trialled and refined and marketed just like a new drug.Sometimes they offer modest benefits (a more convenient dosing regime, for example), but for all the hard work they involve, they don’t generally represent a significant breakthrough in human health. They are merely a breakthrough in making money."
39,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2895049-ross,4," Ben Goldacre is a crusader against charlatans , humbuggers and the ignorant in their claims for the efficacy of alternative and conventional therapies and in the application of so called 'science' to a range of issues. Among his targets are the likes of homeopaths , big pharma , prosecutors and the defense at law and journalists , of whom he is particularly scathing . He also takes on some UK specific personalities . Along the way he arms his readers with a range of logic , statistical and psychological examples to help them defend themselves against the nonsense peddlers ( without too much maths ). In this he does an excellent job and if the reader pays attention they should be well prepared to consider with fresh eyes a whole range of the superficially plausible but biased cant which inundates us daily . His explanation and treatment of the placebo effect was also excellent . As a pharmacist I have absolutely no argument with any of his targets and found his arguments formalised and crystallised for me a lot of attitudes I’ve held myself for a long time. Like me, any interested lay person or professional who hasn’t pulled all this material together for themselves would benefit from this book.  However , for readers outside the UK many of his targeted personalities will have little relevance and can be skipped. Having said that his chapter on Mathias Rath and his connection with the South African governments misguided policies on AIDS is a revelation. My only other beef is with the breezy and jargon laden prose which borders on condescension – at times it’s very irritating. I’d like to see the author tackle a more international version of this book with some judicious editing and toning down of the prose. I’m pretty sure it’d be worth 5 stars."

I've been a fan of the Bad Science column in The Guardian for years and the only reason I didn't snap this book up sooner was that I thought it might simply recycle those columns. Nothing could be further from the truth and I will be urging everyone who's anyone to read the book at the earliest opportunity. There isn't anything in the book which doesn't leap off the page, but here are some favourite bits:""The novelist Jeanette Winterson, for example, has written in The Times trying to raise money for a project to treat AIDS sufferers in Botswana - where a quarter of the population are HIV positive - with homeopathy"" [as if publishing the turgid Oranges are Not the Only Fruit was not crime against humanity enough""The reason for this phenomenal disparity in life expectancy is not that people in Hampstead are careful to eat goji berries and a handful of Brazil nuts everyday...That's a fantasy, and in some respects one of the most destructive features of the whole nutritionist project: it's a distraction from the real causes of ill health, but also ... a manifesto of right wing indivisualism: you are what you eat, and people die young because they deserve it. They choose death, through ignorance and laziness, but you choose life, fresh fish, olive oil, and that's why you're healthy. You deserve it. Not like them.""""To my mind, the greatest harm posed by the avalanche of nonsense we have seen in this book is best conceived as the 'opportunity cost of bullshit'...

41,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1768003-sam,4,"This is a surprisingly difficult book to review as on one hand Goldacre has a point in that much of the science coverage we get in the media is questionable at best and a lot of the experts in non-science fields, particularly homeopathy and other alternative medicines have a tendacy to use science to back up their claims and beliefs when its not entirely appropriate. On the other hand these alternatives do have a place for many people, as do many other things, although they shouldn't be treated as a science by those who teach it, practice it or believe in it (which is the main problem raised by Goldacre when discussing them). On the whole I do agree with Goldacre and as a scientist I frequently dispair at the coverage afforded science in the media and how it is treated as a big complex secret when really it isn't. I also cringe at how non-science subjects are treated the same as science, and frequently found myself dispairing at the examples used by Goldacre to show how science and these alternatives differ and the importance of these difference and in making these widely known and properly covered. Yes he does have a certain head-tilting aw-bless-ya view of alternatives but this is bred from the treatment of these as science by the media and those who actually work in those industries when in reality they are not. Yes they do have a place in the world, just not so much in the science world. I did enjoy the humour of Goldacre's writing but I sense this could alienate some people who don't take such things well and struggle to see his main arguement, which is that some things are just not science, no matter how much they want to be."

In perhaps a similar vein to ""The Republician War on Science"" Goldacre reviews many a popular misconception, with a particular focus on health (the author having a medical background and all) and slams the glimmicky bussiness of alternative with hard science.Goldacre puts a slightly audacious, (but yet to be disproven) theory that much of the misconceptualisation of science comes from humanity majors working in the reporting industry and failing to, or actively neglecting to get the science right.Clearly, hard science won't give you as many headlines, or hold the interest of the public for long, however Goldacre outlines exactly what will, and has already gone wrong with bad science reporting.Sadly its hard to imagine this book making any difference where it counts. Maybe just maybe, someone might pick it up and learn a thing or to. Most likely this book will be read by those already mostly aligned with science, but its still a better world with this book in it than without."

You know the stuff. Homeopathy, the magical healing power of having crystals laid on your body, that kind of jazz. He is immensely entertaining when debunking and poking fun at this stuff, and I adore reading about pseudoscience and bits of quackery. Best of all, he never seems sneering or unkind (which I have no tolerance for) except when it comes to the knowingly deceitful peddlers (unkindness to whom I have plenty of tolerance for). The book not only digs into the new madey-uppy science of our modern world, but also examines why it’s so appealing, and also how it has to distort the way science actually works in order to make itself appealing. A wonderful read for anyone looking to further hone their critical eye when being told about alternative treatments, or reading dodgy articles on the internet.

He starts the book by making some pretty well-worn arguments against homeopathy and other alternative medicine. That said, he does a much better job than most because he sets up his standards for proof of efficacy in a very thorough and well-organized way. In the process, he comes to the best description I've come across so far of what makes alternative medicine ""alternative"" and what makes mainstream medicine ""mainstream"". He then proceeds to show how infrequently mainstream medicine lives up to its own standards and how pharmaceutical and device clinical trials are rigged in favor of positive outcomes. He finishes the book with a long section excoriating journalism for its role in reporting bad science as if it were fact and largely blames the media for the recent decline in MMR vaccinations in England. A little UK-centric at times, but a very light read despite the dense subject matter. Written for a lay audience, but also an effective plea for skepticism among medical professionals. "

But he doesn't only pick the low hanging fruit of alternative medicines like homeopathy, he criticizes popular nutritionism for insufficiently supported claims of antioxidants, vitamin C, and more.Then he goes on to show that he isn't in bed with Big Pharma (while pointing out many alternative medicine entities who are...) and he is faithful to science by laying his guns on the pharmaceutical industry too.Finally, he criticizes the media for all of it. It's their inability to understand science, evidence, or weigh claims; their lust for catchy headlines; and their making shit up.This is truly a book that everyone needs to read."
46,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56111782-b-sarv,5,"I decided to read this book after reading a short but inspiring review on goodreads. Link: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... This book appealed to me because: 1) I find science interesting; 2) I suspected there may be some Mathematics involved so I thought it may help me frame issues for my students; 3) I am cautious about news articles on science; and 4) I am cautious about the commercial nature of the media. Dr. Goldacre explains, often in a humorous style, the flawed approach that the media has toward science and the impact it has on people. He uses two main approaches to do this. He exposes individuals and their use of pseudo-science to dupe consumers and the media’s complicity in the process.Dr. Goldacre targeted British audiences by using a lot of examples from BBC and print media in the UK. Some readers may be bothered by that approach but he clearly had a lot of experience dealing with “bad science” in the media there. To appreciate this book one needs to be able to extrapolate the poor communication of science in the author’s experience to the broader world of media. So in this book we see a spectrum of frauds, overstated results, and poor interpretation of results. Frauds included people who became media darlings and claimed to have certain qualifications that they did not have. They also included people who had either faked results of experiments or claimed to have done experiments which they had never published.So what does he mean by “bad science”. Dr. Goldacre not only exposes the frauds; he helps the reader understand different kinds of scientific studies, the impacts of the choice of experimental approaches, the impact of the placebo effect on studies, statistical significance and the importance of using peer reviewed research to substantiate claims. The harm of “bad science” is compounded when the standards for making a scientifically based claim are not met by someone making that claim in the media. When people using “bad science” team up with the media to sensationalize the “bad science” harm is left in the wake.Often what Dr. Goldacre describes things that a critic of a so-called “free market” would recognize from many other areas of society: the commodification of anything possible to have wealth accrue to the wealthy. Two books I have read link into Dr. Goldacre’s arguments: Fatal Invention: How Science, Politics, and Big Business Re-create Race in the Twenty-First Century by Dorothy Roberts; and Deadly Monopolies: The Shocking Corporate Takeover of Life Itself—and the Consequences for Your Health and Our Medical Future by Harriet A. Washington.Without recapitulating Dr. Goldacre’s book I will share some quotes. Two that relate to the ideas in the other excellent books referenced above and one that I think epitomizes the humorous writing to be found in “Bad Science.” He observes, “The second theme is perhaps more interesting: the proprietorialisation of common sense. You can take a perfectly sensible intervention, like a glass of water and an exercise break, but add nonsense, make it sound more technical, and make yourself sound clever. This will enhance the placebo effect, but you might also wonder whether the primary goal is something much more cynical and lucrative: to make common sense copyrightable, unique, patented, and owned.” (p. 18) Like in “Deadly Monopolies” and “Fatal Invention” he is clear about who benefits and who does not: “big pharma isn’t afraid of the food supplement pill industry, it is the food supplement pill industry.” (p. 337) Imagine an industry as notorious as the financial industry for unprosecuted crimes: “The vitamin industry is also—amusingly—legendary in the world of economics as the setting of the most outrageous price-fixing cartel ever documented. During the 1990s the main offenders were forced to pay the largest criminal fines ever levied in legal history—$ 1.5 billion in total—after entering guilty pleas with the US Department of Justice and regulators in Canada, Australia and the European Union. That’s quite some cosy cottage industry.” (p. 109). When we start talking billions we can rest assured that the big criminals are walking free and enjoying their yachts, private jets and multiple mansions. Law enforcement does not exist to lock up the big criminals. It exists to protect the property of the big criminals and to ensure no one threatens their property.Dr. Goldacre exposes the ways in which the media has been complicit in harming AIDS victims in South Africa, making people think that complex social problems can be solved by pills and promoted a false link between autism and MMR. He lays out these harmful cases in detail and is specific about the flaws in the work that has been done, or even the outright fraud that has been perpetrated. Still, he is able to present his cases with humor, a sardonic wit that appealed to me. In one instance he wanted to illustrate the advances in medicine that took place in the 20th century and used an analogy that had me in stitches and was thought provoking at the same time: “You might think you’re clever, sitting there with no nappy on, reading this book, but things haven’t always been that way, as your mother could tell you.” (p. 138)I set out thinking some of the things in this book may help me in my teaching of Mathematics or in broad general contexts even. I know that I will not draw on it specifically for classroom use because he takes a lot of time tying the threads of his arguments together. In principle though, I will take much more time to talk to my statistics students and explain the harm that can be caused by poorly designed experiments and the importance of statistical significance, particularly how it should not be misinterpreted. What Dr. Goldacre did in this book that differed from the books referenced above was to forge the clear link between irresponsible media coverage and bad science - and the harm it causes. “But the greatest opportunity cost comes, of course, in the media, which has failed science so spectacularly, getting stuff wrong, and dumbing down. No amount of training will ever improve the wildly inaccurate stories, because newspapers already have specialist health and science correspondents who understand science. Editors will always—cynically—sideline those people, and give stupid stories to generalists, for the simple reason that they want stupid stories.” (p. 338)In this review I have only been able to scratch the surface of the details Dr. Goldacre provides in “Bad Science.” The smattering of quotes and summaries are meant to tantalize the possible future reader and satisfy the question one might ask, “Would I want to read this book?” One of the other things I try to do with these reviews is link to other reading so a person can pursue other avenues either with this book or separately. Because I do not want stupid stories or to be duped by them I am really glad I read this book. I hope you enjoy this review. "

People who are very much into homeopathy and are not willing to look at that field objectively may not like this book.

The pharmaceutical industry and the media along with scientists wannabies are manipulating the public through misrepresenting and misinterpreting data. This is a great book! I recommend it to all those who are interested in medical science and clinical research. "

I found the HIV/AIDS lack-of-treatment and vaccine scare chapters the most interesting because they provide very good talking points for my job. The author Dr. Goldacre asks people to exercise common sense and, above all, to trust science - not the sciencey-ness used in the marketing of everything from diet fads to homeopathic medicine and so on. This is a good read, if for nothing else, to reinforce what you already know but sometimes forget."

I skimmed over a couple of sections that didn't appeal, but those 2 or 3 chapters that I did enjoy, wow they were informative. Plus, I'll only be buying 25p Paracetamol from now on. This could save me a fortune. "

The other the exorbitant prices we pay for unproven cures. Some, such as homeopathy, are blatant nonsense, others like bio medicines, less likely to be effective than ineffective.

55,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,4,"Quite a good book outlining how science is misinterpreted and misused, especially by the media and alternative medicine. It's written by Ben Goldacre, a British physician and science writer, who is quite popular in the UK.He gives examples of many of scams that claim to be scientific, yet they have little to no quality evidence behind them: detoxes, fancy cosmetics, homoeopathy, nutritionism, fish oil, vitamin pills, super-foods, anti-vaccination and more. Each one to uncover the lack of science behind each topic, how that topic is misrepresented and advertised to the public, and several examples of the people behind such scams. Along the way, he uses the examples to show how science is done in a broad sense, but also more specific issues that ensure we can trust the evidence we're looking at, including the placebo effect, control groups, cognitive biases, correlational studies, surrogate outcomes, cherry picking, publication bias, and more. It's truly a fantastic book, especially for people not as familiar with evidence-based practice or science in general. However, I do feel it had some flaws. For one, it was heavily focused on the people behind each topic, in what seems prosecution or a personal vendetta. To be fair, he does say he has to start somewhere, and they just exemplify the topic at hand, but if that was the case, the depth he goes into feels unnecessary and counter-productive. Second, while he touches on both the specific incidences of pseudoscience and explains the actual lack of science behind it, it seems it's focused on the first, while the latter is an add-on. It should be the other way around. It would be much more productive to explain the science, and then give examples where it fails to meet those criteria. Another consequence of this is that he touches on little examples of pseudoscience and media misinformation, because of the depth he dedicates to each one. While you indeed get some broad scientific knowledge that applies beyond each one, it could have been done better, ranging a much wider variety of topics, avoiding the reader of focusing too much on any specific one, but rather the scientific principles that determine the accuracy of a claim. Although to be fair, people will likely find this method more appealing, if they have specific people to focus on.Lastly, the book has a somewhat condescending tone. I do understand that many times the topics can be frustrating, especially given that in many it results in countless unnecessary deaths. But this likely has a negative effect on people who don't agree with the author. A more calm and respectful approach would likely have a better chance of changing someone's mind, instead of simply appealing to people who already despise pseudoscience to begin with. The author also seems to be particularly adverse to the humanities, thinking that much of the misinformation behind the media comes from humanities students, who little very understanding of science. I don't doubt this, but then he says that because they don't understand much about science, they think it's bogus, random, and dependent solely on authority. This seems a ludicrous claim. I'm sceptical that most people actually view science that way, they're simply not knowledge enough to apply it or describe it correctly. Despite these flaws, I think it was well done, and certainly helps towards a more scientific perspective, instead of taking everything at face value. The book is also quite well researched, and I was surprised how deep the author went in each example, tracking down the history of a specific event and looking at each claim with minute detail. If you want a book about evidence-based practice and how science is distorted, it's well worth a read. Although if you're fairly familiar with it already, it's unlikely you will learn anything much. "
56,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3586256-francis-kayiwa,5,"THIS BOOK SHOULD BE IN EVERY HOME AND MUST BE REQUIRED READING!Science reporting is bad...no Science reporting is ATROCIOUS. Many a night I've sat and watched the news, read a newspaper article and just cringed! I like to think that I know a tiny bit about science, so I can spot the poor reporting more easily. I've always wondered about the reason for this. Unfortunately it has always made me doubt ANY reporting as a result. Reading Bad Science is a good tonic and provides insight on this and the bad news is that WE are all in on it. Thing about science is that it most requires us to ""be human"". It only requires us to be curious. Finally it DEMANDS and this is the hard bit that our claims be measurable. It DEMANDS that we don't just 'have an opinion' but carefully explain our hypothesis and make our conclusions be 'testable'. Ben Goldacre does a fantastic job of this. No one is spared. Big Pharma? (Oh yeah), Late night quacks? (you bet), Chiropractors (the doctor will rip you a new one now), Homeopathy? (too easy), It would have been easy for him to be contemptuous of the rest of us who don't think about science like he does but he is engaging and funny despite all this. I kept re-reading chapters of this book because it is that good. I could go on but below is a classic example of a news feature on BBC to illustrateEU biofuel push ‘to ruin forests’The headline is “EU biofuel push ‘to ruin forests’”. Then we read “Oil firms have warned that European Union plans on biofuels could wreck the world’s rainforests.”So the news article is really an “anti bio-fuel” piece written by Big Oil. Big Oil is down on bio-fuel because you can grow it instead of drilling for it. Big Oil likes LPG and hydrogen because you can make those from crude. Imagine if cars ran on straight vegetable oil, you could grow it in your back yard! You can see why Big Oil might be a bit scared by that. Of course I don’t mean to say that Big Oil literally wrote the piece, but I mean that Big Oil hired a Respectable PR Company to write a Press Release which they put on the BBC editor’s desk and then passed to an intern who changed a couple of adjectives, rang a Rent-a-Quote and slapped it on the website. That seems to be how news is done these days.Is this was a proper news article then I would expect to see a few sources. We should actually know all of this from high school science and Dr. Goldacre reminds you of this. Who are these “oil firms”, as in “oil firms have warned …”? We just don’t know. You see how this is used to lend an air of credibility to the piece without actually having information that can be independently verified? Later on “one government official told the BBC: ‘The policy is running ahead of the science … ‘”. A government official? With a name? From what department? In what capacity did he tell the BBC this? Pure flak. Again, no verifiable information.You can always tell where the intern has been. Consider this paragraph: “Experts agree it makes sense to maximise wood waste and to grow energy crops on land that is marginally productive for food.” The nameless experts of course provide filler without leaving a verifiable trail. But what does “maximise wood waste” mean? Perhaps before the intern came along it said “maximise biofuel production from wood waste” or something that actually made sense. Who knows. (Aside: wouldn’t it be better to sequester the carbon in wood waste and simply bury it?)Again faceless experts are called in: “Many biologists warn there is simply not enough land on the planet … “.Next up is an explanation that we’re supposed to take as given: “Already President Bush’s highly-subsidised drive to get fuel from the Prairies has triggered food riots in Mexico because it has pushed up the price of corn.” There’s no reference to any research or paper (or even a rent-a-quote) that claims that the riots were caused by the farming subsidies. No critical eye has been applied, just a bland “reprint whatever the press release says” approach. Are there any other possible causes? Is it possible that the riots were caused by trade agreements between Mexico and the USA? Or that the Mexican people are using this issue to protest at their government? There’s simply no investigation of alternative explanations. Big Oil says bio-fuel is bad because it causes riots, so that’s what goes to press.Towards the end of the article we get to some quantitative blindfolding: We see that the UK government wants to produce 20% of electricity from renewable resources, but that the EU wants 20% of all energy to come from renewables. The article points out that since electricity accounts for about a quarter of all energy then that’s four times as much energy from renewables (than the UK government had in mind). Close, but no banana. What about approaches that involve producing less energy overall? If we produce less energy overall then that’s less renewable energy also. A sound article would at least mention this possibility including strategies of more energy efficient housing, more energy efficient cars, mass transport policies, aviation tax, and so on. In this BBC article? Simply not on the agenda. Of course the proportion of renewable energy is still four times higher (in the EU position versus the UK position), but the total need not be. (Aside: it’s totally bogus to set a target as a proportion, but this article isn’t about that debate)The BBC are not a bad organisation. These days they’re just doing what everyone else is doing. Repeating without thinking. This article again is not a particularly bad article, I’ve certainly seen worse; it just happened to be the one that tipped me over while reading a book about bad science reporting. There are lots of example to choose from.When you see a news article about something that you know about, how often is the article on the mark? Do you suppose that news articles about other things, things you don’t know so much about, are more accurate than those about which you know something? This book will arm jumpstart you to stop and listen and demand better reporting."
57,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17552463-marko,5,"This is an amazing book about what's wrong with public understanding of science and, most importantly, what's wrong with science reporting in the media.Unfortunately, the book has not been written with intentional audience in mind. The focus is on the readers from the UK, and throughout the book a the reader is expected to be familiar with the UK media landscape and various UK media personalities. This is not a big issue, since the message of the book is clear and impactful even if the reader doesn't know all the assumed background, but it is a little frustrating at times.One more relatively minor nitpick: on a couple of occasions, the text weirdly assumes the reader is male. I don't mean something trivial as using a gendered pronoun; I mean the text assumes the reader is biologically male and refers to body-functions that can only happen in a biologically male body. I found this to be quite silly."
58,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2143789-lcbogota,4,"The aim of this book is that the reader shall be future-proofed against new variants of bullshit (p.88). With sardonic wit, Goldacre takes aim at the pseudoscience touted in the media that backs up all sorts of farcical claims. From ""detox"" systems that have no effect on the body but assuage the guilty mind, to the breathtaking lack of substantiation for homeopathic medicine and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in general, to high-end cosmetics that imply miracles and contain all sort of impressive sounding ingredients (but that don't truly claim to do anything, because legally these claims would be indefensible), to nutritionism, another field that is big on claims and short on evidence He makes a rigorous defense of the scientific method because the method demands accountability and control of variables, in order to test what it purports to test. This is where most popular science and layman's science falls short. Quite frankly, we mere members of the public have little interest is carefully assessing testing methods, we want to know the results. It is precisely our lack of interest in the nuts and bolts and how the testing was put together that makes us vulnerable to false claims.Goldacre wryly notes the religious overtones that accompany to many health claims. Some ""detox"" programs are basically purification ""rituals"" (with the emphasis on ritual, rather than purification). ""In what we call the Developed Western World, we seek redemption and purification from the more extreme forms of our material indulgence: we fill our faces with drugs, drink, bad food, and other indulgences, we know it's wrong, and we crave ritualistic protection from the consequences…Like so much of the nonsense in bad science, ""detox"" pseudoscience isn't something done to us, by venal and exploitative outsiders; it is a cultural product, a recurring theme, and we do it to ourselves"" (p.14).Other cures are simply based on faith: ""I believe that homeopathic medicine works, therefore it cures me."" As with all instances of faith, ""true believers"" often become incensed when the grounds for their faith is challenged. Their objections are not limited to moral outrage, vitamin magnate Matthias Rath sued Goldacre for libel for challenging Rath's claims that vitamins can cue cancer, and that AIDS does not exist and that ""Antiretroviral drugs were poisonous and a conspiracy to kill patients and make money"" (p.133). Goldacre laments that this campaign of misinformation has cost so many lives. This is not to say that the medical and pharmaceutical establishment does not make mistakes. In fact, he recounts in detail how pharmaceutical producers have gone to great lengths to play up the benefits of their products while withholding or distorting evidence about adverse outcomes (p.149). It is telling that drug companies spend 14% of their budget on R&D, and 31% on marketing and administration (p.150).The final section on the book deals with ""The Media's MMR Hoax"" that arose based on a now-debunked 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield. Goldacre concludes that studies that have looked at the MMR vaccine and incidence of autism have not found any causal link. The scandal, however, was hugely successful because it used emotional engagement through first person testimonials. By suggesting that there might be a link between autism and the vaccine, it preyed on people's fear and guilt about potentially doing unintentional harm to their child.One key piece of information that I will take away from this book is that the Cochrane Collaboration produces systematic summaries of the research literature on health care research (p. 57). Meaning that whenever the purveyor of some miracle cure is claiming that ""no research has been done,"" Cochrane just might have compiled that research.http://www.cochrane.org/The site, however, is not exhaustive. For example, a friend recently sent me an email about DCA (dichloroacetate) as a cure for cancer. Cochrane does not address it.These kinds of stories pop up in the media all the time and people get worked up about them. Often times the headlines are misleading when journalists go for impact over accuracy (by stating figures in terms of relative risk instead of giving natural frequencies, p. 187). Goldacre notes that science stories printed in the mainstream media are often not written by science journalists, thus increasing the risk of getting the information wrong. Last week, for example, the media were all over the story about how cell phones increase risk for brain cancer. The fact that brain cancer rates have remained stable while cell phone use has increased exponentially, is somewhat of a mystery. Not being able to separate the fact from the fiction can be dangerous for your health."
59,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16697900-catherine,4,"I'd always fancied myself as being fairly aware in a vague way (definitely a vague way) that pharmaceutical companies were generally unscrupulous. It was just commonsense that Big Pharma oversold their products, hid disappointing figures from the public and doctors and generally charged too much for their products because they could. The fact that some medicines are feted as the best thing since sliced bread and then withdrawn after a while because there are undesirable side-effects in too many people to be considered acceptable, should certainly flag concerns as to adequate research or lack thereof, before release. Apart from the well known and publicised withdrawal of Thalidomid as a nausea suppressing drug for pregnant women, anyone with long-term and chronic illness or pain will usually have experienced their doctor change their medication on more than one occasion. It may be that the medication didn’t work effectively, or it could be that a new and ‘better’ drug has been released but often enough it is because doctors have revised their opinion about the drug and no longer like to give it out. As to the numerous scare stories in the newspapers about anything, including potential life-threatening diseases, we should all know what newspapers are like, shouldn’t we? You’d think commonsense would dictate that no-one would give credence to the sweeping generalisations given without checking the facts first. With homeopathy and alternative medicines I am less familiar. My general trend of thought was that although it was not for me, if others felt it worked for them then I wished them all happiness. If you also felt similarly benign towards the complementary and alternative medicine industry, then Ben Goldacre will have a few facts to share with you that will raise the hairs on your head.In amusing style, Ben explains the tricks of the trade that will make you realise exactly why it was you never fully trusted anyone involved either in medicine or on the shady periphery. He exposes cheats, fraudsters, liars, pill peddlers, cynical manipulators, quacks and scaremongers. When you consider how serious even the smallest mistake in medicine can be and the hundreds, or thousands even, of lives that have been ruined by small errors, it will make your blood boil to realise quite how, through greed usually, companies, newspapers and individuals will twist and lie about the facts and research to suit their own selfish ends. Don’t worry though, if you find your blood IS boiling, then I expect there’ll be a pill for that.There is one thing though, Ben doesn’t half go on about people with humanities degrees. I am sure not everyone in the humanities, has a personal vendetta against scientists, which is the impression I rather got from this book. There are equally intelligent and stupid people from all degree backgrounds. Personally I always thought journalists working for the tabloids had to be a bit thick because of the quality of the tripe they churn out, but look at the clever way they manipulate and trick people into thinking their articles are honest and factual. As someone who has a humanities degree, I never realised we as a body, were supposed to put down scientists as laughable ‘boffins’ because we didn’t understand them (to whom do I complain for never having received this memo?). Rather, I always admired maths and scientifically minded people as those who saw things in a different way to me and understood what I could not. Think of that! Me! A humanities graduate, admiring scientists? Who’d ‘a thunk it?"
60,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3418651-cathy,4,"In this book Ben Goldacre addresses the scientific method applied to medicine. I must confess that this is a topic of immense interest to me. Once you are past the condescending tone and the author’s self-promotion / elation, there are very valid points in the discussion of the various chapters. Although deep the approach is repetitive, Goldacre tries to explain through concrete examples how can the scientific knowledge be misapplicated at the medical level.As someone minimally informed regarding scientific method, there are simply things that confuse me. I, for one, don’t understand the lack of regulations for the marketing of natural products. Thousands of products are advertised and sold without any problem and as it reads in the insert ""have no side effects."" This is just due to lack of studies, but they are openly recommended by some health professionals, broadcasters and sold freely.The author draws particular attention to Dr. Gillian McKeith and Professor Patrick Holdford, which recommend the consumption of substances in their television programs. I did not know these cases, but I followed the Dr.Oz case in USA. In my country, Portugal, there are fortune tellers making medical diagnoses on television. This is unacceptable.With regard to the author's approach on glucosamine and chondroitin, can’t fully agree with the author's position. There is still not enough evidence for a broad recommendation on medical level, but there’s been taking place a large study in an attempt to clarify some contradictory results. The truth is that the book was written before to the Cochrane review showing that there might be some benefit in taking these supplements.I have to refer the chapter of vaccination. The anti-vaccination movement has increased in recent years and, in the light of current knowledge, the results of refusal to vaccinate children will be catastrophic. We’ll start to have diseases that didn’t appear for several years. Many of which were only referred to at the medical school as a curiosity.Finally, I would like to make a small comment to the role of the physician and the patient. Medicine has changed over the years. With the invalidation of the biomedical model, the doctor came to share treatment decisions with the patient. This change is not always seen as beneficial both for the patient or the doctor. On the one hand, the doctor was formatted during college to have all the answers to the patient's problems. It is often necessary to explain that you simply don’t know or that according to evidence what you have to offer is not wonderful. On the other hand, the patient himself often has a hard time taking responsibility for his own health. This is easily seen by the notorious difficulty in adhering to lifestyles changes. People establish a notion of health who focus only in taking pills. We live in a time when happiness is dependent on having the right pill. And that's essentially why so much that is described in the book happens.It was an interesting read, and I think it’s important to everyone. May become a bit boring to some, but the author strives to explain some basic concepts that we should all have."
61,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21161258-keith,1,"This book sadly wasn't about pseudoscience versus science. It was mainstream science versus everything else. Sometimes the everything else category is quackery such as the cases of ear candling and homeopathy. But then the author supports mercury amalgams and even characterizes it as something that comes up by conspiracy theorists every now and then. But amalgams have been opposed since they were first used. Basic chemistry even without testing would lead one to realize putting mercury in your mouth is going to cause that mercury to outgas. The mouth is warmer than the evaporation point for mercury. That should be common sense. It's right in the back of any chemistry textbook. Denying that is like saying water will freeze at 10 C. But to step beyond theory, just look at mercury evaporating in peoples mouths with amalgam fillings. You can even watch videos of this from IAOMT. To deny all of this is like denying gravity exists. We also see problems when the author talks about vaccination. He spends part of the book talking about the importance of placebos and double blinded studies which is good. Then he talks about vaccination and there's no mention of the fact that these studies use false placebos. In other words they are fraudulently claiming to use a placebo when in reality they compare one vaccine to another or one vaccinated population to another vaccinated population. How can the author not know this? I think he does. And clearly any medical professional would if they took the time to read and weren't being paid to promote another agenda. The book presents a pattern of denouncing anything that's not mainstream regardless of the science, and it supports anything that is mainstream regardless of the science. "

The premise of the book is that the author shows the Bad Science from the Good and I will recommend this to anyone who has ever been to a homeopath, considered detox products or for that matter taken supplements.Each chapter deals with a different issue ranging from my (former) beloved Patrick Holford, Brain Gym initiatives in Britain schools, Omega 3 supplements for kids and the explanation of what constitutes a valid research trail and so much more.Herewith an excerpt of his comments on Brain Gym to give you an idea of his dry slightly sarcastic writing style:“Children can be disgusting, and often they can develop extraordinary talents, but I’m yet to meet any child who can stimulate his carotid arteries inside his ribcage. That’s probably going to need the sharp scissors that only mummy can use.”The chapter on South Africa and that highly embarrassing incident most of us will remember when our health minister proclaimed that beetroot and African potatoes can cure HIV together with our then President Thabo Mbeki announcing that HIV does not cause Aids brought home just how dangerous misinformation can be!There are some scary stats and facts revealed in this book and even though I highly recommend this be warned that there are a few sections that focus a lot on the technicalities of research methodology and the correct way to publish scientific findings so this may not be for everyone.

63,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/970632-mitchell,5,Brilliant and entertaining. And better examples for why something is true in statistics to the point that I can restate them. How good is this book? So all of a sudden we've been getting more pipe noise in our house and not connected to use of faucets or appliances but in the general area where we've gotten it before and we are calling in a plumber. And I'm probably going to have to talk to the plumber. So I'm sitting here reading a book on doing real science and got to thinking on what the plumber is going to say. How often do you hear the noise? How long does it last? Where is the noise coming from? Apparently it was every 3 minutes for 30 second and about 12 minutes later I turned the water off to the toilet with a leak.I've complained for years about how about the statistics reporting is in news stories. But I never gave it nearly the level the thought that this book does. And I wouldn't have expected it to be so funny. Worth re-reading. Worth owning.
64,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264081-melydia,4,"I adore books about modern myths and this is among the best. Though the title is fairly generic, the science in question here is largely related to health: medicine, disease, and diet, and the media's role in the spread of misinformation. I was surprised both by the debunking of myths I'd long thought to be true, as well as those myths and charlatans I'd never even heard of. As an American, reading about the British perspective was extra fascinating. Goldacre also has quite an amusing way with words, which helped dilute some of the anger a bit. Exasperation can be exhausting, but when tempered with humor it's much more enjoyable. Sure, there are some tales, like the AIDS denial in South Africa, that are simply horrifying, but by and large it's more eye-opening than depressing. Definitely recommended to anyone who's ever had any interest in those big ""such-and-such causes/cures cancer"" tales constantly blasted over the airwaves."
65,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67293-benjy,3,"A promising expose of medical scams and quackery masquerading as science, particularly in the UK. Much of the material is culled from Goldacre's Bad Science column in the Guardian. Unfortunately, enjoyment of the book is compromised by mediocre writing and poor structure, and by the author's occasional slip into condescension. Still, the topics are fascinating. This is worth reading for the damning descriptions of the UK media's science reporting alone. But a good editor and more discipline on the part of the author could have raised this another star at least. "

Things I learned:- most moisturising creams do the same thing- antioxidants are probably not really a thing in foods (although Goldacre goes from ""the jury's out on this"" to ""fairytale"" in the space of two pages for no apparent reason)- The Cochrane Collaboration logo is Awesome. Look it up."

68,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46052387-laura-kristiina-valdson,5,"I thought that this book was about debunking health myths and homeopathy, but there is MUCH more to ''Bad Science''. This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in a) science, because there's a lot of detail into how trials and experiments are carried out and b) medicine, because it helps you to understand how evidence-based medicine ACTUALLY works. I promise you after reading this book you know how to critically analyse medical trial (that you see cited by in scientific books, articles etc). Also you'll know how to be critical of its methodology (is it blinded or not, randomized or not, and much more).Yes, there are some topics that are common knowledge today (it was published 12 years ago), such as statistics, how nutritionists trick people into buying their pills, how there are no quick fixes in medicine etc. But there's also important information that people must know. I absolutely admire the author Ben Goldacre and the work that he does by trying to make evidence-based medicine more transparent and efficient. He has helped to make publishing all trials mandatory, which used to be and still is a big problem. Negative trials are less likely to be published than positive ones. Everybody likes good news, but showing what does not work is as important as coming up with new treatments. He wittily criticizes all 3: alternative medicine ''health gurus'', nutritionists (supplement-industry) and ''big pharma''. I admire that he doesn't play the conspiracy theory card though. I was afraid that he sees drug companies as the root of all evil (we all know that's over over-dramatized). Instead he takes much more informative, technical approach.The golden age of medicine is over. We now have multiple drugs for diseases such as hypertension, arrhythmia, allergies, asthma, diabetes (I and II type) etc. Drug companies have to work really hard to come up with new molecules, and so the author has pointed out ways they can make their results more promising. He sees this problem not only in drug trials, but all over academic literature. To those who are interested I recommend reading on ''publication bias''. Side-note: I've read quite a bit of scientific literature on nsaid drugs, efficacy studies on pain medication (comparing efficacy, safety, side effects etc) and medical literature. So I know a thing or two about drug trials and what makes a fair trial. I trust systematic reviews the most. So I'm already an interested reader. But Ben Goldacre really surprised me with his knowledge, witty writing and humour. I highly recommend this book!Also, don't judge a book by its cover."
69,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10120307-minty,3,"3.5 stars rounded down to 3. Whilst in many ways I really enjoyed this book, it also IMMENSELY frustrated me. If you’re going to write a book aimed at helping the public make informed decisions about science, not writing in such a way as to alienate a significant part of your demographic would be a good start. I’d like to assume most science graduates won’t get huge amounts of new info from this book and so the learning aspect isn’t primarily targeted at them, but rather at people without an extensive background in science? In which case, why spend CHAPTERS whinging about humanities graduates? Surely humanities graduates (I.e. potential journalists as the author seems to class them) are the people this book wants onside? If we’re going to have clear communication about science, surely we need scientific communities (with the data) to work with humanities graduates (with strong communication skills)? And don’t get me started on the seeming assumptions the reader is male.That aside, this was an interesting read and certainly opened my eyes regarding medicine and media coverage. The writing style wasn’t always the clearest but overall it was an informative and engaging read. "

As I started reading it I thought ""oh a pro-science book, this is going to be boring, I'll agree with everything and learn nothing.""Well... contrary to my expectation I did learn something. The really surprising thing though is how much this book is relevant 10 years after it's release. A must read to everyone, in my humble opinion. However... the author... is quite... well... ""passionate"". You have been warned."

If you're not really familiar with the scientific process (how trials work and how many and what types are necessary), this is a great (and fun) start to understand more.For more advanced readers though, while funny and enjoyable, the book will seem a bit simplistic. Like the author is not emphasizing enough the dangers of manipulating scientific research, or those of fabricated facts which are being sold as the result of science. "

75,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,2,"Having read another science book, Mark Miodownik's Stuff Matters (4 stars!) a few months back, I was excited to pick up Ben Goldacre's Bad Science. The premise was seductive - a book unravelling all that pseudo science we see in the media today, helping people see past the lofty claims about the benefits of antioxidants, chia seeds, homeopathy, the Paleo diet or whatever the new health fad of the moment is. Unfortunately, Goldacre's book is likely to preach to the converted. People who jump on the homeopathy/anti-MMR/detox foot bath bandwagon are unlikely to want to dig too deeply into the science (or lack thereof) behind these claims. Goldacre, I think, means to write in an accessible manner but citing a variety of scientific studies to bolster his own (valid) claims whilst nonchalantly dismissing the practitioners of homeopathy, proponents of new health fads, etc as quacks and using terms such as ""the nonsense du jour"" or ""cargo cult science"" is unlikely to win over the other side. Take his chapter on 'clinical nutritionist' Gillian McKeith, for instance, where Goldacre debunks her assertion that spinach, having darker leaves because of a higher chlorophyll content, is ""high in oxygen"" and ""will really oxygenate your blood"". Goldacre notes that this displays a fundamental misunderstanding of how photosynthesis works and ""any chlorophyll you eat will not create oxygen and even if it did, even if Dr Gillian McKeith, PhD, stuck a searchlight right up your bum to prove her point, and your salad began photosynthesising...and by some miracle you really did start to produce oxygen in there, you still would absorb a significant amount of it through your bowl, because your bowel is adapted to absorb food, while your lungs are optimised to absorb oxygen. You do not have gills in your bowels."" The snarkiness is perhaps entertaining to those already inclined to be dismissive of McKeith but I doubt it will help sway those who devour her books and TV shows.Goldacre goes on to add that in McKeith's book, Miracle Superfood, which is apparently the published form of her PhD, she referenes experimental data from a magazine entitled Health Store News and an issue of a magazine entitled Earthletter. Goldacre criticises these as being inappropriate references in a PhD dissertation. It's a fair criticism but again, anti-vaxxers, homeopathy proponents, etc are actually likely to cite articles from publications such as Health Store News and Earthletter to support their stance. They don't really care if these publications don't quite have the standing of Nature or the Lancet. If Goldacre wrote Bad Science for those already inclined to be skeptical of the ""quacks and hacks"" and are looking for more ammo to bolster their case, then the book is a great success. Readers can snigger and feel superior as they dismiss those too misguided or ill-educated to see through the hoaxes. But if Goldacre was hoping that Bad Science could persuade those who believe that there may be merits to homeopathy, that the risks of vaccination outweigh the benefits, that packing in the antioxidants can lower your risk of cancer, then the book probably fails miserably on this count. Take this excerpt for instance:""Witnessing the blind, seething, thoughtless campaigns against MMR and GM, which mirror the infantile train of thought that 'homeopathy works because the Vioxx side effects were covered up by Merck,' it's easy to experience a pervasive sense of lost political opportunities, that somehow all our valuable indignation about development issues, the role of big money in our society and frank corporate malpractice is being diverted away from anywhere it could be valid and useful into puerile, mythical fantasies. It strikes me that if you genuinely care about big business, the environment, and health, then you're wasting your time with jokers like Pusztai and Wakefield.""Goldacre's points are valid but his scathing tone is simply too alienating. He could perhaps take a leaf from Jonathan Haidt's The Righteous Mind on how he might reframe his arguments to persuade, rather than besiege."
76,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18777825-himanshu-modi,5,"Who thought that a rebel scientist could write an entertaining book on science? But here it is, Bad Science, in all its paperback glory.“Bad Science” as the title suggests, is a post-mortem of illogical, manipulated, and ridiculous claims made by self-proclaimed or media-created doctors and scientists. First up, let me be clear: Ben Goldacre is not a person against simple, logical things which promote good living. He fully advocates things like exercise and a balanced diet and abhors smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. What he has a problem with, to generalize, are people who claim outrageous things under the disguise of science. And he despises mis-representation and mis-interpretation of research data by quacks, media, and corporate conglomerates. And that, as any common man would be aware, is so common place that it’s hard to discern the good science from the bad.The writer starts with relatively harmless hoaxes like brain gym, a concept apparently prevalent in toddlers-schools in UK, and some strange, detoxifying foot massager. And then ups his ante to take on the so called alternative medicine. Then we go on to crazy nutritionists, pill peddlers, modern medicine, and even genetically modified seed manufacturers. (People who have been following the recent “BT Brinjal” protest movements, will discover some relevant information in this book.) The extent of domains the author covers itself should convince you that he is not for or against anything as a concept in particular. The only thing Ben Goldacre relentlessly demands through the book is a systematic, honest, unbiased, evidence-based research for cures for ailments of the human race. He constantly points out the role of the insensitive and ill-informed media, and at times ruling political leaders, for creating mass hysteria or hype about things that, either do not warrant any attention, and at its extreme, cause needless deaths in thousands. The AIDS fiasco in South Africa, among other instances, being the case in point; highlights the grimness and far reaching effect of “Bad Science”. Ben Goldacre writes that if he were not writing a light, humorous book, he would have been really, really angry. The book itself, though funny, tackles some very serious issues. It might be easy to laugh off at public naiveté as they get caught in a money-spinning racket by some quack, but when it translates to inadvertent deaths of thousands of people through causes that could have been avoided or cured, you can’t help feeling furious.The best chapter of the book is definitely “Bad Stats” for me. The writer took me by surprise by his keen sense of understanding of statistics. Numbers can be misleading if you are determined to make them tell a story that they don’t really convey. And there are examples of how statistics are twisted to convey pre-determined inferences. Do that, and perfectly good science gets twisted and becomes horrendously bad.This book will definitely open up your eyes to a lot of nonsense, you wouldn’t believe how much, that goes on in this world. And while you probably will not go to the extent that Goldacre goes to validate, or repudiate, any of the gazillion claims of fat reduction, or hair growth, or memory enhancement that the latest new medicines make in newspapers you believe in, you will at least gain some intuition as to what is wrong with those claims. That perspective of how to react to the phrase “research has shown” itself is the biggest take away from this book. And if you visit Ben Goldacre’s blog, you will realize he has started a small movement of sorts where people discuss and debate things that get tossed about wrapped in the blanket of science.And oh, by the way, at the risk of repetition, the book is extremely funny. I laughed as much as I would while reading the best of a Wodehouse book. And considering that the discussion is about a serious topic, that too around science, it is quite a mean feat achieved by the author.This one definitely makes it to my “the top 50 books you should read before you die” list."
77,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7402485-lee-penney,3,"I’ve had the paperback of this for some time, but never got around to more than the first few pages (I seem to start a lot of books which now lay abandoned around the house) and so bought it as an audiobook. Even then getting through it seemed to take a long time.I believe in Goldacre’s aim, which is to highlight the poor reporting of science stories in the media and draw attention to the lack of evidence behind many of the claims made by supposed ‘health professionals’ and the media alike (who are too often taken in by these ‘health professionals’). It’s a noble aim that has been carried out in his column for The Guardian and he has a whole website dedicated to debunking quackery.This book, though, may not be his finest hour. While it starts off amusing (and informative) enough (and not a little Dave Gormanesque in style) it descends into what seems like non-stop-ranting about some of Goldacre’s pet hates, which include everything from homeopathy, to nutritionists (a non-restricted term, anyone can claim to be one), to Brain Gym, via MRSA and MMR and includes a couple of chapters on people such as Gillian McKeith and Patrick Holford (I have left off their titles as Goldacre points out they don’t really warrant them, Goldacre’s dead cat has some qualifications in common with McKeith, for example).In the end it seems to drop into repetitive lambasting that highlights the media is lazy, doesn’t do any fact checking and is quite willing to print any press release they’re handed, doubly so if it provides a juicy headline. He points out how media savvy ‘experts’ and companies play the game to get us to believe them, because once it’s in the press, we all seem to believe it. In short, it’s a book that could have done with a lot more editing.What he doesn’t do, however, is provide you with an easy way to defend yourself against the sort of rubbish the media spouts when it comes to science. Most of his research to disprove the claims involved what sounds like a lot of digging through medical journals and papers and interviews. Most of us can’t manage that when scanning an article at lunch or hearing a news story on the radio while eating our breakfast. I’m still not sure about the various control-grouped, placebo-tested, randomised methods needed to produce statistically significant results (or how to figure that out from raw data).What he doesn’t seem to be doing is calling for legislation that any scientific claims need to be backed up with evidence. I would say we could use something like the Advertising Standard Agency, but as there already is a Press Complaints Commission, which should be responsible for this, self-regulation clearly isn’t working!It’s not a total waste, however, it definitely has made me more critical when reading/watching/hearing a science-related story. I’m now looking for any signs of supporting evidence and I’ve pretty much adopted the stance of disbelief until further proven. But then I was fairly switched on before, so I wasn’t the hardest sell. How do you convince the millions of others who do still believe the press?As I said, due to the repetition and endless soap-boxing, the book just seems to drag. Maybe I could suggest a ‘lite’ version. Cut it down to probably 25% of the size, add in some more pictures and I think the book would be able to reach a wider audience (how about a kids version?) and therefore have a greater impact. Otherwise, while a thoughtful read, you can probably abandon it after three or four chapters and not really miss much. If you decide to stay the distance, be prepared for a monotonous affair."
78,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1015045-nola-redd,4,"My opinion of this book shifted several times over the course of reading it, but in the end, I was left with a favorable impression of it (perhaps because it left me on the positive).I should first disclose that I work as a science writer, though not in the medical field, which is where the rants against 'Bad Science' stay focused. There were points when the author railed against the media at large for being, among other things, science-hating humanities majors.'My basic hypothesis is this: the people who run the media are humanities graduates with little understanding of science, who wear their ignorance as a badge of honour. Secretly, deep down, perhaps they resent the fact that they have denied themselves access to the most significant developments in the history of Western thought from the past two hundred years; but there is an attack implicit in all media coverage of science'I must admit to being annoyed and frustrated by his broad classification. However, he went on to redeem himself by removing science writers from the attack; he notes that many of the science writers he knows refuse to touch stories with faulty science (or at least the examples he provides), and that most if not all of the scare stories that go to press are written by generalists rather than science writers, a crime he lambasted editors for.In terms of bad science: the entirety of the book focused on medical news pieces, which make up the majority of science pieces in print. This makes sense, I suppose, since a story about diet or disease is more relevant (and thus more interesting) to the reader's daily life than a distant black hole. Such scare pieces are likely easier to befuddle journalists, as a tale of an earth-destroying black hole will easily be refuted (or validated!).The author starts by discussing basic science principles, often in a humorous way, with either physical or thought experiments to prove his point. I found his discussions interesting enough to recommend to my 12 year old.He quickly veers into an assault on homeopathy and nutritionists, citing the failures of both to demonstrate any scientific evidence for pretty much anything they claim. He takes a special jab at the fact that pretty much anyone can claim to be a nutritionist, as there is no training or certification required, a fact I did not know. A friend who skimmed said that these sections essentially felt like a large pamphlet on why to avoid the snake oil salesman, and I can't disagree.Goldacre has two chapters attacking specific people, which he holds up as examples in their fields (the aforementioned homeopathy and nutritionists). Although he does a credible job of picking apart their 'scientific' claims, I admit to being a bit uncomfortable to such a direct assault. Perhaps the issue is cultural, and if I lived in Great Britain I would recognize both names enough to be more at ease. The author does actually protest that he admires both of these people for achieving their mercenary and entrepreneur goals, but it's a backhanded compliment every time.These were the most uncomfortable (for me) chapters. I appreciated his claims that one of the greatest dangers of the media presentations of science as 'beyond most of us' can have the effect of saying people away from scientific fields. Overall, I found the book interesting and instructive in its approach to helping the average, unschooled reader make sense out of science."
79,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8362689-panos-malakoudis,4,"A great read that touches on three important issues. First, how many scientists and non-scientists don't really follow the proper method of sharing their findings (thus making mistakes because no peers reviewed their hypothesis). Second, how media completely ignored the proof and only focuses on scare-mongering (as that sells better). Third, is about how we as people in this day and age have stopped trying to understand how things around us function and instead look for the dumbed down version."

This book is everything I look for in a Non-Fiction. Just two chapters and down and already not feeling like to put it down.8th November 2017I am done with this book. This book has changed my perspective of seeing few things. The things I used to trust blindly should not always be. This book is full of scientific facts that will open up your brain to so many things that are going on behind those promises and claims few Industries make.

81,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1186861-maya,0,"Review: Overall a good introduction to recognising bad science, and possibly more usefully, bad science reporting. Goldacre has a great sense of humour and is a good writer for the layperson, but he can get carried away on some topics.On another note: I often forgive gendered language, but I was miffed when Goldacre, after mentioning a children's microscope from Toys'R'Us with 100x magnification is enough to tell the difference between MRSA bacteria and bacilli (a burn on Chris Malyszewicz), said if the reader purchases one he recommends ""looking at your sperm"" (pg 282). NOT impressed with the assumption his entire readership has sperm. Didn't expect someone in their 30's (i.e. young) to perpetuate the ""no women are interested in STEM"" mindset.Now for my personal notes & quotes...Homeopathy:""Homeopathy is perhaps the paradigmatic example of an alternative therapy: it claims the authority of a rich historical heritage, but its history is routinely rewritten for the PR needs of a contemporary market""""[Samuel] Hahnemann professed, and indeed recommended, complete ignorance of the physiological processes going on inside the body [...] and championed only empirical data, the effects of medicine on the symptoms. [...] This is the polar opposite of the 'Medicine only treats the symptoms, we treat and understand the underlying cause' rhetoric of modern alternative therapists.""Tricks to play in your statistical analysis to ensure your trial has a positive result: Ignore the protocol entirely (always assume correlation proves causation); play with your baseline; ignore dropouts; clean up the data (delete anomalous outliers that make your product look bad); work the timeframe (stop the trial early or extend it based on the results you've got (if they look good NOW) or will get (if they might get better with an extension)); torture the data (look at subgroups, all the subgroups); try every button on the computer (run your figures through a wide selection of statistical tests, even inappropriate ones, at random).Why clever people believe stupid things: 1. We see patterns where there is only random noise, 2. We see causal relationships where there are none, 3. We *overvalue* confirmatory information for any given hypothesis, 4. We *seek out* confirmatory information for any given hypothesis, 5. Our assessment of the quality of new evidence is biased by our previous beliefs"
82,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12065410-noor,5,"I first knew this book had a big impact on me when a shop assistant stopped me in my track and started promoting a particular face cream. I nodded politely, with a slight smirk, while she told me that ""this cream is by an official pharmaceutical company and works through using enzymes that will give you amazing skin."" All for £29. In my mind, already a number of alarm bells were ringing. Firstly, the [bad] science simply didn't add up. Because enzymes are really going to absorb through my waterproof skin barrier and affect... what exactly? Was I supposed to be impressed that she used a scientific word? And that's not even mentioning the big bad capitalist, conglomerate pharma industry, whose mention was supposed to seal the deal. Dr Goldacre, you would be proud. I wish I had said something to the lady. Instead, I quietly moved on.Ben Goldacre writes a witty, informative and structured account that will make you lose faith in all things health-related, whether it's alternative therapists/nutritionists à la Gillian McKieth or bad statistics being thrown about, skewing reality and having tumultuous consequences for some.If you are in the healthcare profession, then this is an essential read. If you are not, then this is an equally (if not more) essential read, so that you can familiarise yourself with what to look for when you see those inflammatory health-related news articles that strive to stir up health scares or provide miracle cures. Do be warned though - you might feel a little patronised by Dr Goldacre's sarcastic tone.The news coverage of science over the past few decades has shifted to mostly health-care related stories, which makes this book a particularly pertinent read. Too often, we are presented with misleading articles that scare us into thinking that our risk of heart attack has doubled because we take drug X or eat food Y or have lifestyle Z. This book breaks down the basics for us and represents what evidence-based medicine is all about, from meta-analysis systematic reviews through to the difference between absolute and relative risks. The aim of this book is intended to empower the lay reader to be aware of evidence based practice, thus recognising how consumerist companies try to exploit our ignorance into a profiteering business, be they bogus ear wax candles, fish oil tablets or even the pharmaceutical industry itself. A wholehearted recommendation!"
83,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1833260-julie,4,"Bad Science is a fascinating book. Goldacre, a British medical doctor, bemoans the lack of scientific literacy in the public -- why is it that homeopaths and other alternative therapies can flourish despite evidence, why nutritionists tout one fad diet after another with great success, and how quack doctors can come to prominence and cause real harm. This book is an attempt to inject some basic scientific literacy into its readers, with clear, concise language and great deal of wit.Goldacre starts with the more easily-debunkable claims of alternative practitioners who leech out ""toxins"" using foot baths (hint: it involves electricity, salt water, and iron nails... and no ""toxins""). From there, he moves on to the homeopath industry to show what's needed to produce good methodology in a paper, stuff like randomization, blinding, and proper controls. He tackles the nutrition and pharmacology industries, showing how you can misrepresent your results (ignore people who drop out, play with the baseline, play with the statistics, etc.) and how the media routinely dumb down or sensationalize certain stories while ignoring others. There's a fascinating chapter on the placebo effect (more complex than you might think) and a cautionary chapter on the MMR-vaccine / autism media debacle.Through it all, Goldacre is quick to point out that he's not against sensible eating, or people taking (or not taking) pills, or medical interventions. His constant refrain in the book is, ""It's a bit more complicated than that."" What he is against is the alternative medicine industry and media's portrayal of science as something highly difficult to understand, something that exists in a black box. Goldacre asserts that sensible, intelligent, motivated people can understand science, and the media's dumbing down (and the alternative medicine industry's ""science-y sounding"" papers) aren't helping anyone, especially in an age when so many of our decisions ultimately come down to understanding science.I think this is a wonderful introductory book for laypeople who may have (like me) forgotten most of their high school science."
84,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/901342-jacob,3,"I got the sense this book wasn't what I hope it would be when the edition I got from the library carried a subtitle that wasn't on the edition I originally added to my to-read list: ""Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks"". Indeed, this is an M.D. with an axe to grind against Nutritionism, Homeopathic remedies, Food Supplements, Anti-Vaccination Activists, and Drug Companies. His chapters are about exposing the ways they distort scientific evidence in order to make money, and on the way they lead people to make poor choices when those people could have had better health outcomes.Those things are interesting, but I was hoping for a more general discussion of science and the ways in which it is done badly. The sad thing is that a lot of bad science comes from the respected, peer-reviewed publications that Ben Goldacre holds as sacrosanct in this book. Yes, it's definitely a standard to publish in a peer-reviewed publication, but unfortunately that's not the high bar of good information-bearing research Goldacre would like to believe. For example, it turns out most (47 of 53) important cancer results from the last 50 years can't be replicated (http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/0...). That's bad science right there, and I was looking for more of a discussion of how even the highly regarded scientific establishment is broken, not just the obvious pseudo-scientific fringes.At least Goldacre tends to have amusing writing, but that plus his axe are his biggest focus. There's a half decent discussion of how to spot poorly done scientific research, just not any acknowledgment of the relationships that undermine peer review, pressure to publish any quality work in order to get tenure or preserve reputation, and other flaws in the general scientific community that result in humanity not being served as well as it could by science."
85,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2314061-davek,5,"This is a great quick read full of useful stuff, it’s a bit of a reference book you can go back over at your leisure. It makes you think before read another “researches say headline” and helped me crystallise my misgivings about headlines saying things like coffee/sugar/sex/lavender (insert your own words) can reduce your risk of getting cancer by 30%. It’s all about the whole group analysis rather than relative percentages. His ranting about the science writers in the press with the media studies degrees are quite funny but they are not really a revelation, the level of detail helps though.I’m sceptical about the wishy washy holistic types and love science stuff. So this book was a bit of a magnet for me when it appeared in my local bookshop. The bit I really liked was about the placebo effect. I’ve come across stuff on this before so I knew of it’s power but to be told how the colour of the pill makes a difference, and how two sugar pills work better than one, still amazes me. His best argument for why alternative medicine works was when he compared a GP spending three minutes with you before prescribing a pill to a alternative medicine practitioner spending some time talking to you, letting you talk about your problems and symptoms and finally prescribing something to help. The placebo effect works better if you belief in the person who is giving you the pill. If you belief the person when they say “You will get better” then that improves your chances of getting better.He does wash over a bit the affect of how big business influences the peer review process but this is dealt with in depth on his website (badscience.net) mainly in the discussions following his latest blogs.Good stuff."
86,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2319016-cat,4,"I read this for two reasons: first it was a damaged copy from the shop, going nowhere but to the large pulping machine in the sky and secondly, I needed to read something to help me get my head around critiquing research fast. I've done a lot of research critiquing in the past in my previously life with the NHS. But I needed a brush up for university and this was perfect in many ways. It takes the shit out of stats and makes them friendly. I particularly liked the writing around Big Pharma and journalism and some of the pieces shocked me to the core. I was saddened to reflect upon the MMR debacle having been well and truly on the frontline when this kicked off. As a speech and language therapist I saw frightened parents daily worrying about giving their child the immunisations, as well as parents of children with ASD blaming themselves for having immunised. All the time I knew this research was a croc of crap, badly put together and not even concluding what the wretched journalists were claiming and yet it managed to put lives in danger, despite being so, so wrong. MMR is safer than non-MMR. End of debate.If I had one criticsm, it would be the citations - I would have preferred them in with the text they were relating to, however, that is just the academic researcher in me, and I recognise that this is a book for the public at large. Ben writes in a very accessible way, funny and yet poignant, he manages to remind us that, while we can get angry with bad research, Big Pharma and poor journalism, and take the piss out of glaringly obvious mistakes, people die. Bad Science is no laughing matter and I am far better informed than I was before I read this. It's done its job."
87,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7125076-rachel,5,"I love how Ben Goldacre thinks--clean logic with a snarky attitude. He takes apart alternative medicines, the medical establishment, journalists, and especially the drug companies. People have always been too willing to believe what other people say emphatically, whether or not the facts back up the hype. He is hardest on the drug companies, whose misrepresentations in order to maximize profits include covering up deaths, and on the press and journalists, who are eager to sensationalize everything even if they get the facts wrong.He focuses on a few cases, including homeopathy and some other alternative medical ideas, ""nutritionists,"" sloppy study protocols in mainstream medicine, and the autism/vaccine scare. Most of what he addresses are pet peeves of mine, so I loved it all. But the cases are examples for the main point of the book: that we need to understand how to evaluate all the claims of how anything works, across the board. The cases serve as examples of how to use the background knowledge and tools he provides for critical thinking.I especially liked the chapter ""Why Clever People Believe Stupid Things,"" which outlines a number of cognitive illusions that people are prone to.Hardly anything in the book was new to me. But the way the author progressed from simple concepts to more complicated ones, using the examples to illustrate the concepts and the concepts to give the reader an understanding of the examples--magnificent! His writing is clear and eloquent. He obviously has a bone to pick with almost everyone. The last chapter is titled ""And Another Thing,"" and I'm sure he could go on and on. In fact, he has, in another book about the drug companies, and I am looking forward to reading it."

The subject reported no improvement in his condition, but did show clear signs of annoyance and anger and appeared to feel pain in his head. The subject did not know he was being tested, therefore the placebo effect was nullified so there was no need for a control subject. This study was conducted on a well-respected medical research institute (on their parking lot) and included a highly-respected, published scientist in its team (the subject being smacked)."

If you're into homeopathy or any New Age-y methodologies for improving your quality of life, you're in for some rude awakenings.One subject that is thankfully covered in detail is the complexity of the placebo effect. Because many of the readers of Goldacre's critique will quickly fire back the expected ""but they DO work for me!"" arguments, he has taken the time to explain what the placebo effect actually is — why it ""working"" may not mean quite what you expect — and how truly fascinating the science behind it is.He is also quick to point out that the placebo effect, carefully dressed, is also what has allowed the book's villainous charlatans to mislead and exploit the gullible, the tired, the sick, and the stupid for so long.As far as a pop-lit critique of modern scientific marketing goes, I consider it required reading. As a scholarly effort, it's not without its problems, but those neither diminish its value nor cloud the integrity of its point. The world would be a better place if all highschool students had ""Bad Science"" on their mandatory reading lists."

That said I mostly liked it.Ben Goldacre is a doctor who writes for a British newspaper called The Guardian. He mostly writes from the point of view of someone who challenges those ""sciencey sounding claims"" that people make about the products they make (and goes on to suggest what a more accurate claim would be).The book is split into 2 sections. First he explains how scientists do research, how they interpret data, and how they disseminate results. That's about 20% of the book. The rest of the book looks at certain areas (like homeopathy or nutritionism) or certain scientists (like Gillian McKeith or Patrick Holford), and debunks their claims.It's not bad bookwise. It's clearly laid out, and easy to read, but it doesn't assume you're an idiot either. Goldacre's attitude seems to be ""If I can explain something difficult clearly enough, you'll understand it.""So why did I get so irritated by the book? It's just the content will drive you mad. You'll probably leave the book thinking ""Grrrr"" a lot, and that'll irritate you slightly I think.If I had one criticism of the book, it'd be that it can almost explain an idea to death (or repeat an explanation), and that might irritate you. My suggestion to get round that (if it irritates you) is to treat the chapters as discreet, it'll probably make them more enjoyable."
91,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5860800-malcolm,4,"So who knew that evidence-based medicine could be such fun? Goldacre is the author of a regular column in The Guardian (that's the British one) where he takes on bogus medical claims but more importantly he takes on bogus and dodgy science reporting - see http://www.badscience.net/. This book draws together these themes to not only show what evidence-based medicine is but also to show how media reporting of the UK-medical issues (MRSA & the MMR-vaccination-causes-autism stories – I'm tempted to say fantasies) are the product of a combination of scientific illiteracy and a drive to produce media profits.More importantly than this excoriation of the mainstream media and alternative medicines (homeopathy and popular nutritionists are favourites) the book is a clear a lucid outline of the scientific method – the chapters on Bad Stats and Why Clever People Believe Stupid Things are some of the best things I have read about how evidence is presented in a way as to be wilfully misunderstood, and what ideological and commonsense pressures exists for us to believe these simplistic stories. My only real gripe is that in breaking the fourth wall from time to time to warn us that the next bit is going to be difficult, I worry that he underestimates his readers (it’s not really that difficult) and risks hindering comprehension. Still, excellent and in places quite amusing. "
92,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1377326-m,3,"This was good. The star rating looks kind of low, but that's because (a) I'm a hard marker, and (b) I assign stars based on my subjective enjoyment of reading the book more than anything else. The UK-centric nature of some of the examples Goldacre dissects made it harder to stay engaged than (I imagine) it would have been had I been more familiar with them, and my capacity for reading at length about everything being terrible is not very high. But the chapters where I was mainly just learning about why particular ways of thinking about health-related science are wrong, and also why people often don't understand that they're wrong, were top-notch. I learned interesting facts about cosmetics, started to understand the nature and depth of my lack of understanding of unintuitive statistics, and devoured more information about placebo effects and regression to the mean (rapidly becoming some of my favourite concepts to think about). Very much worth reading, for both people invested in various kinds of 'woo' and pseudoscience … and people who struggle to argue against such things effectively. "

I think it could have had a much bigger and stronger impact if it was a touch shorter. The author hammers the points home. And then hammers them home again. Maybe because I knew most of what he was saying it stuck out that much more to me. The questions he raises about how the media represent science (the quest for a big story even at the detriment of actual fact), the unethical conduct of researchers, the publication bias and problems with peer review- all these things underscore his main point: that everyone who reads these stories is responsible for understanding the science that created the stories. Don't rely on an untrained journalist to interpret the research for you. Don't rely on a website with no credentials to gather your information. You can even rely on the New York Times! The majority of articles aren't fact checked. It was a sobering, and even slightly depressing read but nothin I didn't already know. I just wish more people knew it also. "
94,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/932473-sharon4,4,"I found this book frightening and funny in just about equal measure. As a non-scientist, I often come across things in the news and in general conversation that I don't think can possibly be right, (or not as right as those doing the talking might suggest) but I don't have the language or understanding to know why that is. Ben Goldacre does a good job of explaining why ignorance is much easier (and more fun) to propagate than knowledge and does it in a way that is entertaining and readable. He has a wonderful time trouncing certain media figures for a variety of offences - hubris, lack of knowledge, the misuse of data, reliance on poorly designed studies, the blatant pushing of their own products, while at the same time, being careful not to claim too much for what's often referred to as mainstream scientific opinion. Some of the technical material was over my head - I have a maths block - but this was less of a problem for me than certain aspects of his writing style. 'Sciency stuff?' What's that in aid of Dr Goldacre?"

It was really eye-opening to realise how far individuals and companies are prepared to go to back up unrealistic and, in some cases, dangerous claims about their lotions and potions. More shocking still is the way the media supports the quacks while distorting and misreporting the results of genuine science research and trials.The problems this causes to our society are enormous (E.g. the MMR scare - how many children have suffered from measles because of unjustified scaremongering?)How the public are ever to find out what is genuinely beneficial or harmful is obviously a serious problem, and one that Ben Goldacre has pointed out with clarity, proof and excellent examples. I will certainly be looking for original data next time I see a scare story or claim of medical benefit in the news. This book should be compulsory reading!"
96,0007240198,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10024577-holmes,4,"Rarely do we find a scientist so aggravated that he has to publish a book solely to name and shame others. But Goldacre is more than justified in doing this in his crusade against bad science - nay, it should be ""bad filth wearing science's clothing"".From homeopathy to quacky pills, from media nonsense to pseudoscience fakes, Goldacre launches his tireless attacks and punches holes in all things that go against honest science. The amount of dirt that he digs up is unbelievable. I shudder at the sheer pervasiveness of bad science all around us, which at its worst is capable of changing cultures and influencing policies.But one thing I don't enjoy too much is Goldacre's grumpiness. I know he is angry and he gets personal, but I think he has overdone his fingerpointing when he repeats his accusations over and over again. He makes good points, but it gets tiring after a certain period of time. Instead of stomping directly on his opponents, it might be more effective if he mixed his blames with mockery and sarcasm. That might make him sound less like a grumpy guy."

And which sadly apparently intelligent people fall into believing.It particularly skewers homeopathy, nutritionists, Gillian McKeith, Patrick Holford and Matthias Rath. It then skewers Big Pharma for the incompleteness of the evidence it presents to doctors who then are then prescribing medicines with only part of the picture about their good and bad points. He's superb at skewering the scientific record, and its deliberately created gaps (unreported negative studies, company suppression of critical papers etc.) He's good at skewering the newspapers and TV journalists for their distortion of scientific evidence, and their inability to understand what they are reporting on, and their higher level ignorance that there's even a problem needing sorted here.In other words this is a good book on our cognitive failings (as is Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error), and how easily we are being misled."

Every year new drugs are tested, those that pass in what are skewed biased run tests make it to the market claiming to make you healthier, or are claimed by people such as Dr. Wakefield, in the MMR vaccine scare in the U.K. to have caused autism (which was disproved). Goldacre explains how the media plays a huge role in the medical tests by using half-truths and relative risk increase to make the drug seem worse or better than they actually are. Goldacre also explains the huge problem: with homeopathy and how it preforms no better than placebo pills, as well as with nutritionists (such as Dr. Gillian Mckeith full title Gillian Mckeith) who claim that by eating dark green spinach leaves your body will absorb extra oxygen (which is false).  Outstanding book and a book that has made me look at medicine and drug ads in a whole new way. "

Bad Science is an extension of the web site by the same name who's author has carved out a mission to inform people on the spin and manipulation that the pharmaceutical industry uses to promote their products and the disconnect with how we need the media to inform us and how it actually functions. On the positive side it is very well written, literally packed with information and had a lot of excellent examples of his points. It would probably be a good idea to reread this book since there was so much information you can't absorb it all the first time through. On the negative side the author seems very angry. While I can understand why he is upset I wish he had toned it back a little. I actually had to stop reading the book for a while and then come back because it was emotionally exhausting. Such a tone may discourage the casual reader from reading it through to completion.So 3 stars because everyone should read this but just so you know its a bit of a rollercoaster ride."

The author is angry and he's right to be. Lives are lost because of this sort of nonsense.But he's also smug, repetitive and clearly HATES humanities graduates, who he blames specifically for all the weak and unsupported science stories out there. Fwiw, there are journalists from all sorts of educational backgrounds, a mix of good and bad. He constantly tells the reader that his words will enable them to understand scientific reports, yet insists that humanities grads 'don't have the skills to critically appraise a piece of scientific evidence on its merits'. So Ben, what happens when a humanities graduate reads your book then?In my case, they read it despite the building rage, but take twice as long to finish the damn thing as they normally would, because they put it down every time they get annoyed."

What's the fun in that?The more I think about it, the more I feel maybe privatized media outlet is actually a very bad idea. The spread of BS is basically uncontrollable because of it. How about close all of them? Sure, people would cry murder and chant for freedom of speech 10,000 times. But maybe, just a thought, very similar to how AT&T, Comcast and United fight ferociously against any new regulations on ways of milking customers, Freedom of Speech is really just a facade for all the magic pill companies so they could keep their racket going and further undermine knowledge and keep the darkness of ignorance on humanity for another 1000 years.

All written in a very friendly, readable style.He explains how research should work and gives the reader the lowdown on thinking in terms of evidence based medicine. He explains how to recognise when a 'sciencey' newspaper article really is just bullshit. And it really does make you view these articles in a totally new (and unfortunately cynical) light. Many of the examples he uses are funny, but I actually found it depressing to see how successful big pharma/the multibillion dollar vitamin pill industry/journalists are in manipulating research data to sell their drugs/pills/newspapers.So - highly recommended!"

Although the science occasionally flew over my head, I very much appreciated that it was written to be understood by a layperson without being patronising, and I liked how witty a lot of the writing was, even when making very serious points. Also, for what it's worth, this is the fastest I have ever read a non-fiction book.The only real reason I'm not giving this five stars is, considering the discussions of the need for accurate reporting of data, he's a bit sloppy with his pop culture references.

While it does have some very insightful points and illuminating examples the snarky tone of the whole thing ruined it for me. The author has a blog where he covers the same topics - which is all very wonderful - but the qualities of a good blog are not qualities I'm really looking for in a good book.For example, when doling out basic facts and analysis the author was so condescending (ugh, I promise you I can understand complex statistical concepts if you just explain them clearly). Also, in the process of debunking alternative ""medicines"" such as homeopathy and the - I don't even know what to call it - AIDS insanity in South Africa, the author is just so screedy.

He does tend to go off into a sort of High Moral Outrage that balances the more calm and logical presentations quite badly, especially considering that the audience for this is unlikely to be stupid, so either they're on his side agreeing while his head detaches from his body and flies about in rage, or they disagree with him on some other basis, in which case he's being kind of a dick. The tone veers too often towards condescending. I also found him inconsistent in the way he would criticize one study for having a ridiculously small sample size, and then in the next chapter use a study of two people to prove a point. So those are pretty serious drawbacks. That said, when he did well, he did very well -- he just didn't do it often enough."

This book tackles failures the news media giving the example of AIDS denial and the MMR vaccine scare. It also overlaps with Bad Pharma when it comes to poor science design and misinterpretation. He goes on a weird little diatribe about GMO, attacking it for economic and political reasons instead of health science. He talks about terminator genes and other nonsense unrelated to the issue, on which he seems uninformed. This seems an example of what Goldacre has been warning us against! I guess, do as I say, not as I do...Overall I liked this better than his other book because he treated the reader with respect by being honest and being persuasive using logic instead of rhetoric."

I particularly wanted to know more about why people are so against vaccines, because within this last year we had to decide whether or not to vaccinate our infant son and I was getting nervous with moms I know on facebook posting articles that link the MMR vaccine with autism. This book also covers things like ear candles, the marketing magic of ""detox"" foot baths, diets, cleanses, etc., and the supplemental vitamin industry.

Also liked Goldacre's view that he doesn't crucify people for utterances, but does hold them accountable for published materials in their name. I also liked how, when discussing bogus science, he does mention any positive side effects to balance the argument a little.

The media often do disservice for science by dumbing down research findings to seduce imaginating mass. There are tragedy, death involved in these issues, clearly.

Goldacre comes across as genuinely annoyed at much that he tells us; and while it's fun to watch him debunk the personalities in the alternative medicine business, for example, the main benefit comes from his oft-repeated mantra ""it's a little more complicated than that"".You'll never read reports about science in the media in the same way..."

Media informs us of ""the latest info"" from naturopaths, pharma, nutritionists, etc., but because they don't understand the science or have fallen pray to the marketing schemes of these companies in a lot of cases, they end up reporting bad stats. This book is incredibly informative, and I think it's something everyone should read. That being said, I gave it 3 stars because it's hard to get through.

Their special, proprietary, theatrical yawn will lead to “increased oxidation for efficient relaxed functioning.” Oxidation is what causes rusting. It is not the same as oxygenation, which I suppose is what they mean. I’d like to submit to Bad Science my teacher who gave us a handout which says that “Water is best absorbed by the body when provided in frequent small amounts.” What I want to know is this. If I drink too much in one go, will it leak out of my arsehole instead? “Anton,” 2006 there is no reason to believe that anyone is deficient in it or that smearing it on your face will make any difference to your appearance. In general, you don’t absorb things very well through your skin, because its purpose is to be relatively impermeable. When you sit in a bath of baked beans for charity, you do not get fat, nor do you start farting. I can very happily view fancy cosmetics—and other forms of quackery—as a special, self-administered, voluntary tax on people who don’t understand science properly. How does a water molecule know to forget every other molecule it’s seen before? How does it know to treat my bruise with its memory of arnica, rather than a memory of Isaac Asimov’s feces? We know that two sugar pills are a more effective treatment than one sugar pill, for example, and we know that saltwater injections are a more effective treatment for pain than sugar pills, not because saltwater injections have any biological action on the body, but because an injection feels like a more dramatic intervention. We know that the color of pills, their packaging, how much you pay for them, and even the beliefs of the people handing the pills over are all important factors. We know t... As Voltaire said, “The art of medicine consists in amusing the patient while nature cures the disease.” Over the course of many years, a team of Australian oncologists followed 2,337 terminal cancer patients in palliative care. They died, on average, after five months. But around 1 percent of them were still alive after five years. In January 2006 this study was reported in The Independent newspaper in the U.K., bafflingly, as: “Miracle” Cures Shown to Work The eunuch was worried that they would become worse soldiers if they didn’t eat their rich meals, and that whatever could be done to a eunuch to make his life worse might be done to him. Some of the biggest figures in evidence-based medicine got together and did a review of blinding in all kinds of trials of medical drugs and found that trials with inadequate blinding exaggerated the benefits of the treatments being studied by 17 percent. The diamond at the bottom shows the pooled answer: that there is in fact very strong evidence indeed for steroids reducing the risk—by 30 to 50 percent—of babies dying from the complications of immaturity. We should always remember the human cost of these abstract numbers: babies died unnecessarily because they were deprived of this lifesaving treatment for a decade. They died even when there was enough information available to know what would save them, because that information had not been syn... Clinicians, pundits, and researchers all like to say things like “There is a need for more research,” because it sounds forward-thinking and open-minded. In fact, that’s not always the case, and it’s a little-known fact that this very phrase has been effectively banned from the British Medical Journal for many years, on the ground that it adds nothing; you may say what research is missing, on whom, how, measuring what, and why you want to do it, but the hand-waving, superficially open-minded cal... Much like quackery, placebos became unfashionable in medicine once the biomedical model started to produce tangible results. An editorial in 1890 sounded its death knell, describing the case of a doctor who had injected his patient with water instead of morphine; she recovered perfectly well, but then discovered the deception, disputed the bill in court, and won. The editorial was a lament, because doctors have known that reassurance and a good bedside manner can be very effective for as long as... patients and doctors aren’t so interested in whether a new drug works better than nothing; they’re interested in whether it works better than the best treatment they already have. color had an effect on outcome: the pink sugar tablets were better at maintaining concentration than the blue ones. Another study suggested that oxazepam, a drug similar to Valium (which was once unsuccessfully prescribed by our doctor for me as a hyperactive child) was more effective at treating anxiety in a green tablet and more effective for depression when yellow. stimulant medication tends to come in red, orange, or yellow tablets, while antidepressants and tranquilizers are generally blue, green, or purple. the packaging itself had a beneficial effect, enhancing the benefit of both the placebo and the aspirin. People I know still insist on buying brand-name painkillers. As you can imagine, I’ve spent half my life trying to explain to them why this is a waste of money, but in fact, the paradox of Branthwaite and Cooper’s experimental data is that they were right all along. As you would expect by now, just through manipulation of what the doctors believed about the injections they were giving, even though they were forbidden from vocalizing their beliefs to the patients, there was a difference in outcome between the two groups. In 1987, Thomas showed that simply giving a diagnosis—even a fake “placebo” diagnosis—improved patient outcomes. “The drive to keep patients fully informed has led to exponential increases in the formal requirements for consent that only serve to confuse and frighten patients while delaying their access to needed medical attention.” So the selfsame drug became less effective with time, as new drugs were brought in. Botswana—where a quarter of the population is HIV positive—with homeopathy. survey data shows that a disappointing experience with mainstream medicine is almost the only factor that regularly correlates with choosing alternative therapies.classic 1986 essay “On Bullshit.” In biology fieldwork, you throw a wired square called a quadrat at random out onto the ground, and then examine whatever species fall underneath it. Drug companies are very keen to promote theoretical advantages (“It works more on the Z4 receptor, so it must have fewer side effects!”), animal experiment data, or “surrogate outcomes” (“It improves blood test results; it must be protective against heart attacks!”) The idea is to try and give all the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another. —Richard P. Feynman Graham’s health food store—in 1837—heavily promoted its food as being grown according to “physiological principles” on “virgin unvitiated soil.” By the retro-fetishism of the time, this was soil that had not been “subjected” to “overstimulation”…by manure. He changed his Christian name from Bernard to Bernarr, because it sounded more like the roar of a lion For all that nutritionists may fantasize in public that any critic is somehow a pawn of big pharma, in private they would do well to remember that like many my age who work in the public sector, I don’t own an apartment. In South Africa it kills 300,000 people every year: that’s 800 people every day, or 1 every two minutes. This one country has 6.3 million people who are HIV positive, including 30 percent of all pregnant women. There are 1.2 million AIDS orphans under the age of seventeen. Most chillingly of all, this disaster has appeared suddenly, and while we were watching: in 1990, just 1 percent of adults in South Africa were HIV positive. Just ten years later, the figure had risen to 25 percent. President Mbeki sent a letter to world leaders comparing the struggle of the “AIDS dissidents” with the struggle against apartheid. These impractical moral principles are so deeply entrenched that PEPFAR, the U.S. Presidential Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, has insisted that every recipient of international aid money must sign a declaration expressly promising not to have any involvement with sex workers. “Clomicalm tablets are the only medication approved for the treatment of separation anxiety in dogs.” But because people don’t understand exactly how big pharma is evil, their anger gets diverted away from valid criticisms—its role in distorting data, for example, or withholding lifesaving AIDS drugs from the developing world—and channeled into infantile fantasies. “Big pharma is evil,” goes the line of reasoning; “therefore homeopathy works and the MMR vaccine causes autism.” This is probably not helpful. This part of the story is extremely interesting, and I recommend doing a degree in it. only 10 percent of the world’s health burden receives 90 percent of total biomedical research funding. One three-thousand-subject review on SSRIs simply did not list any sexual side effects on its twenty-three–item side effect table. Twenty-three other things were more important, according to the researchers, than losing the sensation of orgasm. I have read them. They are not. If you are smiling in recognition at this paragraph, then you are a very bad person. If I weren’t writing a light and humorous book about science right now, I would descend into gales of rage. you could have a 50 percent increase in risk (the “relative risk increase”), or a 2 percent increase in risk (the “absolute risk increase”), or, let me ram it home, the easy one, the informative one, an extra two heart attacks for every hundred men, the natural frequency. As statisticians would say, you must “correct for clustering.” This is done with clever math that makes everyone’s head hurt. You know, the most amazing thing happened to me tonight. I was coming here, on the way to the lecture, and I came in through the parking lot. And you won’t believe what happened. I saw a car with the license plate ARW 357. Can you imagine? Of all the millions of license plates in the state, what was the chance that I would see that particular one tonight? Amazing… —Richard Feynman This bit’s for the hard-core science nerds, and will be edited out by the publisher, but I intend to write it anyway: We still don’t know what causes autism.

Suddenly we were getting comment and advice on complex matters of immunology and epidemiology from people who would more usually have been telling us about a funny thing that happened with the au pair on the way to a dinner party. Nigella Lawson, Libby Purves, Suzanne Moore, Lynda Lee-Potter, and Carol Vorderman, to name only a few, all wrote about their ill-informed concerns on MMR, blowing hard on their toy trumpets. Without anybody’s noticing, bullshit has become an extremely important public health issue, To my mind, the greatest harm posed by the avalanche of nonsense we have seen in this book is best conceived of as the “opportunity cost of bullshit.” Irrationality by Stuart Sutherland makes a great partner with How We Know What Isn’t So by Thomas Gilovich, as both cover different aspects of social science and psychology research into irrational behavior, while Reckoning with Risk by Gerd Gigerenzer comes at the same problems from a more mathematical Meaning, Medicine and the “Placebo Effect” by Daniel Moerman is excellent, and you should not be put off by the fact that it is published under an academic imprint. 16 The magician and pseudoscience debunker James Randi used to wake up every morning and write on a card in his pocket: “I, James Randi, will die today,” followed by the date and his signature.

I just did not connect at all with this audiobook, however. I was very familiar with most of the subject matter, as much of the material has been covered in depth on the podcast The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe. The book felt like a review and a lot of rehash.The book attacks medical quackery, homeopathy, nutritionists, anti-vaxxers, and several other health-related and anti-science topics. A couple chapters I found interesting were about Brain Gym and statistics manipulation. Brain Gym is a brain training company which is apparently a bigger deal in the UK (I've never even heard of it) which Goldacre claims is bad science and he takes it down in a big way. The Andrew Wakefield / MMR vaccine scare is covered in depth in this book. The author does a great job presenting his case against lousy science in a concise and sometimes funny way. Despite my rating, I would recommend this book for anyone looking to become more proficient in seeing through anti-science claims and recognizing scams and pseudoscience. If this subject matter is new to you, you will probably find this book enlightening. It was written in 2012 and the message is as important now as it was then. Maybe more so, actually."
