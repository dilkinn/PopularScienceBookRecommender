0,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"To any Young Earth Creationist who happens to be reading this reviewFirst, thank you for getting this far. It's to your credit: you're willing to find out something about what the other side has to say. You're probably expecting I'll tell you to read Dawkins's latest book. In fact, I'm not going to do that. Don't read this book. Dawkins is disrespectful and arrogant about Young Earth Creationism, and he will only annoy you. Instead, I suggest that you might want to look at Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. When Darwin wrote it, pretty much everyone in the world was a Young Earth Creationist. Darwin had a great deal of sympathy for the Creationist position, and one of his own favorite books, which influenced him deeply, was the Creationist classic Natural Theology, by William Paley. Despite all this, Darwin found arguments which soon convinced a large part of his audience that their ideas about Young Earth Creationism were wrong.Dawkins continually quotes Darwin. He shows that even though Darwin didn't understand how evolution works - no one knew about DNA yet, or even the basics of genetic theory - the evidence at his disposal produced an overwhelming case that evolution must be the the root cause of the huge diversity of observed species. The clearest and most unanswerable part of the argument is the geographical distribution of the different kinds of animals. Just stop and think for a moment about the single fact that sloths are only to be found in South America. If the story of the Biblical Flood were true, then those slow-moving, tree-dwelling sloths would somehow have had to migrate from Mount Ararat to Brazil in a few thousand years, leaving no colonies anywhere en route. Darwin's Victorian audience thought carefully about the sloths, and could not find a sensible answer. It was even more impossible for them to explain, not just that kangaroos only exist in Australia, but that many similar species - wallabies, koalas, wombats and other marsupials - also only exist in Australia. There were a thousand more pieces of evidence, and they gave up. Darwin did not try to humiliate them, and he honestly admitted that there were important parts of the story he did not yet understand. Even with those provisos, the case was unanswerable. Since Darwin's time, nearly all of the missing parts of his argument have been filled in, as Dawkins explains here. But that's less important. As I said, start with Darwin. He's writing politely and respectfully for people like you, who are skeptical about evolution and want to be shown good reasons to believe it, and he is remarkably convincing. "
1,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1212747-a-j,4,"There's a general feeling out there about Richard Dawkins that he's a little too shrill, a little too hard on people, and perhaps a tad too full of himself. I've had a couple of these thoughts from time to time, though not the last one, and would almost catch myself nodding in agreement until I put myself in the man's shoes. Professor Dawkins is brilliant with a capital B. He is fanatically devoted to science and his particular subject, evolutionary biology. He has spent his life researching and exploring the elegant mysteries and pathways of life on our lonely blue world. And what does he get in return? 44% of Americans––granted he's British––think that the earth and everything in it was specially created about ten thousand years ago, that man roamed the earth with dinosaurs, and that the whole of biology and evolutionary history are to be supplanted by a fairy tale about a couple of teenagers who were convinced by a talking snake to eat an enchanted apple. This state of affairs would be repugnant enough if it was a privately held fantasy; instead what Dawkins gets is constant bombardment from imbeciles who want creation 'science' 'theory' taught alongside evolution in schools, as if there was some competition between the two. By air, land, sea, or Trojan Horse (Intelligent Design, so called), biologists are incessantly having to deal with misrepresentation and ignorance on a profound and disturbing scale.I personally, however, can't be too harsh. Not only was I once a creationist; I was the worst kind of creationist, a young earth creationist. Not only was I a young earth creationist; I was the worst sort of young earth creationist, a Kent Hovindiite. I was to science was the Philistines were to the Hebrews, what the Empire was to the Rebellion, what that kid with down syndrome is to Einstein. What I can do, though, is say with complete certainty is that education, not argument, is the antidote to creationism. Ignorance isn't a crime, and usually people aren't ignorant on purpose. For your average layman, it's not his fault that science education standards are so poor, or that lying snake oil salesmen like Ken Ham successfully peddle bullshit for a living.Having considered all that, I'm fairly convinced that your typical creationist response to this book will be a glassy stare and a trickle of drool. Part of this will be the enormous amount of nonsense, misrepresentations, misunderstandings, outdated arguments, falsehoods, and outright lies that have until now occupied the six inches of space between their ears. Trying to explain the complexities of biology to someone who thinks that Big Bang Cosmology is 'darwinism' is a higher mountain than Dawkins book is likely able to climb. A lot of bad wiring had to be completely redone even for me to follow the major themes of this book, and I've put a lot of effort into it. The second drawback is a personal weakness of Dawkins' writing. It's unfocussed, not particularly well organized, and it lacks the ferocious punch of amateur youtubers like Thunderf00t and Aronra (whose video series 'The Foundational Falsehoods of Creationism' is balls-out awesome). Granted, the history of life on our planet and all the myriad means that we have of understanding it is not a topic suited to one book. I still maintain that the chapters could have been better ordered and more centered around a particular point, as opposed to the more conversational sprawl that is Dawkins' style. I find him a better speaker-communicator than writer-communicator, but a better writer than orator, if that makes any sense. Despite that, I appreciate the effort, passion, and the expertise that Professor Dawkins brings to this book. It is in its way a powerful examination of this subject, and riddled with amazing discoveries and evidences that while they only manage to show a fragment of the deluge that is the evidence for evolution, still enriches the mind and helps non-scientists to explore the wonders of the natural world.""Evolution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt, beyond doubt evolution is a fact...That didn't have to be true. It is not self-evidently, tautologically, obviously true, and there was a time when most people, even educated people, thought it wasn't. It didn't have to be true, but it is....Evolution is the only game in town, the greatest show on earth."""
2,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1424509-diana,2,"Two disclaimers before I begin my review:1. I am an atheist.2. I am a molecular biologist.So, I am clearly not the target audience. That being said, I really wanted to like this book. I am so happy that there are people out there who are speaking out in defense of evolution and (although not in this book) atheism, and as such I want to support Richard Dawkins. However, the best way I can sum up my feelings about the book is to say that it resembles a very long version of an undergraduate's final paper on evolution. Many arguments are not at all clear or well made, the diagram labeling is irregular or completely non-existent, and he does not seem to grasp how to effectively use figures to add to the text. He contradicts himself at least once (but pretty majorly), but it seems that this is due more to a faulty simplification of the scientific explanation that to a lack of knowledge. Ultimately, that's what it comes down to for me: all of the faults I found in the book should not have been there, because I KNOW that HE KNOWS BETTER. Not to mention that his goal would have been better served had he saved all of his half-assed, baseless speculations for beers with the fellas and used the space in the book to include more evidence for evolution. For example, one thing he did not address at all is morality/altruism, which would have been very relevant for creationists (who ARE his target audience) and for which there are some really interesting theories. Finally, while I understand the frustration, condescending anger is not generally a great tool for convincing people, regardless of how wrong they are."
3,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879634-maria,5,"With the help of drawings, photos, cartoons, tables, diagrams & notes, an emphasis on extremely lucid step-by-step explanations, examples, iteration & reiteration & plenty of humor, R Dawkins shows that we are indeed so lucky to be witness to the Greatest Show on Earth -- this wonderful book is addressed not only to those interested in our natural world (and who'll maybe wish they'd majored in biology) but more particularly to the creationists and proponents of ""intelligent design"" -- as evidence for evolution it's one of the most fascinating books I've ever read. It's a beautifully detailed and concisely written effort (albeit a bit repetitious at times) that's full of extraordinary facts both serious and silly, a real experience. It's TERRIBLY witty. It filled me with joy. It should be read by everyone everywhere. "
4,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67532575-kevin-shepherd,5,"I can not emphasize enough how much I admire and respect Richard Dawkins. His books are veritable university courses on biology, anthropology and natural history, this one is no exception. If there's a knock on The Greatest Show On Earth, it's that you cannot read it when you're tired or sleepy. Richard is so passionate about his vocation that he sometimes forgets that some of us don't have his stamina, much less his vocabulary.Dawkins excels at anticipating counter arguments, probably because he hears them frequently, and he is quick to offer rock solid scientific evidence to bolster his bullet points. He also has a knack for coming at issues from various angles. Just when you think two pages of zoology have sufficiently put a topic to rest: BAM! here comes a paragraph of chemistry for good measure. This is what I love about Dawkins. He is adamantly opposed to ignorance. This is not a tome for the obtuse or faint of heart. This is a study in academic truth."
5,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,5,"An educational masterpiece of popular science, this is a brilliant, riveting page-turner written with eloquence, passion and competence.I am almost embarrassed to admit that I waited until now to read this shining book, which comprises so many themes in disparate but related areas in the realms of biology, anthropology, natural history, molecular chemistry and, of course, evolution theory.I am at a real loss to express how rewarding this reading experience has proved to be: after only 10% of the book I would not have hesitated to very highly recommend it to anybody interested in how life has evolved on this Planet. And, after less than 20% of the book, I was completely hooked: yes, many items discussed by Dawkins are public common knowledge, but the author puts everything all beautifully and passionately together in a riveting, compelling and highly coherent narrative that does not fail to illustrate the beauty and the unmatched thrill of the process of scientific inquiry. In particular, the case for evolution is proved with such an overwhelming overabundance of highly converging evidence, that only the most blinkered stupidity or close-mindedness can enable anybody to still promote a Creationist ideology in 2019. Some reviewers have criticized the barbed witticism and the occasionally acerbic attacks on Creationism carried out by the author in a sustained and forceful manner. I personally think these criticisms are unwarranted, and I actually found that Dawkins is always well justified and quite balanced and moderate in his approach: in this world of political correctness, too many people are scared to call a spade a spade and I think that the sheer obtuseness, stupidity and ignorance that pervade many anti-science Creationist attitudes should be named and denounced for what they are and for the danger that they represent to the future of the next generations. Dawkins' disdain for Creationism and its fundamental ideological opposition to science, and for its ""counter-arguments"" to evolution theory, is always completely warranted.Actually, i would have loved to see Dawkins highlight more explicitly how science is an integrated, coherent, cross-sustaining whole, similar to a gigantic epistemological crossword, and that you can't just pick and choose only the parts that do not conflict with your own religious or philosophical prejudices. This is precisely why climate change deniers, or ""history-deniers"" (using the apt term adopted by Dawkins to define Creationists) are not just dangerous for their own misguided ""theories"", but also because they implicitly jeopardize the position and progress of science ""in toto"". It is ironic that, given such an undeniable successes of modern science, even staunch Creationists hesitate to carry out a frontal attack on science, as some of them have at least some residual sense of ridicule: they prefer instead to promote pseudo-scientific misconceptions, (ab)using scientific terminology, or to promote the suggestion (like in the case of climate change) that the scientific community is divided on the issue. These attempts are as dangerous as any frontal explicit attack on science. Similarly dangerous, and similarly cowardly in their attempt to disguise the underlying ideology, are some of the s0-called ""academic freedom"" bills, which permit teachers to introduce creationist material into science classes. Science, truth and the natural world could not give a fig about the delusional ravings of ideologically inspired legislators: Nature is what it is, regardless of how we wish it to be. And Creationism, which has the same scientific credentials as Harry Potter, simply does not belong in a science class. However, having said all of this, I would not want to convey the incorrect impression that this book is mainly aimed at polemical aims: on the contrary, all arguments are presented in a coherent, lucid, highly informative and very persuasive way, and the elements of criticism are more than balanced by the book's constructive side, as the author has a real gift for lucidly treating some not-so-straightforward topics in a way any layman with a modicum of prior scientific education can very easily understand. The last chapter of the book is very sobering, illustrating how almost half the Americans (42%, according to a 2008 poll) reject evolution and believe that the Universe, the Earth and all current forms of life were created less than 10,000 years ago. Sadly, things cannot have improved much since, especially in the sad spectacle represented by today's post-truth and anti-science Trump's America, and this is all the reason to publish and promote books by the likes of Dawkins (the real solution would be to fundamentally overhaul and rebuild the public educational system, as there must be something terribly wrong and dysfunctional in a system that generates a population of which half believe in a ""Young Earth"" - but this is a different subject, I guess).Totally recommended, this book should be made compulsory reading in all high schools. 5 stars.PS: a couple of quotes from the book:- it would be nice if those who oppose evolution would take a tiny bit of trouble to learn the merest rudiments of what it is that they are opposing- (as a consequence of the Young Earth Creationist views)  stars whose distance from us is more than a few thousand light years must have been created with ready-made light beams stretching almost all the way to us  "
6,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,5,"What a stunning read. I have read several books by Dawkins, mostly concerning evolution, and I think this was the easiest to understand. This is partly because I skipped the most difficult bits! For instance I am never going to know how carbon dating is done - but I can live with that. For the most part the book was hugely readable and deeply fascinating. The one thing that marred my pleasure slightly was the stress throughout on proving the theory of evolution to creationists, but then he would give us the statistics about how many creationists there are in the world......and his preoccupation became understandable.I will end with some notes of the delights I found in the book - most of them taken verbatim from the book. (view spoiler)[
  *GENESThese don't mix like paint (which would create a middling average half way between our two parents....and if it did, all variation would rapidly disappear.) Instead genes passing on is like the shuffling and re-shuffling of a card pack. Genes don't blend, they shuffle. You could say they are shuffled badly, with groups of cards sticking together for several generations of shuffling, before chance happens to split them.Any one of your eggs (or sperms if you are male) contains either your father's version of a particular gene or your mother's version, not a blend of the two. And that particular gene came from one (& only one) of your four grandparents, and from one (& only one) of your eight grandparents.* GENE POOLSThese are created in environments of all different shapes, sizes and outlook. Islands, valleys surrounded by mountains which animals can't cross, areas of a certain climate etc. Gene pools are sculpted when humans interfere, eg when dog breeders breed bulldogs to encourage certain attributes.* HYBRIDSThis involves a deliberate violation of the gene pool....eg the Labradoodle is a hybrid between a standard poodle and a Labrador retriever.Some people are trying to breed labradoodles directly with other labradoodles, and to get them to breed true. At present second generation labradoodles recombine to produce more variety than pre-bred dogs are supposed to show. This is how many 'pure' breeds started - they went through an intermediate stage of high variation, subsequently trimmed down through generations of careful breeding, so that a proper purebreed began to regularly appear.*A SINGLE MAJOR MUTATIONSometimes new breeds of dogs get their start with the adoption of a single major mutation. In nature large mutations seldom survive eg basset hounds and dachshunds with very short legs acquired them in a singe step with the genetic mutation called achondroplasia, a classic example of a large mutation unlikely to survive in the wild. *BREEDING FOR SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES AND TALENTSFor instance dogs that can herd sheep, race, or pull sledges, or even 'point'. We could do the same for human beings too - though ethically this could pose a problem...........................................................................WAYS OF MEASURING TIME........*DENDROCHRONOLOGY - THE STUDY OF TREE RINGS.Tree rings show whether it was a good lush year or a year of drought. These form into recognisable patterns eg a bunch of trees living between 1950 - 1970 will share the same patterns of drought and plenty for that period. You can overlap tree rings this way, and create a library of tree rings going back through history eg.Tree 1 1950 - 2016Tree 2 1930 - 1990 With tree 2, you have as a reference the patterns laid down with tree 1, from 1950 - 1990, so you can work out that the earlier rings in tree 2 make a pattern for 1930-1950. You can do the same thing with trees 3 and 4.....steadily going further back through history with each tree. This way dendrochronoligists can date trees back over thousands of years, (theoretically it should work back over millions of years. You don't have to cut a tree down to measure its rings, you can just take a plug from the tree.*THE SEDIMENT IN GLACIAL LAKES (VARVES)This lays down strata from season to season, and year to year.*CORAL REEFSThis has annual growth rings, like trees.*RADIOACTIVE CLOCKS	1) There are a lot of them to choose from2) They cover time from centuries to thousands of millions of years.3) They have a margin of error of 1%4) Layers or strata of rock get their names from the fossils we find in them.CumbrianOrdovicianSilurianDevonianCarboniferousPermianTriassicJurassicCretaceousEtc.and you get sub-categories eg Upper Jurassic, Middle Jurassic and Lower Jurassic.5) You can use radioactive dating of rocks to place a date on them.Carbon is the element most indispensable to life - it enters the food web via photosynthesis in plants and from then on to living creatures.Carbon dating is the most common form of dating. It was invented in the 1940s. It tells us that the earth is 4.6 billions years old.....................................................................*CONSERVAPEDIAThe notoriously misleading imitation of Wikipedia, It has a creationist editor - a lawyer called Andrew Schlafly.*SPEED OF EVOLUTIONThis can be slow or fast. The former is illustrated by Limulus (the horseshoe crab), which is sometimes called a living fossil. The latter is illustrated by bacterial strains, which have with great speed evolved a resistance to antibiotics.*THE MISSING LINKThis has several meanings.1) Gaps in the fossil record - eras shown in rock strata where there were no fossils. This is because the animals around then were not good fossil material, for instance they didn't have hard, mineralized skeletons.2) The Piltdown HoaxMany people were seeking a link between man and other primates. Eventually someone 'found' Piltdown Man - but it was a hoax. In the intervening time since the hoax we have found numerous fossils that link modern humans to the common ancestor we share with chimpanzees. Interestingly there are as yet no fossils - as yet - linking that ancestor (which was neither chimpanzee nor human) to modern chimpanzees....but there are other ways of proving our connection to chimps.* OUT OF THE SEAAll animals originated in the sea, and some, like whales, manatees and dugongs went back into the water. They never developed gills, and still breathe air. Others like seals and sea lions went part way back to the sea.Hippos are quite closely related to whales, or at least to the ancestor of whales who walked on the land. Pigs are related to them too.The most recent ancestor of all fish is shared by many non-fish too. Humans and other land vertebrates are descended from lobe-finned fish. We share an ancestor with coelacanthus and lungfish.*THE WAY WE BUILD OUR BODIES FROM EMBRYOSWe do not do this from a blueprint or some sort of instructions from an architectural design. We do it more organically, like the dance of a flock of starlings, swooping beautifully together, but without a leader. There are thousands of birds but they never collide. They behave as a single individual - wheeling and turning as one. The edges of the flocks are sharply defined. The density is the same throughout the flick, but the starlings have no choreographer and no leader. This is how embryology works.It is all done by local rules.It is done at various levels, but especially the level of a single cell.Influences that go on within the developing cells.....Genes on proteinsGenes on genesProteins on the expression of genesProteins on proteinsMembranesChemical gradientsPhysical and chemical guide rails in embryos.Hormones (& other mediators of action at a distance.)Labelled cells seeking other with identical or complementary labels.(Nobody understand the whole picture, and nobody needs to....)* HOMOLOGYThe study of how bones in mammals correspond across the species - however different they are eg comparing a human hand with a bat wing, or horse's hoof.* SAMENESS AND DIFFERENCEThe vertebrate skeleton is invariant across all vertebrates - while individual bones differ.The crustaceans exoskeleton is invariant across all crustaceans while the individual 'tubes' vary.The DNA code is invariant across all living creatures, while the individual genes themselves vary. Not just the genetic code itself, but the whole gene/protein system for running life is the same in animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, archaea and viruses. What varies is what is written in the code....not the code itself...........................................................WAYS OF TESTING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MAMMALS......*TESTING THE CLOSENESS/DISTANCE OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MAMMALS BY INJECTING RABBITS WITH PROTEINS AND INSPECTING THE STRENGTH OF THE ANTIBODIES PRODUCED IN RESPONSE.The idea of this upsets me so I am not going to describe it more than this, but I feel it must be mentioned as it is of importance...not least because it showed how closely humans are related to chimpanzees.DNA HYBRIDIZATIONAnother bit of the book I skipped. It is how scientists worked out there there is 98% genetic similarity between humans and chimpanzees. The technique involves heat and melting points.READING THE SEQUENCE OF LETTERS IN THE GENES THEMSELVESThis is a more recent method, and more expensive. You measure the similarity between a pair of matching genes from difference species.................................................................*THE HUMAN BODY IS A SERIES OF MODIFIED IMPERFECTIONSThis is a clear sign of the fact that we evolved. Improvements could only come about by making ad hoc modifications to what is already there. We are burdened with all sorts of historical relics, anomalies and inperfections.Interestingly, an improvement is quite likely to evolve not from the old organ which previously did a job, but from something completely different, which performed a completely different function....eg when our fish ancestors took to breathing air they didn't modify their gills to make a lung - instead they modified a pouch in the gut.*MANKIND HAS ONLY RECENTLY BECOME UPRIGHT.We have been land animals for about 400 million years. We have walked on our hind legs for only about 1% of that time.Habitually walking on two legs as we do, had far-reaching ramifications all over the body, which entailed lots of compensatory adjustments. the reason that so many of us get back pain is because we weren't originally designed to walk upright.*WHEN WE SEE THE OUTSIDE OF ANIMALS WE SEE ELEGANT DESIGN, WHEN WE SEE THEM DISSECTED WE SEE A MESS.This is because of the history of how our bodies have adapted to our changing shapes, lifestyles and postures.*THE ARMS RACEThe fastest animals in the world are cheetahs, lions and several species of antelope ie predators and their prey. They have both evolved to run very fast in relations to one another, one to pursue, one to escape. But nature knows when to stop. Increased speed creates thin, vulnerable legs....so there has been a cut off point, where further speed has been penalised. (Faster animals have not survived/bred.) Antelopes would not run as fast as they do were they not chased by fast predators, instead they would shunt more energy into making babies, or laying down more fat for the winter.*NATURAL SELECTION(To me this seems to contradict the paragraph above...)This will favour the most competitive individuals, right up to the moment when the last one dies. It can drive a population to extinction, whilst constantly favouring, to the bitter end, those competitive genes that are destined to be the last to go extinct.*NATURAL SELECTION AND GENE SURVIVALThis is all about the survival of self-replicating DNA, be it in an elephant, or in the virus that is making you sneeze with the common cold. The ultimate message is ""duplicate me"".

7,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin,5,"Richard Dawkins has taken his seat along with Stephen Hawking and Carl Sagan as a great populist of science. In all of his science books and especially in The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence For Evolution, He has taken a complex subject and presented it with clarity to a population that usually gets lost in the seemingly foreign language of most scientists. Yet he does not ""dumb down"" neither. He has a gift for beautifully explaining difficult topics in a way a layman can understand. He saves his famous disdain, which was in abundant display in The God Delusion, for only when it is deserved. Much is made of Dawkins' supposed arrogance yet when he writes something that can be seen as arrogance, it is more of a sense of amazement that his fellow man can totally dismiss the evidence of evolution. There is a hilarious transcript of this in the book where Dawkins patiently sets out the evidence of intermediate fossils, and where this evidence can be seen, to a Creationist and the Creationist totally ignores it saying ""Show me the evidence"" like a mantra. Dawkins states he is aiming this book at the people who believe in creationism, which according to recent polls is 40 percent of the American population. I doubt that those people will give this book the time of day. Yet I also think that the 40 percent number includes a good number of people who on ""on the fence"" so to speak, those who simply haven't seen the evidence for evolution presented in such a clear and understandable manner. I think that is a reasonable audience for this book along with the ones, like me, who have a reasonable knowledge of evolution but wish to learn more. "

9,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1442466-kris-madaus,5,"Wow! This is definitely one of those books that makes you look at the world a little differently after reading. Richard Dawkins writes so well on the subject. He is extremely thorough in his description of the fact of evolution, but he doesn't dumb down his explanations either. If you are interested in a particular subject, he often references places you can go to continue the story. He paints a beautiful picture of how evolution really works and why that helps you appreciate this amazing world we live in just a little more.I won't get into some of the details he shares, but based on the facts that Dawkins reveals in his appendix about the exceedingly high percentage of people that believe in a creationist view, I thing every high school student should have to read this book. But it doesn't matter what you believe. The evidence shared in this book is fascinating. Long term lab experiments that shows us evolution before our very eyes, sea turtles that evolved from the sea to land to sea to land to sea again, our distant ancestor named the lungfish, how DNA and mitochondria are used to trace ancestors, the evidence for evolution across all branches of science - it is all simply intriguing.I appreciate people like Dawkins that can share such amazing things. I especially appreciate how he is more than willing to face creationists head on. If you don't believe in evolution, look at the evidence and then see if you feel the same way afterward - that is, if you are truly interested in answers to the big questions of life. You can say that Dawkins seems a bit aggressive in his books at times, but think about it this way. If you had a group of people constantly questioning questioning that the earth revolves around the sun, and you collected layers and layers of evidence to answer the question beyond reasonable doubt, but they still believe the sun revolved around the earth after all of the years of research, wouldn't you be a bit frustrated too? Dawkins is not only confronting creationists. He is confronting irrationality. Irrationality affects our quality of life. I commend Dawkins for saying enough is enough. He doesn't sugar coat the issue. He says is like it is.Excellent book!"

11,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2849443-catie,5,"Dawkins arguments for evolution are elegant and, in some cases, simply breath-taking. As a psychology professor myself, and as one who has had to contend with ""history deniers"" for years, I especially liked his description of Lenski's research on the evolution of bacteria. Although facts have always been denied by those who claim Intelligent Design as a valid explanation for all nature, Dawkins painstakingly and elegantly lays out unassailable facts in support of the theory of evolution. He stakes his claim early in the book (""...evolution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt....That said, I doubt seriouly that his book will challenge those who view evolution as only a theory, precisely because they would never open their minds to such a text as this!

12,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2113792-tag-riggs,2,"After reading this book, I quickly realized that it was targeted for a particular audience--the choir complete with holy robes and clapping hands shouting, ""...Preach it brother Dawkins, preach it my brother, Evolution AMEN!, Hallelujah!"" I honestly think that it is required that you be a Dawkinite and part of the Dawkins Tabernacle Choir in order for you to take this book seriously. I was fully expecting some kind of scientific treatise yet it ended up being like a bunch of guys on the dock laughing and drinking beer talking about how the big one got away. It is amazing how he comes forth in every chapter in bold declarative sentences without justifications or support (support other than being anomalous tautologies) to conclude in mealy mouthed suppositions and suggestions.I have done a chapter by chapter review on my Facebook page so if interested, you may look for my opinions over there. For a guy who claimed many books on evolution under his belt yet forgot to give evidence to all his previous ones until TGSOE (He even admits this), I am amazed at what people are willing to believe simply because someone says it to be thus. Dumbing down has reached a new low on this one. I cannot see how anyone who approaches the subject from a scholarly viewpoint can take this book seriously."

In 4 billion years we went from a single cell to a fully developed human, and now each of us has repreated it in the 9 months we are in the womb of our mother. The wonder of epigenisis without a blueprint!But the funniest part in it was his quote of Monty Pythons 'All things dull and ugly':All things dull and uglyAll creatures short and squatAll things rude and nastyThe Lord God made the lotEach little snake that poisonsEach little wasp that stingsHe made their brutish venomHe made their horrid wingsAll things sick and cancerousAll evil great and smallAll things foul and dangerousThe Lord God made them allEach nasty little hornetEach beastly little squidWho made the spiky urchin?Who made the sharks?

15,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7130641-cherie,5,"Richard Dawkins has crafted a masterpiece dedicated to explaining evolution in a way that the layman can understand, providing excellent examples of evidence from fossil evidence to observable evidence, genetic evidence, and so on. My personal favorite chapter was on the geographic distribution of animals and speciation. It is really like an extraordinary puzzle that fits together so beautifully. Richard Dawkins uses the detective analogy to describe the study of evolution. And I can't think of anything more fitting. Because of course we weren't there and we can't see macro evolution in action, but we can see the clues (evidence) left behind and see that evolution is indeed a fact of nature. I thought it was excellently paced. Richard Dawkins takes it slow at first, leading up from artificial and sexual selection to get the reader accustomed to the idea of natural selection. Then before he talks about fossil evidence he first makes sure the reader understands how dating methods work and how accurate they are. It's just fantastic, I learned so much and it was very interesting. Richard Dawkins writes with a passion and devotion that is difficult to understand for creationists. They ask how an atheist can be filled with awe and wonder with life if they believe it was all an accident. The answer is because nature in its entirety is chaotic and unusual... It's cruel and harsh, and very uncaring... But it's also beautiful and magnificent and completely fascinating. To say it all was created by a god is a mockery of the complexity that is shown in life. This should honestly be required reading. So many people lack a basic understanding of evolution or even a respect of science in general. I have already recommended this book to several friends and some creationists that I've debated, but I encourage everybody to read this at some point in their life. "
16,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215485-megan,5,"I wish I'd had engaging and interesting texts like this to read when I had to take science classes in high school. I always wanted to like science so much, but I always got bogged down in minutae, in questions the text or teachers didn't address, and in the boredom of rote memorization. This book really made me like biology. Not only does it explain concepts in an intelligent and cohesive way, it has pictures! Color pictures, even. Much like the ones I stared at in biology or earth science instead of paragraphs of text. It absolutely engaged my visual approach to learning.I really enjoyed the way various bits of evidence for evolution were put forth, and weaved into other parts. This book has so much information beyond just the fossil record, it's awesome. Many disciplines of science, from paleontology to astronomy to genetics, are pulled in to all establish evidence for the evolutionary theory. And Richard Dawkins writes in such an engaging manner. I really enjoyed this one."
17,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"Oh, Dawkins. Tell me more of evolution, please. Speak to me of genes and their ways. Teach me things about the world. I could read this stuff for hours. I am endlessly fascinated and the more I understand of evolution, the more I am aware of how unbelievably lucky I am that I exist, that anything exists, that I can learn about it."
18,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51061124-bruce-hatton,5,"Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins is one of those rare scientists who is capable of addressing his specific area of science to the layperson (and I certainly am such – biology wasn’t even on the syllabus at my school) in a lucid and enlightening manner without ever having to “dumb down”. His unwavering enthusiasm for the subject is evident throughout, as is his often wicked sense of humour.This certainly isn’t a book one can rush through. However, I found a careful study revealed many of the wonders of evolution by natural selection and explained why there were so many “flawed designs” (including humans) as individual creatures very gradually adapted in order to survive changing environments.The reading process is helped enormously by plenty of illustrations, diagrams and some beautiful colour photographs. Each chapter had its own breathtaking revelations. Although it took me a while to get through, overall I found this an extremely enlightening and rewarding read."

In fact, Dawkins -who is notorious for his criticism of religion- goes on and lists a number of British #bishops and public figures who call for teaching of evolution in publicly-funded schools.I recommend reading Dawkins book first since he explains what is evolution and natural selection in detail before moving to the evidence while Coyne presents a lot of evidences and details.For books that try to reconcile between religion and evolution, I hear that ""Finding Darwin's God"" & ""The Language of God"" are good, although I haven't read them yet."
20,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"This was written to inform those who believe in evolution how to counter the arguments of those who don't. It hasn't been worth the effort in my experience. Young Earth Creationists (YEC) who believe that the world is only as old as their version of their bible tells them it is (The term apparently applies to people in all branches of the Abrahamic religions plus a few others.) are so dedicated to their intentional ignorance that changing their minds is impossible. They have THE ANSWER & it doesn't matter if it doesn't make a lick of sense & continually contradicts itself. They'll still use cell phones & praise their god(s). None of it was surprising since I'm surrounded by them. Dawkins, who lives in the UK, even mentions the Ark Park & Creationist Museum which are both in my state & not too far away. Shudder. Anyway, that thread of the narrative got pretty old for me & it lost a star for that. Probably a personal problem.I found his explanations in the workings of evolution really interesting, though. Even though I've read several of his books, he's come up with new areas & explanations that make sense of some truly remarkable adaptations.Here are the chapters from the Wikipedia entry:The book is divided into 13 chapters spanning over 400 pages, and includes an appendix called ""The history-deniers"" in the end material. Only a theory? (nature of scientific theory and fallibility) Dogs, cows and cabbages (artificial selection) The primrose path to macro-evolution Silence and slow time (age of the Earth and the geologic time scale) Before our very eyes (examples of evolution observed) Missing link? What do you mean, 'missing'? (the fossil record) Missing persons? Missing no longer (human evolution) You did it yourself in nine months (a statement attributed to J. B. S. Haldane; discusses developmental biology) The ark of the continents (biogeography and plate tectonics) The tree of cousinship (the tree of life, homology and analogy) History written all over us (vestigiality and unintelligent design) Arms races and 'evolutionary theodicy' (coevolution and evolutionary arms races) There is grandeur in this view of life (based on the final passage of On the Origin of Species)I read this as an audiobook narrated by Dawkins & Lalla Ward. They're a great team. Really make the words pop. Highly recommended."
21,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"What a wonderful book! I've enjoyed several other books by Richard Dawkins, and this is his best. The chapter named ""History Written All Over Us"" could have been called, ""Unintelligent Design"". It is just one of many arguments, why evolution is a proven theory. Dawkins makes a point that a good scientific theory must be falsibiable. That means, that if certain evidence were ever collected, or observations made, then one must conclude that the theory is false. He describes how if fossils were ever found in the wrong geological strata, one would immediately have to conclude that evolution is false. But although tons of fossils have been discovered all over the world, not a single one has ever been found in the wrong geological layer."
22,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,5,"So, I admire Dawkins as both a scientist and a writer. His passion for science and the endless search for truth is infectious and his talent for writing magnificent prose is noteable.I had the pleasure to go see him speak at the Center for Inquiry in D.C., and also got to mingle with him before the show (a fun story for sure). Needless to say, he was amazing. I know some people think he is an angry atheist, but I think they are missing the point, and he does a great job of making his point at the beginning of this book. A very worthwhile read for anyone curious about evolution. So much information yet very readable."
23,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1334545-david-s-t,4,"This isn't the best introductory book I've read on evolution, Dawkins loves to insult the people who don't hold his views, goes way to far sometimes to get his point across and has a tendency to ramble on and mention interesting but irrelevant stuff. Once you get past the flaws this actually is a pretty good book, oddly by the end some of those qualities I hated about the book in the beginning, I started to appreciate more in the end (I kind of enjoy the almost pointless side stories and facts). When I started reading this book, I put it down for a while because I got tired of the creationist rants, which apparently the high number of people who deny evolution is why this book is written. Dawkins even goes as far as comparing an evolution denier as the equivalent of someone denying the existence of the roman civilization or even worse a holocaust denier. I'm sorry but lacking the understanding or denying evolution is nothing like denying the holocaust. For one thing we've never really witnessed one animal evolving into another completely different species, meaning one ""kind"" into another ""kind"", in our lifetime (which is far too short of a time scale) or even more a bacteria evolving into a mammal, this doesn't mean evolution is false (its not), but it is far different than denying the holocaust. Anyways eventually I picked the book back up and it was far better as I got further into it. Also expect to hear the word “history-deniers” every few pages, I guess he wants us to remember just how terrible the evolution deniers are. Since this book is written to convince the 40% of American who deny evolution, Dawkins should realize by now that insulting your target audience isn't the best way to get them to listen to you. If anything his books do more help to the young earth creationist movement and intelligent design. The subtitle of this book is “The Evidence for Evolution”, which is kind of an unfitting title, I found that Coyne's Why Evolution is True contains far more evidence in far fewer pages and is overall a better introduction to evolution. You see Dawkins often goes off on rants which do not to move the evidence along. For example in a chapter he discusses the age of the earth, he spends several pages discussing getting the age from tree rings. You see you can match the width of tree rings with others and go back to earlier dates, but then he says that the chain of tree rings goes back 11,000 years only, well the pages he spent on this argument do nothing to convince a young earth creationist of the age of the earth, in fact the argument works in their favor. The book is full of these little side notes and stories which causes the page numbers to go up, but the relevant information doesn't follow. Also expect tons of foot notes with mostly rants about TV shows he wants to be on, his childhood, or why we should call the Beijing Man, the Peking fossil, ect.I know I've complained some but don't get me wrong, this book, once you look past the flaws, is still very interesting and worth reading (assuming that you're not a creationist). Many of the side stories which I complained about are actually interesting if you don’t mind frequent diversions and he goes into DNA a little more than the other non DNA specific evolution books I've read. So in the end I do think its pretty good, just not as a first book on evolution. "
24,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45702383-a-l-buehrer,2," I have to see both sides. I’m really not content to only read what reconfirms what I already believe. Even if I doubt that anything could change my mind on a subject (sometimes facts are facts) I want to be able to see what the other person sees and understand how they think.  I was in this objective sportsmanly mood when I picked this book up. By the end of chapter one I was struggling to maintain that attitude. Why? Because Dawkins has absolutely no interest in playing fair. I like to think that even people who disagree with me can still be intelligent intellectually honest people. Dawkins clearly doesn’t. I took issue with a lot more than just the science in this book. Overall, it was well constructed—I think he went over the subjects that he needed to cover. But…I don’t know. Maybe I’m out-growing pop science, but for me, he wasted so much time on prose explaining obvious things, and trying to keep us poor non-scientists interested.  I didn’t notice his writing voice in The Selfish Gene. I vastly prefer that book. The Selfish Gene had something that actually took some page-time to explain. In this book his style felt like somebody desperately trying to write a lot of words. A lot of chains of adjectives and repeated ideas. I found myself skimming large sections because he had made his point and it was time to start connecting it to the next one, but he was in no hurry. He did a lot of things I never would have done writing a similar book. He claimed in the beginning he was writing for both evolutionists who wanted to combat their stupid creationist relatives at family gatherings and for creationists themselves. I can confirm he was not writing this book with any thought for the possibility that the second group would read him at all. He doesn’t believe in creationists enough to think they would ever dare to read something that might shake their faith. Neither does he ever show any respect for his opposition. He constantly refers to evolution skeptics as “history-deniers” and stereotypes them as willfully scientifically illiterate and emotionally hysterical.  Never once in the course of the book does Dawkins acknowledge that there are fully-educated, fully-rational scientists that don’t read the evidence the way he does. He consistently juxtaposes “scientists” and “history-deniers” as mutually exclusive groups. Never once does he even mention a debate or exchange between himself and real ID scientists. His anecdotes are limited to face-offs with journalists and random people on the street.  The biggest downfall of the book stems from the fact that—unlike some of us—Dawkins makes no effort to understand his opposition. This manifests as the most glaring scientific mistake in the whole book: he wastes a huge amount of time proving microevolution. News flash: educated creationists believe in microevolution. Microevolution is simply variation that arises from shuffling genetic information. (Dawkins doesn’t think I, as a creationist, know what “information” is. He can be wrong.) Macroevolution requires significant amounts of new genetic information and is much more problematic. Macroevolution is the process that, over billions of years, turns worms to humans. This is what we need you to prove, Dawkins. Anyway. I read this. "

I kept delaying reading his books and the loss was mine. For beneath that thin veneer or cynicism, lies a man deeply in love with science and fellow human-beings. BTW, this was my 4th book by him.In this book, Dawkins first explains the problem - almost 40% of Americans and a comparable number of developed-world Europeans believe in creationism and reject evolution. And then step-by-step, he takes the major arguments against evolution and sets out to dismantle them with detailed examples and explanations. Infact, as I already think evolution is true and was trying to understand it better, it sometimes felt as though he was being too detailed. But, perhaps this approach suited his primary audience of creationists.In particular would mention Chapter 4 - that describes the Lenski experiment on evolution in detail and it was truly mind-blowing to read about evolution in action."
26,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12484910-charbel,4," Evolution is one of my favourite subjects, and it saddens me how many people refuse to see the beauty of it, let alone give it a chance. I've never been one to push my opinions on others, and I consider myself an open minded person, but I feel that people don't believe in evolution, simply because they don't want to believe in it.   However, I am happy to say that once again Richard Dawkins has presented the unifying theory of evolution convincingly. Unfortunately, the only people that would be willing to read this with an open mind are evolution enthusiasts, like myself.  This book is charismatic, scientific and a brilliant read. I would definitely recommend this to those interested in evolutionary bioligy. And on a personal note, I look forward to reading my next Dawkins book."

This is a wonderful book that richly describes, in immense details, the wonder that is evolution. Here is a book that really shows the awe of science, and nature and how the world has become the great cornucopia of life that it has become. "
28,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"Richard Dawkins is, from my point of view, a fairly unpleasant man even when I agree with him. He sets out to make this book an explanation of how evolution works (but for that, I would go with Coyne’s Why Evolution is True), and why it is the correct explanation for various phenomena we can observe around us. It’s not as bad as The God Delusion for anti-theist statements, though there are a few speckled in there, and he makes a fairly good line of argument.Of course, since I think evolution is an obvious conclusion, so I’m not exactly the audience he was hoping to convince — and it’s likely I didn’t notice instances of his usual arrogant attitude that would bother someone who doesn’t already believe in the same things. I think you’re probably safer with Coyne’s book.Or this set of logical steps:1. There are creatures who are better adapted to their environment than others of the same species.Because they are better adapted, they will be more successful in survival and, consequently, breeding.2. These traits, when heritable, can be passed on the creature’s offspring — and they can have many offspring.3. These offspring will be better adapted, and will meet others who are also well adapted to breed with.4. Good adaptations accumulate over the course of generations.5. The environment is not stable and changes over time. Adaptation is necessary to allow a species to survive in the same area, and species do survive in the same area.6. Over a long period of time, enough changes will accumulate that individuals of that species would not be able to breed with the original species, or with a branch of the species that adapted differently.7. Evolution via natural selection has necessarily occurred.Plus extra evidence like shared DNA, the fact that we can artificially (and in a very short space of time) cause a species to evolve by selecting traits we want (e.g. high milk yield in cows), and the fossil record which contains plenty of examples of transitional fossils… You don’t need Dawkins; go back to Darwin. Even without the evidence we have now, he saw the necessary chain of events, and he was much more sympathetic to other views, and meticulous about his evidence.Nonetheless, Dawkins’ book is clear and pretty well-written; I just don’t like his attitude, and I don’t think he will reach the desired audience.Originally posted here."
29,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"The Greatest Show on Earth by Richard Dawkins The Greatest Show on Earth is another solid book in a series of books by Richard Dawkins.

No one better at combining evolutionary biology knowledge and communication than Dawkins. 4. Great illustrations. 5. Co-evolution explained. 6.

A bibliography worthy of the author. Negatives: 1. I get the sense this book was a bit rushed because it doesn't have the same eloquence as previous books. 2. Not as concise as it should have been. In summary, this is a very solid book. It's not the best book on evolution for the masses that distinction goes to Mr. Coyne, ""Why Evolution Is True"" but excellent nonetheless. Recommendations include: ""Your Inner Fish..."" by Neil Shubin, ""The Making of the Fittest"" by Sean B. Carroll, and ""Relics of Eden..."" by Daniel J. Fairbanks."
30,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,2,"I feel like I've had a Dawkins overload; maybe that's why I wasn't all that thrilled with this book, although some parts are very interesting (the part about dating from rings on trees and that sort of thing.) But his tone in arguing with believers in literal Biblical creation is annoying and condesending. Although I am firmly convinced of Darwin's theory, I think it's possible that religious writings such as the Bible (I am not all that familiar with any other holy books, I'm afraid) can be excused and interpreted by understanding the obvious: that people at the time of the writing did not have the knowledge we now have, and they made sense of things in the only way they knew how. Creating the earth in 6 days was meaningless at the time because what defines a day in the birth of the solar system? I can't come up with any science to rationalize the rib story, but as far as the eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that's a pretty obvious reference to the origins of human consciousness, as in, they became self-aware and realized they were (gasp) naked. I doubt there was any snake involved but possibly the snake is a metaphor for evil/cunning; at any rate, I would not be surprised if the trouble was started by a woman.Dawkins makes no attempt at any understanding of his opponents, which is fine I guess, but to me, a good book looks at both sides."
31,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82894263-henning,4,"This work has to be a thorn in the side to all creationists. Dawkins refutes the most frequently put forward theories and sometimes simple lies and fairy tales of the modern creationists with clear evidence from an evolutionary standpoint.He provides several explanations for each example given from the animal and plant world and clearly explains why ""Darwin was right"".I found it unbelievable that, according to official surveys, so many people seriously believe that the world we know with all its diversity was only created 10,000 years ago."
32,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6794439-marius-masalar,3,"This is a challenging book to assess. My first question, upon finishing it, is ""who is this for?""The science is too involved for a scientifically illiterate fundamentalist creationist audience, the sardonic tone likewise off-putting to them, and the atheists like me who share his broad perspective hardly need a hand-held walk through the garden of nature's wonders and weirdnesses.Then again, maybe we do: it should be emphasised that this book makes for a fantastic full spectrum look at the subject of evolutionary theory, one complete with some excellent analogies, stunning facts, and wise correlations. Anyone with a high school level understanding of biology will be more than equipped to follow along and learn.Unfortunately, Dawkins' extensive expertise in the subject matter often falls prey to his fairly direct sense of humour, expressed via a mocking tone that does more to further the stereotype of him as a shrill British ponce than to reveal his truer nature as a passionate humanist.Inevitably, I am drawn to wonder what the inimitable Christopher Hitchens would have done with a similar task, equipped with Dawkins' subject expertise. I suspect his subtler wit, fantastically evocative writing, and sophisticated understanding of debate would have produced a finer work.Nevertheless, I would not hesitate to recommend The Greatest Show On Earth to anyone who seeks a peerless introduction to the current state of evolutionary theory, or to a thicker-skinned creationist seeking to inform themselves about the opposing side in the debate about the origins of life."
33,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5992644-mg-mason,5,"Dawkins latest book finally tackles creationism in a not-so-head-on collision. Always vowing to never answer a challenge directly, Dawkins does it in the best way he possibly could, by demonstrating why evolution is true.He seemingly leaves no stone uncovered in the challenge, often tackling direct claims made by creationists and demonstrating why they are false. He also covers how speciation has been observed and the whole ""show me your transitional fossils"" non-argument is handled masterfully. By demonstrating selective breeding of plants and animals by humans, he shows how easily and quickly humans have created new species within a couple of generations.Illustrated with images, colour plates and excellent description, Dawkins knows how to hold the reader's attention and to explain even the most complex scientific terms in easy to understand language. I'm not sure why this book was written though. In 2009, Jerry Coyne released ""Why Evolution is True"" which though I have not yet read, I imagine covers many similar themes and evidences.The other issue is of course that this book is NOT going to be read by the very people it is directed at. Creationists, despite their protests of ""teaching the controversy"" and ""academic freedom"", are not interested in understanding what evolution is. Those who are going to buy it and read it are those already convinced by the evidence for an old earth, natural selection and evolution by common descent, so the question must be asked in the words of Daniel Dennett... cui bono?See more book reviews at my blog"
34,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"Bookmarks begins its review of this book by saying: ""'Like a detective reconstructing a crime' (San Francisco Chronicle), Dawkins amasses a mountain of evidence in this richly illustrated, enormously readable explanation of the theory of evolution."" This book is Dawkins' effort to lay out the evidence for evolution. His target is the ""intelligent design"" approach to explaining why species end up as they are--explicitly rejecting Darwinian evolutionary theory.The book features many fascinating examples of evolution in action--including demonstrating that many species do NOT exhibit anything like intelligent design. His description of the wacky nerve structure of giraffes shows the willy nilly nature of evolution--and is certainly not consistent with the concept of intelligent design.Anyone familiar with other of Dawkins' works will not be surprised at what a nice read this book is. The author does write well and is persuasive throughout the book. However, those who believe in intelligent design are not apt to accept his arguments.For those who wish to get a sense of the logic of and evidence for evolution, this is a good starting point."
35,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,3,"Ironically a book on evolution would be a chimera of textbook, polemic, and panegyric it does none of those things particularly well. Too informal to be authoritative and too casual to be something one could refer someone to this book fits into the wide middle of Dawkins book which are summed up as ""nice but someone else has done it better"".Dawkins' books seem to grow out a nagging urge to yell something at the world and ""the point"" is poorly spread across sprawling chapters that reference across each other suggesting the book could have been better organized. The color plate system makes it easy to ""spoil"" section as it's not obvious what picture is being referred to.One section does stand head-and-shoulders above others in the discussion of dating tools. I never realized that tree-ring dating was as powerful as shown here, providing us a 12 millenia time-line in some places. If you can get it from your library or otherwise without cost, reading these sections is a good usage of ones time in providing a condensed pile of methodologies to pass to the uninformed. "

It ranks right up there with Climbing Mount Improbable and River out of Eden. Dawkins writes beautifully, especially for a scientist, with a combination of erudition and wit. I have a fairly strong background in science, but I don't think that this book would be too much of a slog for the intelligent humanities-based reader. The book's subtitle is The Evidence for Evolution, and the case he makes is cogent and convincing (although he's definitely preaching to the choir with this reader.)"

He realized that the earlier book angered even some of his supporters and hardened hearts against him more than it helped to bridge the gap between the religious and adherents to science.This book comes from his passion for evolution and his determination to answer those with questions about the ""theory"" of Evolution, and more particularly the fake theory of Intelligent Design. The failure of Intelligent Design is a matter of proven fact. Decided in a Dover Delaware case, before a conservative judge who saw, first hand how creationist texts were re written by cut and paste to be born again as the theory of Intelligent Design. Sic Transit Intelligent Design.It is unlikely that the true believers will read this book. At that level it is a failure in concept for Dawkins. For those who do read it, it is a valuable resource against those who think they have the facts to defeat evolution. The facts as Dawkins consistently documents, support the fact of evolution.To be technically correct; there is The Fact of Evolution and the Theory of Evolution.The fact of evolution can be established following the simple logic of Darwin's original arguments:1. All life forms reproduce at a rate greater than needed to duplicate the parent/s (cell division as well as sexual reproduction).2. Absent some limits on the number of off spring who survive, that life form will exceed the space and resources on the planet.3. Competition for limited resources means that those individuals who are less able to compete will die either without offspring or with relatively few.4 Those individuals who survive will have or have more offspring and therefore their individual qualities will be more likely to carry forward into future generations.As we extend this logic sequence forward, we can expect to see variations in any given life form and that life forms will over time vary from the original. All of this takes huge amounts of time.At this level Evolution has been tested more than any known theory and passes these tests. Evolution is predictive and in fact all of us have come into contact with it in any of several forms. Example animal breeds, the need for this year's flu vaccine to fight this year's flue and DNA evidence.Change in life forms over time is a fact. That the Earth has been around for millions of years is a separately established fact and is not herein discussed any further.Some of the more negative reviews of this book have been based on specific questions in the Theory of Evolution. That is what exactly are the mechanics of, the speed of and the sizes of changes allowed given the amount of information we know about topics like genetics. This debate is not possible unless you accept that life forms change over time.By analogy there is the Fact of gravity and the theory of gravity. There is the fact of light and the theory of light. Across the world of physics there are major disagreements over what is a wave and what is a particle?We all demand that our cars and aircraft be build to the highest standards of science. Airplanes fly because of the facts of physics, not the debates within the field of physics.Enough about evolution. What about the book?In 12 chapters Dawkins lays out virtually every question and argument that is supposed to disprove the fact of evolution. In clear, lucid and frequently passionate prose he lays out concrete examples and the attendant logic to support the case for the fact of evolution.This is not a book seeking to balance arguments. Dawkins holds to his evidence and gives no standing to those who fail to understand.Dawkins is clearly passionate about the beauty of a science driven world. His wonderment at the eloquence of creation is forefront. That the world should have laws and that these laws are decipherable is motivational to Dawkins. He wants you to see that science does not reduce the wonder of existence; it proves the wonder of existence.For myself I suggest the following.The word/concept/definition/ of God is a matter of belief. Belief is what you have that that requires no proof.Whatever our role as humans may be, we are confronted by challenges and questions.Our efforts in the form of work, learning and thinking, can bring us to whatever limits there may be on human ability to answer all these challenges/questions. Whatever we cannot know, and by this I mean beyond human abilities now and in the future is the boundary between human existence and Devine existence. Failure to strive towards that boundary is a failure to meet divinely proposed challenges.There is no reason to assume that science is a refutation of religion. Science is a human tool for understanding life in this world and to answer the challenges of living in it.I would like to think that everyone who would question the fact of evolution will read this book. Likely most will not. It is therefore an easy to read enlightening casebook resource for those who are either unsure or who need facts to face down those who would limit human achievement"

The benefit of reading it is that Richard Dawkins covers all of the major areas, and so can fill in a few of the blanks that all of us have to one extent or the other. It covers the fossil record in depth, showing the relationships between living things past and present, and has a good discussion on “missing links.” He makes the point that the only reason we can divide the fossil record into different species is because of the gaps in that record. The slow changes over evolutionary time would have been imperceptible to anyone seeing the plants or animals while they were alive, and at no point could an observer have looked at something and said that it was a different species than its parents. In fact, the normal variation within the species would have been greater than any individual incremental evolutionary change. Only because of the breaks in the fossil record can we recognize the slow changes over time.Carbon-14, is the standard dating technique for plants and animals having lived within the past 50,000 years, but I did not know where it came from, and found Dawkins’ explanation quite interesting.Carbon-14 is special because it is continually being made by cosmic rays bombarding nitrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere. Nitrogen is the commonest gas in the atmosphere and its mass number is 14, the same as carbon-14’s. The difference is that carbon-14 has 6 protons and 8 neutrons, while nitrogen-14 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons…. Cosmic ray particles are capable of hitting a proton in a nitrogen nucleus and converting it to a neutron. When this happens, the atom becomes carbon-14, carbon being one lower than nitrogen in the periodic table.Although we normally think of evolutionary time as taking place over millennia, Dawkins describes several experiments that showed major changes can happen very quickly. There was a fascinating experiment that tracked the changes in bacteria over many generation as they differentiated from their parent stock. There was also an experiment on zebra fish which showed that, in the absence of predators, the males evolved bright colors to attract females, but with predators present they quickly evolved duller spotted patterns to mimic the color of the stream bottom.He also makes a good point about sexual reproduction, in that when a living creature is conceived, it is only a “blending” of mother and father when looked at from a high level. At the DNA level, however, what gets passed are genes, which are either/or: any particular gene either comes from one parent or it comes from the other. They are never a blend of the two, although sometimes, for several reasons, they can pick up a mutation. There is an old Creationist argument that natural selection could not work because any new beneficial traits would be swamped as they blended into the existing traits of the general population, but if genes pass down intact, the helpful ones could spread.In his discussion of how modern molecular genetics has helped understand evolution, Dawkins makes an interesting point when explaining how scientists determine how closely related two species are:The human/dog cell should theoretically have an identical resemblance score to the chimpanzee/dog cell because humans and chimpanzees have exactly the same degree of relation to dogs. It should be identical, too, to the monkey/dog cell and the lemur/dog cell. This is because humans, chimpanzees, monkeys and lemurs are all connected to the dog via their common ancestor, an early primate (which probably looked a bit like a lemur). One of evolution’s most powerful arguments is that life evolved only once. This is a well known statement, but Dawkins makes it after he has brought to bear a great deal of evidence from many different fields of study, and when he finally presents it the reader gets a sense of its majesty. We are all truly connected, from the simplest bacteria to the most complicated creatures.Of course, it wouldn’t be a Richard Dawkins book if he didn’t take some well deserved swipes at Creationists. Were it not for their baleful influence on science and education, there would be something pathetically funny about them: they believe because they believe because they believe, and no amount of evidence or logic will change their minds. It reminded me of the saying that faith is not an argument, but the absence of arguments.I enjoyed this book. Because I already had a layman’s understanding of evolution, I wasn’t sure how much I would learn from it, but it was definitely worth the time. It filled in a number of gaps in my understanding, and expanded on the areas I was familiar with. It makes a strong case for evolution being, as the title says, the greatest show on earth."
40,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42172950-ashok-krishna,3,"Richard Dawkins is one of my favorite authors, in the same league as Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and Neil deGrasse Tyson. What stands out in the works of these people is their unwavering loyalty to Truth and Reason. They are not the sort of persons that can take an affront to Knowledge lying down. All of them are outright atheists that don’t mince words when it comes to attacking the superstitious and stupid religious beliefs. This is the third work of Dawkins that I am reading, after having gone through ‘The God Delusion’ and ‘The Magic of Reality’. Dawkins continues in the same vein as in those two books, but this book is turning the heat up for the ‘Creationists’ – those that believe that a god created this universe, our planet and all the life forms that populate it, within the last 10000 years or so. Dawkins builds a citadel from which the Evolutionists – those of us that believe that the planet Earth is about 4.6 billion years and all the life forms that we see in front of our eyes today evolved through natural genetic modification – can fight the ignorance of the ‘Creationists’. And, what a citadel has he built! I don’t think that a staunch believer of the religious version of ‘Creation’ will be moved by this book well enough to reverse his/her views, but this book will nevertheless end up causing a dent in his/her belief. Be it plants, animals or the multitude of bacterial and vermin life forms, Dawkins pulls them all up to stand as witness to the survival of their ancestors in the long gone past and their evolution by ‘natural selection’. Dawkins also arms all the ‘Evolutionists’ and ‘Darwinists’ with enough arsenal to fight back the stupid questions raised by the ‘Creationists’. ‘If men evolved from monkeys why are there monkeys still around?’, for example.But one thing that I couldn’t stomach in this book is that, while trying to build a citadel of facts and arguments strong enough to be unassailable by the ‘Creationists’, Dawkins seems to have become too obsessed with the details to the extent of ignoring the normal, laymen like me that couldn’t grasp science beyond a certain level, at least for now. You need to have a fair knowledge of genes to understand the book. In the previous two books, I found the words of Dawkins having a smooth flow. The same is lacking here. His random jumping between the topics and cross-referencing details in other chapters and even in his other books doesn’t make matters easy either. A good book to read, if you prefer reading books that are slow and heavy. Though this lacks the usual flow and wit of Richard Dawkins, it is a worthy shot in the arm if you are someone that ends up arguing with the ‘Believers’ every now and then."
41,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Subtitle: ""The Greatest Show On Earth: The Evidence for Evolution""I like most, but not all, of Richard Dawkins' books, especially ones such as ""The Selfish Gene"" where he is adding real new insights into how evolution works (and doesn't work). I gave his book-before-last, ""The God Delusion"", a pass, because it appeared to have all the charm and insight of a typical Internet rant. Dawkins is at his best when he talks about the topics he loves (biology), and at his worst when he talks about the topics he hates (religion).Fortunately, in ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", he mostly sticks to what he loves. He describes this book as a sort of, ""oh, I should have said"", in which he goes back to describe the basic facts about evolution. In ""The Selfish Gene"", ""The Blind Watchmaker"", ""Climbing Mount Improbable"", and his other evolution-related books, he was taking it as given and discussing the more subtle aspects which are not covered in basic discussions. For this reason, I was not certain if I wanted to read this books, since, you know, I already took high school biology.The reality is, though, that Dawkins knows (or has at his disposal) an astonishing and delightful range of biological facts and short stories, from primates (current and extinct), dinosaurs, worms, a Monty Python parody of ""All Things Bright and Beautiful"" (ok that one's not exactly biology), crab bodies imagined as rubber-sheet transformations of one another, and on and on.In particular I can commend Dawkins for his use of graphics. The technology used for making books in the 19th and 20th century led to an entirely regrettable reliance on exclusively print texts, which computer-controlled printing is only slowly undoing. In addition to the wonderful color insets, Dawkins has graphs, line drawings, and other imagery sprinkled liberally through the book. The greatest part of the history of books included pictures with the words; let's hope Dawkins becomes less of an exception in the 21st century.In addition, let's hope he sticks to topics he loves in future books. He's much more fun to read that way."
42,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2277727-emily,0,"Richard Dawkins has set out to challenge Creationists with his new book ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution."" As someone who was taught evolution by one of the most hardcore nuns in my Catholic school, I've always found Creationism somewhat baffling. Isn't ""faith"" believing in spite of evidence? Not pretending the evidence doesn't exist? In my personal canon, I rather like the idea that the ""clay"" God made Adam out of in the Bible is actually RNA. All live evolved from this, not just human life. I suppose this is neither here nor there. But it doesn't seem hard to reoncile evolution with God to me. If you created a universe, wouldn't you come up with some process by which the world could govern itself instead of having to deal with every little problem? I think you would. Anyway, Dawkins says this book is intended to convince Creationists that they are wrong. I don't think it will do that. They will just ignore this book as they ignore the rest of his work. I'm not sure there is any book that can be written that would convince people who are already certain, but it's not this one. (Perhaps if someone who was on the fence wrote a memoir about examining the evidence?) Dawkins's tone is a bit too superior. I listened to this on CD and I rather thought he was silently adding ""those idiots"" whenever he said ""history deniers"" (the phrase he uses for Creationists). Those who disagree are more like to shut the book before reading a whole chapter. So I think the main audience for this book will be people who already believe in Evolution who want to start fights with Creationists on the Internet. "
43,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658672-scott,3,"This book does a decent job of explaning evolution, though I have two criticisms: First, the format suffers organizationally. The book is written as a rebuttal to creationist arguments, but Dawkins addresses those arguments by interspersing them, in no coherent order, within affirmative evidence for evolution. A bettter way to format the book would have been to model it after a good legal brief. Present the affirmative case for evolution first, then address creationist counterarguments second. Second, Dawkin exhibits unnecesary hostility toward those who believe in creationism. There is no good reason to be so disrespectful of their beliefs. To him, it's as if teaching children creationism is one of the world's greatest evils. At worst, however, teaching children creationism is only teaching them a false belief. Moreover, while many Americans (and others) believe in creationism, most (even by his own account) do not. The trend, if anything, is toward believing in evolution, so there's no reason to get so worked up about it. Dawkin's defensiveness and hostility actually render his book less persuasive, because he comes across as a radical, or extremist. For example, Dawkins repeats the phrase ""evolution is a fact"" perhaps several dozen times, as if saying it will necessarily make it so. If evolution if a fact, say it once and move on. In sum, a more level-headed approach would not only have made the book more persausive, but also a more enjoyable read. "
44,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,3,"44% of Americans believe that humans were created by god about ten thousand years ago. I admire that Richard Dawkins' stamina in fighting the good fight but he's not going about it very effectively. He sounds pretentious. He uses technical terms quite frequently, to the point that I can barely keep up (and I have reasonable background in the area already). He repeatedly insults and mocks people who do not accept what he sees to be completely self-evident. The argument is not strung together too neatly and his time/resource allocation is also slightly questionable. You can feel his pain and sympathize, but if he wanted to be more effective he would have to surrender some of his ego first, which I don't think he can do very well.I personally read this book because I was curious to see what evidence from the animal kingdom Dawkins would select as his best ammunition and how he would structure the argument. I emerged slightly disappointed: by the tone, the flow, the structure, and the selection. If there is someone out there who would like to learn more about evolution I would instead recommend looking at some very well-produced videos on YouTube."
45,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4745220-alicja,5,"rating: 5/5It was sometimes a tough read but it presents the evidence for evolution in a clear and concise manner that is accessible to non-biologists. Although, I did have to google search some concepts because I didn't remember enough biology 101 foundations from undergrad (the embryology chapter killed me! but thankfully I've revived since). So, if you are evolution theory ignorant (because what I remember from high school and basic bio in college has pretty much left my brain by now), this is a great read to pick up and brush up those corners of your brain. And Dawkins tends to stick more to the biology is this one, rather than condescending (as much) to the religious which is generally my criticism for any atheist works of his, so yup... read it. "
46,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35090771-guat-n,5,"As the title suggests, this book is about evolution, but the author goes through a little geology, embryology, anatomy, paleontology, computer simulations, real-life experiments, amino acids and radioactive decay to support his arguments, which is a bonus.Otro punto a favor es que mientras leía este libro, me acordaba constantemente de este video y se me alegraba el día."
47,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,4,"Very thorough and compelling evidence for the case of evolution, but I feel that Mr. Dawkins would have gotten his point across in a much more convincing fashion if he had left out the constant jabs at religion. I agree with him that it's pretty disheartening that so many people just out right reject evolution, without observing ANY evidence, but you also can't tell unbelievers that they are basically stupid because of their religion and expect people to care to listen to your argument.

53,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31260727-josiah,4,"As a creationist, I disagree with a lot of the ways that Dawkins interprets scientific studies and don't agree with most of his conclusions, but I have to give credit where credit is due: this is, by and large, a good argument for macro-evolution. He lays out complex scientific topics in easy-enough ways for a layperson to understand, explains things in entertaining ways at times, and uses a variety of studies and arguments to make his case. I think his scientific arguments are flawed (see this book), but he also makes some good points at times and I can appreciate certain arguments while disagreeing with them.That being said, while I could respect Dawkins when he was talking about science, his arguments were laughably bad when it came to philosophy. Dawkins tries to seriously argue that the presence of pain in gazelles disproves a creator, the fact that trees try to ""compete"" with each other for who can be the tallest disproves a creator, and the fact that predators don't prey ""optimally"" disproves a creator, among other things. His lack of understanding for what the intelligent design movement argues and his college-freshman-level understanding of philosophy hurt his credibility in my book. For someone who makes a big deal about non-scientists misinterpreting science, he really should be more careful before delving into philosophy as a non-philosopher.Overall, I appreciated reading this book to better understand scientific arguments against the creationist/intelligent design positions. Didn't persuade me, but it was well-argued (sans the philosophy bits).Rating: 3.5-4 Stars (Good)."

55,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,2,"Back in the 60‘s, the Modern Library edition of the Origin of Species and Descent of Man was probably the single greatest inspiration for me to study biology and eventually get a degree in that major. I was not an atheist back in those days. I’m not sure I am totally one today? I have many, many problems with organized religion. I cannot nor will I ever believe that I could be a member of such a community. However, I have not given up on the idea that there might not be some intelligent design to things. It’s just not the intelligence of Richard Dawkins.Think about it, Richard. I’ll bet that you believe their is a high probability that there is life and possibly even intelligence somewhere else in the universe. Would it be intelligence as we know it do you suppose?Publishers Weekly commented, ""If Charles Darwin walked into a 21st-century bookstore and wanted to know how his theory had fared, this is the book [GSoE] he should pick up.” The review then goes on to say that “Dawkins remains a superb translator of complex scientific concepts....he has a way of making the drollest details feel like a revelation."" I support the first part of that review but not the second. I think that Charles Darwin was that person who could so superbly articulate and make clear complex, scientific concepts. Richard Dawkins has a problem.The author of The Greatest Show on Earth, Richard Dawkins, is a self-described militant atheist. For me, therein lies the “greatest” problem with this book and others he has written. I have no problem with Dawkins’ atheism. I understand his militancy. But all of that, particularly rapped up in vehement emotion seems incongruent with a book on science. Unless perhaps in the study of behaviorism, science loses its authenticity in the presence of emotion. It ceases to be legitimate science and begins to sound more like the “circus” he is trying to debunk. In most of his books, Dawkins makes a passionate argument against the influence of religion around the teaching of evolution. Or maybe one should say the influence of religion on Not teaching evolution. I understand that and I completely support his thesis. However, for the same reason, I just do not believe that his anti-religious rants belong in a book that purports to teach science any more than speculation on creationism belongs in the classroom. Both seem to cheapen the discipline of science itself. As hard as Dawkins tries to separate Church, State and secular education, it is in this trying that his books lose their scientific punch. There was a lot to like about GSoE. Reading about evolution again, I relived with much of the same excitement I had had back in those days when, as that teenager, I was introduced to evolution. But all of Dawkins’ bashing and defensiveness diminishes the sheer enjoyment of reading and reveling in the beauty that is Charles Darwin all by himself. What Dawkins has to say about separating Church and State and education needs desperately to be said and needs to be listened to. A book all about that and without all the biology would be fine. It would make more sense and probably be more widely read. One book, Richard, maybe one book of the ilk of GSoE would make sense, but an entire library devoted to this? Come on..... Sounds almost like a crusade that you would argue against so ardently. Discover magazine called Richard Dawkins ""Darwin's Rottweiler"" for his “fierce and effective defense of evolution.” I believe that speaks a disservice to the genus canids. In today’s world, anyone with half a brain knows that evolution requires no more of defense than that of the heliocentric solar system. But yes, our schools and curricula do need defense from religious zealots. Let’s just keep the fact of evolution separate from the theory that it’s not. The socio-political and religious arguments for teaching creationism to the exclusion or at least the demeaning of evolution are strong, large and looming enough targets to go after on their own. The breath and depth of science in this book only muddys up that water. Do I care that a recent Gallup poll concluded that 44 percent of Americans believed a god created humans in their present form within the last 10,000 years and that beliefs in Europe are not much different? You bet I care. I just do not think folks like Dawkins are going to change that thinking with books like this. You want to know about evolution? Read Charles Darwin first. Go to the master himself. He is totally approachable and his science reads like beautiful prose. You want religious influences out of public schools, join the PTA or vote for the right candidate. In its totality, I subscribe to all that Dawkins posits. It's only the messenger that I'd like to kill."
56,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"Although Dawkins doesn't seem to realize that you can't reason someone away from a position they don't hold by reason, so trying to arm people to counter the arguments of evolution 'skeptics' is a futile endeavor; however, getting a lot of the gaps filled in about evolution is a fascinating subject for us dilettantes who accept that science isn't intentionally lying to us and are interested in how the accepted science came to be accepted.Yes, those are ironic quotes around the word skeptics, because metaphorically waving ones hands and repeating nuh-uh isn't really skepticism, it's willful ignorance.So, sure, one may hear from science deniers that evolution isn't science because you can't test it in a lab. People that claim that are both wrong about the necessity of a lab to test a hypothesis, and the claim that evolution hasn't been tested in a lab. There are experiments where evolution has been demonstrated in a lab - bacteria that have multiple generations in a day, so that evolutionary timelines are years instead of millennia. And the bacteria adapt. Is this good to read about because it will help you convince somebody who's invested in not believing evolution? Of course not. You can't change anybody's mind. Only they can, and if they've predetermined they won't change their mind you're wasting your time. But it's cool as heck. The experiment, that is. And Dawkins explains it, perfectly striking the balance between making it accessible to the layperson, without leaving out substance.Is the anecdote wherein a denier, who couldn't accept that random mutations could advance from a single cell to a complete human, with a nervous system, miles of blood vessels, sight, hearing, etc., might arise in billions of years, was confronted with the observation that she accomplished it herself in nine months, going to even begin to sway someone who's dug in their heels? Duh no. But the chapter about how we're metaphorical origami rather than constructions from blueprints elucidates so much, and makes the observations that humans have gills early in embryonic development, as birds have teeth and bony tails, make sense. These aren't flukes, they're expected observations of undesigned results of millions of random prototypes.So, please don't tell Dawkins I said this, because I hate to crush a dream, but the book works for unintended reasons. It's a great survey course in evolution. It cannot work to sway your extended family at Thanksgiving because they aren't genuinely interested in allowing their minds to be changed. And one thing dumb ol' evolution hasn't accomplished yet is allowing objective evidence to force someone to change their minds. Apparently there's no competitive advantage in it."

Mathematicians can prove things – according to one strict view, they are the only people who can – but the best that scientists can do is fail to disprove things while pointing to how hard they tried. Even the undisputed theory that the moon is smaller than the sun cannot, to the satisfaction of a certain kind of philosopher, be proved in the way that, for example, the Pythagorean Theorem can be proved. But massive accretions of evidence support it so strongly that to deny it the status of ‘fact’ seems ridiculous to all but pedants. The same is true of evolution. Evolution is a fact in the same sense as it is a fact that Paris is in the Northern Hemisphere. Though logic-choppers rule the town,* some theories are beyond sensible doubt, and we call them facts. The more energetically and thoroughly you try to disprove a theory, if it survives the assault, the more closely it approaches what common sense happily calls a fact.”Dawkins is persistent and rightly so. Why would you disprove something that is true? If you are a creationist, do give Dawkins a chance. You might rethink your views. Enough of all this.The book begins with ‘theory’. What we do mean when use this word in a sentence? What do creationists mean when they use this word? The difference is major and explained wonderfully with the true meaning. Dawkins goes on to follow evolution from earlier times, depending on the species. Why are there so many different breeds of dogs suddenly when there were only a few back in the 18-19th centuries? Questions like this and many more are answered. We have come a long way from Darwin’s Origin of Species. More things are known today than Darwin knew back then when he was writing his masterpiece. ”Evolution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt, beyond doubt evolution is a fact. The evidence for evolution is at least as strong as the evidence for the Holocaust, even allowing for eye witnesses to the Holocaust. It is the plain truth that we are cousins of chimpanzees, somewhat more distant cousins of monkeys, more distant cousins still of aardvarks and manatees, yet more distant cousins of bananas and turnips . . . continue the list as long as desired. That didn’t have to be true. It is not self-evidently, tautologically, obviously true, and there was a time when most people, even educated people, thought it wasn’t. It didn’t have to be true, but it is. We know this because a rising flood of evidence supports it. Evolution is a fact, and this book will demonstrate it. No reputable scientist disputes it, and no unbiased reader will close the book doubting it”Highly recommended."
58,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1340159-amanda,4,"Approaching this with an education (albeit only just over half an undergrad degree for now) in evolutionary biology was a rather different experience, I would imagine, than approaching it with minimal knowledge of the subject matter. As it stands, I liked the book; I thought it was well put together and used some really classic as well as some really new and exciting examples of experiments that have been done and discoveries that have shaped our current understanding of evolution. But I also have some complaints and differences of opinion with it. The book seems to be a bit bipolar in terms of its intended audience. Obviously Dawkins wants to write for his usual fan base/ the generally curious and somewhat scientifically literate public. But another major aim of the book is to try and educate creationists. So it ends up switching back and forth between explaining the simplest of things (common sense stuff for anyone who's ever taken grade 9 or 10 science) and assuming you know them already. The end result is that the text patronizes even the layman reader while alienating the scientifically illiterate creationist who will not be able to grasp the concepts completely.Now, there are a few things I take issue with in terms of how he explains certain evolutionary concepts, but these are mostly nitty gritty details that I think could be worded to better convey the information without creating common misconceptions and thus aren't really worth focusing on too much. He doesn't really do evolutionary forces other than natural selection much justice (specifically random genetic drift), but as a friend of mine said: ""Just getting the idea of natural selection across to creationists is a challenge; bring out genetic drift and the shit will start to fly. One step at a time, here!""I think my major issue with the book pops up in the introduction. After explaining the scientific use of the word ""theory"" and contrasting it with the colloquial use, Dawkins decides that in order to avoid misconceptions, it would be best to use a different term. So he decides to make up a word. He borrows the mathematical term ""theorem"" and purposes misspells it ""theorum"". The ""theorum"" of evolution. He could just have easily referred to it as the fact of evolution, which is what he actually does for the rest of the book, only mentioning ""theorum"" once or twice more near the end. The whole thing is an exercise in futility and doesn't really do anything towards his goal of promoting scientific literacy. It just makes him sound silly. Although I suppose that ""theorum"" does sound better than if he were to purposely misspell ""law"" as ""luw"" of evolution.In spite of all the criticisms I've put forward, it actually is a good summary of evolutionary theory and deserves to be widely read. If we could make textbooks as engaging as this, I suspect that many more people would understand evolution and be less susceptible to creationist misinformation."
59,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11030012-jade,4,"The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is most certainly one of the best, most entertaining, and most interesting non-fiction books I’ve ever read. There is of course no doubt in this world anymore about Richard Dawkins’ amazing capabilities to put together a comprehensive, concise, yet thorough text on evolution that makes one want to keep reading, in search of even more interesting facts than the last few he’s brought forth.Dawkins describes this book as the ‘missing link’ in the impressive chain of books he’s written up until now: The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution is meant as a book on the evidence for evolution, instead of being very much about the theory itself. And of course, as a highly intelligent evolutionary biologist, Dawkins more than succeeds in presenting evidence for evolution, using photos on coloured pages, diagrams, illustrations, and many other visual aids next to his own written word.He writes with humour and wit about all the amazingly interesting examples of evolution he puts forth, many of which were yet unknown to me, and shows how much passion and enthusiasm he has for this field. Reading this book made me almost feel giddy at times, and definitely brought me joy. Dawkins gives the reader a lot in this book: he doesn’t only provide evidence on evolution, but he also tackles a few arguments of creationists on evolution (the point where he stresses that the fossil record actually isn’t even needed as evidence for evolution is particularly strong, especially because it seems so overlooked). Critique on Dawkins and his work has sometimes been about his aggressive tone or his tendency to continue beating down creationists; I didn’t consider this to be a problem in The Greatest Show on Earth, nor did I think Dawkins was aggressive in any way. The creationists’ views are valid and contemporary in the discussion on the evidence of evolution, and I didn’t feel as if he was purposefully dragging them into this book.I would most certainly highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone, with no exceptions. It’s a lovely, engaging, and interesting book that’s most definitely well-worth a read."
60,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1219617-erik,5,"""Evolution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond serious doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt, beyond doubt evolution is a fact.""So Dawkins ardently asserts by page seven of his latest coup de grace of scientific reasoning and logical deduction which is easily digestible by laypeople such as myself.Dawkins also warns us readers several times of the ignorance that pervades our world, even in this new century.""…some 40 million per cent of the American population, and a somewhat smaller percentage of the British population, claim to believe that the age of the Earth, far from being measured in billions of years, is less than 10,000 years. Lamentably, especially in America and over much of the Islamic world, some of these history-deniers wield power over schools and their syllabuses.""Although this hasn’t been the norm for public schools here in Western Washington, despite being the home of the Discovery Institute, the supporters of intelligent design have attempted numerous times in recent decades to remake creationism in their challenge against the teaching of evolution. (One can only ponder the next moniker for creationism. Perhaps it could be called “scientifically intelligent design” in order to dupe those who won’t bother to think things through for themselves first? Oh, but that’s probably giving those folks a leg up on this ridiculous fight against true scientific evidence, inference, and reasoning.)Religion, unlike science, has a hard time changing its mind no matter how incontrovertible the evidence against a mistaken belief. ""One of the nice things about science is that it is a public activity. Scientists publish their methods as well as their conclusions, which means that anybody else, anywhere in the world, can repeat their work. If they don’t get the same results, we want to know the reason why.""Ask any established church that follows biblical literalism to open itself to public scrutiny and reasoned argument based upon data and empirical evidence, and you’ll see a quick collapse of many, if not most, fundamentalist beliefs. (Dawkins skewers religion and its fallacies to much greater effect in his last book, The God Delusion.) For the conservative-minded religious folk, Dawkins is obvious enemy number one in his relentless, yet reasoning, assault on their unquestioned beliefs. But for the secular-minded, his breadth of understanding of the nuances of evolution and its mechanisms is unparalleled. Consider reading The Greatest Show on Earth as time well spent."
61,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12945730-jack-ferreira,4," As usual Richard Dawkins managed to put toguether yet another irrefutable and amazingly well writen book. You really don't need to have any cientific background whatsoever to enjoy his work, and it reads as rivetingly as any good fiction can. His explanatory skills are superb and so, so easy to follow.  The objective of this book is to prove why evolution is true, and it absolutely does. It really puts into perspective the grand scope of evidence that exists in favour of it. And I thought I knew quite a bit about evolution (well, more than an average person would) but this book STILL comes as a flood of new information to my brain. I still learned so many new things and the things you learn are mind-blowingly beautiful.  He brings up some really fascinating experiments some notable scientists have had the privelige to conduct and my jaw really did drop a couple of times. The fact that it's very interesting combined with Dawkins' enthusiasm about the subject really get's you envolved and makes you want to know more. It answered some of my questions I had when I was in school and never really considered following up on. Like you are taught that ""X"" happens and how it happens, but sometimes you ask yourself 'but WHY exactly does it happen?' or 'what makes it happen like that, specificaly?'. Dawkins explains it all in a simple and deeply engaging manner. The only thing that might put you off is the constant digressions. Most of the time I didn't mind them and was actualy glad he talked about some cool extra stuff, but there were a couple of times where it did come of as a little redundant, especialy nearing the end it kind of seems like he was repeating some points he had already adressed (and adressed at lengh). Maybe he did it on purpose to really hammer in the information to a certain stuborn demographic. The thing that suprises me is the size of that demographic. I am now speaking of, as Dawkins refers to them, the history deniers. History deniers are the people who absolutely do not believe in evolution. Don't get me started on them (because it get's me so worked up) but it's kind of saddening to think about. This book is mainly for two types of people. The people who are on the fence, or haven't really took the time to think about it properly, and the people who already accept it as true and wouldn't mind having some extra ammunition (wich is both useful and fun to have). You can't go wrong with Dawkins, this is another solid book. And I thank Richard for never failing to remind me how beautiful life is."
62,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14993998-marco-maia-carneiro,5,"Different from The God Delusion, here Dawkins is at his own field. The amount of information contained in this book is staggering, and I got exactly what I was looking for: a big compendium of proof for evolution, and how did we get to them.One thing I always try to acquire is the information that was used to support a claim, and when a book provides this on the top of the claim, all the better. In ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", Dawkins discusses in depth every step of several different ideas that support evolution, in a way that is not overwhelming or tiring (even though sometimes a little long).This is my favorite book from Dawkins and my favorite book of 2018 so far. An arrow through any creationism argument.  Thinking about the last sentence, it's not really true. This in no way feels like Dawkins on The God Delusion, where he attacks theists and theism every other page. Here Dawkins shows you why evolution makes more sense than creationism. He spends 80% or so of the book towards reasoning for evolution, and perhaps 20% - if that much - attacking creationists or discussing creationism. It's a joyful reading that will show you why and how evolution works, and teach you a lot of biology during the journey."
63,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8873486-moataz,5,"Wonderful! No matter what I write, it's nothing compared to the effort was carried out in the book. Dr. Dawkins waves hundreds of evidence about how species were varied and evolved from same ancestors. I see no point of discussing creation. Honestly, I don't understand how someone believes that the human races come from two individuals, finds difficulty in believing that the life on earth evolved from a single-celled organisms. However, for religion, if you don't buy the story of Adam and Eve, you're infidel; for Dr. Dawkins, also, if you don't buy Evolution, you're creationist, stupid, and ignorant! I didn't like that, reading the book, I found myself under the pressure that if I didn't understand something, I would be stupid and delusioned. Anyway, let's speak evolution. Evolution is the only scientific explanation for how life evolved on earth. That's a fact. Fossils are facts, molecular sequencing results are fact. The connections between species and their 'ancestors' is NOT a fact, it's a conclusion drawn from what we have and what we know. Science isn't a reigion, you can always learn and study, and if you don't like the conclusion of evolution, you're more than welcome to study Animal Sciences and suggest to the world new theories that might explain these fossils. How Darwin reached to his conclusions without all that we now knew from fossils and DNA is magnificent, which makes him a genius. Evolution is difficult, that's a fact. The Evolutionary scales is the most difficult, since the average lifespan for humans are short, tiny compared to the scale of earth. Yet, what is the first homo sapien? Who were his parents? (I realize he answered this in the book, but it was a physiological answer rather than scientific.) How do life originated? In other words, how conscious progressed? Humans have thoughts, animals and bacteria don't! What is the spark that made life of things? I mean, what made a single celled organism moves forwards? To accumulate and become at least multi-cellular organism? Is is the same reason why an animal moves from species to another? Is evolution still on going?"
64,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/958510-michael,5,"Richard Dawkins presents an excellent step-by-step case study for the theory of evolution, from the definition of the word 'theory' itself, right up to the most modern evidences found in the decoded genomes of animals and humans.It does sound at times like Dawkins' has an axe to grind with religious communities, specifically the Christian religion. Of course, Dawkins himself is a professed atheist. However, he grew up in a Christian home, but began asking questions about the belief in God in his teen years.It is hard to read this book as a believer in the Biblical account of creation and not come away with a sense at some point that you've been reading a fairy tale all your life. The evidences presented for the laymen to understand evolution are so many that it begs me to ask the question of why we haven't seen this material before, in high school biology classes. While some evolutionary theory was presented, the evidences (at least back when I went to school) were highly lacking in any textbook I read at the time.For atheists, this book will just confirm some of your basic beliefs about the origin of life and produce evidences that I'm quite sure not everyone in your community has heard of before. I would not be surprised to find that this book is sold in atheist circles as a 'textbook' guide to evolution and how to use it against creationists (especially the ones who believe the earth is relatively young, say, around 6,000 years old).The bottom line is that the book is well worth the price. Although I purchased the audio book (which means I missed out on the illustrations), I would highly recommend whatever version suits your lifestyle best. If you are a religious person seeking answers, information and truth; or if you are an atheist looking for evidences to back up your position(s), this book is an excellent resource. You won't be disappointed."
65,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4975531-ashley,4,"Scientists accept evolution because there is so much evidence for evolution and none found yet that refutes it. But what IS that evidence? I knew so little of that evidence before I read this book. This book was much needed because it thoroughly explains the evidence for evolution coming from a variety of scientific areas: zoology, geography, geology, genetics, natural history, etc. Further, it does so in a way that was easy for me to understand (for the most part...more on that a bit later). I enjoyed this book mainly because I learned a lot from it (for instance: how does carbon dating actually work, anyway? etc. etc.) Another thing I enjoy about Dawkins' work is how knowledgeable he is and how clearly excited he is about his subject matter. His enthusiasm comes through the pages. I remember when I was younger and I thought science was boring. If you think so, he might just change your mind. He's extremely knowledgeable about a variety of topics and is very able at showing how fascinating science can really be. There are even beautiful color photographs in the book.I would actually give this book a 4.5. My only problem with the book is that sometimes Dawkins would lose me. As I said above, most of it is easy to understand, but I had trouble following through his very technical, detailed descriptions about some things (e.g., some descriptions of skeletons, a few sections on genes).Finally: Dawkins doesn't discuss religion in this book (as he says in the intro, he's already done that in another book). So don't let his anti-religion reputation (as author of The God Delusion) deter you from checking out this book if you're at all interested in learning more about evolution."
66,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7855283-david,3,"This book whilst on one hand is interesting, falls into some of the same irritating traps of his other book 'The God Delusion'. Whilst as an Atheist I support the championship of Richard Dawkins, his way of writing doesn't necessarily do the cause any favours.This book is not an 'anti-religion' book for the most part, but is a book outlining the evidence and processes of evolution. Dawkins (I am sure with difficulty) restricts his anti religious ranting to the occasional criticism of creationists and a short appendix chapter where he outlines his concerns over the worrying level of dominance creationism and intelligent design has over the public.Where this book excelled I feel is through its picking apart of the process of evolution. As a social scientist and not a biologist, Dawkins successfully explains some of the more superficial elements of evolution in a way that I was able to understand.Now, for the criticism. Whilst Dawkins clearly tries to explain evolution to ordinary people, his decades in academia seem to have made him forget how difficult it is for people like me who are not biologists to be able to understand the mechanics of the likes of genetics. Some of the more complicated chapters were riddled with jargon and scientific names, making it quite frankly painful to read and almost impossibly in my case, to understand. It is hard sometimes to not read parts of this book and not feel like a complete idiot.This book has value to the reader but is maybe better suited to those with at least a basic knowledge of evolutionary biology, which many as a result mean that Dawkins is 'preaching to the converted' anyway.Prof Dawkins has an important message to tell, but he needs to do it in a way that everyone can understand."

His hatred of people with differing points of view than him (especially creationists) was not only distracting, but led him to apply the worst logic I've ever heard anyone try to apply in a serious way: ad hominem, straw man, anecdotal, masked man, circular reasoning, equivocation, and pretty much every other fallacy you can think of. The field of evolutionary biology is diverse and filled with a vast number of differing points of view and Dawkins presented the evidence as if there was a single theory of evolution: his. Everyone who disagrees is not only wrong and stupid, but demented and wicked to the core (he really says this--countless times). He did a disservice to the field and to the thousands of evolutionary biologists doing real work collecting and analyzing data, compiling research, testing new and old theories. As a curious and eager to learn listener, I was not just disappointed, but angered by such a poor showing of logic, lack of objective scientific presentation, and just generally narrow view of the field. I expected better of him since he's so well known as an intellectual, but I cannot take him seriously after this book. So much for the spirit of science...If you want an honest scientific presentation of contemporary evolutionary theories, this book is not for you.If you want to rage against creationists and pretend Dawkins has finally come up with the one and only true and indisputable theory of evolution, have fun..."

It left me immensely depressed because, of course, Dawkins is preaching to the choir here. Said purveyors of creationism and intelligent design will not read this book, nor will they let you try to explain it to them. According to Dawkins, 44% of Americans believe God created human beings pretty much in their present form sometime during the past 10,000 years, and fewer than 15% are willing to grant evolution without some kind of Divine intervention. It is dubious any of these people read books that exceed a sixth-grade reading comprehension level.As Dawkins himself points out (on p. 402):""Shooting the messenger is one of humanity's sillier foibles, and it underlies a good slice of the opposition to evolution. . . 'Teach children that they are animals, and they'll behave like animals.' Even if it were true that evolution, or the teaching of evolution, encouraged immorality, that would not imply that the theory of evolution was false. It is quite astonishing how many people cannot grasp this simple point of logic. The fallacy is so common it even has a name, the ""argumentum ad consequentiam""--X is true (or false) because of how much I like (or dislike) its consequences.""Sorry folks: it doesn't bode well for our future "

Although I am very interested in the subject of evolution and the public's perception of it, I found myself simply following the words with my eyes and not having a clue what I was reading. It is obviously very well researched and infused with fact after fact, and this I can respect immensely. However, I will not be rating it because, for one, I didn't finish the book and would never claim that I could pass judgment on its contents and, for another, I obviously don't have enough of a scientific background to even be able to pass judgment had I finished it. I did, however, peruse through and read some passages and every now and then would run across something that made me say, ""Hey, that's really cool!"" I also felt it was very helpful that the book has periodic illustration pages that allow the reader to get a visual image of the science in action. I have a lot of respect for Dawkins and have heard him speak numerous times and, I can say, he seems like one of the few rational people in our society, although he is villified by those who fear what he teaches. Perhaps one day I will try again to wrap my brain around this, but alas I will have to claim I am too stupid and too much a lover of fiction to be able to tackle this book. *sigh*"

I like how believers in anything choose wisely their battles and avoid using weak arguments when there are stronger ones to use.The book took me from the basic science I studied at school to higher levels to prove a point. I had a round in cosmology, chemistry, biology, geology, ... etc (many words ending wit -ology).It defends its model to the last proof and piece of info available. And I have to say, it is quite strong. Still having dents and weaknesses but still makes sense.Looking at it from a creationist's point of view who is seeking truth without hesitation, those who believe in God have been sitting back for a long while and only fighting science with fear. A few I met have really stood to defend their belief and work on understanding the holly books and polishing their model without entering wrong battles of using fake arguments (like the fake arguments mentioned in the book). That's why the comparisons between and old idea defending God and a new scientific model is like comparing between the quality of movies in the 70's and today's HD movies. If someone really believes in God, he should wake up and cope with the updates and new scientific parameters."
71,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/258010-chuck,5,"This is a splendid book, comprehensive, well written, and nicely illustrated. Dawkins makes the case for evolution, drawing from the fossil record, comparative anatomy, contemporary experiments, and molecular genetics. Any one of these evidential paths is plenty convincing, but their collective weight is overpowering. Dawkins occasionally snipes at creationists, although he is much more restrained here than he was in The God Delusion. Still, his impatience with creationistism seems quite justified in light of a poll that he cites showing that 42% of Americans believe that life on earth has always existed in its present form (the record isn't much better in Britain). It's not clear what constitutes the source of this abysmal ignorance, but it seems to run parallel to equally false notions about climate change and the economy. If such ideas seem relatively innocuous when considered as as private beliefs, we need to bear in mind that they also make their way into the political sphere; it appears entirely possible that the American electorate will choose a presidential candidate in 2012 who proudly rejects science in favor of faith. That's a recipe for restoring American global competitiveness, eh?"
72,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3398495-lynne-williamson,5,"Reading Dawkins' ""The Greatest Show on Earth,"" I developed a much greater understanding of how all living organisms are related as branches on the evolutionary ""tree."" The chapters on mammals and the emphasis on the bone structure that all mammals have - same number of bones in a similar alignment - with wonderful variations selected for environmental conditions - was awe inspiring. (And I use ""awe"" here in the sense of a rational human wanting to know more --- not in some sort of quasi-metaphysical ""spiritual"" sense). The picture of the bat in the book that showed how the fingers and arms developed into the wing structure, but show the same basic fingers and arms that human primates have was mesmerizing to me. And I was delighted to find that the hoof of a horse is equivalent to our primate middle finger naturally selected over time to support what a horse needs to do to survive.

Dawkins explains these probable events and processes better than anyone. Understanding the path that life had to take to bring us here makes me feel special. Usually, I don't like it when an author reads his own works but I like it when Dawkins does. I listen to all of Dawkins' books and he doesn't repeat his analogies in his explanations and manages to come up with new and better analogies and explanations.

I was tempted to return to page one the instant I finished. Dawkins has always had a knack for making the complexities of science accessible to liberal-arts types like myself without dumbing down the very concepts he seeks to explain, but he has outdone himself this time. From DNA to molecular clocks to plate tectonics to radioactive dating to embryonic development and beyond, Dawkins takes us on a breathtaking ride through the vast evidence for evolution, pausing here and there along the way to introduce us to some of its more unusual products. While he is vocal in his ire against the stubborn irrationality of young-earth creationism, he otherwise leaves the topic of religion well alone. This is a book about science and reason, and it is splendidly conceived."

He reminds us that the ""even without the fossil record there is no doubt as to the truth of evolution...""The book's chapters are a thorough overview of the pieces of evidence (including genetic, homological, archaeology among others). But, in his typical fashion, Dawkins gets side-tracked on details that probably could have been left out. That being said, he admits as much but points out that any 'detail', deemed important or not, is often pounced upon by ""history deniers"" (as he calls them).A few jabs at creationists and a sorrowful last chapter reminds us that books like this are unfortunately still needed.The book is not a difficult read, but Dawkins' writing style is sometimes a bit heavy."

I've always accepted evolution as a fact, but this book exposed mountains of evidence and information that I was never aware of. The facts are simply overwhelming, and this book does a great job of painting them into a beautiful picture of life's complexity. Wonderfully written and easy to understand, but still a bit snarky to recommend to a creationist who might be open to considering the evidence. Still, it should provide plenty of new evidence and countless interesting facts to anyone who isn't already a professional in the field of evolutionary biology.

90,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"How appropriate that in this bicentennial year of Darwin's birth, and the 150th anniversary of the original publication of Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"", Richard Dawkins's ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"" has been published throughout the Anglo - American world by his American-based publisher, the Free Press imprint of Simon and Schuster. Not only should this be mere cause for celebration since its initial publication date falls within the Darwin bicentennial year, but more importantly, Richard Dawkins has written the finest book in his legendary literary career, and the one which is, without question, the best, most extensive, argument for the scientific reality of biological evolution ever written for a public audience. Indeed this noteworthy book deserves immediate praise as both a popular scientific and literary classic, one that ought to be venerated as among the finest books Simon and Schuster has ever published, taking its rightful place alongside such great works as Ernest Hemingway's novels, David McCullough's biographies and histories and Frank McCourt's memoirs. Given its potential impact as the popular account on evolution most likely to garner a best-selling worldwide audience, I am convinced that this may be the most important book Simon and Schuster has published in nearly two decades. Concentrating solely on the immense wealth of biological data that confirms both the fact of evolution, and the substantial likelihood that natural selection is its primary mechanism, Dawkins throws down the gauntlet at Intelligent Design creationists and their fellow evolution denialists, whom he refers to repeatedly as ""history deniers"" (Though, I might add, that one ought to refer to them as ""mendacious intellectual pornographers"", as a more apt - if not necessarily succinct - description of them and their nefarious modus operandi.). At the very onset of the book, in the appropriately entitled chapter ""Only A Theory?"" (Chapter One), Dawkins argues persuasively that those who reject evolution in favor of Intelligent Design and other forms of creationism, are no better than Holocaust Deniers who refuse still, decades after that horrific episode of modern history, to accept as real, the Shoah, the Nazi Holocaust, despite the ample weight of eyewitness testimony and documents confirming it. A vast realm of biological data is cited in Dawkins's book, and he uses effectively, these very facts, coupled to compelling logic and splendid, quite lyrical, prose, to demonstrate again and again, why - to cite evolutionary geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky's astute observation - ""Nothing in Biology makes sense except in the light of Evolution"", or rather, to quote Dawkins at the very end of Chapter One, ""....demonstrate that evolution is an inescapable fact, and celebrate its astonishing power, simplicity and beauty."". He illustrates (Chapters Two and Three) how and why the dichotomy between artificial and natural selection is not quite as clear-cut, as history deniers might wish for us to believe, persuasively arguing why Darwin was right to use artificial selection of farm animals as a perfect metaphor to compare and to contrast with Natural Selection. He also introduces co-evolution (Chapter Two), by illustrating it in an especially lucid description as to how orchids spread their pollen via visiting pollinating insects. Next up is a long, but necessary, digression on radioactive dating (Chapter Four), merely to emphasize to readers why creationist claims for a ""Young Earth"" are hopelessly inane assertions in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary, demonstrating the great age (approximately 4.6 Billion Years) of our planet. Dawkins successfully conveys the wonder and excitement of great contemporary experiments that have demonstrated how Natural Selection acts on populations (Chapter Five), both in the field (John Endler's classic work on Trinidad guppies) and in the laboratory (Richard Lenski's decades-long ongoing experiment on the ""evolution"" of the bacterium found in the guts of humans, Escherichia coli.). Dawkins's riveting account of Lenski's experiment is by far the best I have encountered, easily eclipsing Carl Zimmer's memorable description in his recently published ""Microcosm"". Indeed, for both experiments, as well as for some other, field-collected, data, Dawkins clearly illustrates how Natural Selection can act with alacrity on any population in only a few generations, transforming dull gray guppies into those brightly colored for sexual courtship, within streams relatively free from predation. Dawkins does an admirable job explaining how and why ""Missing Link"" fossils are overrated (Chapter Six), by discussing the superb example of early tetrapod history, recounting how early tetrapods like Tiktaalik and Acanthostega conquered the land in the latest Devonian and early Carboniferous. But he doesn't stop there. He discusses the successful invasion of the seas by early cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) and sirenians (manatees and dugongs). He also demonstrates the complexity of turtle evolutionary history, by noting that many modern turtles probably evolved from ancestors who ""invaded"" the land, after adapting to life at sea. He closes his discussion of the fossil record with an especially riveting account on human evolution (Chapter Seven), noting the significant contributions made by African hominid paleontologists. Other well-conceived, well-written chapters are invaluable introductions to embryology and how it can be seen from the perspective of molecular biology (Chapter Eight), biogeography and paleobiogeography (Chapter Nine) with an elegant explanation of the geological theory known as Plate Tectonics and its evolutionary implications, and systematic biology (Chapter Ten) with a concise description of molecular biology's importance in determining degrees of relationship between different taxa. He devotes Chapter Eleven to an especially lucid overview on vestigial organs and other examples of ""evolutionary history"", which clearly contradict Intelligent Design creationist claims that one sees countless examples of perfect ""design"" within plants, animals and microbes. And he returns once more to co-evolution (Chapter Twelve), stressing the relevance of co-evolutionary arms races in driving Natural Selection within populations in the same ecosystems, of which the most relevant are the interactions between predators and their prey. In a most triumphant coda, Dawkins gives his interpretation of the closing paragraph of Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" (Chapter Thirteen), along with a strongly cautionary note on the intellectual damage done by ""history deniers"" within the Anglo-American world, and elsewhere, especially in Islamic countries, around the globe (Appendix). Is Dawkins's book the perfect introduction to popular audiences of the incontrovertible reality of evolution? It's almost, but not quite. I am especially surprised that Dawkins hasn't discussed at length, the relevant importance of extinction, especially mass extinctions, on the history of life on Planet Earth. As his eminent Stony Brook University colleague Douglas Futuyma has stated more than once, we really don't understand extinction well at all. And I remain perplexed with Dawkins's conflation of geological period with geological era, when, by definition, geological periods like the Cambrian and the Devonian are much shorter intervals of geologic time than substantial chunks like the Paleozoic, Mesozoic (""age of dinosaurs"") and Cenozoic (which includes the present) eras. But these are merely quite minor criticisms I have of Dawkins's remarkably well written, and surprisingly, concise, book. If one seeks a concise, exceptionally well-written, overview of modern evolutionary biology, then there's no better place to begin, but to turn to this outstanding book. It is truly, without a doubt, a literary classic of the very first rank, worthy of the many awards and honors that will be bestowed upon it.(Reposted from my 2009 Amazon review)"
91,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90153256-keziah-haley,5,"“Evolution” is a phrase tossed around by the general public often with strong emotional and social meaning, but also often lacking the scientific understanding of word or completely misunderstood altogether. While many critics like to complain that Dawkin’s work is too critical in tone and too watered down in subject, I completely disagree. The targeted audiences are usually scientifically illiterate and are unlikely to understand more academically written works. Plus, the typical zealous, obstinate Creationist is unlikely to be swayed due to a obsession with “faith”, or subjective confirmation bias, so a firm, unyielding tone may just be beneficial to plant a seed not so easily dismissed. The fact that a proven scientific theory is often rejected from education and political spheres simply because masses do not like it based on their personal preferences is absolutely absurd. Scientific theories should only be weakened by empirical evidence, not by whims or popular belief. I’m so very grateful books like this are written. I was raised in the backwards southern Bible Belt by extremely religious, young earth Creationists and was defiant towards “evil evolution” initially. The only reason I learned evolution (or scientific objectivity to begin with) was because I learned scientific evidence is more reliable than subjective beliefs. A respect and understanding for the objectivity of science smacked me in my smug face. It is this respect of the scientific method that is being disregarded when evolution is dismissed for faith, and considering the decline in education and scientific literacy in the US (and other countries) this should really warrant a very firm rebuttal, which Dawkins delivers in a lucid manner. If science is so easily tossed aside, society can only suffer as a result; I would hope that can easily be gleaned by observing the Dark Ages. "
92,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,4,"Richard Dawkins is obviously a rational, concerned, and passionate man. He sees the great diversity of life as The Greatest Show on Earth, and he is upset that so many people (about 40% in the U.S. and 20% in Britain) are willfully blind to the process that brought it about. I can understand his dismay. It's a bit like bringing some friends to the most wonderful movie you ever saw, and they close their eyes so they can't see it and plug their ears so they won't hear the score. You implore them to look, plead for them to listen, but they simply refuse. How frustrating that would be. Now imagine it's not a movie you want them to see, but something far more important, something real—a fact of life—THE fact of life.This book is Dawkins' attempt to explain the process of evolution by natural selection to those who apparently do not understand it, especially to those who willfully refuse to understand it. He provides examples, analogies, and summarizes the overwhelming amount of supporting evidence. There are even color pictures. He undoubtedly thinks this will help. He is a rational person, after all.The Greatest Show on Earth is an excellent summation of what we know about the evolution of life. If the book has a shortcoming, it's that it can't do what he wants it to do. I doubt logic and evidence are capable of swaying the opinions of young Earth creationists. They hold their views based on faith, not on reason, and evidence is entirely beside the point. Creationism isn't amenable to scientific evaluation since it is not a scientific theory, and I found his occasional digressions into refutations of it little more than a distraction from the science he was otherwise explaining so well. Still, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject of evolution. I can't see it as being much help to those who aren't interested in it, though.Dawkins is clearly dismayed that so many people are either ignorant of evolution or refuse to acknowledge that it occurs because of theological presumptions. In fact, he seems almost obsessed with it, but he may be upsetting himself unduly. Yes, opinion polls conducted over the last twenty years or so suggest that about 40% of Americans might be under the impression that life on Earth appeared suddenly in all its current and varied forms less than 10,000 years ago, but so what? Even if everyone believed the whole world popped into existence last Thursday (complete with a full set of false memories and a bunch of annoyingly deceptive fossils) it wouldn't affect reality. Life has evolved and will continue to evolve much as it has done for the last several billion years, whether anyone wants to believe it or not.We could hope it was otherwise, but cultures change slowly. I'm sure that if a similar poll were conducted a hundred years ago the results would have been far worse. Progress has been made. It just seems stalled among some populations. How long did it take until most people accepted that the Earth orbited the Sun or that continents rode on tectonic plates and shifted position over time? I'm sure there are still people (even a few from industrialized nations) who believe the world is flat. Scientific understanding has never been universal and, for the most part, this hasn't mattered. People can live productive and happy lives without knowing why things are the way they are. A farmer doesn't need to know that axial tilt causes seasons in order for him to grow vegetables. An understanding of how gravity creates tides is not necessary for a fisherman to bring his boat back to the dock. If you think Poseidon causes tides and that seasons shift from spring through winter by divine decree, it doesn't stop them from happening. What does matter is that those who work in scientific fields understand what is actually happening, and this is almost universally the case.I'm sure Dawkins would agree with this, but I'm also sure he would point out that, in a democracy, scientifically ignorant people can and sometimes do elect scientifically ignorant representatives. Laws and regulations these politicians enact can have negative consequences if they base them on poor or erroneous understandings of the issues at hand. I confess that this also concerns me. From a political standpoint, Dawkins' concern about people who refuse to accept the simple fact that life evolves has merit, but it points to a more general failure of our culture and of our politicians to adapt to our rapidly expanding knowledge of the universe. A general understanding of science and scientific principles is far more important now than it was a mere century ago because of how much we depend on science and technology in our daily lives. Unfortunately, basic scientific literacy lags far behind what it should be. Without it, we only have unquestioned assumptions, uninformed opinions, and gut feelings to help us make decisions, and these seldom provide a good basis for wise choices.I'm American, so I would like America to continue to be a leading force in science and technology. A scientifically literate population seems to me to be a necessary precursor of that. But America isn't the world. There are other nations, and some of them seemingly do a far better job of providing a basic scientific understanding to their general populations. This is likely to yield more scientists and engineers, better political decisions, and a greater likelihood of continued technological advancement and economic prosperity. I don't want to sound like a cultural Darwinist, but nations that can adapt their cultures to our growing understanding of the world will prosper. Those that do not won't. If American doesn't lead, some other nation undoubtedly will.So, whereas opinion polls may be a cause for concern, they don't imply an end to human advancement, and they certainly don't affect how nature actually works. The only real question is how well people and the societies they live in will deal with scientific discoveries that challenge previously held beliefs. Those better able to adapt their worldviews to accommodate new knowledge will have an advantage over those that do not. It's not exactly the same, but this is something like how evolution works."
93,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86115503-younes-saci,5,"I'm glad that Richard Dawkins had 'grown out' of sledge hammering religious beliefs (which in my view is a dialogue killer) and focused enough to write this book on actual evidence of evolution.the book is more busy in the truthiness of evolution rather than debunking creationist beliefs, while nevertheless effortlessly showing the impossibility of a creationist origin/design. Richard Dawkins welcomes all skeptic readers and lays out the methods by which modern scientists --of empirical and theoretical fields-- confirm Darwin's theory.Best arguments that struck me the most (because they cannot be associated with any honest designer) are:1/ laryngeal nerve of the giraffe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO1a1...this alone disproves intelligent design hypothesis or any ""guided"" evolution.2/The Lost Eyes of the Ant: natural selection can be economic and can take away costly features that are no longer beneficial to the species.3/Pseudo-genes: Genes we got from ancestors which now serve no purpose (except if you count showing us the historical impact left by natural selection as a purpose).4/The Lenski's Experiment: showed evolution of bacteria ""before our very eyes"""

It didn't have to be true, but it is....Evolution is the only game in town, the greatest show on earth.”This book is very detailed, but if you want to know exactly how the evolution is proven by science, it is great. Sometimes it was maybe too detailed for me, especially in the sections I was familiar with, but you can just skip over those, if you encounter this problem, too. This book is also very scientific. It is written to be understood by almost everyone, but there are parts, which are more difficult to understand, so you should probably take more time reading it (or at least some parts of it).That being said, I think it is great this topic is being dealt with by popular science and I recommend it to everyone who wants to know more about the world. 4*"

At the same time, paradoxically, ill-informed opposition is also stronger than I can remember. This book is my personal summary of the evidence that the ‘theory’ of evolution is actually a fact – as incontrovertible a fact as any in science.”To summarize the intent and content of Richard Dawkins’ THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH, it’s tough to beat Dawkins’ own words in the opening paragraph of his preface.It’s instructive, it’s entertaining, it’s educational, it’s informative and, perhaps most important of all, it’s persuasive and convincing beyond any reasonable shadow of a doubt that evolution exists, that it always has, and that, even today, it operates in real time, and occasionally causes changes at speeds that can best be characterized as jaw-dropping!My rather niggardly award of only three stars as opposed to a four- or five-star rave review stems from the fact that I have never been a lover of biology in my reading, no matter how accomplished the writing might be. Personal preference only. But the fact is, that THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH deserves your time if you’re a lover of popular science. If you’re a believer in a young earth or creationism, give it a shot! You never know where it might take your thinking.Paul Weiss"
96,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21100863-essannia-dahi,0,"In the introduction, Dawkins admits that he wrote this book for people who already believe in Evolution and might be looking for arguments to use against or to convince those who don’t and I agree with him. You can never win over someone by being extremely condescending to them like Dawkins is throughout the parts I read. So, I’m bailing out not because I don’t believe in Evolution but because of the tone of the writer and also the book was getting to technical for me ( if I am being honest it’s more the latter reason)I wish I could back to school to study science. I was a smart kid who made what I see now a stupid decision of choosing a non-scientific branch."
97,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2763719-john,5,"Richard Dawkins is a man who, in his own words, simply wishes to teach people all over the world how to think critically for themselves. Dawkins, who often admits to being distressed by the close-mindedness of most people, takes the high road in his new book, The Greatest Show On Earth, by devoting only two chapters (the first and the last) to discussing how stupid everyone who disagrees with him about evolution are, no exceptions. He refers to people who don't believe in evolution as ""history deniers,"" pointing out that only people stupid enough to believe that the world is flat, or that the Romans never existed, or that the Holocost never happened, would ever try to argue that people didn't necessarily evolve the way Dawkins says they did. Dawkins tactfully points out that any ""unbiased"" person who reads this book will soon find themselves in complete acceptance of evolutionary theory. Dawkins, author of other books such as The God Delusion and The Devil's Chaplain, is thankfully free of any such biases that might otherwise influence his own thinking. A biased person is by definition, after all, a person who doesn't agree with Dawkins, so it would be impossible for Dawkins to ever be biased about anything. Besides, on an episode of Bill Maher, he demonstrated his own open-mindedness and good faith as a scientist by explaining that, on a scale of 1 to 7 (with 7 being the equivalent of 100%), he is only a 6.9 in terms of his certainty that there is no god. When posed the question of whether or not he'd ever heard a clever, interesting idea from the other camp (the Youtube video of this was titled ""THE BEST RICHARD DAWKINS MOMENT EVER!!!"" last I checked), Dawkins replied with an emphatic ""No!"". For this demonstration of unbridled arrogance (although, in Dawkins, arrogance is not a negative trait because he literally knows everything), Dawkins was rightly given a standing ovation from the audience in attendance. This is why Dawkins says he doesn't debate creationists, because it would be like a ""cartographer debating a flat-earther.""Anyway, enough about Dawkins' inscrutability. About the book itself: the parts about Micro-evolution are interesting, but a little bit dull due to the fact that it is all basic science stuff that everyone, including young-earth creationists, have no problem with (though Dawkins enjoys implying otherwise, probably as some kind of really funny joke I just don't get, and not because he is trying to make creationists look unfairly stupid). Or, if he is, he does so with good reason. One thing that really gets on Dawkins' nerves is when creationists quote him in a manner that he feels is unfair or manipulative, so that naturally makes it okay for him to do it back to them tenfold.Dawkins then shows us the three ways by which we can date the earth, thereby proving how very old it is. The first way is by counting tree rings and daisy-chaining them together, which takes us back (gasp!) just over ten thousand years! Oh wait, I guess that doesn't prove the earth is old at all, does it? The second way is by carbon dating, which is highly unreliable and grossly inaccurate (such as when used to date rocks, or when used to date just about anything else--for example, some live mollusks were once carbon dated to have died 2,000 years previously). Loads of controversy surrounds the effectiveness of carbon dating, but Dawkins, in the interest of helping people think for themselves, doesn't waste time mentioning the controversy at all, making it easier for people to think critically for themselves by providing them with only part of the information. The third way of dating objects only works if you assume evolution to be true and carbon dating to be a completely valid measuring tool. What could be more convincing?!Dawkins' chapter on missing links is interesting because Dawkins has a different idea than I did about what exactly constitutes a missing link. I had expected Dawkins to show evidence of evolution in progress, such as an animal with a not-yet fully formed ear that didn't quite work, but was in the intermediate stage of becoming. Dawkins, however, is satisfied that all missing links are simply fully-formed animals that look a lot like other animals. Say, the way a camel could be a missing link between a giraffe and a horse. Thank you, Dawkins, for simplifying that for me! How obvious it all seems now! Dawkins states that the best evidence for evolution is genetic similarity. If two things have a similar makeup, why wouldn't they be related to each other? For example, take a snowman and a watermelon. They are both made up of most of the same things so they are probably related to each other, if you go back far enough into the past.Anyway, I've grown tired of reviewing this book. Dawkins' genius is self-evident. Any unbiased, non-history-denier, intelligent human being should be able to read this book and think for themselves by completely adhering to Dawkins' ideas and calling anyone else who doesn't agree an idiot. Dawkins proves in his book that there is only one way to look at the evidence, and anybody who looks at the ""facts"" and has a different idea about what they might mean is unquestionably an uninformed idiot. I can hardly wait until Dawkins puts out his next book so I can know what other kinds of people--other than creationists, republicans, and chruch-goers--I can feel free to despise in the name of open-mindedness.

102,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5468034-mohamed-almahdi,5,"Original post is found in my blog: https://loveacid.wordpress.com/2019/0...Reading The Greatest Show on Earth by Richard Dawkins has been my first exposure to a literature (a popular science book in this case) that provides a thorough backed-by-evidence explanation of the theory of evolution. As a somewhat, unorthodoxly, religious person, I have not been in a denial of evolution prior reading the book. Honestly, I have gone through many online contents about the matter since I have been aware of it and I personally do not see any irresolvable irreconcilable clash between science, particularly in topics related to the theory of evolution, and my personal beliefs and practice of religion. It has been a very interesting read and evolution, in my opinion, is a must-understand topic to whoever has a STEM background.I can say that the book has offered me a clear and a systematic list of evidences confirming that evolution is a fact. Dawkins’ rhetorical way of writing is greatly attractive and enjoyable. With a blend of wit and, somewhat, simplified semi-technical demonstrations of the propositions and their associated evidences, I think the book is neither very complicated nor very superficial for a layman. It is sufficient. Although the context is clear, I have referred to YouTube videos and have done some external readings for further details and to approach the topics presented from different angles.The only thing that I have found irritating is when the author presents cases against the flawed intelligent design and the beneficent deity. The author wants to refute some of the claims made by the so called creationists to reinforce the case for evolution, and there is nothing wrong with that, but the author is sometimes caught extensively in such discussions and they turnout as a lengthy nagging. I have never been through many creationism vs. evolutionism debates since a long time but I do not personally confirm that the religious and indoctrinated individuals I live with in my Middle Eastern culture are proponents of the “intelligent designer” proposition rather than a “designer” proposition. I do not think the religious scriptures I am aware of explicitly explain the emergence of species, and in particular our human species, so that design flaws ( Many so called flaws can be found here ) can be attributed to God, if it is concluded from the religious scriptures that He created everything in one shot and not by means of something similar to evolution. I rather find some religious scriptures very metaphorical and symbolic regarding the emergence of species, making it inconclusive to tell whether there is a conflict between religious beliefs and the acknowledgement of evolution as a fact. God might have catalyzed evolution through first beings (i.e. species) to eventually have all these species with the so claimed flaws as traces of the evolution process. who knows?The parts discussing the beneficent deity are philosophically extensive topics but Dawkins presents them in somewhat straw-man fallacy manner. Are all species expected to live in life without pain and suffering if we are to consider the topic from a religious perspective? I do not think that my religious beliefs has ever validated pain-free and suffer-free lifetime. Should species live in a “heaven on earth” status so can God be considered beneficent and omnipotent? I do not think religions advocate such notion, religions are much more complicated than the straw man Dawkins is trying to refute.I highly recommend the book to whoever is interested in learning about evolution. I also highly recommend it to those opposing evolution. The book has indeed answered many of the questions I have had and has reinforced my stance regarding evolution.

There was just too much evidence to deny it. Nevertheless, because of my faith I fought this conclusion to some degree for much of my life. For the most part I've always been willing to concede that the human body had evolved. But thinking about the evolution of aspects of humanity that I attributed to the soul (such as consciousness and intellect) was uneasy for me. You can see this unease in my review of Keith Devlin's The Math Gene which I wrote in 2008 (Math Gene review) and Douglas Hofstadter's I am a Strange Loop which I wrote in 2009 (Strange Loop review). I was uncomfortable enough that I didn't even finish either of those books. Then I was worried that I was running from something that frightened me. But why? What was I scared of? The Greatest Show on Earth is a much needed book. We need great scientists (like Dawkins) and great writers (again, like Dawkins) to layout in an easily understood way some of the major evidences for evolution. But (and here's the point!) the crux of the whole evolution versus creationism debate has nothing to do with a lack of evidence for evolution. It has everything to do with people being unwilling to even look at the evidence because they don't want to lose a fundamental piece of themselves. This is something I can sympathize with (remember my unwillingness to finish Devlin's and Hofstadter's books).What those not accepting evolution need is a friend--someone they trust--to take them by the hand and say ""I've been down this road. I know it's difficult. But it doesn't mean giving up who you are. It doesn't (necessarily) mean losing your faith--I gotta be honest, that's always a possibility in this world. We can't escape that. But I was able to navigate this, and what it meant for me was seeing a bigger Universe and having an expanded faith.""Some will take that outstretched hand, and some won't. Dawkins (bless his heart) is more apt to push people into a corner. We all know how people respond when they're forced into a corner.What I'm saying is: if you buy into evolution already, then Dawkins' book is a great one. You'll have a lot of fun reading it. If you don't believe in evolution because of your religion, well, we need some better resources for you. If you're Mormon Evolution and Mormonism A Quest for Understanding (which I've not yet read) may be a good place to start. For other faiths I don't know if there are good resources like this. That's the sort of thing that needs to be developed. For some, evolution is directly and explicitly contrary to their faith's basic tenets. How do we help those people? I don't know. I'm not big on tearing down people's faith. But we have to help people understand that even if evolution is incompatible with their faith, it is good science and therefore should be taught in schools. (they're still free to reject it on a personal level.) How best to get that message across I don't know.That does bring me to another point: intelligent design. Intelligent design needs to be attacked as the bad science that it is. Dawkins does a good job of carrying out that attack. On the other hand, intelligent design is bad theology. That's an attack vector that I haven't seen used against it, but I think really should be. Think about what the premise of intelligent design is saying: if science is done ""right"" then it proves to us the existence of God. Wha? So now we don't need faith? Now we can just turn to the intelligent design ""scientists"" to tell us about God? Yikes! That's not the kind of faith I'm interested in.For what it is, the book is great. In my opinion Dawkins flubs a couple of things--his arms race examples could have been better chosen, and he ends with a somewhat bizarre exegesis of Darwin's ending to The Origin of Species--but those are minor points. Recommended for anyone that it won't push into a corner."
104,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,3,"I'm one of those people who loves Richard Dawkins, but could do without him talking about religion all the time. I wish the man would just do what he does best, which contrary to popular belief is NOT riling up atheists(which he does fantastically btw). Dawkins is obviously free to write whatever he feels like writing, but my main problem with him is really an issue of effectiveness. If his goal is to truly convert religious folk to atheism, then he seriously needs to reconsider his methods. When I found out he had another book coming out I was worried it was going to be a religion bashing sequel to The God Delusion(which don't get me wrong, I enjoyed) and was contemplating giving this book a pass. After the fact, I certainly don't regret reading it, and I was glad to see Dawkins talking about evolution again, though I was a bit disappointed in how he chose to tell this particular story.To be fair, he states in the introduction that this book is intended for atheists and agnostics who have lots of evolution arguments with religious folks and need fodder for conversation and examples to relay as proof of evolution. Basically, it's supposed to be a book of argument winners. And so, even if I take that as the underlying purpose of the book, I have to think it failed in its intended purpose. Are the kind of religious folk who have not accepted evolution going to be persuaded by the probably imperfect retelling of stories and facts contained with this book by atheists they're acquainted with? It just doesn't seem that likely to me. And the shame of it is, there IS a lot of really good information in this book. And though I think Dawkins rushed this, and that there were many parts that were a bit sloppy, there is the outline of a pretty strong case for the theory of evolution. It's also probably his most accessible book on biology and evolution. I think everyone that reads this book who already accepts evolution will probably come away with a good bit more knowledge than they had before, and even those thoroughly familiar with evolution may find the experience valuable due to the varied topics Dawkins discusses.The shame is that who could really benefit from reading a book like this, is exactly the type of person who wouldn't make it past the first few pages wherein their beliefs are ridiculed. And where their ilk are constantly being pointed to and laughed at. Some of it is relatively mild, ""Creationists believe this, but how could that be if this and this, and because of this and this."" But the more pointed ones really show some of the frustration Dawkins has with creationist arguments...or mantras, as he puts it. Valid points yes, but the kind that would immediately put someone like that on the defensive. And again, if you're giving arguments to atheists to use against creationists, then it's useful to point out things like that. But here he doesn't go far enough in the other direction. If he really wanted to prepare atheists for verbal warfare he could've structured his book around very specific creationists arguments against evolution(irreducible complexity(i.e- the Bombardier beetle), second law of thermodynamics, apparent design, etc...). Sure, he touches on all these issues, but not in a straightforward way for people to use as weapons. But assuming I forget about these bigger issues and just look at the book itself, it really was an enjoyable read. Dawkins presents cases from many areas of science, all of which provide some sort of evidence for the theory of evolution by natural selection. He tackles the issue in the most comprehensive manner I've seen(though admittedly, this is the first book I've read laying out the proof of evolution). I particularly enjoyed the chapter on embryonic development. After what seems like a long drawn out chapter detailing the ins and outs of our development in the womb, possibly leaving the reader wondering what the hell the point of all this was, Dawkins brings it all around and drives home the salient point that evolution works by simple changes that are made in the dna sequence, which cause the embryo to develop differently in the tiniest of ways. If this change in development leads to an organism better equipped to survive in its environment, then it's more likely that the genetic change will be passed down. It's important to remember what level the actual changes are happening on, which is I think a large and common misunderstanding when it comes to evolution. Also, the book was interspersed with sections of full color pictorial inserts, which were very cool. So if all else fails, at least you have pretty pictures to look at. "
105,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3871172-kirsty,4,"I wasn't sold on this at first, but the chapters after the first one were better (The first chapter was quite antagonistic towards creationists who really aren't going to be reading this book so it was a bit unneccesary). The pictures were good as well."
106,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49637424-krysztina,5,"An absolute triumph in the face of creationist nonsense. Long and overly-complicated in places, but well worth a read. No-one with an ounce of intelligence could still believe evolution is just an unsubstantiated theory after reading this."
107,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38974091-grzegorz-skorupi-ski,4,"I was a little bit disappointed when I realised that one of the main goals of this book was to deflect all popular arguments of creationists. It is sad that in 21th century we need to make books with that intention... For me, this book itself makes a very good job not only to make one understand evolution but also to make one non-religious. I even don't have to read The God Delusion (but I will probably). Also I get now why there is the biggest percentage of ahteists among biologists. The reason is that when we really look into how we and other living organisms are built, we can find lots of evidence that The Creator just couldn't be intelligent. So obviously there had to be other force shaping more and more complex life continuously. The evloution of living organisms is not by any sense intelligent. But because of this process such beautiful creatures like Galapagos Turtles can randomly occur, so this is definitely The Greatest Show on Earth.One more thing: thanks to this book, I finally get how bold and ahead of his times Charles Darwin was."
108,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108361878-mohammed-walaa,5,"This book tackles one of the most controversial topics in the 21st century in a way that is methodical, accurate and with a plethora of evidence that irrefutably beyond reasonable doubt confirms that evolution is a fact. ""But its only just a theory"", as those who deny evolution (history-deniers as Dawkins labels them) would so blatantly claim, which is why the author premises the book with an accurate explanation of what a theory is compared to what most people believe the word theory means (most people confuse a hypothesis for a theory).The author goes through Darwin's theory of evolution in just the right amount of detail, as the book is addressed to the masses who for the most part don't have a biology related degree, the level of detail in such a book has to be just right. Too much detail and you confuse people with information that requires knowledge that they don't have, too little and your book will be an overly-generalized unconvincing mess. Dawkins however, manages to strike the right balance between too little and too much detail.The only take I have against Dawkins is his attitude against those who still deny evolution which can sometimes be overly aggressive, while I sympathize with the fact that he probably had to deal with lots of people who refuse to see reason and/or are unqualified to talk about the subject, one must admit that he could have gone about his criticism in a less condescending fashion.Overall, I'd recommend this book to any one who's interested in evolution, biology or more broadly, the diversity of life and how it came about to be. You'll learn a great deal and will generally be left satisfied knowing that you've come out of the other side of the book with more knowledge that you had before, provided that you approach it with an open mind in the first place and let go of whatever negative connotations you may or may not associate with evolution, knowing that this book isn't about faith or creation, it is as the title says, about the evidence for evolution."
109,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999998-david-s,4,What an amazing book. Quite a surprise..I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. Very insightful. Would have rated it the full 5 stars but I felt Dawkins had his atheist agenda take centre stage even when it wasn't warranted. Well worth it though.
110,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4559891-laila-haerian,4,"Notes for Laila:-Mandel and Darwin working at the same time period but not knowing about each other, Mandel in Germany and Darwin in England.-Gene pool: for each species a pool of all the existing genes. Genes are being shuffled from generation to generation rather than blended, if it was being blended the offspring of a male and female was going to be a half male half female! 3 different forms of selection (same final result): Artificial selection: Humans mating the stronger horses or dogs or more beautiful flowers so their genes are more often passed to the next generation.Sexual selection: female peacocks choosing the most attractive peacocks to mate with, so the genes of the most attractive ones are more often passed on to the next generation or canaries with the most beautiful songs and sounds.Natural Selection: in each species, the ones with the superior characteristics (like stronger swimming mussels or faster swimming features in fish) are more likely to survive and have offspring, so the genes for the stronger characteristics are more often passed on to the next generations, in a long run the genes responsible for the weaker features get eliminated from the gene's pool because the carriers of those genes do not survive as often as the stronger ones!Isotopes: variants of the same element with the same # of protons (same chemical properties) but different # of neutron. Radioactive: Some of the heavier isotopes are unstable and decay into the next element (e.g. Potassium to Argon). Half life is the time it takes for half of the remaining original unstable atoms to change into the stable atoms. Tis method is used to estimate the age of the rocks. Some of the isotopes with shorter half lives are extinct now and all changed into the stable atoms. The ones with very long half lives (Billions) still exist like Potassium-40.One method of measuring how much close two species are: DNA has a melting point at which the two strings separate. They can bond with other DNA's but the closer the composite of the two strings are the stronger the bond is and the lower the melting point would be. Humans and chimps DNA's have a very strong bond stronger than like humans and dogs.- Hillis plot: a huge and complicated round plot that shows how every living thing got evolved from the same origin.- Argument on evolution vs. intelligent design: there are examples in animals and plants which could have been designed better if it was a design from the scratch, but it makes sense for it to be evolved from an existing organ/system and being modified gradually to do the new required function. (e.g. poor sinus drainage in humans, crowded teeth (wisdom teeth), appendix in humans with no known purpose and causes death if infected in the absence of medical help. unnecessary wings in flightless birds, e.g. ostriches. Plants are green and not black, even though black plants would absorb more light energy. “The biologist John Berman has offered the opinion that evolution is not an engineering process, and so it is often subject to various limitations that an engineer or other designer is not. Even if black leaves were better, evolution's limitations can prevent species from climbing to the absolute highest peak on the fitness landscape. Berman wrote that achieving pigments that work better than chlorophyll could be very difficult. In fact, all higher plants (embryophytes) are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor that is a sort of green alga – with the idea being that chlorophyll has evolved only once.”"

""Life is a patch work of compromises "" as a reader of this book will find, along with the understanding of how Natural selection works thus propelling evolution of all life forms. Very thrilling experiments cited. It is a must read."
112,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3579598-adriana,5,"There are times when I think of the process of reading as a way to find happiness by leaving the nuisances of my own life and getting lost into someone else’s problems and reflections. In this scenario books are like spaceships that allow me to fly far away from my own planet, with the advantage of delivering me safe in my bedroom at any time. At other times though, reading turns my spaceship into a microscope through which I gain greater insight into all the different things that make my life the way it is. When this happens, I come out from the experience with a new sense of wonder and respect for things I previously didn’t really care for that much. In the case of “The Greatest Show on Earth”, the aspect of reality I now find completely fascinating is evolution, and while I don’t claim (I don’t think I ever could) to understand everything there is to know about it, I’m now way more interested in the process than I was before finishing this book. What I like the most of TGSOE is how it breaks down the science and the very, very complicated biology processes in ways that allow those of us with a scientific background that pretty much stopped in high school to understand them, without going to the other side and sounding condescending. (Unless you’re a proponent for young earth creationism or intelligent design, in which case prepare to be challenged on very chapter) I especially liked the section devoted to embryology and the explanation about the tree of life, along with the introductory chapters where Dawkins explains the relevance of theories, and their meaning in a scientific context. There’s also a lot to be said in favor of a book that doesn’t pretend to completely satisfy your curiosity on a given subject, but instead tries to leave you with more questions and a newfound respect for all the people that have dedicated their lives to answer them. A lot of people might find Dawkins’ intolerant stance on creationism and intelligent design off-putting, (especially those who feel that religious beliefs are above criticism) but I found it amusing, informative, and justified. The fact that in some countries as much as 42% of the population believe that humans and dinosaurs coexisted (and I’m not talking about birds) paints a worrying picture of our current state of affairs in terms of basic scientific knowledge, and gives merit to the idea that we as a society are not doing right by kids when it comes to education. I’m not going to use this space to talk about my opinion of religion in relation to science and evolution, because in my very personal opinion the idea that religion has to do with everything and needs to be involved in every discussion is part of the reason why things are the way they are today (that is, fucked up), so I’m going to end this review on a positive note: Nature is terrifying, sadistic, and even outright mean when it wants to be, but most of the time it’s simply awesome. "
113,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/755462-nathan,4,"I really enjoyed this book as a good comprehensive primer on the current state of the theory of evolution, and how the evidence continues to mount in favor of the undeniable fact that the earth is ancient on the scale of billions of years, and the diversification of life on earth through natural selection. I can't imagine how difficult it must be for someone like Dawkins to walk a delicate balance between making these subjects easy enough for those of us who don't hold PhDs in zoology or microbiology to follow the evidence, without watering it down to the point that it loses all poignancy. I think He does a brilliant job. One of my primary reasons for reading the book was to find something I could give to christians who are young-earth creationists that might give them a singular place to go to unpack just how misleading and manipulative the young-earth intelligent design movement is. I think most people in this position mostly read information from dishonest sources that are deliberately misleading and full of pseudo-science and rhetoric. I'd love to find a primer on the actual science behind evolution that could explain the massive problems with young-earth creationism in a way that doesn't insult their core beliefs. I had my doubts that a writing by the world's most famous atheist could do this, and I think I was right. Despite what I think is an honest effort, Dawkins still has trouble hiding his contempt for ""history-deniers"" as he calls them, and his atheist world view bubbles to the top pretty often. I don't personally have an issue with this, and in fact I can empathize with why Dawkins is so demonstrably irritated with proponents of young-earth creationism. And he's right. It's deplorable that scientists in 2012 have to stop their legitimate research and put dealings in the academic arena on hold in order to defend the basic facts of the universe from what basically amounts to medieval religious persecution. And I think his anger over the matter is directed entirely at the leaders of the movement who are so deliberately ignorant and/or misleading, and not at the average believer on 'the street."" But, that's a subtlety that readers who don't believe in evolution on spiritual grounds will likely miss. In a perfect world, people would be able to read this dispassionately. Unfortunately we live in the polarized time of rhetoric and sound bites, and I think the people that most need the information in this book will be turned off and offended by Dawkins' tone. It's a shame, and it shouldn't be true, but it is. What evolution needs is someone who can deliver the science on this 'street-veiw' level without being critical of people's spiritual views. I don't think this book quite hits the right tone. Still, I really enjoyed it. I learned many things I didn't know. I read it twice straight through, because there was so much here to chew on. "
114,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64939455-robert-narojek,4,"""Barbarians are standing at the gates"", as John Brockman wrote in the introduction to the book ""Science and creationism."" It is hard to believe, but almost everywhere in the world, the degree of acceptance of the theory of evolution diminishes from year to year and it is increasingly common to hear voices that it is ""only a theory"". Consciously or not (though very often with full premeditation) people confuse the different meanings of the word ""theory"" and forget - or do not want to know - that evolution is a theory in the same sense as the heliocentric theory or the theory of gravity. Evolution is a fact. We observe such disturbing phenomena not only in the backward countries and Islamic theocracies, but even in the most developed and civilized countries. This infamous statistic is opened by the United States, where two-fifths of the population, influenced by the indoctrination of fundamentalist churches, believe that man was created ""in the image and likeness of God"" ten thousand years ago, but other countries in developed democracies (EU), do not give way. What's worse, almost everywhere there are more people who do not want to or can not accept that life has evolved on Earth for billions of years, and the common ancestor of man and chimpanzee lived in Africa a few million years ago.The theory of evolution is attacked by States and Churches, Popes and Cardinals, Ayatollahs and Rabbis. The fundamentalist right with the radical left is allied against it ... In the name of the ill-conceived freedom of speech and belief (and sometimes, which is more ironic, also in the name of freedom of scientific research), it is demanded - in the US, Great Britain, Russia, and many more countries - the introduction of allegedly ""theory"" of the origin of life into alternative schools, with the widely promoted concept of Intelligent Design at the forefront. The duty of a thinking man is to resist this wave of obscurantism, and hardly anyone like Richard Dawkins, the author of world bestsellers, including the famous ""Selfish gene"" and no less ""The God Delusion"", fulfill this commitment with undisputed intellectual competence and verve, and equal literary talent. ""The greatest show on earth"" is probably the first attempt in popular science literature to gather in one publication all - at this point already irresistible - evidence and testimonies confirming that evolution, though it still hides many secrets, is certainly much more than just ""only theory"". Well, someone who does “not believe” in the theory of gravity, should jump out the window from the tenth floor, and who does not believe in the theory of evolution ... should read the latest book by Richard Dawkins. "
115,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5877090-annette,3,"Whew! It took me a long time to finish this book. I've always got a non-fiction book on the go and I never feel compelled to read them quickly. I just plod along at my own pace. I read a chapter here and there, taking my time to absorb the information. I'd read The Selfish Gene a few years ago and enjoyed it,but that took me several months to get through too. Overall I found the Selfish Gene easier going, and I particularly enjoyed the chapters on Memes (the wonderful term Dawkins created), and learning about how carbon dating really works - wasn't what I thought at all.The Greatest Show was much tougher going for a layperson. I'm interested in science though I don't have a background in it, and the concepts don't come easily to me. I'm an arts and languages person but I like to learn about the world of science. I never imagined it would take me this long to plough through though!I had to read and re-read most chapters, and some sections which were highly complex I must have read 3 or 4 times. Just so I could get a handle on what Richard was getting at. He's one smart guy, and his passion for Darwin and for educating people about evolution is obvious. The problem is with folk like me, who don't have a basic knowledge of genealogy and anatomy. So inevitably some stuff went soaring over my head and I just had to move on. There were parts that were way more interesting than others and were much easier to read.Dawkins writes in a dry way which doesn't make for fascinating reading, unless you have a passion for the subject matter. But he does pepper his information with anecdotes and he likes to demonstrate his sense of humour. He writes in the same way he talks, and he never dumbs down his facts for the benefit of the non-scientists out there. Good on him for that.So, if I was ever in doubt about the origin of mankind ( I never was), I would certainly find plenty of evidence to convince me about evolution after reading this book. So many facts about our origins with Dawkins presenting such rational, substantiated evidence to support them. I just wish more people would get on the evolution bandwagon. I can't believe I know people who think humans have existed for only 10,000 years and that we descended from the mythical duo, Adam and Eve.Richard Dawkins has a long way to go in convincing the die hard creationists. His comments about the problems science teachers have in the USA with teaching kids about evolution is an eye-opener. It's fascinating stuff but I can only give this 3 stars because of the difficulty I had in understanding some of the subject matter. That's my issue, not Dawkins'. That man knows his stuff."
116,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65052392-vixie,5,"Richard Dawkins is a man of strong opinions and an equally strong will, unwilling to bend to the will of others and uncompromising when it comes to scientific fact. His reputation precedes him and this book does not disappoint, every word, every sentence is full of both scientific fact and research to back it up as well as his quick wit and strong-willed banter. This book is full of evidence on evolution and it was an educational experience to say the least. I will have to re-read this book for sure simply to absorb the sheer amount of scientific explanation and evidence Dawkin's provides. And what is within the book is merely the tip of the iceberg when it comes to evolution. There is no doubt in my mind that Dawkin's not only trusts in Evolution, he has done every bit of research he can to be able to argue for Evolution and everything related to it. And quite rightly to. As I say to anyone who asks, simply believing you are right is not the way to go. Research is key. It doesn't matter what you 'believe' or 'know', research both sides of the argument so you can hold a sound argument. And Dawkins does this, and he at least acknowledges the side of the ‘Creationists’ conceding to their opinions once or twice to express his point. There are times when he admits the Creationist’s are right, such as there isn’t a huge amount of fossil evidence, then he explains why there wouldn’t be. Or at one point he mentions there being a ‘creator’ and although he expresses doubt at there being a creator he allows the word to remain in his work because he knows full well that some who are reading this book do believe in a ‘Creator’. This shows that as much as he may dislike religion he dislikes ignorance more and is merely trying to explain to Creationists that facts cannot be fabricated, not easily at least and that evolution is based on fact which simply shouldn’t be ignored. Every chapter is full of this understanding and research and most importantly the need to be understood. Dawkin’s is not trying to ‘force’ his ‘ideas’ on religious people, he is trying to fight ignorance and this book felt as if it was full of frustration at the fact that these individuals simply wouldn’t even look at the proof. He was not asking them to accept it, just to look and understand. Although even I don’t think I fully understood what was within these pages. It certainly needs another read. Evolution is full of such interesting twists and turns that it is hard to know which came first the ‘chicken or the egg’, a moot point because really it is neither. Which almost mimics the mind-teasing and tricking within these pages. He discusses evolution as simply as he is able but it is such a complicated topic I am sure it took him some time to word it appropriately. Frogs and Monkeys are related, but yet they are not the same species because they are evolved from a more distant ancestor and by the time the monkeys and frogs evolved the two species were so different there could be no chance of interbreeding. To explain how every plant, mammal, reptile, fish and bacterial/viral life-form is related is a daunting task. How does one adequately express the incredible way natural selection has formed such intricate and various life-forms in one simple book? It is all but impossible but Dawkins makes an admirable effort and supplies us with a book full of evidence to prove just why evolution is an accepted scientific fact. Perhaps the thing that interested me most was the explanations into the biology of animals and the ways scientists dated their finds. Pages 205 and 206 were just two pages of the many pages that gave me pause. The image of the young chimpanzee’s face, so similar to our own that it certainly made me startle when I looked upon it. I knew apes were closely related to humans, in fact humans are a species of ape, but never before had I looked at a chimp and seen such a fine example of a human-looking face. The skull of page 205 was surely the skull of a young human child dead before he or she could grow into an adult, but no, even this was a chimpanzee! An infant just before birth. Surely there could be no doubting? No scientist could perform such a fete as to make a chimpanzee child look like a human! And if man had interfered the infant ape would not suddenly change into a chimpanzee looking ape if humans had played with the ape’s DNA. This was nature at its finest and a peek into the distant past when apes started looking more and more human before they lost all hair and stood up on two legs (of course not simultaneously, evolution happens gradually the majority of the time (though there are a few exceptions to this rule)). Page 268 onwards was also of interest because Dawkin’s takes apart the idea of Noah’s Ark and asks a simple question. In his own words: ‘Why would all those marsupials- ranging from tiny pouched mice through koalas and bilbys to giant kangaroos and Diprotodonts- why would all those marsupials, but no placentals at all, have migrated en masse from Mount Ararat to Australia? Which route did they take? And why did not a single member of their straggling caravan pause on their way, and settle- in India, perhaps, or China, or some haven along the Great Silk Road?’ I don’t know about you but I have watched many documentaries on humans and animals alike and not all who make the pilgrimage reach the end of the journey. Some are killed off (in the case of animals) but more often than not the animals and people will reach a stage in their journey where they choose to stay or turn back. If this great pilgrimage occurred after Noah’s Ark I am certain not all Marsupials would not have made the journey to Australia. Page 102 is part of a chapter that reveals the age of Earth and the fossils. The chart of isotopes and their half-life’s (which you will gain some understanding of by reading this book) reveals that the Earth cannot be 10,000 years old. Manipulating isotopes is impossible to do, there is simply no way to falsify this unless someone had a big time-machine capable of holding all of Earth’s rocks and then ‘magically’ age 10,000-year-old rocks to 1.4 billion years old for example. It is as farfetched as it sounds. The age of rocks cannot be mistaken, there is no way for the data to be falsified. By the end of this book I was in deep thought, Dawkin’s arguments and information was sound with the evidence to back it up. And he was honest, very opinionated I agree but not once had he lied in this book. Everything was truthful and based on scientific fact, everything he wrote about can be found in museums and in every scientific lab and text book. Although messing around with isotopes and chemicals is something no-one should do without proper education and support (and even then, it should be left to the professionals). Still, the point he makes is sound. There is no doubt about his research or facts and there is no doubting his trust in evolution, I would go so far as to say he is incredibly passionate about evolution and it comes across in his words. I certainly could not put this book down, I was deeply intrigued by every nuance of evolution he reveals and was very disappointed when I reached the end of this book. I will be reading more of Dawkins works and I will be recommending this book everyone. It is an incredibly educational book that provides food for thought. It certainly opened my mind to the possibilities and intricacies that evolution provides. "
117,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3199067-jhay-rocas,5,"Reading this book is like going back through all my classes in biology, genetics, and evolution; all in one sitting. Well not literally because of my busy schedule, it took me two months to read the entire book.Going back, Richard Dawkins presents the case for evolution and the evidences for it in a simple, witty, fun and realistic way. Even a friend of mine who had no formal science training and just a few units of biology was immersed with reading only a few pages of the book. By the time he gave the book back to me, you can see it in his eyes that he had a clearer understanding of evolution, well the significance of tree rings and how we use them to date fossils.What I really enjoyed about this book is the way Dawkins took on the skeptics, deniers and critics of evolution with concrete evidences and how these have been blinded by their own beliefs and misconceptions.He cleared up a lot of misconceptions about evolution. Once such misconception goes on like this:""I'll believe in evolution when a monkey gives birth to a human baby.""To which Dawkins responds so straightforwardly in Chapter 6, page 155:""Once again, humans are not descended from monkeys. We share a common ancestor with monkeys. As it happens, the common ancestor would have looked a lot like a monkey than a man, and we would indeed probably have called it a monkey if we had met it, some 25 million years ago. But even though humans evolved from an ancestor that we could sensibly call a monkey, no animal gives birth to an instant new species, or at least not one as different from itself as a man is from a monkey, or even from a chimpanzee. That isn't what evolution is about. Evolution not only is a gradual process as a matter of fact; it has to be gradual if it is to do any evolutionary work. Huge leaps in a single generation - which is what a monkey giving birth to a human would be - are almost as unlikely as divine creation, and are ruled of for the same reason: too statistically improbable. It would be so nice if those who oppose evolution would take a tiny bit of trouble to learn the merest rudiments of what it is that they are opposing.""And the book has plenty more cases to refute and debunk those who oppose and deny evolution. The same cases and examples are also the book's points of strength in explaining how evolution works to the lay man. The book has done one thing brilliantly, prove that evolution is a fact. An undeniable fact."
118,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1671310-hayley,4,"I doubt Dawkins will convince creationists of evolution--you'd have to be friendlier to get them to listen--but he does do a great job describing the evidence for evolution with some of the most fascinating examples known.I think this book is good for three things:*Playing up the wonder of evolution*Reviewing lots of biological concepts that one might've learned in college, in a way that's really easy to read and surprisingly comprehensive*Providing ""ammunition"" for evolutionists to convince creationists (if they're willing to be less scathing than Dawkins)A master of metaphor and simile, Dawkins compares evolution to a crime scene where scientists are the detectives, piecing together the story from whatever remains behind.He takes readers back through geologic time, describing the unbroken chain of one species becoming another becoming another. He hammers home that ""species"" are based on artifical boundaries in time, while in reality, each generation of an organism is only slightly different from the last. He describes examples of evolution we can see in real time -- the scientist who grows successive generations of bacteria and freezes each one to compare, for instance. What a good idea.Readers will get some key concepts of evolutionary biology, ecology, embryology, biochemistry, paleontology and more...it's fascinating how many different fields Dawkins pieces together to cover evolution.He does it almost seamlessly. I can't imagine the sheer amount of research he must have done to make this book as cohesive, convincing and organized as it is. The book is at the right level for, perhaps, a science-interested college freshman. It teaches key concepts like homology (how a bat wing and human hand are modified versions of each other), natural selection vs. genetic drift (don't remember if he calls it that), evolutionary arms races, etc. This stuff doesn't feel dry and egg-headed. He's too good at finding perfect, illustrative examples.I docked the book one star because Dawkins really is too much of a jerk at times for us to expect creationists to listen. Why alienate the people you're trying to convince? (Also, a final note: I saw another review here complaining that the book didn't look much at the evolution of morality and/or altruism. I agree that this is a gap. I wonder why he didn't delve into those things -- they are definitely relevant.)"
119,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1028250-tamra,2,"2.5 stars.The upside:- This is a nice compilation of the evolutionary evidence that's out there. Dawkins frequently quotes other books that have been written on the subject (his own books included).- It's also a nice sum-up of what was written in Darwin's On the Origin of Species, which I'm not likely to read. Dawkins followed Darwin's pattern of ""softening up"" as Dawkins put it, which means he softballed the subject for 3 or 4 chapters, leading the reader from something they were more likely to accept (dog breeding, for instance) towards the real heart and soul of evolution by natural selection.- The last few chapters are AWESOME. Comparative evolutionary evidence is incredible.The downside:- Dawkins is insulting. He tries to not be so in-your-face about his All Religious People are Chumps stance, but he can't stay away from it long before he's throwing out one-liners and pop shots. - Dawkins is condescending. The one study that he goes into depth about, he warns you about. And I quote: ""The next few pages are ... somewhat intricate. ... It would probably be best not to read this section of the book when tired, at the end of a long day."" He repeats this ""if you're too stupid to understand this section, try again later"" warning TWICE (those were my words in quotes that time). Seriously, Dawkins? How come when I read your book I get the feeling that you think I'm stupid? You've never even met me. I'm reading your book, shouldn't you try to be the slightest bit respectful? Whatever.- He rambles. A lot. His sidetracks took him so far off topic that I often had to read the chapter and then go back and skim it to know what the thread was. I took to underlining the main topics so I could TRY to follow him. By the end of the book I got used to his style, which is, I think, to introduce a lot of hard topics that he won't carry past the current page.- I've read a lot of the information in another book, and it was better done there. Finding Darwin's God, thank you. - Dawkin's hero worship of Darwin got a little old.So, I guess the bottom line is that the information is good, but the writing left something to be desired. It took so long for me to read because I got tired of being insulted. I'm a nice person, Richard Dawkins! You, however, may not be."
120,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2034124-jaice-cooperrider,5,"Wow! Dawkins does a very thorough and entertaining job of laying out the evidence (both direct and indirect) for evolution in this book, particularly of evolution by natural selection. Only the most closed-minded and brainwashed people will be able to deny evolution after considering all the profound evidence accumulated in this book. The best part of it is that one doesn't have take Dawkins's word for any of it, as one can reference all the information oneself in the scientific literature and texts or, if really dedicated, perform the experiments discussed oneself and see the results firsthand. One belief this book and the evidence it contains cannot dispel is that some supreme being had a part to play in guiding this evolutionary process. However, it is clear that such a hypothetical being made some very odd and inefficient choices while doing so, as is evident in biological evidence, some of which is presented in this book. I can't say I learned a lot from this book, due to my previous training in the biological sciences, but I certainly learned new useful ways to thinks about what I already knew. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone, with the following caveats:1) Dawkins's writing might be a bit difficult to understand for those not at least at a college reading level and perhaps even slightly challenging for many college students. This is likely due to his own intelligence and his British formalism.2) Dawkins can be slightly condescending toward evolution dissenters (not that it isn't warranted) at times in the book, which might put off those who disagree with him from reading the book, which is unfortunate, as the primary focus is to lay out the evidence and let the reader draw his/her own logical conclusions.3) The book is mostly intended for those who already endorse evolution, so that they will be well-armed with profound evidence to combat the ignorance (scientific ignorance in general, evolutionary biology ignorance specifically) that continues to infect the American (and, to a somewhat lesser extent, European) public, in spite of our supposedly beingone of the most ""intellectual"" nations in the world.PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!!!"
121,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4656543-gabriel-patriarca,4,"So this is Dawkins presenting evidence for evolution.Richard Dawkins is a very well-known and outspoken person so, before reading the book I kinda knew what to expect already. He pulls no punches in criticizing and even ridicularizing creationists; but coming from him, what would one expect?This is a man that publicly states that, parafrasing: ""Religious people make specific claims about the universe and should be criticized and ridiculed, with contempt!""So there you go, he does not refrain from criticizing and ridiculing what he sees as taken as literal truth with no evidence or basis on reality. For my part, I can say I agree with the criticizing part but I am not so fond of the ridiculing one. Well, at least, not always. But there is room for that too, in certain situations.About the evidence, it is all there, as the sub-title states, plenty of evidence with some remarkable citations and reflections on Darwin himself. What was of particular importance to me was that it became clear that some creationists quote-mine ""The Origin of Species"" to twist what Darwin really meant. He did not condone a society based on the 'survival of the fittest' idea, for example (Although that is what happens in natural selection, it is not how he thought one should act in a society). There are also a lot of drawins, graphics and even some colored pages to facilitate learning. All blended with his good writing and explanation skills, making it very accessible.I only take out one star because he ended up been a little too repetitive in certain parts. In some chapters, he had just mentioned a concept to repeat or rephrase it a little later.I can't help but agree with him about this been the greatest show on earth. The theory and the observable facts are all very incredible and elegant; and beautiful, sometimes. In the end, this book made me want to know much more about this show. Luckily, there are a lot of titles to choose from."

However, I guess the book was OK; Dawkins didn't do as much a good job as Coyne or Miller did in their books. the book is full of what seems like scientific snobbery, which does say a lot about Dawkins- he is a true enthusiast about science and about what he's doing, but the book could've been much smaller and to the point; Jerry Coyne's book was precisely that- in 300 or so pages, with no technical and scientific jargon and little details, he aims straight to the head, I actually liked how Dawkins referred to it a few times (and I do appreciate he tried to keep his own personal beliefs and anti-religious speech out of the book). However (given that I do already accept evolution), there wasn't that moment where Dawkins has actually put a piece of incontrovertible evidence that made me say ""wow.. this is sure evolution"", or to better state it: this is sure macroevoluion .. I've listened to some Arab creationists claiming that all that was in the book were mere ""adaptations"" -I have no idea what's their definition of adaptation or why don't they consider it microevolution even, as they seem to deny it as well-, and I can see where did they get the feeling from, although I am now aware some cherry-picking and quote-mining has happened with this book.. (smh).Anyways, I guess this book isn't for those who want the ""concrete proof"" of evolution, although it does provide evidence but the jargon, heftiness of details, and frequent digressions all lead the book to go on another lead; but it is for those who enjoy learning and knowing about evolution or how it does actually work.أعظم استعراض على وجه الأرض، ريتشارد دوكنزالكتاب كبير ومغرق في التفاصيل ومليء بالاستطرادات، إلا أنه بجانب هذا مليء بكم من المعلومات والملاحظات مما يدفعني للقول أن دوكنز فعلاً متحمس وشغوف بمجاله ويالعلم عموماً.. لكن الاستطردات الكثيرة وأسلوب دوكنز (الذي يبدو متعالياً في كثير من الأحيان كعادته في محاضراته) ناهيك عن التفاصيل الدقيقة التقنية الكثيرة لا تجعل فكرة الكتاب في ""إثبات صحة التطور وبيان أدلته القوية"" واضحة. فبالنسبة لي كتابا جيري كوين أو كينيث ميلر أفضل من هذا الناحية. الكتاب لمحبي المطالعة والشغوفين بعلم الأحياء والتطور، لا لمن يريد التأكد من صحة نظرية التطور أو التعرف على أدلتها. بعد قراءة الكتاب أفهم لماذا يتهم الخلقويون العرب -كالدكتور إياد قنيبي ومن وراءه الباحثون اللامؤاخذة المسلمون- دوكنز بأنه يحشر أدلة على ""التكيفات"" (فالدكتور إياد لا يعترف حتى بمصطلح التطور الصغروي) وكأنها دليل على التطور الكبروي. إلا أنهم كالعادة اجتزؤوا قطعاً من الكتاب ولم يتطرقوا لعدد الشواهد في فصول السجل الأحفوري وبالطبع -كما قرر جيري كوين من قبل- أنهم لم ولن يتطرقوا أو ينفوا أو يردوا حتى على الجغرافيا الحيوية bio-geography لكن أتفهم موقفهم من باقي الكتاب.. وأنا أختلف مع دوكنز فكرياً طبعاً وأختلف مع الخلقويين العرب بالطبع أيضاً.. فأنا أصبحت أكره أي شخص يحشر أيديولوجياته في العلم.. لأن هذا يضر العلم (كما يفعل دونكز بأسلوبه المتعجرف أحيانا) ويضر الدين (كما يفعل الخلقويون العرب كالباحثين المسلمين). والجدير بالذكر هنا أن دوكنز حاول ألا يلصق ميوله المعادية للدين في الكتاب، وهو ما أحترمه بصراحة.في الختام فإن آخر فقرات الكتاب كانت مثيرة بالنسبة لي جداً.. وسأقتبسها فيما بعد. التطور ليس العشوائية (أيها الباحثون المسلمون) وها هو دوكنز أكبر ملحد يعترف بهذا. أتساءل إن كنتم قرأتم الكتاب فعلاً وعبرتم على هذه الفقرة. وأستغل هذا التعقيب لأذكر أمراً شخصياً: سأكون صريحاً، أثناء قراءتي للكتاب كنت لا اتمالك نفسي فأقول ""سبحان الله""، فعلاً، بالرغم أن كاتب هذا الكتاب أعتى ملحد على وجه الأرض حالياً، إلا أنني في كذا موضع لم أستطع سوى أن أرى عظمة الخالق في خلقه وكيف يسير هذا الكون وكيف تمضي هذه الحياة بكل تعقيد وبكل سلاسة وبكل تنظيم. أقدر مكانة دوكنز كعالم بيولوجي، ولكنني لن أقبل بكلامه في اللاهوت والدين. لا أعلم إن كان من المنطقي أن أقول أنني أرى عظمة الخالق في عملية التطور أثناء قراءة كتاب لكاتبٍ ملحد عنها.. ولكن هذا ما حدث.. ""How is it that we find ourselves not merely existing but surrounded bu such complexity, such elegance, such endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful?The answer is this. It could not have been otherwise, given that we are capable of noticing out existence at all, and of asking question about it. It is no accident, as cosmologists point out to us, that we see stars in our sky. There may be universes without stars in them, universes whose physical laws and constants leave the primordial hydrogen evenly spread and not concentrated into stars. But nobody is observing those universes, because entities capable of observing anything cannot evolve without stars. Not only does life need at least one star to provide energy. Stars are also the furnaces in which the majority of the chemical elements are forges, and you can't have life without a rich chemistry. We could go through the laws of physics one by one, and say the same thing of all of them: it is no accident that we see...The same is true of biology. It is no accident that we see green almost wherever we look. It is no accident that we find ourselves perched on one tiny twig in the midst of a blossoming and flourishing tree of life' no accident that we are surrounded bu millions of other species, eating, growing, rotting, swimming, walking, flying, burrowing, stalking, chasing, fleeing, outpacing, outwitting. Without green plants to outnumber us at least ten to one there would be no energy to power us. Without the ever-escalating arms races between predators and prey, parasites and hosts, without Darwin's ""war of nature"", without his ""famine and death"" there would be no nervous systems capable of seeing anything at all, let alone of appreciating and understanding it. We are surrounded by endless forms, most beautiful and most wonderful, and it is no accident, but the direct consequence of evolution bu non-random natural selection - the only game in town, the greatest show on earth.""Indeed, it is no accident..يصدق الأمر نفسه على البيولوجيا. ليس من باب الصدفة أننا نرى الخضرة اينما ننظر تقريبا. ليس من باب الصدفة أننا نجد أنفسنا قابعين فوق غصنٍ واحد ضئيل وسط شجرة الحياة المزدهرة النامية؛ ليس من باب الصدفة أننا محاطون بملايين من الأنواع الأخرى التى تأكل، وتنمو، وتتعفن، وتسبح وتمشي وتطير،  وتحفر الجحور، وتتسلل خلسة، وتطارد، وتهرب، وتتفوق في السرعة، وتتفوق في البديهة. لولا أن النباتات الخضراء تفوقنا عددا بما لا يقل عن نسبة العشرة إلى الواحد، الما كانت هناك طاقة تزودنا بالقوة. .لولا سباقات التسلح التى تتصاعد أبدا بين المفترسين والفرائس، وبين الطفيليات وعائليها، ولولا ما قاله داروين عن ""حرب الطبيعة"" و""المجاعة والموت""، لن يكون هناك وجود لأجهزة عصبية لها القدرة على أن ترى أي شيء مطلقاً، ناهيك عن إدراكه وفهمه. نحن محاطون بأشكال لا نهاية لها في غاية الجمال والروعة، وليس هذا من باب الصدفة، ولكنه نتيجة تترتب مباشرة على التطور بواسطة الانتخاب الطبيعى للاعشوائئ - اللعبة الوحيدة في المدينة.. أعظم استعراض فوق الأرض.بالفعل.. إنها ليست محض صدفة، وليست عبثاً"
123,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/965207-r-a-schneider,5,"This brilliantly written book is aimed/dedicated toward dealing with the claims of creationists and ""intelligent design"" advocates, that there is no evidence for evolution by natural selection (EBNS). Those claims usually arises from a complete misunderstanding (often willfully fostered by opponents) of what EBNS exactly is, or about what EBNS claims. The book is POINTEDLY aimed at disabusing the 44% of Americans who admit in polls to being creationists of their misinformed ideas about the topic.Dawkins, among other beautifully written, poignant and funny chapters, cleverly and totally deals with the oft repeated canard that ""evolution can't be true... if it was, why have we never seen one species evolve into another?"" I don't want to have to put a spoiler tag on this review, but the reason we haven't is primarily because EBNS absolutely NEVER posits such a thing as direct, one-generation, transition from one species to another. It is a straw man, and Richard Dawkins systematically pulls the stuffing out of it. And yet, he completes the chapter by showing how we are witnessing evolution into new species all around us, all the time. Read the book to find out how, paying special attention to the idea of ""islands.""I felt myself uplifted, transported and smiling at numerous points in the book as a result of the clarity of ideas Richard expresses so well. I'm ""into"" evolution, and I still made myriad discoveries; learned LOTS of stuff.For the person who has never actively delved into EBNS or Darwin, or who for the person who has only been taught it by his/her pastor, this is a great place to start unravelling the misinformation and seeing the amazing facts and output resulting from this astoundingly simple, yet astoundingly powerful 150 year old idea. Did I say, Astounding!!"
124,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32521564-erik-m-ller,5,"Dawkins minces no words confronting those who propagate the idea that all life was created thousands of years ago, in spite of the mountains of evidence to the contrary -- from geology to species distribution, from radioactive clocks to skeletal morphology, from molecular biology to computer science. His point is clear and well-argued: to deny the evidence of evolution is to be part of a modern, well-funded and aggressively evangelical Flat Earth Society, and it's only appropriate to treat it as such.He does not spend as much time on the bizarre offshoots of creationism that exist today (the arguments that species only ever ""devolve"", that evolution happens but can never lead to speciation, that an intelligent designer is constantly tweaking the process). That's because, after laying out the evidence, it becomes abundantly clear that these are simple ""God of the gaps"" arguments, attempts to shohoern theism into whatever parts of current scientific understanding can be assailed most seemingly plausibly.Leaving aside the directness, the book is trademark Dawkins in other ways: full of details, anecdotes and diversions. Most of the time I enjoy these, but the book would have been better with more rigorous editing (which, I'm sure, Dawkins would or did push back against). Dawkins is a storyteller, and you have to be ready for an experience not unlike listening to a very knowledgeable, slightly eccentric professor in order to truly enjoy this book.If you have your doubts about evolutionary biology, or are just not very well-versed in it, this is a good introduction, but it is not a gentle one. Look elsewhere for that. If you're ready to be shoved into a world that is truly filled with wonder, this book is a great start. You don't have to leave your delusions at the door, but be prepared to have them shattered."
125,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5410681-tony61,4,"4-starsDawkins is a gifted writer and he enjoys being a lightning rod for the cause of showing that evolution is truth. Nobody can read Richard Dawkins without generating a strong opinion of him, either positive or negative. You will either love him or hate him. TGSOE is a mad dash through the evidence to date for biologic evolution, giving an overview of paleontology, geology, the fossil record, homology, biogeography and a pretty good explanation of plate tectonics, genetics, etc. The molecular biology evidence, explaining how predictable rates of genetic mutations occur in plant and animal genomes, is worth the price of the book in itself. Dawkins presents his information as an argument to religious believers who disdain science as if he is trying to convince them of the truth of evolution. This is a similar style to how The God Delusion is written. Some readers may find this off-putting, and frankly is tiring after a while. I assume creationists will never read Dawkins, so why is he even addressing them? Ok, he’s putting it out there for those who are questioning creationism, maybe young people, but the constant droning about how stupid religious people are-- while maybe steeped in truth-- gets old. TGSOE is fairly comprehensive, but there are obviously more exhaustive tomes on each individual topic. Indeed, one could attain a PhD in each sub-discipline that is part of the proof of evolution...which is what makes this book such a treasure. Dawkins gives an excellent summary in one place and summarizes the meaning of the body of evidence as a whole. TGSOE is more complete than Jerry Coyne’s venerable Why Evolution is True (another 4-star book). I listened to the audiobook on my way to work and was treated to the the dulcet English accent of Dr Dawkins and his female associate. Highly recommended. I love this book, but then I love Dawkins. "
126,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44657400-natasha,4,"Always meaning to further delve into the biological world I decided to read Dawkins' The Greatest Show on Earth and it is exactly as Dawkins has labelled: it is a book filled with 'Evidence for Evolution'. Some chapters are more interesting than others but I guess this is rather subjective with the most interesting chapters having me in an almost-trance where every sentence was followed by a deep sigh and a 'THAT'S JUST AMAZING'. Some of the less interesting chapters probably consisted of the topics that I haven't met in class so I found myself reading paragraphs again to decipher meaning and most of the time failing. For someone who has studied science at a 'basic' level (high school senior biology/chemistry/physics) would find this an easy read for Dawkins relies on well-known science to provide evidence for evolution. Without this fundamental knowledge however, The Greatest Show on Earth could be a bit of a stretch so I wouldn't say that this is accessible to every reader or anyone on the street.This is a fabulously structured book that has not only grounded my understanding of evolution but has answered many questions that have been buried in the depths of my brain that I have never bothered answering. Dawkins' piece is also filled with evidence from many studies and adaptations of animals that really allow the reader to appreciate Mother Nature for all its callousness and beauty. A disclaimer: Dawkins looks down on creationists (people who do not 'believe in' evolution) with much disdain and treats them as uneducated, belligerent members of the population and this can seem rather contemptuous at times but I do understand Dawkins' frustration but he may have crossed the line one or two times but this did not affect my view of The Greatest Show on Earth as a whole."
127,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7414199-john,5,"I can certainly say that while I understood the basics of evolution, I didn't really know the details of natural selection, nor did I fully understand how we know what we know about it. Dawkins, in an attempt to give a full account of the evidence for evolution and counter the absurd claims of creationists, has written an immensely readable and understandable tome on the subject, leaving no doubt about the facts. I should note that it's unfortunate that such a detailed refutation of creationism is even necessary, but the facts show that it is. A full 42% of Americans believe that the Earth is less than 10,000 years old and that humanity appeared on the scene such as it is today at the creation of the world. An alarming number of those same people cannot answer what a ""year"" is beyond 365 arbitrary days and believe that the Earth completes an orbit around the sun once per month. Lacking such basic understanding of our universe (and even just our tiny area of it), how can they lay such faith in the claims of creationism and deny that evolution explains our existence? Indeed, evolution does, and this book explains not only the processes of evolution and natural selection, but covers the vast scope of the evidence in a way that is accessible yet authoritative. Understanding the process gives more insight not only into how we came to be, but also into why humanity's history is the way it is. If you don't truly understand evolution, natural selection, or the evidence for it, or if you flatly deny that it ever happened, I challenge you to read this book and walk away still befuddled or a denier. Only if you are a fundamentalist can this not change your views and give you a view into why the world is as beautiful as it is - no creator necessary."
128,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/289897-kristen,5,"It is a fucking Greek tragedy that this is not required reading for the entire global population, especially for those people who are least likely to read it and most in need of reading it. I refer to the ones who ""don't believe in"" evolution, those who think that everything was created in 6 days and that the earth is less than 10,000 years old, the ones who argue against evolution who can't even define what it is. In this book, Dawkins lays out in clear language exactly why evolution is true and goes through the plethora of evidence for it. How anyone can say they don't believe in evolution anyway, let alone in the face of all the evidence, boggles the mind. He is terrific at making the complex information accessible to the layman and he tackles most of the ""arguments"" used against it, like ""if we evolved from chimps then why are there still chimps?"" and other such nonsense.What also comes through in this book is Dawkins' utter delight in the natural world, his excitement at teaching something wonderful and thrilling to someone who might not have known about it before now. The wonder he clearly feels in science and the world is obvious and it makes reading this book even more interesting.Throughout, Dawkins makes little comments directly to his readers. I love this. It just makes you remember that he really is writing this for the layman and that he understands when a topic might be especially difficult for one not scientifically trained to grasp, and then he goes on to explain it without dumbing it down.This is absolutely recommended for everyone, the entire world. Don't argue, just go find a copy and read it."
129,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5041101-stuart,4,"Enjoyed most of this book. It is absolutely packed with information, presented in a clear descriptive manner which breaks evolution down into a series of interlinking subtopics which are each thoroughly addressed. If you want to read all about the evidence for evolution, it is certainly a good book to choose.The point at which it loses some of its charm would have to be the author, unfortunately. At times he seems to revel in a kind of smug self satisfaction, interjecting interesting chapters with asides which just hammer home how stupid all these creationists are, oh yes. The need to address creationists' criticisms is inherrant in such a book, however the way it came across was rather grating. Perhaps, if you were a creationist yourself the rants may have the desired effect, but as I was not in this group it often seemed like I was on the recieving end of an argument I had not started, or even had any interest in being in.That said, Dawkins is really an expert on the subject. You can see how much effort he has undertaken to research the subject matter and the passion he feels for it. When describing the situations such as the giraffe dissection, it is easy to get caught up in the excitement he shows. It is easy to forgive the author for his hostility to creationists, as they are opposing something he feels so strongly about, something which he has collected so much evidence for, something he has devoted a significant portion of his life to. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about evolution, as it really is a fantastic (and fascinating) read."
130,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/659169-bill,3,"I listened to this audio book and found the narration to be fairly pretentious. The book was written to present the overwhelming evidence for evolution. Unfortunately, rather than appealing to opposing viewpoints with reason, Dawkins immediately polarizes the issue. He explains that he will be arming the reader with unassailable points in the pro-evolution debate and then proceeds to wield offensive terms such as ""the history-deniers"" and ""the 40 percenters"" (polls show 40% of Americans believe in the literal truth of the Bible). Reaching out to opposing views and appealing to reason is absolutely the key to promoting evolution. You don't recruit allies by calling them stupid.Most of the book will be review for anyone who has read Darwin and other evolution texts. However, many chapters provide powerful and useful insights. There are several powerful metaphors and an excellent chapter on evolutionary ""theodicy."" Unfortunately, the book kicks off with a painfully pedantic and seemingly endless monologue on why evolution isn't just a theory. It also contains a horribly inaccurate summary of the rarity of hybridization between species. There are a number of places where wording could have been more careful.Still, it is worth reading if you are passionate about the subject. I'd recommend reading the book rather than listening to the audio book, as this might allow you to ignore the pretension obvious in the spoken version. I hope the author will follow Sam Harris's lead in presenting precise, articulate reason without insult or condescension."
131,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/558700-ed,4,"So, personal feelings on Dawkins aside, you can't deny he's got some kickass explanatory skills. I mean, I am by no means an expert on evolution, and I found this book really easy to follow. Along with others of his that I've read.This is technically aimed at Creationists, people who believe in intelligent design, the sort of folks who think the Earth is 6000 years old. I don't know if this book is going to find that audience, because they're not exactly interested in science, evidence, and facts in general. They're probably not gonna pick up a book by Richard Dawkins of all people. You can tell Dawkins, with his passion for evolution, is not best pleased that these people are trying to get the theory of evolution banned from school curriculums and continue to spread misinformation about what evolution actually is. This is something he's devoted his life to, after all. He's pissed, and he shows it. That might bother you if you're the sensitive sort. It didn't bother me because those same people tend to be the ones who are trying to take away the rights of people like me so I'm not overly concerned with sparing their feelings.Personally, I didn't need any convincing that evolution is a real thing that really happens, so I really can't tell how convinced you'll be by this book if you don't believe in it already. But I learned some new things, and it was not a dry read at all. He writes good.I'm just gonna blissfully pretend that he is not seen as the ultimate spokesperson for atheism."
132,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/277214-mateo,4,"A fine book. Dawkins has a wide and solid grasp of his subject, from molecular genetics to paleontology, and he's an engaging and witty writer. But this book should have been subtitled ""The Argument for Evolution,"" rather than ""The Evidence for Evolution."" Not that there isn't plenty of evidence in this book, or that it's not convincing (or should be convincing, at any rate, to anyone whose frontal lobes haven't turned to talcum powder under the influence of creationism), it's just that Dawkins can't resist long exposition and deep argument--he's a born explainer. The result is that where another author might have marshaled a large number of examples, Dawkins offers deep disquisitions on computer simulations, nerve pathways in giraffes, and E. coli reproduction. Nothing wrong with that; the evidence is both fascinating and effective, but this book may not be exactly what every reader expects. As a side note, it's too bad that Dawkins's naturally clever, smooth, and erudite prose is marred by a certain repetitiveness (""let me repeat again…"", ""at the risk of repeating myself….""); it's as though he's glancing over his shoulder as he writes, looking to see if any creationists are out there, ready to cherry-pick his words out of context. It's not Dawkins's fault, of course, and my preferred solution--sterilizing creationists after nailing their tongues to loose copies of The Watchtower--probably isn't practical. "
133,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37763-dylan,5,"Everybody should read this book. Seriously, I'm not exaggerating when I say that reading this book should be a prerequisite for being considered an educated adult. It makes the case, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that all life on Earth arose through non-random natural selection, aka evolution. Those who believe otherwise are basing their decision on something based other than evidence, because the evidence is so overwhelming that you'd have to be either ignoring it, unaware of it, or unable to understand it to believe anything else. On top of that, it's also a witty and well-written book that will pique your curiosity about a lot of subjects. Dawkins' writing is accessible without being pandering, and while he's harsh on critics of evolution, he is far more interested in explaining and exploring the amazing story of evolution on Earth and the ingenious ways scientists have devised to investigate it and build such a massive body of evidence. As someone who did not study science extensively in college and does not work in the field, the book was a great way to deepen my understanding of how evolution works and how we know what we do about it. It's the kind of thing that should be, but isn't, taught extensively throughout the educational system. This book is likely to be most useful to people who aren't experts in biology but are curious and open-minded enough to want to know more. Stop reading this review now and get this book and read it. "
134,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1240986-dave,4,"I'll repeat some of the same things I said about another Dawkins book:It could have been shorter with the same content.It could have been more clearly organized for memorability and knowing where you are.He's simply not the best writer, although you can tell he's a brilliant thinker.And despite all that, there are enough gems spread through the book to make it highly rated. His passion comes across in several-page descriptions of brilliantly designed experiments and the conclusions that they allow us to reach. In detailed explanations of the selective pressures exerted between species. In the pleading with the reader about the importance of improving the public's understanding of evolution and science, generally. By the end, you're convinced that even if there were no fossil evidence there would be ample support for evolution from many other tracks. You're armed against the missing link argument and the reason there are no ""crocoducks."" And personally, I learned a lot of fascinating facts, like the many examples of poor ""design"" that were never selected against, the way that radioactive dating is ""zeroed"" by death or by the solidification of igneous rock, and the many ways that structures have been appropriated and re-appropriated for different purposes over time.So, it's a little like mining. You have to move a lot of dirt but in the end, there's a rich payoff that makes it all worthwhile."
135,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/596234-rashid,4,"Throughout the book, Richard Dawkins eloquently weaves together his argument proving evolution by natural selection as the only mechanism which brought us all the way from random chemicals at the dawn of time to the self conscious beings we are today. No planning, no foresight, just arbitrary mutations that gave way to more complex organisms and enabled them to adapt in order to survive in different environments. The proof? The abundance of fossils which fall magnificently into evolution’s grand narrative, and if you are not fully convinced with these specimens, then go no further than the universal building blocks of life; DNA. These self replicating molecules contain within them the history of life from its very bleak beginnings; a mausoleum of life from the moment of creation to the present. Relics that exist within our very being.Ever since Darwin came up with his theory people, stubborn in head and heart, have faced a neuroses dilemma in accepting that mankind descended from ape-like creatures. Regardless, Dawkins through intellectual stimulation sets out to blunt the “history denying” snarl, proving “[e]volution is a fact. Beyond reasonable doubt, beyond sane, informed, intelligent doubt, beyond doubt evolution is a fact”!Whether you are a Dawkins fan or in the opposing camp, this thought provoking book brings otherwise complex concepts closer to the non-professional, hence broadening the debate. Well worth a read. "
136,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20989544-laura,4,"The book is amazing. I read this book some months ago, but I want to leave a review before I forget things. Dawkins has a terrific and precious talent to explain science in a funny and easy way, so it's written in a manner that everybody can understand, and when the chapter is going to be a bit tricky, Dawkins will just warn you to pay attention, I loved that, because I was almost falling asleep in a part and then he commented like ''Yes, I know this is boring'' and I couldn't stop laughing. If you ''believe'' (It's not something you believe in, it's the true, but let's use that word) in evolution, or if you feel a bit unsure and want to know the science and proofs behind it, READ THIS BOOK, but if you are too religious, creationist..., and you don't ''believe'' in evolution, neither in science, I don't think this is a book for you (people here have recommended very suitable books).I love Dawkins' irony, attitude, irreverence and sometimes, his arrogance, but at the beginning, he says that the target public of the book is everyone, including religious people, and then he just annoys them and treat them like really stupid people, I think he shouldn't invite religious people to read the book when he is going to lack respect. That's why I gave four stars to this book , I truly loved it, I love Dawkins, I'm atheist but I hate when he does that, I know I'm being moral, but I just couldn't stand that."
137,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2805789-no,5,"I loved this book. I think everyone should read this atleast once and have a copy. It answers so many questions in life, and is 100% proof of evolution. I learned a ton from this book. It was like a roller coaster though, one moment i was fascinated by what i was learning and then the next moment it was reading like a text book and talking about things i didnt understand and had to look up. Few things i went to refresh my memory on or just didnt know about was things like the Piltdown Man, a early unknown human remains hoax. Odontochelys semitestacea, the oldest turtle to have been discovered, and its shell was on the bottom and not the top.Ida Fossil, dated to 47 million years ago, perfect condition.The Cambrian Explosion, this was the seemingly rapid appearance of most major groups of complex animals around 530 million years ago.Archaeopteryx, the earliest and most primitive bird known. They found the fossil of this, amazing picture.Pangaea, when the earth was a supercontinent and very slowly over time spread apart due to plate tectonics and made it so we now have seperate continents. It was interesting how they took the core samples and dated parts of the ocean floor and you can see where its brand new rock and the further you got out the older it gets.This book is full of interesting things, I think i will read it again in a few years."
138,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,4,"This is an excellent presentation on the modern evidence for evolution. Dawkins is a very lucid writer, and he makes a very strong case.One of the better passages is his very detailed description (pg. 116-131) of Lenski's long-running experiment with bacterial cultures. He describes how at or about generation 20,000, one of the cultures starting doing extremely well. Upon examination, this culture had remarkably evolved a biochemical means to process citrate. Due to a very clever scheme for ""tagging"" the many cultures, the result was both compelling and well-documented.One highlight of the book is the three sets of gorgeous color prints. These add greatly to the value of the book.The only qualification I have for giving this book 5 stars is Dawkins' regrettable habit of lapsing into caustic criticism of anyone who does not share his ardent atheism. He is not content to politely demonstrate why the technical arguments of young-earth creationists and ""intelligent design"" writers are unsound. Instead, he must ridicule their position, and that of anyone else who takes religion seriously. Why can't he be even-handed, say like Paul Davies or even Eugenie Scott, whose writings grant that science does not have all the answers? Or at least who recognize that science and religion need to be in conflict?"
139,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201179-daniel-wright,3,"If you want an accessible guide to the vast quantity of evidence for the common descent of species, you could do much worse than this well-written and stimulating book. Dawkins is here (unlike in his dreadful book The God Delusion) on his home ground; he knows exactly what he is talking about and does not pull his punches. He has (finally) worked out that not all theists are dead set against him and is commendably keen to have respectable theologians onside. The science is well-researched, demonstrates his own personal keen interest in the subject, and (as far as I am aware) completely accurate.On the other hand, he makes his sadly customary mistake of being smug and irritating, which is good fun if you agree with him, but there really is no use in preaching to the converted; the tone of this book will not convince anyone who happens to disagree with him, regardless of the weight of the evidence. Dawkins still needs to learn to take a less combative, polemical tone and try to genuinely empathize with his opponents rather than simply write them off as know-nothings (accurate as that may be).For those who are interested in a less aggressive approach to the arguments, the works of Michael Ruse have been recommended to me. I may review one or more of these in good time."
140,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30569007-jos-lu-s-fernandes,4," I read this book a few weeks ago and I clearly hoped for someting better. Dawkins might be a brilliant scientist and there was many fascinating and thought-provoking information but I feel that Dawkins refered many things he shouldn't like some of his attacks on God (evolution through the processes of selection like the natural or sexual selection and God aren't philosophically mutually exclusive) and the creationists (even if pointing flaws in their logic like the ideas of intelligent design or the watchmaker is valid) and many informations about himself (most readers don't care about what Dawkins did in high school when that doesn't add anything to science or even to the story or only care in a biographical and not a scientifical background) He's sometimes also too agressive towards the creationists and even if I understand that the scientists must be firm, determined and sometimes agressive in their iniatives against them in order to avoid public ignorance about the subject of evolution I feel that he is sometimes a fanatic as well. I doubt that most creationists will ""convert"" if they read this book and, as such, if I evaluated this book only by evaluating how its purpose was accomplished I would give it 3 stars, but as Dawkings is a good writer and the informations and proofs he gives here are good he deserves 4 stars."
141,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5919112-daniel-bratell,4,"This is one of those books where I have to differentiate between readability and content.The content, what we know that tells us evolution is right, is very interesting which makes this book well worth reading by someone uncertain or someone that feels they lose out in arguments because they are missing details.The readability on the other hand is not as great. I don't know if it is intentional but the author keeps repeating himself within a couple of paragraphs. It might be an attempt to hammer something into the mind of the reader, but I found it annoying and it reminded me of some books that are written to a page count rather than a content mass.I will still give it four stars out of five since I learned a lot through the book.And a quick spoiler. Things that support evolution include, but are not limited to: Layering of fossils. Dating of fossils. Visible changes in isolated populations in just a few decades. Our ability to modify dogs and cows. The weird mistakes found in body designs. The similarity of species. The lack of similarity between flying mammals (bats) and flying dinosaurs (birds). The weirdness of some animals that seem to have migrated from sea to land and then back to sea. And so on.The author is quite upset that so few people know about this in certain countries and I can understand him."
142,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3870587-lucas-miller,4,"My Audible review:I enjoyed this book a lot. I have a degree in zoology and already know that evolution is true. This book is really intended to give the ""already converted"" with an arsenal of studies, arguments, and evidence when we find ourselves in a debate with someone who believes in creation or ""intelligent design."" There's some really great stuff here; some things I was already familiar with and and some things that were new. I think it would be pretty challenging material for someone who didn't get much past high school biology but rewarding. Not having the visual aids with the audiobook was a bummer and would make it more challenging for a non-scientist. I'm hoping that this book's popularity indicates that the public is embracing evolution at last. There were so many wonderful bits I could detail but I will let you discover for yourself. I do encourage this book to anyone who's even considering this book and obviously you are if you're reading this. I found the ""tag-team"" reading with his wife a bit distracting at times. Dawkins reads most of it (probably 65%) and did an excellent job. His wife's reading worked sometimes and not at others. Not ruinous, in my opinion. Enjoy!  "
143,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4613273-abe,3,"Dawkins felt that he had not written a straight-out evidence-for-evolution book and this fills that gap. Like reading The Origin of Species, I felt honor-bound to educate myself further on this. Probably not the best use of my time.While this was a good book for folks with a marginal knowledge of evolution, I felt as if I was already familiar with most of the concepts discussed. As with Darwin, Dawkins has a wide range of knowledge about creatures great and small, living and long extinct, and he brings this to bear on providing wonderful examples for all of the concepts. And he does a good job of explaining the concepts in broad strokes. Natural selection, sexual selection, human selection, the fossil record, evolution in real-time, and plenty more topics are all discussed at length, and the picture that is painted is complete and elegant.And there are plenty of color pictures!As with any book like this, the ignorant and stupid will not read it, and the intelligent are already on board. But I understand his motivation in writing it; if one is to base one’s life on reason rather than faith, then the evidence that supports the reason must be solid and presented in a permanent fashion such as this book."
144,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583076-sue-smith,3,"I can honestly say that I'm glad I listened to this book on audio (other than missing out on the photos...which they still refered to). If I had read this, it would have taken me forever. It was too much like a textbook and I found my thoughts meandering at various points throughout - only to be brought out of my train of thought by the realization that I was supposed to be 'listening'. Not that those thought side lines did any harm, as I found that they would hash out points to the nth degree and I would just get bored...unless my mind wandered.As a whole, it was an interesting book. I don't have a problem with the idea of evolution, so it was interesting to hear why the author felt he had to write a book about his position. Although I did feel he was rather 'smug' at times and I didn't like the tone of the writing at others. (It was annoying actually). But I guess he felt he 'had' to make his point or points.... as if creationists would actually read his book in the first place. So why he couldn't just write it with that in mind and cut out the constant referrals to 'those creationists', I felt it would have made the book less defensive and less smug. But that could have been me. "
145,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1466603-margaret,2,"This was a gift - I wouldn't have chosen anything by Dawkins because I have tried in the past and his writing is awful. I read the Selfish Gene but couldn't manage more than a few pages of the Blind Watchmaker. Apart from turgid prose, he repeats himself unbearably often and is in serious danger of disappearing up his own backside imho. It's nowhere near as bad as BW but it's not good.I have all the same complaints as the people who have already written reviews. I agree with most of what he says about religion and evolution yet find him extremely annoying - how he ever expects to convert anyone by haranguing them and calling them stupid is one of the great unsolved mysteries of the universe. I don't know for whom this book is intended - he seems to think he's writing it for those who believe in creation by God according to Genesis. I am confident in predicting none of them will bother reading it. If they weren't put off Dawkins already they are unlikely to get past the first chapter. It took me ages to finish because I don't like being lectured at & got bored with all his repetition."
146,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1945673-andreas-rauh,3,"So, if you think life started sometime around 3.5 billion years ago and evolved transforming itself in what we know today as living organisms, then maybe this book isn't for you. You see, it's not that the book itself, the content, or the way the argument is constructed, is bad - quite contrary - but the book wasn't written for you and chances are you'll feel like a moron. Which is not an accident at all, you might be experiencing the symptoms of the creationist fever, a disturbance that affects part of the intended audience. Creationist fever induces hallucinations and a firm, fervor like refusal of scientific evidence of the existence of evolution. Worst, you might experience a paranoid perception of patterns and hidden clues that point to the existence of a great designer that made everything around 10 thousand years ago.If you want solid arguments to back the cause of evolution go for this book. But if you actually still need to argue such a thing I wish you my sympathies, the best of luck and most important, patience my friend, a whole shipload of it. Because it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be, the way things are going, they might crucify yee."
147,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4257677-karl-jennings,5,"Exceptionally well written, this book details the evidence in favor of evolution, as well as explains the methods by which evolution has produced the wide variety of life on our planet. While it is written with the goal of answering specific arguments against evolution put forth mainly by creationists, this book is invaluable for anyone who wants to understand evolution in detail.Far from arguing one side of ""the controversy"", Dawkins shows that there is no controversy. Using evidence from the fossil record, various ""natural clocks"" that mark the timeline of species development, molecular evidence, and evidence from other branches of scientific inquiry, Dawkins builds a scientifically insurmountable case demonstrating the fact of evolution from the first appearance of life to the rich menagerie we see today. Dawkins also demonstrates a strong talent for explaining complex scientific ideas in terms easily accessible to the average reader. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the mechanisms of natural selection and evolution and especially to those who may believe there is still reason to doubt these scientific facts. "
148,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876945-ryan,3,"Dawkins does a great job presenting the overwhelming multitude of evidence for evolution, expected for someone who has devoted his career to being a champion of evolution and crusader of atheism. His eloquent writing style and British humor makes for an enjoyable read even if certain chapters were rather dry for eg when he explained the 'invagination' of cells into more complicated structures in the initial stages of embryo development. His perseverance in churning out yet another volume on this topic is to battle the rising tide of creationism, although I suspect he preaches to the converted as those who read his books are, like me, already on his side. No matter how convincing the logic and reason he invokes, I believe it will do little to alter the strongly held beliefs of the religious, for which logic and reason are ineffective tools against blind faith. And sadly, in an increasingly 'denatured' civilization nature will be pushed further and further away from everyday lives such that there is less interest and willingness to learn about evolution, as opposed to the easy indoctrination of religion."
149,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1784379-jess-cattanach,4,"Richard Dawkins seems to have a way of writing that is fun and easy to read. He explains more complex things, sure, but in a way that doesn’t overwhelm readers who have no scientific background.I picked this book up because I enjoy evolutionary biology and thought it would be fun to read a book on it, rather than a textbook. Dawkins covers a lot of different aspects of evolution, using a lot of different analogies to help explain what he is trying to get across. He uses interesting real-world examples and has a sort of underlying wit that makes the book flow nicely. The statistics listed at the end of the book regarding the amount of people who believe things such as “humans lived at the same time as dinosaurs,” “the world is less than 10,000 years old,” “the earth orbits the sun once a month” and simply deny evolution altogether made me want to weep for humanity. With such easy access to information such as that contained in this book, which requires no scientific background and even just the slightest scrap of intelligence to understand the basic ideas provided within, I don’t understand how people are content with being so ignorant. But I digress. This book is good."

This book will leave you educated about the proof of evolution and how it happens through non-random processes called Natural Selection. Dawkins presents beautiful descriptions of studies from natural life that are so elegant that it might make you want to become a biologist yourself. At least that's what it did form me. We should all grow up and stop believing in supernatural and superstitious nonsense. At the end of Greatest Show on Earth, you will be educated about reality, how things really are and how we KNOW that they really are. approach this book with an open mind and you will close the book a believer in evolution no matter how hard you want to deny it (if you want to deny it). People always say ""teach the controversy, teach the controversy!"" (referring to creation by Intelligent Design VS Evolution) but there really is no controversy. There are thousands of religious creation myths and just one (true) scientific explanation of the origins of life.

It loses the 5th star because he so often gets distracted by haranguing those people who do not believe in evolution (and how many of these are honestly going to read a book by HIM, anyways?) or believing that he can write in some flowing style of prose because he's read some famous work and owns an original edition. When he falls prey to these pitfalls Dawkins comes off as not much more than an annoying wanker, which is a terrible shame, because so much of this book was great. I encourage people to read this book to gain a better appreciation of the wonders of nature. They are truly beautiful, eloquent and poetic; complex in ways most people outside of biology would never have dreamed of and many people in biology never pause to admire, much to their detriment. Whenever Dawkins starts sounding like an ass, skip past until he's come to the end of that ""episode."""

It explains why we are all here, why everything is here! I know some people find evolution threatening, but that's just plain stupid. We, all of us, are not important creatures, we are just flawed primates struggling to understand our place in the World. There's nothing to understand. We, life, just is! Get over it! Richard Dawkins is so clear with the facts, the science, it's not like he is trying to hit people over the head with the fact of evolution, I think he is just astounded that in this the 21st Century there are people who would do anything to deny these facts, to prevent children learning the truth. It is astounding! Truly! But, we live in a strange World! For anyone interested in evolution, science, then this book is for them. For religious people, these creationist and intelligent design folk, not really going to be their kind of read!I found the book amazing! Learning is cool!"
153,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,4,"This is a must read for any literate adult interested in science.The book is a tour de force showing why evolution through Darwin's theory of natural selection is a fact and the notion of intelligent design is absolute nonsense. Even if you are quite well informed in this area you will find the very latest evidence, which Dawkins presents from genetics and molecular biology, fascinating. Dawkins has, of course, written a number of books around this issue, but never strictly to the point of why evolution is a fact and intelligent design is not. The reason for the book he states is that polls show nearly 50% of Americans today believe that evolution is a hoax and the earth is less than 10,000 years old. Jaw dropping ignorance. He also cites polls showing the level of ignorance in Europe is not this high, but that it is rising due he says to the increasing muslim population.So, do not fail to read this book.If you have not already read the ""The Origin of Species"", you must read that first. "
154,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045059-harry,3,"I have a love/hate relationship with Richard Dawkins. The guy is so annoying. But he's also so right. I empathize with his views on science and rationalism, but feel contempt for his compassion-less scoffing and need to show how smart he is. After speed-reading through this book, I'm left with the same old feeling of disliking an ally.This book, which purports to be a summary of the best evidence for evolution, reads a bit like a textbook written by the class valedictorian under the influence of speed. By necessity, Dawkins jumps all around. There's a lot of ground to cover. I found a lot of chapters either too boring to read or I already knew what he was talking about. If you want to know how carbon-14 dating works, Dawkins spends a meaty 20 pages on it. If you want to hear him rhapsodize about a hot biologist's back tattoo for a couple pages, there's that, too.In the end, this is one of those books that sums up too much information in too few pages. Dawkins, however, is more than happy to point you to better reading material. Which I suggest you skip right to."
155,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2366580-bob,4,"Likes: Dawkins-style arguments, with all their characteristic clarity, precision, wit, and supporting evidence. His slow and steady development of context has a strange ability to leave you fascinated with some obscure species that you've never heard of, though not as often in this book as in the Ancestor's Tale. The last chapter, expanding on the closing line from Origin of the Species, is thorough and beautiful, and earns this book a fourth star.Dislikes: The first half of the book is slow and wandering. He confuses the definition of a scientific theory by creating a new, but similar term for the same thing. He weakens some arguments by letting his illustrations get too detailed and lengthy. Oddly, he talks a lot about embryology, but misses the opportunity to use comparative embryology as evidence for evolution. His contention that evolution has no mechanism for blunting biological arms races seems to contradict his hypothesis concerning the evolution of evolvability. And his tone concerning young-earth creationists is, as always, just a little too nasty."
156,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/373589-lindsay-stares,4,"The Greatest Show on Earth is a lovely, careful step-through of the process of evolution via natural selection, an explanation of many of the mountains of evidence supporting it, and a call to solidarity against those who would deny such evidence. On this level alone I recommend this book in the strongest terms.This is the third book I've finished by Dawkins, and by now I'm getting a sense of the hallmarks of his style. They include an easy confidence combined with infectious enthusiasm for his subject, a ready humor tinged with a bit of didacticism, acknowledgment of retread ground, and friendly recognition of criticism with merit.In a sense, this occupies a middle ground between the two previous works I read, with a similar amount of scientific explanation as The Selfish Gene while tempering the righteous anger of The God Delusion to a frustration tinged with hope.Read my entire review on The Blue Fairy's Bookshelf."

For me, this book was a been-there-done-that kind of thing. It was like revisiting all my biology/ecology coursework - really interesting the first time I heard it but now YAWN! I was hoping there might be a discussion about religion but all he does is plug his other book about religion in regards to that (unless I skimmed over it) -so basically it's a big book on why we should all believe evolution. Yep - I already believe in evolution, no reason to read 500 pages about it & it's not like anyone I really know doesn't buy the whole idea so I have no need to ""prove"" it to anyone else. Plus - he irritates me w/ his ""I'm really trying to be a scientist, but I'm actually trying to write this for a non-scientific audience"" style. To make a long story short, this book is going back to the library over the weekend & I'll be finding something a little more interesting to read."
158,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5152368-joe-iacovino,4,"Overall the book is a solid read. I enjoyed the examples for mutation and speciation and really wanted more. I felt that every mention of Creationist dribble was space wasted for actual information. However, Dawkins did not waste too much space with their nonsense but I'm at the point where I am realizing it is the same arguments from that group over and over (from other books, debates, and videos) and I'm simply fatigued. Of course the book left me wanting more but the topic is so broad, with so much evidence, that I can see how it is difficult/ impossible to cover each avenue of evidence in great detail without becoming a set of textbooks. An all around good job though with a very strong end of the last chapter to finish. I would like to see more on genetics from Dawkins as he uses his vocabulary superbly in making that topic very accessible.I do recommend this book be read with Donald Prothero's ""Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters"" as well as Jerry Coyne's ""Why Evolution is True"" as the each fill in some of the details left open here.

You feel that you live in a borrowed time, that...that cow you slaughtered yesterday is a being, with whom you shared an ancensor eons ago, that there are more reasons to unite all of us---human beings and other beings than to divide us, that reality is better than the myths that we erroneously cling to, and that this life is 'it'. Maximize, leave a print, be a future giant, whose shoulders your children's children can stand on --- to be better because there is no other life. Scary isn't it! Well, not if you read the book in it's totality.In ""The greatest show on earth"" Dawkins rationally takes you through facts that proves that evolution is a reality. In the journey, you come to appreciate the wonderful and most beautiful forms you are surrounded with, by no accident, but the direct consequence of evolution by non-random natural selection. It's stimulating to know the how...than take matters as the given and that...sorta chase the scary away :) "
160,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30956623-lorna,5,"This is my first Richard Dawkins but already I am loving him! I read ""The Origin of Species"" not so long ago and that has led me to Richard Dawkins. As much as I love fiction every now and then I read a factual/non fiction book to get the old grey cells working. Dawkins was a great choice. He writes with wit and intelligence about his chosen subject (naturel history and particularly evolution) and with an enthusiasm which is tangible with every tun of the page. What's more his enthusiasm catches and as a reader I'm interested in what he has to say. I feel like I'm gaining a real understanding of the topic and I'm learning something. I liked ""The Origin of Species"" but in reality I read it beuse I felt it was a rite of passage. Dawkins' enthusiasm has made me see the work in a new light. Any author who can make me feel enthusiastic about something and make me want to learn has got to be good in my book. Dawkins gets a big thumbs up from me and I look forward to reading the rest of what he has to offer :)"

Though Dawkins may have softened his attitude toward those who can reconcile their religious beliefs with evolution, he still harbors great hostility toward its detractors, equating them to Holocaust deniers—a label that riled the New York Times Book Review. Objecting to Dawkins's abrasive dogmatism, many critics felt that the biologist is at his best when he forgets his opponents and focuses on the science. He is indeed a master of explaining complex scientific ideas to nonscientific readers, and though The Greatest Show on Earth may not be his best book, it is a well-written, captivating review of the science behind the theory. This is an excerpt of a review published in Bookmarks magazine."
162,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1637858-dave-maddock,4,"Dawkins is at his best when he sticks to facts about science rather than railing against religious folk. Shoot, even when I agree with his criticisms of said folk his tone is often so obnoxious that I tune out. Thankfully, he stays on point for the majority of this book.This book is a gem for those lazy folks you know who are fond of saying ""there is no evidence for evolution"" or ""it's only a theory"", etc. who you know have no clue what evidence may or may not exist. (Had this very conversation with a co-worker just last week...) Sadly, you could buy them a copy but they wouldn't read it since they couldn't even bother to spend 15 minutes to Google 'evolution evidence.'If you are decently educated then you know the broad strokes already, but you will still enjoy Dawkins' descriptions of experiments as well as many of the finer points of embryology and genetics that aren't covered in high school science curricula."
163,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038815-jc,3,"I really like reading Dawkins work, which is why I give this only a three -- he can do so much better. My problem with this book is that it is unfocused. He has some beautiful bits -- very high quality, elegant explanations of evolutionary concepts. And, I can't resist his humor. But, in this work Dawkins kept losing track of his stated audience. Some of the book is very introductory -- maybe 201 course level. And then some parts only a grad student with some background reading could follow. And, it is not like he builds to the more complicated stuff, he kind of goes back and forth in an uneven manner. As his stated purpose is to describe evolution to those who would deny it as fact, I think he would just make anyone like that wonder what he was talking about. Don't get me wrong, much of Greatest Show I really liked, but I don't think he accomplished what, in the introduction, he stated he meant to accomplish. "
164,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2242165-tyler,5,"I don't know why I read this and I don't know why he wrote it. Evolution is so much a part of what we know about the natural world today that denying it sets a person completely outside the realm of science, evidence, and fact. And yet Gallup says 44% of Americans disbelieve in human evolution. (All 32 European countries surveyed score better than us except Turkey, the only Muslim country surveyed.) So I guess there's a need for a book like this.And it was fun to read, the best I've read from Dawkins to date. Cool illustrations, fun facts, interesting anecdotes. And Dawkins stays on point here, bringing the nonbeliever along step by step through artificial selection to natural selection, discussing embryology, geologic time, the so-called ""missing links,"" and directly rebutting all the creationist arguments along the way. Worth reading for the already convinced, and an overdue wake-up call for everyone else."
165,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2897142-joanna,2,"I do acknowledge that evolution is a fact and I did not read this book to get convinced. What I was hoping to get from this book was to get a deeper understanding of the phenomenon, however the book is so badly written that I had to force myself to finish it! The fault does not lie in the difficulty of language – quite the opposite I think Dawkins writing is really accessible – but the narrative which goes back to creationists/ID 'theory' over and over again: this would be helpful if he was introducing some new components of the theory and deconstructing them with argument. What happens instead is that he just gives examples of how ridiculous creationists are (I am not arguing they are not) which just becomes quite boring after being repeated for more than 3 times... I think the book is full of good evidence and gives a nice overview of how thorough and extensive evidence supporting Darwin's theory is but you need to fish out the gist of it from the sea of pointless anecdotes. "
166,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8278205-joshua-flenniken,5,"This book is extremely accessible for anyone who (like me) has an interest in evolution with a rudimentary understanding of biology, chemistry, physics, and geology. Dawkins presents the case for evolution with ruthless logic, understandable examples, useful graphics, wit, and humor. I expected reading this book to be a necessary chore if I wanted to satisfy my curiosity, but rather I found it extremely enjoyable to read, while learning something in the process.I highly recommend reading this book prior to tackling the writings of Darwin (who I enjoy referring to as ""Chuck D."") and Wallace. They were both, of course, visionary pioneers but Dawkins is easier to read with the benefit of being able to cite several more decades of research.I can understand why creationists detest Dawkins so thoroughly. He essentially relegates their argument to repeating, ""Nu-ugh."""
167,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25325044-alienindie,1,"I went in expecting to learn why I should believe in neo-Darwinism instead of the intelligent design hypothesis. What I got instead was some (justified) young-Earth-creationst bashing and some details of modern evolutionary theory either not going beyond basic high school knowledge or being totally trivial to the ID - neo-Darwinism controversy. No debunking of a single sensible intelligent design argument. So whats the purpose of this book? Cashmaking? Michael Behe is still the best and most intellectually honest contemporary author of layman's books about evolution. I would greatly appreciate if all evolutionists didn't think all intelligent design proponents are ""essentially the same thing"" as young Earth creationists. I'm not even religious the slightest bit, and I still cannot stomach neo-Darwinism, purely on rational grounds."
168,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1163723-david,2,"I agree completely with this book's central argument - that evolution is a fact and should be regarded as such - but I'm not sure I'd recommend the book itself, at least not all of it. A self-indulgent aside or footnote (sometimes both) appears on nearly every page, and Dawkins makes the chapters feel disorganized by digressing for pages at a time. I find myself giving brilliant people a lot of leeway with their idiosyncrasies, but I really am surprised this book was published - that it wasn't put through a couple more rounds of editing first. The evidence for evolution that Dawkins presents (between distractions) is compelling - admittedly, I didn't need convincing - but I think at least a third of this book should have been cut before it was released. "
169,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/796306-brandy-bones,4,"thank you dawkins for creating such a great book outlining exactly why evolution is very real and very awesome. However, why do you have to be so dismissive of religion? I know you're an atheist but you are condescending and make your argument less effective every time you dismiss religion or a belief in some higher being as among the stupidest ideas ever. creationism is a stupid and hurtful idea. but a belief that perhaps there is something more out there none of us humans can even begin to understand is not stupid or hurtful and most importantly, not incompatible with the theory of evolution. Every time you diss religion it hurts the book and your worthy message. How do you know how or why it all got started with that first creation of a single celled organism? "
170,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19912493-bahul-jain,4,"Fun, enjoyable and an informative read. While at some moments it seemed more like the author was trying to disprove creationist ideas (in quite a harsh way that too), on the other hand he made some brilliant points to provide evidence for evolution as well. Apart from that, I loved how intricately each and every experiment and observation was explained. What fascinated me the most was the effort the author has made to prove his point by delving deep in various domains such as mathematics, chemistry, biology, geology and paleontology, that too without making it seem like rocket science. Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to someone who is fascinated by science, nature and the amazing things happening on our planet."

Dawkins clearly hopes that the burden of evidence (he culls from an astounding number of sources) will change minds, eloquently and carefully walking readers through the facts. However, with more than 40 percent of Americans rejecting evolution, the book may best serve to strengthen the position of the already converted. "

Dr. Dawkins takes the reader on a journey through evolution and illuminates the mysteries of the universe as only an Oxford scientist can do: spectacularly. Although I disagree with Dr. Dawkins along lines of metaphysics, I admire him greatly as a scientist and biologist. If only the world had the rare combination of Dawkins and Aquinas, or I should say: if only Dawkins would align himself with Aquinas. An evolutionary biologist from Oxford who sides with the possibility of supernatural existence: is that too much to ask? "

Dawkins' passion for his subject comes through clearly in this fascinating book, and although he doesn't break new scientific ground, it is an excellent report on the current state of evolutionary biology.My only quibble is the amount of time Dawkins spends writing responses to the Young Earth Creationist mob's attacks on evolutionary biology. We all know YEC is all about blind faith; there's no need to point out the bleeding obvious. It just gets in the way of getting onto the next fascinating chapter!"

Detailed enough to convince anyone that there is a systematic way in which we understand the history of the earth and the development of species. I knew roughly about the existent theories, but this book was a fascinating way to uncover the details. The photo pages make it quite attractive to see the beautiful sights evolution has led us to. Dawkins gradually uncovers bit by bit the detail to which we are certain about this theory, and that makes it very accessible. A must read!"

I have been skipping some paragraphs as some of them can be summed up in one or two words. Thus far, as far as i have read: he talks about his ""blind watchmaker"" program. Why is it so hard to asusme that like the player of his program, an intelligent designer is...doing something similar.Ill update this later as i read the book.

So, I'd chalk this up as an extremely interesting and intellectual ""preaching to the choir"" book. However, it's amazingly well-written and incredibly well-researched. It teaches you a heckuva lot about the biological history of the planet and about how incontrovertible the evidence for evolution really and truly is. It's a shame really, but you can't combat anti-intellectualism with intellect. In fact, I think a Nobel should go to the first person who figures out exactly how to combat it."

As much as I enjoy the writings of Richard Dawkins, my favorite book on this topic remains Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why it Matters by Donald R. Prothero. With many science branches touching the evidence for evolution or benefiting from the understanding of natural selection, trying to fit it all in one book and make it understandable for the layperson is a tremendous task.

I would be furious if a fellow Christian were that sarcastic of atheists. Let's have a scholarly discussion with each other rather than poking fun.Dawkins also spends much time proving things about natural selection with which creationists agree.

185,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2341498-kelly-nielsen,2,He tries a little too hard to prove his point. He uses precise science mixed with humongous generalizations to prove that anyone who believes in God must not be able to use logic. But his same arguments can easily be used against him.

I found some key errors in his reasoning, which I have always found to be present in those who push evolution as ""fact"". Very often they engage in Anthropic principle style argumentation and in claiming that the target of evolution is whatever happens to survive. The problem with survival as the goal is twofold.Firstly, it always entails an after the fact assessment in relation to whatever happened to survive. Secondly, before the fact, it is totally non-committal as to what it means by survival, rendering predictive content of the theory never specific and direct and always generic and indirect. If you are looking for an empirical observation of evolution by natural selection and survival of the fittest, how is it going to come about if we look at the definition of an ""empirical observation""?On the one side, there can be no empirical confirmation of the concept of something surviving due to evolution, as we define after the fact, whatever survives as what has evolved. There is a definitional dependence here that makes it non-empirical.On the other side, if we want a genuine prediction we must have some definite specified target of evolution agreed upon before the fact, (rather than a mere placeholder term like ""survival"" that only waits to be filled after the fact with what has ""survived"".) But, of course, if we have some target agreed upon before the fact, this would be a design to natural selection guiding the process that is the very thing they are trying to deny in favor of randomness to avoid preemptive projection of purpose on to life processes. In this case there is nothing to observe.So, on the one side evolution is non-empirical and from the other it is non-observable.Of course, this is all just technically speaking. Of course, there is this real process taking place that we largely cannot predict and that for methodological reasons we are well-advised in science to avoid projecting our own designs and sense of purpose on to natural phenomena as it leads to a skewing and misunderstanding of many things. It also can lend to support to the idea of an external, timeless designer of things that prejudges and undermines scientific study of a field.So, for all these methodological reasons, evolution is a good methodology for understanding biological phenomena and their transformations over time. But, if you are going to insist that it be empirically observed as a ""real"", ""factual"" thing you are asking for something impossible that can only lead to a different kind of dogmatism. We don't create models for understanding reality, then expect to observe those models as being the reality itself. This is a confusion of our concepts and models with reality. The fact also remains is that always some placeholder of design is left that is only filled in after the fact. As I say, this is a great methodological device, but it is not something that can be proven true, it is not even trying to be proven true, as it is specifically set up to make itself immune to being falsifiable.In one chapter in the book a claim is made of evolution being observed in the shortening of elephant tusks due to poaching. The over simplification involved here is astounding. Any animal in a threatening environment changes the physiological hormones they release instantly. This is known, basic science. If elephants were in such an environment, as opposed to a happy go lucky environment for them in the past with no predators, then of course, immediately they are going to reduce their production of certain hormones and this would have an effect on things such as tusk length. To me, this is the only explanation for this phenomena, for given elephants lifespan, there is no conceivable way that a natural selection process could have caused the changes observed there that quickly.This was just one example that I found very unconvincing, and I am not even someone who needs to be convinced!Evolution is our best conceptualisation of the process of how life develops and transforms over long time spans. This is agreed. Lets stop over pushing dogmas in line with our religious beliefs, which in this case is the atheistic over push of claiming that all design is an illusion. When we don't know this, and could never possibly know this. What we know is that over long time spans it is critical to not postulate an external design or project any design of our own on to the development of living phenomena, and instead let how they develop and survive speak for itself.Lets have much more of this, letting nature speak for itself, rather than us speaking for it. I think this is the kind of humility people admired in Darwin and the kind of arrogance they find repulsive in a dogmatist like Dawkins, whose final gleeful conclusion would be that all animals act blindly and randomly, and selfishly, no short term targets and designs except after the fact what survived, no credit to any life for getting where it got, except to humans who are left placed on a special pedestal, contemplating morality..."

230,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6326292-boris-limpopo,4,"Dawkins, Richard (2009). The Greatest Show on Earth. New York: Free. 2011. ISBN 9781439164730. Pagine 470. 18.00 $Durante il mese di dicembre del 2009 ho scritto due post (Pensare e studiare e Analogo e omologo) in cui anticipavo che stavo leggendo The Greatest Show on Earth, che stavo accumulando ritardi nelle mie recensioni su questo blog ma che avrei presto recuperato il ritardo. Eccomi qui: più di 2 anni.Naturalmente, non sono più in grado di darvi le mie impressioni a caldo, e siete anche liberi di dubitare che mi ricordi tutti i dettagli del libro.È ormai parecchio tempo che la produzione di Dawkins, anche quella rivolta al pubblico non specialistico, si è via via allontanata dalla frontiera della scoperta scientifica (The Selfish Gene, tanto per capirci, presentava idee piuttosto nuove al di fuori della cerchia degli addetti ai lavori, e infatti fece piuttosto discutere alla sua uscita: ne abbiamo parlato, anche se un po’ obliquamente, a proposito del recente libro di Trivers) per diventare un elegante apologeta delle teorie evoluzionistiche, anche e soprattutto contro l’attacco della destra religiosa americana e dei “creazionisti.”Nei suoi libri precedenti sull’evoluzione – spiega l’autore nella prefazione – si era concentrato su temi quali la proposta di un punto di vista “non familiare” sulla familiare teoria dell’evoluzione (The Selfish Gene e The Extended Phenotype), la rimozione di ostacoli specifici alla comprensione dell’evoluzione stessa, cercando di rispondere a domande del tipo “a che serve mezzo occhio o mezza ala? come può funzionare l’evoluzione, se la maggior parte delle mutazioni sortisce effetti negativi?” (The Blind Watchmaker, River Out of Eden e Climbing Mount Improbable) e un pellegrinaggio chauceriano alla ricerca dei nostri antenati (The Ancestor’s Tale), in tutti i casi e sempre dando per scontati il fatto e la verità dell’evoluzione. In questo libro, Dawkins spiega che quella evoluzionistica non è “solo una teoria”, ma un fatto incontrovertibile: This book is my personal summary of the evidence that the ‘theory’ of evolution is actually a fact – as incontrovertible a fact as any in science. [p. vii]Dawkins stesso illustra molto bene il senso del suo libro in questa (lunga) intervista rilasciata in occasione dell’uscita del libro:Come sempre con Dawkins, la lettura è appassionante anche se – a tratti – l’argomentazione è meno densa che in precedenti occasioni. Ma non saprei dire, sinceramente, se la stanchezza è la mia o la sua.Non aggiungo altro di mio se non una serie di passi che (ormai oltre 2 anni fa) mi ero segnato. Vi invito a leggerli, però, questa volta, perché così vi renderete conto di come continuino a brillare la sua argomentazione scintillante e il suo talento per la spiegazione. Plants have an energy economy and, as with any economy, trade-offs may favour different options under different circumstances. That’s an important lesson in evolution, by the way. Different species do things in different ways, and we often won’t understand the differences until we have examined the whole economy of the species. [p. 49] Lenski’s research shows, in microcosm and in the lab, massively speeded up so that it happened before our very eyes, many of the essential components of evolution by natural selection: random mutation followed by non-random natural selection; adaptation to the same environment by separate routes independently; the way successive mutations build on their predecessors to produce evolutionary change; the way some genes rely, for their effects, on the presence of other genes. [p. 130] It is hard to measure degrees of resemblance. And there is in any case no necessary reason why the common ancestor of two modern animals should be more like one than the other. If you take two animals, say a herring and a squid, it is possible that one of them resembles the common ancestor more than the other, but it doesn’t follow that this has to be the case. There has been an exactly equal amount of time for both to have diverged from the ancestor, so the prior expectation of an evolutionist might be, if anything, that no modern animal should be more primitive than any other. we might expect both of them to have changed to the same extent, but in different directions, since the time of the shared ancestor. [...] Notice especially that ‘primitive’ in the sense of ‘resembling ancestors’ does not have to go with ‘simple’ (meaning less complex). A horse’s foot is simpler than a human foot (it has only a single digit instead of five, for example), but the human foot is more primitive (the ancestor that we share with horses had five digits, as we do, so the horse has changed more). [p. 157] In animals, unlike bacteria, gene transfer seems almost entirely confined to sexual congress within species. Indeed, a species can pretty well be defined as a set of animals that engage in gene transfer among themselves. [...] My colleague Jonathan Hodgkin, Oxford’s Professor of Genetics, knows of only three tentative exceptions to the rule that gene transfer is confined within species: in nematode worms, in fruit flies, and (in a bigger way) in bdelloid rotifers. This last group is especially interesting because, uniquely among major groupings of eucaryotes, they have no sex. Could it be that they have been able to dispense with sex because they have reverted to the ancient bacterial way of exchanging genes? [p. 303] [...] two organs – for example, bat hand and human hand – are homologous if it is possible to draw one on a sheet of rubber and then distort the rubber to make the other one. Mathematicians have a word for this: ‘homeomorphic’. Zoologists recognized homology in pre-Darwinian times, and pre-evolutionists would describe, say, bat wings and human hands as homologous. If they had known enough mathematics, they would have been happy to use the word ‘homeomorphic’. In post-Darwinian times, when it became generally accepted that bats and humans share a common ancestor, zoologists started to define homology in evolutionary terms. Homologous resemblances are those inherited from a shared ancestor. The word ‘analogous’ came to be used for resemblances due to shared function, not ancestry. [pp. 312-313] The often-quoted figure of about 98 per cent for the shared genetic material of humans and chimps actually refers neither to numbers of chromosomes nor to numbers of whole genes, but to number of DNA ‘letters’ (technically, base pairs) that match each other within the respective human and chimp genes. [p. 318] A new mutation, if it is genuinely new, will have a low frequency in the gene pool. If you revisit the gene pool a million years later, it is possible that the mutation will have increased in frequency to 100 per cent or something close to it. If that happens, the mutation is said to have ‘gone to fixation’. [...] The obvious way for a mutation to go to fixation is for natural selection to favour it. But there is another way. It can go to fixation by chance [...] , given a large enough number of generations. And geological time is vast enough for neutral mutations to go to fixation at a predictable rate. The rate at which they do so varies, but is characteristic of particular genes, and, given that most mutations are neutral, this is precisely what makes the molecular clock possible. [p. 335] When we are talking about natural selection, we think in terms of rare beneficial mutations turning up and being positively favoured by selection. But most mutations are disadvantageous, if only because they are random and there are many more ways of getting worse than there are ways of getting better. Note: This is especially true of mutations of large effect. Think of a delicate machine, like a radio or a computer. Al large mutation is equivalent to kick it with a hobnailed boot, or cutting a wire at random and reconnecting it in a different place. It just might improve its performance, but it is not very likely. A small mutation, on the other hand, is equivalent to making a tiny adjustment to, say, one resistor, or to the tuning knob of a radio. The smaller the mutation, the more closely the probability of improvement approaches 50 per cent. [p. 352] In a typical mature forest, the canopy can be thought of as an aerial meadow, just like a rolling grassland prairie, but raised on stilts. The canopy is gathering solar energy at much the same rate as a grassland prairie would. But a substantial proportion of the energy is ‘wasted’ by being fed straight into the stilts, which do nothing more useful than loft the ‘meadow’ high in the air, where it picks up exactly the same harvest of photons as it would – at far lower cost – if it were laid flat on the ground. And this brings us face to face with the difference between a designed economy and an evolutionary economy. in a designed economy there would be no trees, or certainly no very tall trees: no forest, no canopy. Trees are a waste. Trees are extravagant. Tree trunks are standing monuments to futile competition – futile if we think in terms of a planned economy. But the natural economy is not planned. Individual plants compete with other plants, of the same and other species, and the result is that they grow taller and taller, far taller than any planner would recommend. Not indefinitely taller, however. There comes a point when growing another foot taller, although it confers a competitive advantage, costs so much that the individual tree doing it actually ends up worse off than its rivals that forgo the extra foot. It is the balance of costs and benefits to the individal trees that finally determines the height to which trees are press to grow, not the benefits that a rational planner could calculate for the trees as a group. And of course the balance ends up at a different maximum in different forests. The Pacific Coast redwoods (see them before you die) have probably never been exceeded. Imagine the fate of a hypothetical forest – let’s call it the Forset of Friendship – in which, by some mysterious concordat, all the trees have somehow managed to achieve the desiderable aim of lowering the entire canopy to 10 feet. The canopy looks just like any other forest canopy except that it is only 10 feet high instead of 100 feet. From the point of view of a planned economy, the Forest of Friendship is more efficient as a forest than the tall forests with which we are familiar, beacause resources are not put into producing massive trunks that have no purpose apart from competing with other trees. But now, suppose one mutant tree were to spring up in the middle of the Forest of Friendship. This rogue tree grows marginally taller than the ‘agreed’ norm of 10 feet. Immediately, this mutant secures a competitive advantage. Admittedly, it has to pay the cost of the extra length of the trunk. But it is more than compensated, as long as all other trees obey the self-denying ordinance, because the extra photons gathered more than pay the extra cost of lengthening the trunk. Natural selection therefore favours the genetic tendency to break out of the self-denying ordinance and grow a bit taller, say to 11 feet. As the generations go by, more and more trees break the embargo on height. When, finally, all the trees in the forest are 11 feet tall, they are all worse off than they were before: all are paying the cost of growing the extra foot. But they are not getting any extra photons for their trouble. And now natural selection favours any mutant tendency togrow to, say, 12 feet. And so the trees go on getting taller and taller. Will this futile climb towards the sun ever come to an end? Why not trees a mile high, why not Jack’s beanstalk? The limit is set at the height where the marginal cost of growing another foot outweighs the gain in photons from growing that extra foot. We are talking individual costs and benefits throughout this argument. The forest would look very different if its economy had been designed for the benefit of the forest as a whole. In fact, what we actually see is a forest in which each tree species evolved through natural selection favouring individual trees that out-competed rival individual trees, whether of their own or another species. [pp. 378-380]"
231,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"Dawkins makes an evidence-based case for evolution against creationists and Intelligent Design advocates, whom he calls “history deniers.” The book is written for laypeople, but provides enough scientific detail to make his points. This book augmented my understanding of how natural selection (which I accept) leads to evolution (which I accept to an extent; I don’t accept that there's a “single tree of life”). I read it because I’m a creationist and wanted to increase my familiarity with the arguments against creationism. This book did just that, and prompted further questions. My rating is based on the fact that I found the book informative and interesting, not because I agree with all its contents.My main complaint is that Dawkins mocks creationists (mostly Christians, but he mentions Muslims too) for their religious beliefs, but but he overlooks key beliefs that shape their understanding of life, such as that God created the universe in a mature state, and that the Fall (humanity's fall into sin) negatively affected life on Earth. Obviously Dawkins would at such beliefs; my point is simply that if he’s going to attack a belief system, he should represent it accurately. Surprisingly, Dawkins doesn’t bash his opponents nearly as hard in this book as he does in The God Delusion (my review).Dawkins points out apparent faults in modern creatures, saying, “eyes and nerves, sperm tubes, sinuses and backs are poorly designed...” and calls the human eye “the design of a complete idiot.” He jokes about “unintelligent design.” He later points to pain and suffering as evidence for the lack of an intelligent designer (at least a beneficent one), joking that God made cheetahs to be “killing machines”. Such arguments about faulty designs and suffering ignore the belief that life on Earth was negatively altered by the curse that resulted from humanity’s fall into sin. All creatures that have ever existed since the Fall are fundamentally different from God’s original creations, which He called good.Genesis 3:17ff records changes such as thorns and thistles, and presumably other unpleasant things, that came about as a consequence of humanity’s fall into sin. See also Romans 8:18ff. God didn’t create any creatures as “killing machines”, because death wasn’t part of the original creation.Dawkins also mocks creationists for believing that all modern species were created by God. I don’t believe that the Bible teaches or requires such a belief; Genesis doesn’t record all the creatures that were originally created, it simply lists broad kinds (plants, trees, birds, creatures of the sea, wild animals, etc.). Even for those creatures that are named, we don’t know their species or anything about their genomes. Humans are named as an original creation (Genesis 3:27) unique from the other creatures, but we don’t know how much humans have changed from that original design, after passing through the Fall and generations of genetic change.I don’t recall Dawkins addressing the belief that God created a mature and fully-functioning universe, which would render long-term dating methods inaccurate (look up the ""Appearance of Age Theory""). This is probably because he considers such a belief preposterous.At one point, Dawkins uses the development of the human embryo in the womb to show that it’s not difficult for a single cell to become a human, and uses this to defend the theory that humans evolved from single-celled organisms. I found this to be a stretch, since a human zygote contains already contains the genetic information necessary for the “construction” of the human body.Dawkins says “we have no evidence” about the origin of life, only hypotheses. Below are my notes from the book, without any commentary from me. Below that are the questions this book raised in my mind.Notes	• Evolutionary change is too slow for us to notice, like the movement of tectonic plates.	• In the subtitle to On the Origin of Species, which is The preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life, “race” means “creatures possessing a certain allele”, not races within humanity.	• Natural selection means that “every gene pool, in every species, tends to become filled with genes for making superior equipment for survival and reproduction.”	• “Artificial selection is not just an analogy for natural selection...[it] constitutes a true experimental...test of the hypothesis that selection causes evolutionary change.”	• Natural selection doesn’t lead to perfection in all areas. “Perfection in one department must be bought, in the form of a sacrifice in another department.” Creatures have limited resources, and there’s no such thing as a free lunch.	• Not all genes necessarily have survival value. Some are pleiotropically linked to genes that do have survival value.	• No fossil remotely resembling a mammal has been found in Devonian rock or any older stratum. No trilobites are found above the Permian, and no dinosaurs above the Cretaceous.	• Several different radioactive clocks converge on the age of Earth at 4.6 billion years.	• “Natural selection often acts to shift the balance of existing variation, rather than waiting for key mutations to turn up.”	• In Richard Lenski’s experiments, new information entered the E. coli genome: the ability to feed on citrate.	• Bacteria have evolved resistance to almost every antibiotic developed since World War II.	• “No modern species is descended from any other modern species;” they simply share ancestors. Humans aren’t descended from monkeys, they share a common ancestor.	• “Every creature that has ever been born would have been classified...as...exactly the same species as its parents and its children.” It’s only with hindsight that classification into distinct species, genera, etc. becomes possible.	• “Natural selection doesn’t need to understand why a genetic change has a certain consequence...If that consequence affects survival, the changed gene itself will stand or fall in the competition to dominate the gene pool.”	• “The development of the embryo, and ultimately of the adult, is achieved by local rules implemented by cells, interacting with other cells on a local basis...There is no overall plan of development, no blueprint...no architect.”	• Speciation occurs when isolated gene pools become too different for combined genomes to produce fertile offspring.	• Genetic comparisons of many species indicate a single tree of life.	• Fixation is when a new mutation increases to 100% (or nearly) in a gene pool. By comparing the genes that have become fixed in two species, we can estimate how recently they split apart.	• “Most mutations are disadvantageous...Natural selection promptly penalizes the bad mutations.” However, depending on environment or other factors, deleterious mutations are not penalized and spreads. Example: blind eyes in troglobites (creatures that live in total darkness).	• Evolution doesn’t contradict the Second Law of Thermodynamics (entropy increases in an isolated system) because the Sun feeds energy into Earth’s systems.QuestionsHere are the questions I thought of while reading, and links to some possible answers I found.Q: How do creationists explain ages measured by dendrochronology (the tree ring record)?A: Answers in Genesis, Institute for Creation ResearchQ: How do creationists explain the absence of mammal fossils below a certain point in the fossil record?A: Answers In Genesis, Answers In Genesis, Institute for Creation ResearchQ: How do creationists explain the age of Earth measured by radioactive dating?A: Answers In Genesis, Answers In Genesis, Answers In Genesis, Institute for Creation ResearchQ: How do creationists explain Richard Lenski’s experiments, where new information entered the E. coli genome?A: Institute for Creation Research, Answers In Genesis, Answers In GenesisQ: How do creationists explain genetic comparisons that indicate a single tree of life?A: Answers In Genesis, Institute for Creation Research, Institute for Creation Research, Institute for Creation Research"
232,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46538050-lance,3,"""Nobody, reading the sequence of letters in the DNA of a fertilised egg, could predict the shape of the animal it is going to grow into. The only way to discover that is to grow the egg""I really enjoyed reading ""The Greatest Show on Earth"". There is something of the childhood excitement of discovering the weird logic of evolution and all the diverse forms within the kingdoms of life which seeps through Dawkins' narrative. I enjoy all the tangents and examples, which add novelty to even those with some formal training in molecular biology.The structure of the book follows many of the arguments made by Darwin himself in his legendary treatise ""On the Origin of Species"". Dawkins shows an erudite breadth of historical and contemporary knowledge of evolutionary science, which he densely packs into a formidable argument for evidence-based evolution. The opening chapters regarding domestication by artificial selection is adapted from the beginning of Darwin's own argument, and introduces the reader fairly gently into the concept of selective breeding for traits with familiar species from agriculture, after explaining the different meanings unhelpfully associated with the word ""theory"". This is rather basic for someone with a background in natural sciences, but still makes for an interesting historical passage. Dawkins interfaces the narrative with some of his own artificial selection computer programmes. It's a shame there's no mention of these being publicly available in the book. Computational/simulational biosciences is well-represented in this book. Although I do not believe that these elegant programmes constitute evidence for evolution in the strictest sense, I think these elements are relatively unique to Dawkins' writing and add a diversion for those familiar with artificial selection arguments.For me, the chapters surrounding ""Before our Very Eyes"" was one of the stand-out elements of this book. I marvelled at the account of Belyaev's silver foxes which in only 45 generations transformed into black-and-white, floppy-eared, biannual reproducers following selection only for tameness of pups. I was pleased to see another of Darwin's personal favourites, the weirdly shaped orchid flowers, getting such detailed treatment, especially as the bizarre contorted shapes of these flowers are spectacularly resolved in the light of their diverse special relationships with pollinators. Island lizards developing coecal valves in only 37 years? Guppies changing their spots depending on whether that had to hide from predators or show off for mates? I enjoyed the epic tale of Professor Lenski's 400,000 generations of E. Coli developing in a limited-glucose environment too, especially alongside the detailed reconstruction of cell culture technique. However, I do think one rather remarkable example would have greatly improved the credibility of this argument. In 2006, Davidson et al. published a remarkable paper proposing that only one change in locality of gene expression was required to generated two heart chambers in the normally one-chambered sea squirt larvae. A who new chamber and a step towards the heart of a genuine vertebrate such as a fish in only one generation! That really would be right before our eyes. This section was a little distractingly interrupted by a chapter on radioactive isotope dating, which should really have been an appendix as the assumed level of science was much lower than throughout the rest of the book. Although I do believe this is a very interesting scientific achievement, and helps greatly with dating fossils, I think Dawkins' diversion towards showing how carbon-14 dating invalidated the credulity of the Turin shroud was a little much given that he is hoping to convince those of a strong religious background.The next few chapters are mainly concerned with the fossil evidence. Although there are some beautiful pictures of fossils, I think that the fossil argument is mainly aimed towards hard-core young earth creationists as most secular school children would not deny the fossil record. This section is entertaining for an evolutionist (""Show us your crocoducks!""), and the detailed treatment of ancestral human fossils is an important piece of cultural history, but I'm not sure if the fossil record alone will be enough to convince anyone. It might have been better just to lay out the evidence, rather than citing specific creationist misunderstandings of the fossil record which oddly gives credit to these arguments by employing a serious academic to discuss these.Excitingly, Dawkins then goes on to discuss embryology! As a developmental neuroscientist myself, I was really excited to see embryology receive a whole chapter in its own right in a popular science book! I think Dawkin's explanation that no ""master plan"" or ""homunculus"" is needed to coordinate embryonic development is an important illumination, as most natural science undergraduates have very litre knowledge of these processes prior to university study. The inner development geek in me was extremely excited to see gastrulation and neurulation treated in a popular book at all, these are early processes by which the embryo undergoes folding to achieve a ""tubular"" shape in the first few days of development. He also evoked several computational simulations of these processes to explain that differential cell division can account for much of these early processes. However, the ""sophisticated"" bit of embryonic development is treated more vaguely. If I had been writing this chapter, I would have included some early experiments to show clearly the influence of local chemical guidance cues on embryonic development. For example in the early 1990s many chemoattractant molecules were discovered to divert the path taken by growing neurons in a dish, and this has now been replicated in whole animals in vivo. Another two essential embryology stories relevant to evolution which I would have had to include! One is Von Baer's 1800 observation that animal embryos appear to go through stages of looking like an earlier ancestor before developing into their final form. For example, early human embryos bear a striking resemblance to developing fish, right down to the ""pharyngeal arches"" which are remnants of gills, travelling through reptile-like anatomy before becoming obviously mammalian later in development. Although Dawkin's does briefly touch on this, the implications are huge. Von Baer initially (wrongly) supposed that human embryos ""become"" fish for a short period of development, rather than just strongly resembling them. We now now that the conserved early embryonic forms occur in so many animal species because these are highly successful forms for general growth of the body plan, which then can be specialised later in development. This would have tied well into Dawkin's argument that evolution has no ""drawing board"" that can be used to generate animal independently of their immediate ancestors but has to work with the previous model to generate a new specialised form. Another topic only glanced upon is the amazing body-organising genes known as the Hox-genes. The Hox genes are mentioned with regards to the conserved body-plan of many animals, however their mutations are also incredibly cool and could potentially explain the origins of different classes of animal such as the centipedes duplicating thorax segments to diverge from an insect-like body plan. In 1935, Spemann was awarded a Nobel prize for the amazing discovered of the ""organiser"" within the early salamander embryo. On grafting a second organiser onto a normal embryo, the salamander grew a second, fully-functional head! The organiser is now know to be specified by Hox genes. Exmaples such as this are important for demonstrating the power of body-plan genes and the huge difference that any mutation can make in these. Right, embryology rant over.One consideration is that I am still not quite sure who the target audience of this book is. There are several strong elements of assumed knowledge on the reader's part, especially with regards to the chemical nature of DNA and the meaning of concepts key to understanding evolution such as a ""gene"" and a ""mutation"". This level of assumed knowledge suggests that the reader should have some background in the natural sciences (A-level at least, but some of the details extend beyond any school syllabus). Yet this contrasts with Dawkins' stated intent of trying to arm non-specialist evolutionists with arguments, and also to better educate creationists and other anti-evolutionists. I know it must be boring for an expert such as Dawkins' to hash out the basics of DNA structure and function in each of his many popular books, however, I do think that the accessibility of this volume would have been greatly increased by an appendix explaining some of the concepts which the main narrative assumes prior knowledge. Overall, there were many interesting scientific and historical conversations points in this book, which I will enjoy discussing with my beautiful and intelligent husband. Although I would like Dawkins to write the book again, but just about embryology (kidding! ... maybe), I think it is a valuable addition to my popular science read0list."
233,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9809633-matthew,5,"In an ideal world a book such as The Greatest Show on Earth would never have been written. However this is not an ideal world, and so the book has become deplorably necessary. As Richard Dawkins points out, a depressingly large amount of the population of the world continue to deny evolution, and to insist on absurd and ignorant views that suggest that all life on earth appeared spontaneously, possibly just a few thousand years ago.In the face of such wilful ignorance, Dawkins seeks to outline all the evidence to support the theory of evolution, and sure enough there is enough to fill over 400 pages, and this is giving only the most cursory summary of much of it.Each chapter looks at a different area. The first chapter dismisses the idea that evolution is ‘just a theory’ by explaining in scientific terms what a theory means. For the second chapter, Dawkins gives examples of artificial selection, where humans have themselves adapted animals and plants to suit their own needs or preferences as a basis for arguing that nature has done the same. Charles Darwin started from a similar point in The Origin of the Species.Dawkins continues by looking at macro-evolution (Chapter 3), how we date the passage of time (Chapter 4), examples of evolution that we have witnessed through observation and testing (Chapter 5), the fossil record and myth of the missing link (Chapter 6), human evolution (Chapter 7), the development of the human body (Chapter 8), plate tectonics (Chapter 9), the relationship between humans and other animals as demonstrated by similarities in bone structure among other things (Chapter 10), the defunct and dysfunctional aspects of evolution that undermine the claim we are intelligently designed (Chapter 11) and the evolutionary arms race (Chapter 12). A final chapter offers a breakdown of a famous Darwin quote, and how far it stands up today.Dawkins’ book is erudite, and full of his passion for biology and for Darwin. It is written as clearly as it can be (as a non-scientist I struggle at times), but the arguments are presented in no-nonsense terms. For people who like Dawkins the scientist better than Dawkins the atheist, this work will please better than The God Delusion.Will it do any good? Perhaps not. To some extent, a book of this kind is preaching to the converted. Dawkins acknowledges as much when he quotes exchanges between himself or others and creationists, in which the creationists continue to deny and get angry with the evolutionists no matter how much evidence is presented. However while the book may not persuade diehard creationists, it will comfort the more sensible part of the population, and perhaps convince a few waverers. To read a book is to get a foggy sense of the real evidence since we only have here a book telling you that it is there. However only the most dogmatic of anti-evolutionists can possibly believe that all scientists are in a conspiracy to promote evolution.Of course many religious people do now accept a limited belief in evolution, but only on the understanding that the process was guided by a creator. The Greatest Show on Earth does a good job of showing how even this thinking is foolish. The anatomical structure of humans and animals are not done in a way that is consistent with efficiency or ease, and look like the add-ons of evolution trying to find a difficult way round the problems of earlier developments.Some see Dawkins as a bully for his robust advocacy of evolution and atheism, but I am not one. He expresses his opinions firmly, but in a manner that is free of childish abuse. If he was discussing an opposing political opinion, he would probably be thought polite.However we live in a world where religion has distorted the debate, and religious believers are far more sensitive about their tenets than political believers, perhaps because those beliefs hold an even thinner foundation underneath. There is little reason to be frustrated with strong criticism of one’s cherished beliefs unless your opponent is being obtuse, or unless you secretly sense that your own position is not a strong one.For this reason, The Greatest Show on Earth continues to be an important book in a debate that is raging over an issue that should no longer be a question."
234,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70019675-cliff-ward,5,"As I was reading this book planet earth was following it's orbit around the sun as it had obediently done for nearly five billion years. It was moving at at a stunning speed of sixty-six thousand miles an hour actively creating the four seasons on it's way while at the same time revolving on it's axis at a thousand miles an hour, turning east to west, and this produced night and day.It takes eight minutes for light to even reach the earth from the sun and there are two to four hundred billion such stars just in our Milky Way. It's been estimated there are another billion gallaxies beyond. So how was it the universe was created some fourteen billion years ago? We know that the elements which made life possible were forged within the explosions of an earlier super-nova. The essential building blocks of life would not exist otherwise.How was it that a single life cell was created somewhere in those early seas in warm water under unique conditions some four billion years ago? What made the genetic sixty-four, three letter word code which mixed with proteins to become the first life? When we try to look back at this we discover if we trace our family tree, if we try to shake hands with our oldest know relatives, but then keep going, millions of generations, we will eventually be shaking hands with a fish.Beyond that fish, the invertebrate, until almost back to the beginning of time we were all the same stardust.This is the arguement Richard Dawkings pitches against the Creationists. Those who believe the earth was created 6000 years ago. Dawkins has made it his life passion to argue with Creationists and in this book he puts together his evidence for Darwins Theory of Evolution. He explains how nature can be dated through various methods such as tree rings and carbon-14 half-lives and how some 165M years ago the continential drifting of earths plates started to turn the Gondwana continent into most of the land mass we are familiar with today. 400 million years ago life emerged from the sea. Just 6 million years ago there were no humans and no apes, but a common ancestor was running around which would be the seed to both. 2 million years ago Homo Erectus, then something like humans 100,000 years past, possibly the annilation of our Neandethal brothers and then the charge of Homo Sapiens to take over the whole planet some 40,000 years ago.Dawkings spends ample time showing the links between the animals through adaptions in DNA. The skeleton of the bat, the nerves in the neck of a girrafe, the swim bladders of fish which became lungs on land and the blowhole of a dolphin which was previously a nose before those mammals returned from land to the oceans.Nature is beautiful but even though it has not evil intentions it is incredibly cruel. The lion chases and then eats it's prey alive, the spider which wraps the honey bee, or the Ichneumon wasp which captures a cattapillar, keeps it alive, and allows it's young to nourish on the living body. So much information. So much to reflect on. What does this means for us today? We have the opportunity to rise above the cruelties of nature; or do we? This is a profound question. This is an incredible book that I could just not put down. Some of the scientific explanations, as Dawkins warns the reader, 'take the book somewhere quiet and focus' - 'don't read this part while your tired or you just won't understand it'! He is often very funny in his explanations and side stories, clearly intended to give relief to the poor individual trying to grasp a techinical concept. My only criticism is his tendency to always go back to the Creationist and how what they believe cannot possibly be true. Despite all the science which I immesly enjoyed, Dawkins seems to fail to grasp the fact that people need belief and they need faith. Science doesn't give us all the answers, not even all the technical answers, and more importantly it can't tell us about the purpose of our lives and why we are here. For that we do need still to come back to the theologians and the philosophers. "
235,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2875060-brad-belschner,3,"My favorite part in the entire book was a delightful poem by Burt Leston Taylor on page 306, regarding the 'second brain' some dinosaurs had near the end of their spines:Behold the mighty DinosaurFamous in prehistoric lore,Not only for his weight and strengthBut for his intellectual length.You will observe by these remainsThe creature had two sets of brains--One in his head (the usual place),The other at his spinal base.Thus he could reason a prioriAs well as a posteriori.No problem bothered him a bit;He made both head and tail of it.So wise he was, so wise and solemn,Each thought filled just a spinal column.If one brain found the pressure strongIt passed a few ideas along;If something slipped his forward mind'Twas rescued by the one behind;And if in error he was caughtHe had a saving afterthought.As he thought twice before he spokeHe had no judgments to revoke;For he could think, without congestion,Upon both sides of every question.Oh, gaze upon this model beast,Defunct ten million years at least.Fun aside, I wouldn't give this book to somebody skeptical of evolution. It fails to be persuasive in that regard, due to Dawkins' arrogant attitude and lack of engagement with specific YEC issues. Nevertheless, if you are already persuaded of evolution then it's an entertaining book. Dawkins has an elegant and fun writing style here, believe it or not. The book is filled with fun details and arguments like these:-Koala pouches are upside down, meaning that their babies constantly risk falling out and plummeting to their deaths! The reason for this is that Koalas evolved from wombats, whose pouches were backwards due to their constant digging (it kept dirt from entering the pouch).-Trees are tall due to competition for resources; it's a forestry arms race!-The Giraffe laryngeal nerve is *several meters long*, travelling from the skull, down through the entire neck, and back up to the skull, all in order to reach a location that was only a few centimeters from its origin. It's brilliant, hilariously poor 'design'. See here for more details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO1a1...-Geographic distribution of species is a problem for young earthers: why are there ONLY marsupials in Australia? Surely one placental mammal would make it there. Why are there sloths ONLY in the Americas? Surely there should be one sloth somewhere else. Etc. -Faunal succession is another problem for young earthers: why are there NO exceptions to the law of faunal succession? Where are there NEVER any mammals below a certain layer? Why are dolphins and aquatic dinosaurs never found in the same layers? Why are bats and pterosaurs never found in the same layers? Etc.There are also occasional fun anecdotes in the book, like this one on page 190:""Unlike diseases, which are often named after their discoverers, new species are named by their discoverers but never after themselves. It is a nice opportunity for a biologist to honour the name of another, or, as in this case, a benefactor. Not surprisingly, my distinguished colleague the late W.D. Hamilton was several times honoured in this way. Arguably one of Darwin’s greatest successors of the twentieth century, he had a lugubrious manner reminiscent of A. A. Milne’s Eeyore (not the deplorable Walt Disney version, of course). Hamilton was once on a small boat on an expedition up the Amazon when he was stung by a wasp. Knowing what a great entomologist he was, his companion said, 'Bill, do you know the name of that wasp?' 'Yes,' Bill murmured gloomily in his most Eeyoreish voice. 'As a matter of fact it’s named after me.'""Overall, 3 stars. I had fun reading it and learning more, but ultimately this book fails at what it sets out to do."
236,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32553593-elliott-bignell,5,"There have been a number of excellent reviews of the undeniable (but heavily denied) freight of evidence for evolution in recent years, so the question that may spring to mind is, ""Why read this one?"" Well, it cannot be denied (but will be) that the mere fact that Richard Dawkins himself wrote it will predispose many to read it. I do not want to discourage you from this as Dawkins is undeniably (but not according to some) the greatest populariser of evolutionary science alive today, perhaps of science per se. His writing merits attention. However, this book sells itself on its considerable merits.Before I seek to enumerate them, did anyone notice a theme of deniability running through that first paragraph? Well, it is not a coincidence, as this book owes a great deal to the incoming tide of science-denial that sadly made it necessary to write it. Dawkins opens and closes the book with passages on the prevalence of the denial of evolution, likening his position as an educator to a history teacher coping with persistent heckling by a minority who disrupt classes on antiquity to deny that the Romans existed, or classes on the Second World War with denial of the holocaust. I can only sympathise, as the thread of science denial is all too obvious today and increasingly makes it impossible to discuss science productively, whether evolution, fertility control and prophylaxis or anthropogenic warming. The willingness of a section of society to deny evolution is particularly damning as the weight of evidence which Dawkins sketches is truly prodigious, and in the age of cheap DNA sequencing is becoming a deluge. The position of Young Earth Creationism - frighteningly prevalent and becoming more so - is even more untenable as it seeks to impose a chronology that would require overturning almost all of the physical sciences.Dawkins wrote this book to fill a lacuna that he thought still to be open in his writing. He has written of gene selfishness and the mathematical basis for the neo-Darwinian synthesis, he has written a biography of our entire evolutionary history, he has written of the wonder of science and the blunder of theistic religion and creationism. He had not, to date, written a book reviewing the reasons why evolution is true, simply treating it as a priori fact. This book serves to correct that perceived deficiency and presents Dawkins' account of the evidence.The evidence comes from a range of lines of inquiry which Dawkins examines in turn. Taking a cue from Darwin, he devotes a chapter to sketching out the effects of artificial selection and the astonishing rapidity with which domestic animals have been squirted along developmental pathways in a few generations or tens of generations to yield results barely recognisable as the original species. He then addresses the notion of ""Deep Time"" and the dating methods and inferences which leave no question but that the time available for natural selection is not mere millennia but millions of millennia. (This evidence is crucial to the debate on young-Earth creationism, because to insist on a biblical timescale is not to reject evolution but to reject geology, cosmology, the physics of nuclear radiation and virtually all of the physical sciences.)He proceeds to examples of evolution happening ""Before Our Eyes"", of which there are now many, many documented examples. Particularly topical is the Lenski team's disciplined and inspired study over 20 years of cultures of E. coli bacteria, in which an audit trail of the population genetics was fixed every single day and evolution observed in vitro with a detailed record of its course. Many other field studies have demonstrated evolution outside the lab, and Dawkins enumerates some of these, including a study of a Podarcis lizard population in which changes in jaw and skull shape and the emergence of new structures in the intestines tracked a change to a more vegetarian diet.He then explodes the myth of the ""missing"" link, following up with a study of the specific links available in the recent lineage of our own species. There are now hundreds of hominin fossils and a rather continuous series of intermediates is known. Sufficiently so, in fact, that taxonomists are sometimes evenly split on which species to assign a specific subject to. Dawkins efficiently dispatches a number of misunderstandings about species and ""gaps"". Firstly, the record is in any case often far more contiguous than a creationist might wish. For many lineages, including our own, there is a tight series of intermediates documenting a transition. Secondly, gaps in the fossil record are in any case not a problem. The evidence for evolution is found in biogeography, phyletic mappings, homologies, atavisms and the endless flood of DNA sequences. In a criminal case with this much evidence, the emergence of a CCTV record of the crime in which the suspect happened to walk behind a wall a couple of times would not break the case. A complete fossil record is not to be expected - fossilisation is rare. They are just nice to have - and never, ever materially undermine the case for evolution by turning up in the wrong order. The fossils for the human lineage now form a series so continuous that taxonomists are split on whether to assign a specimen to H. sapiens or another hominin - just as you would expect from evolution. It is true that they always have a fully-formed species name, but that is not because of their characteristics but of those of human taxonomists with boxes to put things in. There is no such thing as a ""fully-formed"" species! Only fully-formed names. A complete fossil record would in fact be a huge headache as it would be one continuous series of intermediates and assigning species would be impossible. Taxonomy is only possible because of the gaps.Dawkins then deals with embryology, possibly the most interesting and productive area of biological research outside gene sequencing. Embryology imposes strong constraints and some direction on evolution which explain much of what we see. He moves on to the phenomenon of continental drift and the light it sheds on both biogeography and Deep Time. The slow march of tectonics has left its footprints not only on the strata of the continents but on their inhabitants, and the times of separation of the land masses make strong predictions about the relatedness of the lineages divided at that time. He then addresses phyletics and the various ways to quantify relatedness which independently generate consistent family trees for all of life. Then come the marks of the evolutionary chisel on the stone of life's edifice - the signs of an evolutionary history. Gill arches in the human embryo, the drunkard's walk of the vas deferens and facial and recurrent laryngeal nerves, the back-to-front design of the vertebrate eye with its botched curves and frequent downstream corrective factors - the marks of our past are all over us like Shubin's inner fish. Finally, Dawkins looks at arms races and the inefficient workings of ecosystems, condemned to waste by natural selection working without foresight.It is a tragedy that this book was necessary, but Dawkins states the case clearly. The evidence for evolution is overwhelming, yet increasing numbers of the public remain distinctly whelmed. Like Dawkins, I attribute this to an organised effort to indoctrinate anti-science by churches and, in other fields such as anthropogenic warming, by well-funded ideologically pro-market advocacy groups. Dawkins confines himself to evolution in this book and he knows whereof he eloquently speaks. He sounds worried and frustrated and I don't blame him. The cacophony of science-denial is becoming deafening and I admire Dawkins for his reason and restraint shown in this book.The are several excellent works on the evidence for evolution currently available. Prothero's beautiful and magisterial survey of the same evidence covered here; Shubin's account of his discovery of Tiktaalik, Coyne's allegedly excellent survey - a little further down my list! None speak as clearly and engagingly as Dawkins to the layperson, who is the current master of explaining science to the non-scientist. For this reason I would encourage any lay reader interested in the case for evolution to read all these works, but to start here. "
237,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69570477-sina-iravanian,5,"""... the key step was the arising, by some process as yet unknown, of a self-replicating entity. Self-replication spawns a population of entities, which compete with each other to be replicated. Since no copying process is perfect, the population will inevitably come to contain variety, and if variants exist in a population of replicators those that have what it takes to succeed will come to predominate. This is natural selection, and it could not start until the first self-replicating entity came into existence.""This is the gist of evolution by natural selection. Just fast-forward and generalise this statement about the very first organism that initiated life to today's macro-organisms and higher forms of life. This book is full of analogies and metaphors that help the reader understand complex biological concepts. Maybe the best analogy of all is the Origami analogy to embryology development. Chapter 12: Arms races and 'Evolutionary Theodicy' is my favourite chapter with thought-provoking examples of futile arms races between organisms and sheer suffering and pain within animal kingdom.""Nature is neither kind nor unkind, she is neither against suffering, nor for it. Nature is not interested in suffering one way or the other unless it affects the survival of the DNA. It is easy to imagine a gene that, say, tranquillises gazelles when they are about to suffer a killing bite. Would such a gene be favoured by natural selection? Not unless the act of tranquillising a gazelle improved that gene's chance of being propagated into future generations. It is hard to see why this should be so and we may therefore guess that gazelles suffer horrible pain and fear when they are pursued to the death - as most of them eventually are. The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation. ... thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst and disease. It must be so. If there is ever a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored.""Animals that live in the darkest caves lost their eyesight over time and became blind, while retaining vestiges of eyes. As generations passed they didn't need eyesight to survive in their dark environment and could use the energy for other departments. Birds that migrated to the once mammal-free New Zealand lost their wings over time for similar reasons: they didn't need wings to survive. What if we could live in a world free from suffering and pain?""Without the ever-escalating arms races between predators and prey, parasites and hosts, without Darwin's 'war of nature', without his 'famine and death' there would be no nervous systems capable of seeing anything at all, let alone appreciating and understanding it.""Our consciousness and our ability to understand and appreciate the world are by-product of our brain growth. It's interesting to see how our consciousness is despised by the sight of suffering and pain in the world, and at the same time its very existence is dependent upon those pains and sufferings.This is a fascinating book that answered a lot of questions I had in my mind about evolution."
238,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5500087-shaun,5," Richard Dawkins wrote this book with the main purpose of supplying the reader proof that the theory of Evolution and Natural Selection is a demonstrable fact. Dawkins states that this inclination was due to the fact that his previous books have naïvely assumed the fact of Evolution, which means that he didn't explicitly lay out the evidence in detail on just how Evolution is true. It is this method that Dawkins makes the case for evolution, drawing from the fossil record, comparative anatomy, contemporary experiments, and molecular genetics. Along with laying down a effusive amount of evidence for Evolution in his chatty (first person) style, Dawkins multi tasks in his endeavors by largely clarifying and correcting the common misconceptions on what the theory of Evolution states.  In many ways, this book is also meant to address some of the valid questions that the naive general public may have in regards to Evolution; - Why don't we see evolution happening right now? - How can we trust the history presented by science of life on earth?- How do we know it is accurate? - Is there really a so-called missing link? - What is wrong with just presenting creationism and evolution as equally valid arguments in order to allow students to choose for themselves?  Dawkins takes time to fully address all of these questions repeatedly in differing chapters, when addressing different topics. Dawkins does this while employing a ""tutorial method"", hammering repeatedly on aspects of natural selection, how the variation in our DNA provides a map to our ancestral heritage, and how an intelligent designer is a ludicrous notion once we've understand all the evidence collected to date, not only validating evolution but frequently and methodically disqualifying the idea of an ""intelligent"" designer. Dawkins begins his book at a more elementary level, but then uses chapter after chapter to build upon what pre-requisite information that was introduced in the previous chapter, to flesh-out an understanding of evolutionary topics at a more advanced level. It is at this point to where the book becomes highly specialized and detailed, with the language getting more technical and involved. One has to make a concerted effort to follow the information closely and comprehensively, otherwise a few points of emphasis could be missed.  Even if one already has read on the general theory of Evolution, there is information that Dawkins uses that may have not been available to the reader before ( for example, learning that the hoof of a horse is homologous to the fingernail of the human middle finger, or that some dinosaurs had a ""second brain"" of ganglion cells in their pelvis, which helped compensate for the tiny brain in their head).This book is certainly worth rereading in order to become more familiar with the material. Dawkins as always, is a superb translator of complex scientific concepts. It doesn't matter if he's spinning metaphors for the fossil record (like a spy camera in a murder trial) or deftly explaining the scientific method by which scientists measure the genetic difference between distinct species. Dawkins fashions his arguments as a tutorial while employing the use of analogies and thinking exercises. The examples provided for his arguments are not merely used because they provide devastating arguments in favor evolution, but because they are also teachable moments.Here are some examples of simple analogies that Dawkins used while clarifying complex biological material to the reader: - How Genes, DNA and RNA works. Dawkins informs the reader that when the 2 strands of DNA is brought together from each parent into an offspring - it isn't as if all the DNA code is meshed or mixed together, like when one takes blue and red paint to make violet. Dawkins clarifies what really happens by giving a more fitting analogy that different DNA strands being combined are more like the shuffling of two different decks of playing cards. - Embryological process. Dawkins compares the early developing biological process of the embryo to an invaginating ( or in-folding ) type of ""origami"" with the sheet tissue inflating and folding within itself. - Speciation occurring within a genus . . Dawkins uses the literal description of an island, which is surrounded by geographical barriers - further extending the concept of an ""island"" to any area which is keeps a species isolated from others of its like, to the point to where there is enough genetic variance between the two to stop any reproducing if the two ever came into contact with each other again.  At other times in the book Dawkins uses both biological evidence and of the fossil record to further refute Creationists / ID hypotheses or criticisms and explain why they are wrong, such as the assertion that there are irreducible gaps/links between related species of animals ( ex Primates and Humans having a shared ancestry through many documented intermediates or land and water mammals ). When Dawkins uses examples of evidence he always has more examples that support his preceding examples, in this sense expanding on the homology of the skeletal structures of these species - emphasizing that the skeleton in any animal can be taken and pulled, or compressed, part by part, modified in different amounts, along different descendant lineages. There are many examples in which Dawkins is able to clarify underpinning results from the extensive fossil remains, such as tactfully demonstrating that there wasn't a ""first person"" i.e that every animal/person ever born, belonged to the same species as its parents. Here are some fascinating examples that Dawkins uses to further the weight of his evidence :- Deliberating the taxonomy (classification ) of animals in relation to the shared ancestors of all modern groupings of animals.- DNA and Embryological study. How DNA actually works on a cellular level, through a process of self - assembly/bottom-up procedure . . . following local rules at various levels, that are contrary to the idea that cells follow an a overall architectural blueprint - i.e order, organization and structure emerge as by-products of rules which are obeyed locally many times over, not globally. - Genetic vestiges.Remnants found in physiology and in the genetic code that indicate where modern animals are descended from. - The economy of energy that an animal or plant spends of developing and maintaining parts of its body in relation to the energy that it could use for more breeding ( passing on its genes).- Describes symbiotic relationships in the adaptation of species ( birds, bee's & flowers ), or a ""co-evolution"", a partnership occurring between organisms that have something to gain from each other, each contributing something to the other.- Meticulously breaks down how scientists use different types of dating ; Evolutionary time-scales / radioactive or geological clocks, overlap principle denodochronology in tree-rings.Technical description of the chemistry behind the dating of radioactive isotopes  ( unstable atoms decaying into some other elements at a predictable rate ). The numerous photographs ( color plates with black and white illustrations ) in the book also helped reinforce his examples and were an unexpected surprise to see them placed throughout the whole book.  Indeed, this book can serve as a handy reference guide after your initial read. Dawkins amasses a mountain of evidence in this richly illustrated, enormously readable explanation of the theory of evolution.  That said, I doubt seriously that his book will challenge those who view evolution as only a theory, precisely because they would never open their minds to such a text as this !I enjoyed reading Dawkins marshaling in overwhelming evidence that our Earth is billions of years old, along with evidence piled upon still more evidence to show evolutionary development of life on Earth is indeed the ""Greatest show on Earth"" - We all should be in awe of it as much as he is. "
239,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4012069-mike,3,"Good, but somehow not what I was looking for. Sometimes too simplistic and other times too detailed. I didn’t mind the meandering sections and footnotes about the curious behavior of various animals. He seems to have encyclopedic knowledge of interesting species and if you just let yourself go and flow with him it can be entertaining. However, the tangents aimed at evolution-deniers seemed strange because they certainly would not be reading this book. The most significant thing I learned is the importance of embryology, the dividing of cells in early development. Cells fold on each other and make shapes in what he calls augmented origami. He stressed that from the bottom, i.e. chemical reactions, to enzymes, to cells the process is governed entirely by “local rules” without any overarching view of the big picture. That seems remarkable. And a bit confusing. He doesn’t like the analogy of “DNA is a blueprint” because it suggests a top down development and because it suggests you could work backward from the final design to the guiding blueprint. Despite his concern for this analogy, it is hard for me to see it any other way. We often think of mutations providing advantage, but most mutations are disadvantageous (there are more ways to cause harm than good). Natural selection removes the bad mutations. As an interesting illustration: bad mutations to the eye are constantly removed from the gene pool because they are disadvantageous. But for animals living in caves those bad mutations don’t get eliminated because eyes don’t matter in the dark. Consequently, over millennia bad mutations build up and cave animals tend to have terrible eyes or even empty useless eye sockets. Many advantageous mutations are selected to accommodate for some previous design (good or bad). For example, our eyes are actually poorly designed. If you were to start from scratch you could do a much better design. Eyes are the result of millions of years of incremental change, each time working from the existing design, line upon line. However, the bad design is “fixed” by a powerful brain that is able to instantly photoshop images to make sense of things (which can sometimes result in optical illusions, i.e. our brain incorrectly trying to photoshop the image). Examples of bad design abound. Such as the vagus nerve that was well placed when we were fish, but now loops around our throat in an efficient manner (which is clearly illustrated with a diagram of a giraffe's throat). Likewise, with the unnecessarily long and circuitous tube that sperm travel through. Most “bad designs” in humans are because we only “recently” began to stand upright. Consequently, women experience more difficult labor and many people suffer back pain. Dolphins and whales have a common ancestor with hippos, and their obvious bad design is that they breathe air."
240,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59061186-braden-siemens,4,"I read this book during my visit to Ireland, which in a strange but yet fitting way, felt right. Reading about evolution while staring at snails leisurely making their way down the rocky shore of the Atlantic in Northern Ireland was an appropriate visual medium while attempting to wrap my brain around the intricacies of natural selection.I thought this was a good book. As a theology student ill-equipped at speaking intelligibly about science (save for a rough summary of my genetics and evolutionary biology classes required by my university), I thought Dawkins wrote accessibly and in such a way that actually was far more diplomatic than I expected. I am not a young-earth creationist whatsoever, so the arguments against creationism did not cut as deep and were not nearly scathing as it may have come across to other Christians. I can understand why it was so necessary for Dawkins to critique the fundamentalist movement, primarily due to its anti-intellectualism and refusal to look at the growing evidence for natural selection and evolution that frankly is absolutely stunning. What leaves me reeling is Dawkins' analysis of the necessity of suffering as a type of extreme ""red flag device"" that assists humans in making choices geared towards their survival (he called this his ""evolutionary theodicy""). Fascinatingly, we look at pain as an evil, especially one in which a beneficent God must be blamed for permitting. This evolutionary view of pain then makes plenty sense to me: as something that helps humans discern their environment in order to flourish as a species. People in the theological world hate Dawkins. Even saying his name is a kind of swear word in my community. It's true, his book ""The God Delusion,"" which criticizes faith in God, is so elementary as to be easily refuted (I would recommend David Bentley Hart's ""The Atheist Delusion"" for a great riposte), yet Dawkins is far from what some have said of him as a ""stupid, popular, journalist."" This book taught me a great deal, and I am beginning to think that only the fusion between the sciences and the humanities will create more robust theology for the future (which is definitely already occurring in interesting ways in process theology's correspondence with quantum physics). I hope my generation of theologians and philosophers will be quick to give an open ear to the voice of science. "
241,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27417672-ganesh-poomal,3," In this book, Richard Dawkins explains array of evidences that support the theory of evolution. These evidences are coming from different scientific fields and they do not contradict each other. Reading this book helped me better understand the evidence for evolution.Evolution holds that complex life forms evolves from simpler life forms. Every life on earth has a common ancestor. Evolution works through random gene mutation and natural/artificial selection. Some evidences presented in this book can be grouped as follows,Domestication:Domestication is a process of increasing desired characteristics in an animal or in a crop through artificial selection. We were able to increase docility of domesticated animals and increase yields of crops. Beyalav's experiment with domesticating silver fox is very instructive; in a few tenths of generations he achieved domesticating wild fox population. Genetic Mutation and Natural or artificial selection can spawn a new species. By just creating different environment, we can see natural selection at work. Natural selection results in increase of populations that can adapt well to the new environment. There were experiments using bacterias and Guppies fish. In case of bacteria, selection pressure was controlled by the availability of glucose. After a few generations, the evolved bacterias were better in dealing with the new environment. In case of Guppies fish, the selection pressure was controlled by the nature of the pebble in the water floor and the presence of predators. In the presence of predators the evolved fish is better at camouflaging.  Dating methods: We have different dating methods. Radio active dating, Tree cross section based dating, molecular clock etc. They are independent and they all support a view that simpler life forms were there long before complex life forms. Fossil records: We do find fossil records of animals that seem to be intermediary between two species. Even though the book deals with pretty important subject, the book could have been written better. I felt that the book was going all over the place though those details were interesting, but, If you judge from the perspective of presenting evidence for evolution, it could have been written in a more persuasive and concise way."
242,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101280370-lucy,4,"I'm starting biology A-level next year, and as part of my preparation work my teachers told me to read a book from a given list. I picked up this book because it was the only one on the list that we already had at home - my dad's a bit obsessed with Dawkins - and also because I intend to study genetics in the future, and while I (mistakenly) assumed this would be more ecology focused it would still be an interesting read.This is only my second book of Dawkins', my first being the kids' book The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True which absolutely fascinated me. The style of this book is much the same as that, once you get past the first chapter or so. This first chapter is dedicated to explaining why a book evidencing evolution is necessary, with some truly terrifying facts about science-deniers and how prevalent they are. After that however, each chapter was a fascinating, accessible and occasionally whimsical and humorous look at a different piece of evidence for evolution. A surprising amount of ground is covered, from radioactive clocks to the fossil record to evolutionary arms races. I was particularly interested in the chapters on embryology and DNA evidence which covered quite complex subjects in an easy to understand way. There are also examples of various studies throughout the book which are really well explained.I do have a few issues with this book. The beginning and the appendix of the book are fairly dedicated to bashing creationists, some of which goes beyond factual observation (though there is an argument that such treatment is necessary for those people to realise they are in the wrong). There are a few hints of racial prejudice in Dawkins' wording. These two facts combined mean I am reluctant to read any of his more opinionated books. However, these issues can be ignored in this one where, to his credit, he remains pretty much objective throughout the main chapters.Overall, this book is a fascinating read, and despite the fact I considered myself fairly educated on the mechanism of evolution, taught me a lot. It's worth reading and it gives you a better understanding of how beautiful life is in all its variety."
243,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/577651-said-almaskery,5,"Let me start with the book I recently completed :The Greatest Show on Earth, by RIchard Dawkins. The author wrote this book specifically to convince those who dont believe in Evolution using science, logic and lots of pictures (probably I need to share some of these pictures later). The books starts with the terminology ""Theory"" and comes to a conclusion that Darwins Theory is more than a theory and is a scientific fact, hence Theorum is a more accurate representation to what Darwin proposed in his book ""In the Origin of Species"". He also uses the analogy of a crime scene, where a detective comes to the scene and reconstructs what happened through evidence. What evolutionists and scientist do is exactly this; they came to the crime scene (Earth) and from the evidence they build an accurate picture of how life evolved in the past millions of years. Dawkins goes on with minute details showing how ""artificial selection"" enabled humans to come up with vegtibles and animals that were not there before; such as the different cabbages and dogs. He then goes to answer some of the key questions that are always raised by the public on evolution, such as the missing link (if evolution was real, why dont we see evdence of our ape like ancestors?), or the question of dating the fossils, or the question of DNA sequencing and how it confirms that we are cousins with other animals such as Chimpanzees. ONe of the chapeters focuses specifically on how females do it alone: i.e. the evolution of the embryo from a single cell to a full human in just 9 months. The chapter takes this into deep details and relates it to the maro evolution of the human kind. Finally the last chapter challenges what Dawkins name as ""creationists"" with the main argument being if there was a God who created this world with perfection, then why do we see imperfect organs inside mamels and different animals. These - to him - are only explained be evolution!My opinion?Nearly everything in evolution confirms the existence of God ... Im surprised how come Dawkins has not come to this conclusion."
244,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114370311-karl-gibbs,3,"This book displays an outstanding collection of evidence to support Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution. The stories of great experiments and miraculous discoveries, missing links and irrefutable proofs, are all excellently told.Dawkin’s description of bee vision and how they see in UV is mesmerizing. “A meadow full of flowers is nature’s Times Square… A slow motion neon sign, it changes from week to week as flowers come into season.” The excellent personification had me envisioning a bee on an acid trip in a candy shop. Like the majority of the book, it conveys scientific fact in an enthralling way.Other titillating details that would delight the amateur biologist or pub quiz fancier were those of the tiktaalik perhaps a shared relative of both the whale and the hippo. A link between land and sea. And the tale of the ancient Japanese sea battle, Danno-Ura (1185), and its relationship to crabs.Whilst all this is extremely interesting and you feel the weight of its brevity, Dawkins detracts from the key point in some of his witticisms against creationists, fellow scientists and more. “I’d love to see the egg all over the faces of the zoologists and anthropologists who engage in life long feuds” he states somewhat ironically in reference to species and genus classifications, one of his many contentious battlegrounds. This all feels massively unnecessary given how well Dawkins has presented his proof. Dawkins tells us in quality and abundance compelling tales and details of fascinating animals and it is far better to hear him talk of those. The evidence Dawkins has assembled summarizes excellently the proof of evolution and lays to bed any prior objections. In his own words, the work that he and other scientists have done, show “that the ‘theory’ of evolution is actually a fact – as incontrovertible a fact as any in science.” "
245,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35655787-ahmad,4,"Richard Dawkins is the man for evolutionary biology. It is 'no accident' that evolution is the driving force of our existence although we do not know what the causative link to the origin of life on earth; however, the life began with simple (primitive) forms and evolved to the complex forms that we can see on millions and millions of species. The evidence for the theory of evolution is massive. From geological evidence (rocks, fossils, weather, continental shifts) to the DNA, genetics, proteins and molecules whose evidences are enough to put the Theory of Evolution as a scientific fact. Dawkins in this explains eloquently the evidence of evolution relying on observable, testable, repeatable and incontrovertible backed-up evidence. The amazing thing about this book is its simplicity for the public readership, it's well-written and explains clearly intricate steps of, for example, bacteria and how it evolved 'right before our eyes', or the experiment with Lizards and the different evolved forms, changing from insectivores to veggie-eating animals when a team of scientists artificially placed them in two far-fetched islands from each other. However, Richard Dawkins would exhaust your mind with his digressions and somewhat over-complicated analogies. I got frustrated, for the first time reading a book, about one of his metaphors. His occasional diversions which he admits doing can indeed put a reader off sometimes. No matter, the Greatest Show on Earth is an astonishingly well written book. Reading it indeed left me a more knowledgeable person. Indeed, when it comes to evolution, there's no one better than Richard Dawkins. "
246,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5050128-mikey-will,5,"Dawkins successfully weaves together three individual goals - a multi-angular riposte of Young Earth Creationism - an homage to Charles Darwin and his revolutionary ideas - a 21st update to Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species There work is replete with intriguing antidotes and explanatory examples spanning the entire gamut of current and historically animal and plants biology, genomics and behavioral observations. Uniquely, the book transcends the biological sphere to cover evolutionary principles such as continental drift, subduction/plate tectonics, dendrochronology, radiometric dating, etc., These areas are juxtaposed with the comparative “alternative” young-earth explanation (mostly denial of the phenomenon). In address of comparative creationism, Dawkins takes painstaking attention towards phrasing and terminology, often clarifying with additional detail and use of liberal rephrasing. This directive deviates from his other compositions; however, as a preeminent authority of evolutionary biology (via zoology), its soon apparent to see how often (and inappropriately) he is misquoted by detractors. You almost feel his precautionary, anticipatory thoughts exemplified in attentive phrasing and word choice. This may not be his best book (My money’s on “The Selfish Gene” whereas Dawkin states “The Extended Phenotype”). The Greatest Show on Earth is primarily focused as a comprehensive (and comprehensible ) review of neo-darwin evolution for an open-audience as opposed to his more familiar critical, craft of neo-darwin evolutionary sub theory (e.g. gene-centered view of evolutionary) aimed at professional biologists."
247,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61197295-drew,4,"Overall this book really satisfied my Dawkins appetite. Similar to his other books, the enthusiasm he has for biology is incredibly energizing. I found myself putting down the book and Googling nearly all of the lifeforms he describes. The color pages also really added to the experience.There is a really neat part in Chapter 2 about Plato and essentialism. The context is the question: Why did it take so long for Darwin to discover evolution, when much harder theories (like Newtonian mechanics) were invented far earlier in human history?Dawkins describes that Platonists cling to essentialism. Basically, a right triangle drawn in the sand is just a crude approximation of the essential triangle. One that has perfect orthogonal lines.He describes how there is no essential rabbit. We think of rabbit as some perfect, essential prototype. In reality, all rabbits are just genetically variable recombinants of their parents. So, as time proceeds, each rabbit will be a variant within its greater species. As time goes on, the thing we have no longer resembles what some ancestral variant of it looked like. There never was some perfect rabbit prototype for which all rabbits vary to some degree.My one gripe with the book is that he definitely failed on his promise to not attack religion. I’m not a theist, and I loved The Gold Delusion. However, his hypothetical arguments with a phantom creationist really break the momentum of the biological explanations. I really wish he could have just written a ‘pure’ science book here."
248,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71023848-ana,5,"I've been familiar with Richard Dawkins for a long time but this is the first of his works that I read. And as much as I disagree with some of the ways he approaches different/wrong/stupid attitudes towards things we know are scientific facts, his expertise in evolutionary biology is truly ironclad.As an educated person and somebody who accepts evolution as a fact, I have to say there were many things in this book that I wasn't aware of. The whole experience of reading ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" was like going back to school to a science class given by an extremely interesting and eloquent teacher. All the beautiful and useful pictures in the book also made it all the more fun.I will admit I got lost a few times, possibly because I was reading about complex concepts while not entirely rested and focused, but most of the book is legible, educational and entertaining. I'm not sure how much this will convince creationists that evolution is a real thing that's been happening for billions of years (the transcript of the interview with the creationist lady made my blood boil), but it will offer a plethora of interesting little details to those of us who already ""believe"" in evolution.Some of my favorite parts were the foxes that became very dog-like over the years, the E. Coli long-term evolution experiment and all the silly things evolution ""messed up"" in animals' and our bodies that an intelligent designer wouldn't (if there was one). The fact that our sinuses have their drainage holes at the top was a revelation, and koalas having their pouches the other way round made me giggle. In conclusion, I will probably re-read this book some day, and I will definitely be reading Dawkins' other works soon."
249,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71115989-liliana,3,"I have noticed Dawkins' books fail to reach me, somewhat. I believe it to be mostly because of his writing style, and the at times more sardonic tone he employs (namely towards creationists and/or religion) that I don't think aids him in his objective of enlightening his target audience. Related, I don't think I am his target audience. I am already quite convinced by evolution, but I decided to pick this up as I would like a more current view on the matter. As such, I found this book to be quite informative, providing plenty of proof and arguments for evolution, but at the same time a bit basic in its depiction of the subject. This is clearly intentional, to make the book more accessible to a lay audience. Most of his books are like this, which unfortunately, I tend not to jive with. And as I said, his tone doesn't really help the matter.I would also not recommend this as an audiobook. That's how I tend to explore my non-fiction TBR list, but since this book is apparently filled with figures supporting his points, I lost some of the charm just by listening. Nonetheless, I would recommend this book to anyone seeking a more foundational read on evolution. It's informative and accessible, and albeit suffering (in my opinion) from some cheesy or sardonic remarks by Dawkins, it definitely is not too cluttered with theoretical and scholarly terms that would be too difficult to follow."
250,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75995905-kevin-warne,4,"I had mixed feelings about reading Dawkins. One on hand, he's clearly an expert in the field of evolution. On the other hand, I was put off by his negativity about people who disagree with him for the simple reason that I don't see the point in it. It rares changes people's minds to attack their beliefs, regardless of whether or not the facts back it up (which they clearly do). Having said that, I feel more sympathy for Dawkins and his contemporaries after reading this. For the sheer amount of research that they've devoted their lives to, it must be very frustrating to hear creationist speakers call it all into doubt. I suspect this experience may have actually made Dawkins a better writer in a way. Being so used to skepticism from the public, he is able to explain a staggering amount of material in a concise and generally very readable volume. Granted, at points, this book does get very technical and difficult to follow some of the finer details if (like me) you're reading this on a busy rush hour train, but the general points are fairly clear throughout. It's a fascinating book and covers a lot about the subject that I never knew. I don't know how many minds it will change, but if you want a deeper understanding of the science of evolution and how we found all the evidence, it's definitely worth reading. "
251,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/844087-bradley-hanson,5,"If, like me, you were curious about the details of evolution and want to understand the overwhelming scientific proof of the fact of evolution, this is your book. Dawkins, a clear thinker and masterful writer, explains in excruciating detail (there are also around 40 pages of color photos and additional illustrations in the book) how clear the evidence is. While it’s nice to have to many fossils, (and not one of them contradicts evolution), we also have proof from the changes in species, compared skeletons and vestigial traits in all species. In humans, we have a vestigial tail, goosebumps where we once had hair, the appendix, the tendon in the underside of our forearm, and the same lizard brain flight or fight response. The Galápagos Islands are also a rich example of species that exist ONLY there. Dawkins also takes great detail in showing all of the intermediary fossils and evolutionary examples that Creationists often used to refer to as “missing links.” There are no missing links, as you will read. The gaping holes in creationism are exposed, as well as the flawed logic and scientific misunderstandings Creationists use to defend the indefensible: Noah’s Ark. There are also countless examples of “bad design,” that not only reinforces evolution but are also examples of traits that no “designer” would ever create. Highly recommended. "
252,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7656537-ismail,2,"I didn't like this book that much. I was expecting it to be more like The Selfish Gene (which is one of my favorite books of all time) rather than The God Delusion (which is okay).I am not a creationist, obviously, I think that evolution is true and the evidence for it is as big as for any other deep theory in any science. Evolution has as true as Newton's theory of gravity (in both cases some of the details are wrong but the bigger picture is totally right). So what I wanted from this book was to learn more about it.Unfortunately, the book was mostly at bashing creationists rather than talking about the evolution. While I think that there is place for such a book (and it is terrifying how so many people think that Earth is younger than 10K years, and that humans had dinosaurs as pet), this was not the book for me. Mostly, cause I already have the same opinion as Dawkins in those things, I think that creationism is totally stupid, and that there is no need for intelligent design. So, I guess it is mostly cause I came with wrong expectations, thinking that this book will be more like The Selfish Gene. Nevertheless, I will read soon The Blind Watchmaker and The Extended Phenotype, which seem to be more about the science of evolution rather than an anti-theist book."
253,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27856843-tom-driver,4,"Dawkins opens The Greatest Show on Earth by quoting survey results where 40% of Americans and nearly 40% of Great Britons believe a supernatural being created all life on Earth. Dawkins refers to people who deny the scientific truths of evolution et al as History Deniers. A portion of those respondents believe the Bible is an historically accurate account of how our planet, and the life it contains, came into being. Others within that percentage feel God created evolution and then sat back and admired his work. The survey results are both shocking and dangerous, and the reason Dawkins produced this educational and entertaining book detailing ""The Evidence for Evolution"". Dawkins provides a variety of examples from multiple scientific disciplines which clearly show evolution by natural selection is how all life on Earth developed into its present form. He explains how the principles of evolution by natural selection have been tested from a variety of angles and the evidence from these experiments clearly support evolution by natural selection. I appreciated how Dawkins describes in detail how each of the experiments were conducted and explains how the methodology is readily available to anyone, with the proper training and facilities, could simulate the experiment or move the experiment to its next logical stage. One particularly interesting section included an explanation of why, due to the fact the continents once fit together like a puzzle, vegetation on eastern South America shares so many traits with vegetation on the western coast of Africa. In another entertaining section Dawkins demonstrates how there is a complete lack of proof for any argument in support of the story of a man with a giant ark saving two of every animal from a massive flood. I admit, however, I am looking forward to Russell Crowes' movie about Noah; there may not be a iota of truth to it but it is an entertaining story. Many consider Richard Dawkins controversial but I completely disagree. After reading several of his books I've come to admire Dawkins for his relentless pursuit of a greater understanding of how things work. He, like all good scientists, is seeking the truth and his only agenda is to pass on his knowledge and love of learning to others. Dawkins is in awe of our planet, its existence within the universe, and the endless wonders they contain; I'm not clear on how that qualifies as controversial. His choice of title, The Greatest Show on Earth, is undeniably fitting because evolution by natural selection is truly one fantastic show and one we should all take the time to understand. Unfortunately, Dawkins is often met with resistance from History Deniers who, it would seem, are perfectly content to live a life without knowledge, without truth, and without even a basic understanding of how our planet, and the life it supports, actually works. As I was finishing this book Bill Nye (aka The Science Guy) participated in a ""debate"" with Ken Ham, CEO of Answers in Genesis on the topic of creationism as a credible explanation for the Earth's history. My first reaction to this ""debate"" was to wonder why Bill Nye would give Mr. Ham the time of day, but then I recalled Dawkins explaining how the History Deniers are well organized, well funded and actively working to prevent our children from learning about evolution, or any topic that contradicts their God. Dawkins writes about how the History Deniers are training their children to disrupt classrooms where teachers are trying to educate our children about these fundamental scientific truths. Truths supported by the one thing History Deniers lack - Evidence. To all the History Deniers I ask one thing - read The Greatest Show on Earth, The Evidence for Evolution by Richard Dawkins. Read this book and read it carefully. Read it in the morning once the caffeine starts working so that your mind is alert and attentive.What is the real motivation of History Deniers like Mr. Ham? Is it fear? Are they afraid to admit the creation story is wrong because it may lead the faithful questioning the rest of the stories? Dawkins argues we don't need ancient myths to explain our existence and the sooner we accept this fact and open our minds, the sooner we can move towards a more unified and open-minded world. A world where people don't hate one another and kill just because your neighbor's fairy godmother is different than your own. But the History Deniers are so scared about facing life without their ""softly spoken magic spells"" (thank you Roger Waters) they continue to indoctrinate their children and actively work to prevent schools and educators from teaching scientific truths. I implore all History Deniers to read The Greatest Show on Earth. After finishing this excellent book please pick up another book, perhaps The Magic of Reality, How Do We Know What's Really True by Richard Dawkins. And then pick up another book, and then another, and then another, and then.... well, you get the point, at least I hope you get the point!I also wonder if the History Deniers have really given much thought about what they are actually saying when they steadfastly support creationism? The creationism story is incredibly illogical, and just plain silly, when compared to the scientifically supported evidence for evolution. Dawkins does a wonderful job of explaining what supporting creationism means in the real world; everyone cites the human eye as an example for intelligent design when in fact it is a perfect example of evolution by natural selection.I will end this review by pointing out another interesting tidbit from book. History Deniers are not just Christians; when it comes to denying evolution, Christians walk arm in arm with believers in another ancient religion. The Islamic faithful are also campaigning against teaching evolution to our children. The Christians and Muslims can't say they don't have anything in common. Actually, they have a lot more in common than they would care to admit, and isn't that a comforting thought for the rest of us? "
254,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33146346-cameron-huble,3,"I feel like the general public will have a hard time with this book, for multiple reasons. The obvious first one is that it is a book providing evidence for evolution -- a hot-button topic, and Dawkins doesn't exactly pull punches. But even the people who can move past that and actually try to learn about the evidence (i commend you if you're one of them) may still have a hard time with it. I just don't think the general public will be able to understand a lot of it. I'm not trying to say they're stupid or ""look at me i'm smart"" -- far from it. There are just many, many examples Dawkins uses that i felt i would not have followed/understood if it weren't for the background knowledge i attained in getting a degree in Biology. Dawkins tries to give background knowledge (and does a pretty good job for the most part), but a lot of the times too much is required to fit in just 400 pages. Maybe i'm wrong, maybe everyone can understand it and i AM being pretentious. Still, it does feel like reading a textbook sometimes, other times it's overly wordy and he let's his own philosophies come in. But i did enjoy it and learned a lot. If you can power through it, i highly recommend."
255,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47627566-niel,5,"Dawkins' evidence for evolution is easily accessible and remarkably coherent. It is beyond fail, a book specifically written to convince and affirm the somewhat annoying neglected evidence for evolution plagued by conflict it unavoidably presents against the long revered doctrine of design.Dawkins in this book is convinced that evolution is the only means by which the complexity we see today could have arisen. The evidence to buttress this conviction are numerous as he highlights, from fossils, to anatomical comparison, to geographical distribution of organisms, to molecular composition, to predator -prey tussle, to varying clocks (not necessarily in that order).The theory of natural section as attributed to Darwin, as we see in the book, continually holds true to the explanation of apparent complexity in species and would require a powerful contradiction to shake off.The attack by Dawkins on creationists, I must add is quite, to me, beyond necessary but in retrospect can be understood given that the evidence has been compelling since Darwin and the reluctance and indifference by many to accept it.

The important difference between a theory and a law, exactly how much detail is put into radioactive dating, how insignificant a fossil record is to understanding that natural selection and evolution are consistent with how life developed, and, in contrast to my previous point, the astonishing amount of 'intermediary' fossils we have on record between animals today and common ancestorsThough I learned a great deal, this was not one of my favorite books to read. Though he's no doubt an expert in this field and taught me a lot on this subject, he took plenty of tangents that were unnecessary and made the read less enjoyable. I'm very glad I read the book, but I'm also relieved to be finished. However, if you are in need of a deep dive into the whats, whens, and hows of evolution, this is a good place to start."

Dawkins himself and Lalla Ward in a hauntingly beautiful manner.The book explains in most simplistic way the tools with which we work to gain information about past evolutionary events. Then goes on to explain those events, again in a manner understandable for the layman. Overall it draws a picture of the reasoning and evidence behind the statement “evolution is a fact!”The only shortcoming in the book that disapointed me was that it didn’t go into details about human evolutionspecificly. It would have been nice to see a little more in-depth assessment of the evidence behind human evolution and answers to the the arguments of the opposing views, since there are “neo-theist” emerging here and there, and one of their arguments is that although evolution happened in nature it doesn’t have anything to do with where we humans come from.All in all “the greatest show on earth” is a great read full of solid evidence with a forward and somtimes humorously insulting language. To creationist I suggest, read it with an open mind, to non-creationis, read it with fun..."
258,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8571135-anna,3," I was doubting between 2 and 3 stars. The subject matter was interesting, the writing was mostly good, but I can't help but to feel slightly annoyed by Dawkins himself, with his holier-than-thou attitude. Or, well, I guess in his case it is more like anti-holier-than-thou, but anyway.I should have known what I will get just based on the name of the book, really, but I somehow wasn't expecting it to be this bad. He didn't quite use the word ""idiot"" but it was implied for everyone who doesn't believe in evolution. I, personally, would rather go for ""misguided and uninformed"", and even then would not necessarily say that to their face, as, last I checked, calling people ignorant and dumb doesn't really help your point getting across (take note, world, for I have spoken!).So, definitely at least a 3 star book if you are not annoyed by Dawkins as much as I am, and if you disagree with him... well, you would never even read this book in the first place, would you? At least not with an open mind. I tried to have an open mind and I still dislike the man, even if I do appreciate his science."
259,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99303258-lavleen-sharma,5,"I had read Rene Descartes -A Discourse on the Method before reading Dawkins. It felt like the enquiry process Rene had wanted me to take, was provided on the table, in this book. As anybody else I knew the dictionary meaning of Evolution, but nothing else. Natural Selection and the world of DNA & RNA are the two topics I loved to know about. Even after the explanations were sufficient, Dawkins has gone an extra step to add more. There is a lot of commentary on anti Christianity and artificial selection, which can be skipped. Till we come to the chapter on human evolution we are shown all the processes behind the science of evolution. The diagrammatic representations are helpful for people who don't have a biology background. It was fascinating to read and see the first life to originate and branch out in so many directions, select among themselves what the best was, know about the earth's environment and keep progressing towards the that reptile which became a human in a million or so years.This is a necessary read - given the debate of AI merging with humans. This forms a base of knowing why and what really is possible given the entire evolution process."

But Dawkins is just such an unbearable asshole, he really sucks the joy out of inherently incredible subject matter. There were a few awe-inspiring bits of information, but overall it was so poorly and blandly explained; in trying to disprove intelligent design, he treats evolution as such a matter-of-fact that he drains the joy from it.Additionally the book is just poorly explained and meandering. Half the time he explains things to death, and other times gives no explanation or definition of scientific terms which would be helpful to readers. It all feels like his private joke of “I’m smart, you’re idiots.” He doesn’t respect or connect with his readers, which is an essential aspect of education. His writing would be much more effective, convincing AND INTERESTING if it wasn’t 70% ego and 30% subject matter.I’m officially done ever reading Dawkins because I really have no space for his energy in my life. Back to Michael Pollan and other authors who capture the wonder of life."

As someone with a small amount of biology knowledge (high school bio lol) this was the perfect reintroduction to the subject of evolution by natural selection. I love Dawkins' writing style; so elegant and witty at the same time. You are eased into the book gradually in what felt like (at least to me) a very logical way to go about teaching the subject. There were a couple smaller parts that I just sort of had to grind through, though I don't blame that on the author. It was more so some of the specifics that I wasn't particularly enamored by. In contrast to the very few slow parts, Mr. Dawkins backed up his claims with various case studies throughout the book that were conducted by various biologists and other scientists that helped him make his point and they were all very intriguing to me. Definitely recommend this to anyone interested in finding a starting point for learning about evolution and would even be inclined to tell people who ""don't believe evolution"" to try it as well."
262,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2418521-bassmh,4,"The book was suggested by a friend, and while at the back of my head I was recalling how Richard's approach is severe - based on his twitter feed - , I was skeptical ( I wasn't aware that it's spelled sceptical in U.K. ! ). Aided with the fact that I'm not an atheist, I had a bit of fear picking up this book. But Richard was able to put a solid scientific evidence towards evolution, one that is sometime was voiced with his own opinions. But I get that , he is passionate about the idea and the concept , and unable to understand how come it's not a prevailing choice in polls. It's an lovely read, especially for those who have a medical or a biological background. And I was left wanting to find books that target human evolution solely. What I actually appreciated mostly is that through out reading the book I didn't get the sense of ideology persecution. Yes, Dawkins voiced his opinions on evolution as a fact ( and for which I believe in evolution ) but he never singled out a faith or a religion. "
263,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64269316-luke-smith,4,"Having known Dawkins for his outspoken stance on atheism I decided to try and learn about a subject that I'm shamefully ignorant. Biology and specifically evolution. I loved nature growing up but as soon as it turned into cells (the complicated stuff) I just found it too confusing to retain anything. However Dawkins writes with passion which is very infectious and the pacing of the book is superb. There were a few bits I really struggled with but I think the fault lies with me, not Dawkins. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that Dawkins' belligerence gets really tiresome. He opens the book deriding and bewailing the fact that creationism exists in the face of such a mountain of evidence. That's understandable but he keeps coming back to this point again and again which personally I just found irritating. I sought this book out to be educated, not hectored and really, the facts should speak for themselves. That said, its a fascinating story well told, the greatest show on earth, indeed!"

While I believe that any thinking and fairly well educated person could benefit from reading the book, many lay persons may have to scan rather than digest unfamiliar material. Those who possess good reasoning processes and an open mind will be convinced that evolution is a fact and that the theory is extremely well supported. Those people will fulfill Dawkins' desire to change minds. However, when you consider that nearly half of the population possesses below average intelligence, according to the normal distribution, it is not surprising that over 40% of Americans believe that the earth is less than 10,000 years old. That is only part of the story. Other factors include indoctrination and the lack of motivation to become informed. As a science activist, I am doing what I can to promote real science, even by posting evidences for evolution on Facebook. All of us who care about science and future generations of Americans need to do what we can."

They can't see the evidence but keep nevertheless shouting ""show us evidence"". Despite their blindness, the judge's verdict is hard: God is not guilty! He never has been seen on the crime's scene. It's Mother Nature! She, and only she, is responsible for all the things we now observe after the crime took place. With her slow but neverending interventions and her secret weapon called 'natural selection', she has created a show and a spectacle never seen before. Some members of the jury still can't see the spectacle in its full glory, even though it's all around them, but the judge's verdict is clear: Guilty to the first degree: Mother Nature is reponsible for organising the greatest show on earth."

He loves Richard Dawkins to bits, so I was really excited to read this! By the end, however, I didn't like it as much as I thought I would.All in all, it was really informative. Even as someone who studied biology and worked in a lab studying evolution, this book gave me a new way to think about evolution and natural selection. The only thing that really turned me off was the tone of the whole thing. Dawkins comes across as snarky and unlikeable, putting a sour taste in my mouth for the entirety of the book. If you're already familiar with the basic concept of evolution, Dawkins will be really helpful in expanding your knowledge of Earth's natural history and the mechanisms of evolution! If you believe in creationism or are otherwise skeptical about the evidence for evolution, this book probably isn't for you. Dawkins tends to pick on skeptics while presenting his evidence. Either way, if you're thinking about reading it, give it a try! You might be surprised at what you learn."
267,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39981103-kristen,4,"This was a very interesting look at various areas of support for evolution, covering not only the fossil record — in fact, very little of that, as one of Dawkins’s main points was that the evidence for evolution abounds even if we didn’t have a fossil record at all — and basic biology but also geology, ecology, molecular biology, genetics, embryology and more. For the most part, I found Dawkins’s writing to be enjoyable. He’s obviously brilliant, and while that occasionally causes some moments of arrogance, I mostly enjoyed his humorous asides and his genuine excitement and enthusiasm for many of the experiments and discoveries he related. I’d previously known of him mainly for The God Delusion, which didn’t interest me, but I now realize that he’s much more of an authority on evolutionary biology, and I hope to read some of his more detailed books. He often anticipated my questions — when there seemed to be a gap or something that didn’t make sense — with a remark that “the reason for this is covered in my other book, x.” My one-star-reducing complaint is that I didn’t feel the book made a very coherent argument, either as a whole or in each chapter. Sometimes I wasn’t sure what the point of a chapter had been once I finished it. It was still very enjoyable; just not as well structured as other books I’ve recently read on similar subjects."
268,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893735-joseph-sverker,0,"I was so relieved when starting this book because Dawkins was explaining the basics and facts of evolution and was really quite good at sticking to that. However, that was, as usual, all about to change by the end of it. Dawkins simply cannot let go of including numerous rants against theism. I'm not sure that evolution and atheism are so necessarily interlinked so that one cannot be taught without the inclusion of the other? I know that the book is guided towards Creationists (and then not the type of creationist that I am), but it was suppose to be a book explaining the evidence for evolution not (another) book about his atheism.Whenever Dawkins explain evolution I must say that I thoroughly enjoy the reading and I think I am thoroughly enlighten as well. I think that he succeeds in convincing me (although I did not need convincing) about the truth of evolution as a scientific theory of the origin of the spices. However, I get frustrated by his gibes against a belief in God as if that is the consequence of theory of evolution.Dawkins main argument is ""this has been done by gradual step by step evolution without any need of a Creator"". ""Natural selection, step by step"" explains the apparent design of this spicies. I do think that is correct, however, that is not to reach to the idea of atheism through the theory of evolution it is to reach to the idea of atheism through the philosophical proposition of Ockham's razor. I agree that it is a strong and for me many times disturbing truth that evolution show no need (or possibly even signs) of a Creator, but that doesn't mean that evolution leads to atheism, it means that Ockham's razor when applied to evolution leads to atheism. But I more strongly suspect that it is actually one person's atheism with the help of Ockham's razor that interpret the theory of evolution as leading towards atheism.Please correct me if I am wrong, but my impression is that even Dawkins himself shows that evolution is incapable of showing whether a conscious ""manipulator"" of evolution evolved (active verb) a certain species? When he talks about the wild cabbage and the cauliflower he states that evolution takes over once the human being has started what he calls the ""articial selection"" so that in the end what has evolved is a new species (I'm not sure if it species is the correct biological distinction between wild cabbage and cauliflower, but you get the idea). What I mean is that Dawkins seem to show that evolution itself erases the trace of that the evolution of the cauliflower had been done by intention, while the evolution of the wild cabbage was done by random evolution and step by step natural selection. What I am arguing is not that ""prove the non-existence of God then""-argument. What I am arguing is that evolution provably is unable to say anything about whether there was an intention with a certain species or not. We can then, as Dawkins does, argue that there is far too much suffering in the world for there to be a benevolent Creator, but that is not a scientific argument, that is a theological argument and one that the Bible certainly is grappling with.This sounds like a completely ridiculous attempt to salvage faith I'm sure, but isn't Dawkins terribly anthropomorphic when writing about the world and animal life even down to the insect level. I know that it sounds horrendous about the insects placing larvae inside another insect and the eating it up, but is there pain involved there? Do we know it or project it? We know for sure that ""higher"" animals feel pain and it might seem ""a sadistic bastard"" that created it in that case, but that is once more a theological statement and not an argument that comes out of the theory of evolution.So anyway, a little tiresome that this would have to come up again and again when I thought I would read a book about evolution. As such I kind of think that this will be my last book that I read by Dawkins unless something really, really compelling is penned by his extraordinarily biased sharpened pen. But that is not to say that I do not dare to read books that are opposing to my worldview - I have actually now read six of his books. Just ask yourself how many authors you have read six books by? And even more have you read six books that are openingly arguing against you worldview? If not, and if you are an atheist I would like to recommend six books for you:* The Life of Pi - Yann Martel (presents a very interesting argument for God in the end)* In the Beginning - Henri Blocher (I would just love for ID:s and Literalist Creationists as well as theologically ignorant atheists to read this well written and hermeneutical aware exposition on Genesis)* Gunning for God - John Lennox (Might be the best and most humble response to the New Atheism that I have read)* Dethroning Jesus - Darrell Bock & Daniel Wallace (I don't know if this is the best book about the historical reliability of the Gospels, but it is certainly enlightening and shows the distortions of the debate)* Simply Jesus - N.T. Wright (He is a formidable writer on the NT texts. I haven't actually read this one, but his two more scholarly works on Jesus. But I have heard that this one is a very god summary of those.)* Mere Christianity - C.S. Lewis (It is a little bit tiresome that this book always shows up on these types of suggestions, but I think it is a finely written book and many tirades are written against Lewis and people arguing against him, gunning him down, but read it first and see for yourself.)Well that's it. My goodbye to Dawkins as far as reading his books is concerned, or should I say adieu? I might turn your pages again, but being so unable to bring in your favorite pet hate in a book that was not suppose to be about that kind of make me feel like he might be just as biased in his presentation of the theory of evolution, scientifically speaking."
269,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63251284-thijs,4,"I'm giving the book 4 stars despite the 5 stars it's worth simply because despite being an amazing book it will NOT complete it's objective: to convince History deniers that evolution is fact. At one point Dawkins mentions cracking a nut with a sledgehammer. He should've used an anvil, nay a grenade, or better yet a nuke to crack that particular nut. The book is simply too intelligent. Dawkins assumes his readers have at least somewhat reasonable arguments for refuting the evidence. A foolhardy history denier will be bored with this. A better method would have been to line out all the evidence in neat, undeniable points with a paragraph of explenation and have an appencide worth 3/4ths the book to lay out the evidence. But I get ahead of myself. On the other hand, if you are an evolution/Darwin supporter and you want to arm yourself against History Deniers, as I am, then this IS the book for you. Or if you simply want to know more about evolution, Go read it."

I haven’t read Dawkins in almost a dozen years (the only other book of his I read was The God Delusion) and I’m starting to think I owe it to myself to read more of his work. This book takes pains to explain the myriad of facts surrounding us every day that show us the path of evolution, without the need for fossil record (though this certainly helps). While at times a bit preachy, Dawkins has made a name for himself by debating creationists for years and his stance on being an anti-theist. You can feel his frustration a bit too often at times, but I’d chalk this up to the insane drivel he’s had to put up with for most of his career. Unfortunately, the people most likely to get the most out of this book are the least likely to read it. At times very technical, it kind of needs to be, as there’s no magic bullet like there is with creationism."

Before I have decided to learn about evolution, and start reading this book, I was unsure about the reality of evolution. I have thought about evolution only as a theory, not a fact. I am glad that I have read this book. It explains a lot about how life came to be and gave me a new way of thinking. I suggest this book to anyone who wants to learn about evolution, wants to see evidence for it and those living his/her life by following a religion to reconsider their beliefs with the information provided in the book. Turkey as the Top Country Denying the Fact of Evolution In the appendix of the book, Turkey was listed among the top countries that deny evolution. It wasn't a surprise considering the education system teaching religion as an unquestionable fact, evolution as a theory."

It needs to be addressed, desperately, and part of that is arming people who do trust in science with real understanding of its foundational concepts. I learned a lot about evolution and how we know it exists from this book.My problem is that Dawkins is...pretentious? Condescending? I wholeheartedly believe in evolution and am a full atheist, but even I found his attitude grating at many points. This conflicts me, because on one hand pandering to the willfully, obstinately ignorant is pointless, and possibly even detrimental. On the other, I feel like the growing mistrust of science partially stems from this kind of high-horse attitude that makes people on the fence feel attacked and defensive and more likely to turn to people who will capitalize on those feelings to manipulate and radicalize them."
273,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48534204-tristan-sherwin,4,"Overall, an excellent book—well written and explanatory. It may seem to be an unnecessary book, to some, but it is interesting how often I have encountered people, both pro-evolutionists and anti-evolutionists, who present misunderstandings of evolution. The Greatest Show on Earth is an excellent, well-arranged and digestible presentation—if you want a better grasp of it, then I think this is a good ‘go-to’ resource.A quick note re’ the rhetoric: An atheist work colleague tried putting me off Dawkins when he saw me with my nose in this. I won’t repeat the names he applied to the Prof’, but let’s just say he wasn’t a fan, especially of his tone and attitude. That said, Dawkins’ famous tone, of which I was familiar with, is actually remarkably tame here. Sure, there’s snide remarks and jibes, but, to be frank, I’ve read more repugnant rhetoric in some so-called “Christian” books (especially one I read recently)."

If he'd left out all the rants, this book would have been a third shorter. And I don't understand how he thinks the target of these assaults are going to get to hear them, as they certainly won't be reading this book. And if they were going to read it, the best way to convert them would be to write a humdinger of a neutral science book that laid out the facts with indisputable clarity and not ito indulge in immature tirades. I didn't find the science presented in a particularly coherent manner either for a book hailed as the successer to Darwin's 'Origin of Species'. But there were some pretty good examples of amazing natural phenomena that I'm still bringing up in conversation every now and again."

They're both readable works, broadly in defense of evolution by means of natural selection. In fact, I liked it as much as any Dawkins I've read, save The Selfish Gene. (Note that I've not yet read many of his books, but I have especially high hopes for The Extended Phenotype.)Most of the ideas were not novel to me, save for the chapter on embryology (which was eye-opening). Most of the supporting evidence, however, was new to me (I am in no sense a biologist). If you're interested in biology, and specifically evolution, and can stomach intermittent diatribes about the epistemic inferiority of arguments against it, I weakly recommend this book."

Plus, this is aimed mostly as a general audience with a basic biology knowledge (enough to know what gene and natural selection and population biology are in a basic term). Still, it has some very nice examples of biological anatomy and behaviour, plus the exasperated arguments are always a treat to read (I'm delighted to read the 'higher animals', 'more intelligent' bits, it's like reading my own screaming every time someone asks me, 'but which one is smarter, dolphins or dogs?', because it DOESN'T MATTER! Anyway, I digress, but to see someone who's just as frustrated as I am makes me feel not so odd after all!)Haven't read Dawkins in awhile and the style was exactly as I remember it to be.

Really great information, some of which I already knew from college, a lot of which I didn't know. Really helps to bring a lot of separate facts into context with each other. However, Dawkins clearly hates religion and makes it quite clear the multiple, multiple times he slams them (Christianity particularly) in the book. I think this virulence against religious people is probably where a lot of the criticism of him comes from. If I were religious at all, even if I believed in evolution (I know Dawkins hates that phrase, work with me), I would still be offended by this book. I'm not religious at all and part of me was occasionally offended on behalf of religious people. Dawkins is clearly a genius scholar, but a little leeway in his tolerance of other people's beliefs would not go amiss, and might lead to more religious people reading him."

I love it. also loved seeing his musings throughout the book. in a sort of conversation with the reader.I had read two of Dawkins's earlier books and I try to listen to his public lectures and panel talks as well. Therefore some of the topics covered here were repetitive for me, but the book clarified a few lingering questions in my mind (such as why the cave dwelling animals abandoned pigments and eyes - beyond energy saving), and made me think a few points that I had never imagined before (such as origami-like embryo development, the evolution of evolvability, etc).Great read."

I was enthralled by Dawkins’ arguments in that book. Mr. Dawkins has become a staunch anti-creationist in more recent years and this book is his treatment of the real evidence for evolution that is often hand-waved away by creationists with little or no understanding of the topic.This is the third book in my list of books that I ask creationists to read for more than a casual and often false understanding of evolution. Dawkins's style is easy to read and understand.Other books that I recommend for the subject of evolution and that I have reviewed here are:Bill Nye – Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of CreationJerry Coyne – Why Evolution is True"

This is book is very necessary as even today, many people deny that evolution happened. Books like these are important and should also be read by people who do believe in evolution, so they can persuade those who do not.Dawkins is very passionate and some might say ""aggressive"" in his writing style. I think this shows the amount of heart he has on the topic, and it makes reading through his explanations of relatively complex scientific theories that much more interesting. This book is not just in favor of evolution, it is also a book against creationism, and that is a marked distinction.Dawkins is a prolific science writer, and this book is a good example."

But even with no science background, Dawkins will help you wade through the technical terms to understand how the world got this way from it's early beginnings - and also how we worked it out as well."
283,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5696672-james,5,"A fantastic, well thought out, thoroughly explained case for the biological evidence of evolution by natural selection. I read this because I have sadly never had a class on evolution, and while I understood and accepted the general idea, I want to be able to logically defend it. He covers topics ranging from embryology, natural and artificial selection, macro evolution, timescales used to measure the age of fossils, ‘missing links and persons’, plate tectonics, and vestigiality. That sentence sounds mind numbing, but he makes them fascinating. They are weaved together well and communicated skillfully, as only a passionate and intelligent evolutionary biologist like Dawkins can do.In my opinion, Dawkins has covered a few extremely important sections here; everything else falls aside as nice backup evidence for me. • Putting to rest (he is obviously not the first to say this, but I am ashamed to admit that this was the first place I learned it) the very, very tired “argument” that this is “only a theory”, he reminds us that there are confusingly two definitions of the word, one being the hypothetical definition that is most readily called to mind, and the second being a scientific consensus as the observed explanation for a given phenomenon. Hopefully this will do its part to stop those trying to make it seem as if it is in question, you can only question evolution’s acceptance if you also do not accept the theory of gravity. He then addresses that no one is claiming there to be an intermediate between a horse and a panda, as we share common ancestors. This refutes any claims that we evolved from apes, because we share a common ancestor, we haven’t replaced the fucking animals.• He describes a really interesting experiment where 12 flasks of E. coli reproduced (asexually) through through 45,000 generations. This experiment took place over twenty years, and each of the 12 groups was kept isolated, representing 12 distinct possibilities for something to happen. They were all kept warm and provided a nutrient broth. Bacteria doesn’t fuck around as far as speed is concerned, and they all evolved to process their glucose more efficiently, growing in size and population. Interestingly, most found different ways to to this, but two changed 59 genes in the exact same way. Dawkins mentions that the odds of this happening are “ stupefyingly large”, yet it happened. This is both an example of evolution happening in our observable lifetime, and more importantly, a disproval of a common argument of irreducible complexity (i.e. life was far too complex to have happened randomly). If this can be achieved of bacteria (comparable to a few hundred million years of slower evolving life), imagine what can happen in the far larger time earth has been around.• In what I consider the best chapter in the book, Dawkins uses vestigial genes, organs, and various anatomical structures as an extremely convincing argument that not only do we share a common ancestor with other life on earth, but that if there was a creator, he/she has inexplicably created several things that are quite clunky. This chapter is brilliant, as it shows (as only one of many excellent examples) the insane length the laryngeal nerve has extended in us (bypassing the goddamn larynx and wrapping around a main artery leaving the heart, and then connecting to the larynx. This is even crazier in the giraffe, where it takes a detour of almost 15 feet to get to its destination. This, along with other things, such as the massive inefficiency of our eyes, sinuses (which make perfect sense if we were still quadrupeds), and other examples make no sense to be created as such, but are explained perfectly by natural selection, and the marginal cost of these inefficient flaws being so slight over time as to take the detour without causing damage. This bizarre rerouting is explained as such: when mammals evolved away from fish ancestors, direct routes to gills became complicated by elongation of necks and circulatory systems. Hell, even the vas deferens shown here takes a ridiculous pathway that makes no goddamned sense to be designed as such. He spends some time at the first theorizing as to why this idea has met such resistance. He discusses Plato’s idea of essentialism, e.g. any triangle that is drawn is but a shadow of the true, euclidian triangle, where lines are truly and infinitely parallel, angles golden, etc. The story of Noah and the ark follows this same example, for example, we think a rabbit is a rabbit is a rabbit. But the rabbit (or any other living thing, really), is not the same rabbit of the past, nor will it be the rabbit of the future.He states early on that this is not meant to refute religion, but you start to see that happen inherently through some of the conclusions of science. He claims to not want to argue about it, but let’s not kid ourselves; Dawkins can be bit of a dick. Seriously, would it be fucking possible to read a book about evolution or deity directed design without the author trying to verbally punch the opposing side in the dick? It weakens the argument, and it is so overdone that me bitching about this problem is even a cliche. The cheap shots aren’t overwhelming though, and so are easily skipped over.Recommend this to any and everyone, but I fear that some may struggle with keeping an open mind (and avoiding becoming inflamed by Dawkins being Dawkins at times). Emotion is inherently irrational, but if you can manage to keep a clear head, the conclusions of this book might make it extremely hard for you to defend a creation story. "
284,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31325228-arara,5,"love him or hate him, Richard Dawkins has a captivating writing style, that makes it easy to enjoy such a heavy topic, and learn about it. even though, I believe in god and disagree with him over some of the topics in this book. I can't have but respect for him. anyone who reads his books sense the sincerity and devotion from this man. Evolution is a controversial subject, and people have strong opinions either with or against it. this book is a great source to learn about this subject for the ones who don't know much about it. I personally believe that god is overseeing and directing the evolution. Furthermore, a lot of people link the evolution with atheism and this is wrong. In parts, because if we do that, religion is on the losing side of the equation. "
285,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13245519-meha-jadhav,4,"This book by Dawkins is essentially aimed at giving a better understanding of evolution. Through extensive repertoire of examples and eloquent use of analogy, the writer conveys the essential themes of evolution including selection, speciation, drift, phylogeny and development. However, the book also comes with it's pitfalls. Firstly, the book is directed at those who deny the existence of evolution and all through the author repeatedly refers to this audience. It can be annoying. It would have been better if the book were solely with the aim of explaining evolution to a curious reader. Overall, the book effectively conveys the major points about evolution quite precisely. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a better understanding of evolution; biologist or not."
286,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18010472-athenaq,4,"Another book that took me forever to finish it. Starting chapters were great, flooded with amazing examples from nature and bringing a wider perspective on evolution. However, halfway through the book things started to get pretty molecular and, since I studied that aspect thoroughly at university, quite boring. For someone who is not familiar with biological and molecular basis of evolution, this book is a very good guide. It smoothly explains even the difficult parts of evolution and is written so clear that even a person with no idea about evolution, biology and molecules can understand it. That and the starting chapters are the main reason I gave this book 4 stars. If I hadn't been so familiar with the field, it would get a straight 5."
287,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5340946-alvaro,3,"""The greatest show on Earth"" is an insightful book with some awe moments. It describes in depth an exhaustive list of arguments for Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. I used to think there was not much else to know about this theory, beyond what we learned at school. But the empirical evidence described by this book will certainly add onto what most of us knows. I found the descriptions of experiments particularly interesting and fun. As en educated European reader, the recurrent criticism of creationism across the book seemed uninteresting. But Dawkins has a point in that this is a cause for concern in America. It is a worthwhile read that will certainly increase the reader's interest in the natural sciences, or in spending some holidays in the Galapagos."
288,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55422230-amanja,3,"i found it hard to rate this book. it's not that it's inaccurate or difficult to read, it's that i don't know who it's for. anyone who has a foundational knowledge of evolution may find themselves bored by a bunch of facts they already know without many new examples or experiments and those who don't may find themselves insulted. the main problem is that dawkins directly attacks those who need this book the most. i also found it uncouth that he frequently cites his own books as evidence. read this book if you want a baseline understanding of how to talk about evolution conversationally. but don't give it to someone who needs a full conversion, they will likely stop reading when they're treated like imbeciles."
289,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85189823-helmertz,4,"I really liked what is being said in this book: lots of interesting facts are brought forth that I didn't know about the subject before. However, HOW it was presented was not always my cup of tea. I do understand professor Dawkins wanted the book not to just be pure facts and make the reading more interesting, which he many times accomplishes throughout the book. But when it is not accomplished, it feels like those parts could have been presented short and more on point instead, otherwise it feels a lil like a bunch of 'fillers'. I heavily recommend this book if you want to know a lot of interesting ways evolution has worked its magic and I want to thank Professor Dawkins for this book and his contribution not only to the field but also to the world."
290,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63087015-hossan-rose,4,"In 426 pages Dawkins presents evidences about evolution from paleontology, embryology, molecular biology, modern medicine. He points to basic blocks in mammaliam skeletal system, how artificial selection has brought about 100s of varieties of dogs, how natural selection works with examples, shows our cousinship with mammals, debunks intelligent design by pointing to internal anatomy of giraffe/humans, throws light on evolutionary race between prey and predator and details the experiments which was performed in lab to demonstrate evolution. His writing style is difficult to follow as it is not tied around a single point and at times he shows his frustration about ignorance of people to obvious truth in the book."
291,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99417334-nathan,3,"I suppose it is an artifact of the audience to which Dawkins likely addresses the book, but most statements made within are repeated far more times than I felt were necessary to convey the intended meaning. For instance, rather than repeat time and time again why a particular trait is useful to examine in light of evolutionary processes, it would be sufficient to simply state the conclusion once.That being said, the work was rather interesting and showed me several aspects of Darwin's theory that I haven't previously considered. However, I believe it could have been presented with less bashing of the 'history deniers' than he included. I understand why he feels this way, but it tints the book's statements of fact to almost appear as opinionated bias instead."
292,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22173481-buddy-don,4,"I suppose one either enjoys Dawkins or not, depending on one's beliefs. I find him utterly convincing and enjoy his use of metaphors to explain the absurdity of what some people believe. In this book, he develops the useful idea of ""history deniers,"" those who would insist that the earth is only 10,000 years old, that humans supposedly lived with dinosaurs, that kind of nonsense. I haven't read all of his books, this being the third, but I seem to detect a pattern, that he has mostly the same kinds of things to say over and over again. They need saying, expecially in a world such as ours, where >40% of people in the USA believe in an earth aged about 6,000-10,000 years. "
293,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30012279-jon,4,"This book is well written and covers a lot of ground. Richard Dawkins occasionally takes an adversarial position against creationists, throughout the book. This is understandable because he has spent his life trying to increase public understanding of evolution, and has been met with some staggeringly silly arguments. However, creationists are the very people he presumably is trying to convince with this book which lays out the evidence so plainly. I worry that some people who might have been persuaded may have stopped reading because of the perception of antagonism. I would encourage anyone who would like to know more about evolution by natural selection to read this book."
294,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80449241-louella-esguerra,2,"This book convinced me, nada. It surprises me all the time that certain scientists can conclude evolution. You would have to be alive for centuries in order to properly test this theory. I did learn that scientists make great assumptions. For example in the book he says something like 'Evolution occurs much faster “centuries” rather than the original “billions of years” as previously assumed’. That is one massive jump. How do you go from billions of years to centuries? You do this by making a mammoth assumption to start with and end with another questionable assumption. Too quick to come to conclusions about something they can't test. Makes me wonder if they messed up the big bang theory timescale as well."
295,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273251-gelitron,4,"My first deep dive into the subject of evolution. I find it a fascinating subject and I imagine I'll be reading a lot more about it. I'm not a fan of Dawkins' writing style. Like many scientists I know they can be excessively wordy, I think this partly comes from wanting your audience from all walks of life to be on the same page of understanding the content. What I saw to be a common critique of this book, and I agree, is the condescending tone that Dawkins gives off toward the ""deniers."" It would serve him well, if he truly wants to reach the deniers, to write with a more inclusive point of view."
296,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,5,"We are in 1999, the SHOW is going on right now… just look through that window. All living things are your distant cousins, Dawkins shouts sitting on evidence. Of course, that tree is a more distant cousin than those birds over there. Deal with it. Because your meals are feasts over very distant relatives. And here comes evidence on how evolution has been creating this formidable diversity of living things. Including YOUR species, which managed to figure out the show using science. THE greatest show on Earth, the only game in town. Coolest book title ever. We just don't know how the game got started... Takeaway: a bat and you are mammals sharing a homologous skeleton. Google that, BATMAN. "
297,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87995061-houssam-kotob,3,"Regardless of the marvelous information and scientific facts and experiments explained in the book. And of course the easy and story-like writing style of Dawkins. It seems that Dawkins is writing this book not to explain evolution in a objective way, but it seems he is writing because he is very much irritated by creationists. It felt like this book was made to reply to creationists logic and rational more then just explaining and educating us about the greatest show on earth. The unfortunate thing is that he is replying to, and quoting ideas of, brainwashed people. I am a religious man and my faith grew even stronger after reading this book. "
298,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7502234-wade-stotts,2,"A Grand Evasion. Professor Dawkins shows no evidence that he’s reflected on the arguments of his critics. He lumps them in with those who deny the Holocaust. Calls them “history deniers.”He makes sure, though, to spend pages and pages on the “only a theory” and “why are there still chimps” methods of critiquing evolution. No mention at all of the ID books written by PhD scientists and philosophers of science. I mean...come on, man.Here are some books that argue against this sort of thing:“The Kingdom of Speech” by Tom Wolfe“The Other Side of the Coyne” by Doug Wilson“Discerning Truth” by Jason Lisle“Icons of Evolution” by Jonathan Wells"
299,059306173X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16961185-long-williams,4,"A great companion to Origin of the Species. Well researched and very readable. But I think Dawkins has wasted a lot of time and space denigrating the non-believers. So much so that I think it takes something away from the quality of this books. The constant poking at creationists is clearly overdone and quite unnecessary as seen in the appendices. The author has got to come to terms that creationists will never change their views by reading this sort of book and that there is a large number of scientists that are religious. Einstein was one. Still a highly recommended read for people that believe in facts, but not so good for people who believe in faith."
