I hate it when I hear someone say that Darwin says, ""we come from monkeys."" because that is not the case.his theory is on EVOLUTION, not monkeys. all he wanted people to understand was adaptation and survival of the fittest is really a simple concept, and daily life- proves just that.his theories don't have to impede on your beliefs in God. he was a Christian man, himself, but could still see the science before his very eyes. give it a shot if you are intrigued by species changing, growing, dying, extinction, over time..."

2,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-sean-barrs,3,"Charles Darwin changed the world when he wrote this book.I mean if you think about it logically, no other book has had such a powerful impact on the way humanity views the earth; yes, we have countless religious doctrine, but never before had there been a book that so drastically alternated our perceptions of the mechanisms that are behind our existence. I’m not talking about on a spiritual level, a level of ideas that cannot be scientifically proven or unproven, but on an actual physical level. These ideas weren’t accepted overnight, few things are, but over time they began to be more and more accepted. Even today we still refer to Darwin’s ideas as “the theory of Evolution” despite the fact that it is now empirically proven as to how we got where we are. It is, generally speaking, a culturally accepted idea. The fact that we still refer to something most accept to be fact as a theory is a phenomenon. It’s unusual. Contrary to popular belief, Darwin did not seek to debunk any religious beliefs. In fact, the research he carried out put him in constant confusion about his own Christianity. For a time he believed religion and science could work together; he believed that science helped to explain some of the ideas in creation stories, but eventually he stopped believing. He lost his faith and embraced the logical mind of the scientist; again, he didn’t seek to counter religion. It was just a simple case that over time he could no longer personally and logically believe in it: it could not be proved rationally. As a student of literature, as a lover of stories, history, nature and narrative, I find myself drawn to ideas of religion and science. For anybody to call religion groundless (I say this from my own agnostically driven perspective) is to divulge a massive lack of judgment. Without wanting to offend any atheists, or anybody of faith, we will never know either way which is ultimately right. But, I do most ardently think that we can only begin to understand what it is to be human by reading and exploring the ideas of both religion and science. They have both been perpetuated by man, so I think we owe it to ourselves to try and understand why. Some of you may have noticed how eclectic my reading tastes have become. I pretty much read anything. I have many reading lists-both shortlists and longlists- but four works I simply need to read in my lifetime are The Qur'an (I have a beautiful edition I picked up from a used book store- a late 19th Century edition), The King James Bible (I’ve recently finished genesis), Relativity: The Special and the General Theory by Einstein and A Brief History of Time by Hawkins. The point is, I think in today’s world we need to understand both religion and science. Both parts form a larger part of our society. Well, anyway, that was a rather large digression. I read the origin of species back in 2013 for the first time. My second reading was more of a gloss over of certain key ideas, and a revisit of passages that I flagged down before. The ideas in the book are obviously ground-breaking, though not the first historical example of them. But, for me, this book is more of a slog than leisure driven reading. The writing isn’t great and it is terribly repetitive at times, but I suppose that’s what comes with observing the natural world in such scientific detail. From the findings here Darwin would eventually go on to lay down his full arguments in  The Decent of Man,  a read that sounds more compelling and all encompassing. So it’s another one to add to my list!"
3,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"Dear Carol,Thank you for your mail, and of course I remember meeting you on the flight last month! It was a very interesting discussion and I'm still thinking about it. The semester has now started here at Creationist U and I am working hard, but I found time to read the book you recommended. And I'm glad I did, because it was really a lot better than I thought it would be.I guess I was expecting Darwin to be like Richard Dawkins, but he was respectful of religious ideas. And it was great that he liked Paley's Natural Theology so much... he says he almost knew it by heart! We read Paley last year in History of Creation Science, and I also thought it was a terrific book. So I could see Darwin was an open-minded person who was prepared to look at both sides of the question. Richard Dawkins could learn a lot from that!The way he sets up his argument is smart. He starts off talking about how stockbreeders can improve their breed - well, I'm a country boy, and I could see he knew his stuff. This is someone who's spent time down at the farm and understands how country people feel about livestock. And I liked that he'd done all that work raising pigeons. Not the kind of scientist who just hangs out at the lab all day. After that, he introduces his Big Idea about the survival of the fittest and he almost made evolution sound sensible. He's a good writer. And then he was honest when he explained all the problems with the theory. He really got me - I was wondering if he was going to mention any of that stuff, and a page later he came out and said just what I was thinking! Nice work, Mr. Darwin. But I did wonder what he was doing, cutting out the ground from under his own feet. He said he could explain things like the eye and how bees could evolve to make honeycombs, but even if he was real good at making his case, I wasn't buying any.So by the halfway mark, I figured he was done, but like ol' Dubya used to say, I misunderestimated him - he'd saved all his best stuff for last. He had some good shots! I got to admit, he made me think. Why does God put the species that look alike in the same place? Like he says, it is weird how you have a mountain range, and there's one kind of animals and plants on one side, and a different kind on the other side. God's ways are inscrutable to us, but why does He care about those mountains? And the islands, they were even worse. He says if you look at the species on a lot of islands, you don't have any mammals there, except you do have bats. Why? I could see where he was going with this one - the bats could blow in off the mainland and evolve, but other mammals couldn't do that. I admit it, I don't have an answer, except maybe God's testing our faith again. But I can see not everyone will like that. I'm still wondering about those bats! Okay Mr. Darwin, I said it already but I'll say it again, you were a smart guy. So how's life at MIT? And I hope you read the book I recommended to you. A Canticle for Leibowitz will show you that faith and science have more in common than you might think!Take care,Bob"
4,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3712181-stephen-m,4,"Edits for NR because I love him that much. This:""This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection. Variations neither useful not injurious would not be affected by natural selection, and would be left a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic.""We shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change, for instance, of climate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost immediately undergo a change, and some species might become extinct. We may conclude, from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound together, that any change in the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants, independently of the change of climate itself, would most seriously affect many of the others. If the country were open on its borders, new forms would certainly immigrate, and this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants. Let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be. But in the case of an island, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up, if some of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the area been open immigration, these same places would have been seized on by intruders. In such case, ever slight modification, which in the course of ages chanced to arise, and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions, would tend to be preserved and natural selection would thus have free scope for the work of improvement. ""We have reason to believe, as stated in the first chapter, that a change in the conditions of life, by specially acting on the reproductive systems, cause or increases variability; and in the foregoing case the conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a changes, and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by giving a better chance of profitable variations occurring; and unless profitable variations do occur, natural selection can do nothing."" (I DIDN'T WRITE THIS. DARWIN DID IN THIS BOOK.)Or This."

I'm surprised at how adapted we have become (or at least the segment of those people on the planet who don't reject Darwin's theory of natural selection as counter to their own idea of the way God makes and shakes) to Darwin's revolutionary idea(s). Like with many of the pantheon of scientific geniuses (Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, etc) there was a bit of random chance involved. The ground was ready for Darwin's adapted seed. There were enough scholars and scientists and rationalists around to carry his idea(s) hither and his theory thither. So while this book, and Darwin himself, were both stellar examples of scientific restraint, the force and momentum of OftS can't be under appreciated. It was just the right time and right place for a scientific revolution. Darwin and his little book walked by a labour of scientific mouldywarps who happened to find themselves on the chalk cliffs of science, pushed those sterile hybrids off, and never looked back. Evolve bitches!"

It's almost complete transcended its role as a seminal scientific tome and become a legitimate historic artefact. You can't review a historic artefact.This is a fantastic read, even viewed in a completely different way to how it would have been read at the time. It really is amazing how much evolutionary biology Darwin was able to formulate almost a century before Watson and Crick's discovery of DNA. It boggles the mind what Darwin could have been capable of if he'd had access to the last 150 years of genetic research."

It was sometimes a bit tough to read because of the depth into detail. If I were an anthropologist I'm sure I would more appreciate that detail, but as a layman it did at times seem too thick. If I were lost in an uncivilized world and had only two books, I would want a Webster's dictionary and this Origin of Species. The dictionary to learn word definitions and this book to learn about the flora and fauna around me. For all those people who get upset because you think this book may contradict another one you are so fond of, just be very careful not to fall off the edge of the flat 6,ooo year old earth......mgc "
8,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,4,"Too much to unpack here and not an easy read as it was written 150 years ago. Despite all of the knocks against reading Origin for enjoyment, I can only express extreme awe and state the obvious - how much of a genius Darwin was. From his theory of natural selection to glacier theory, to hybrid plants, to fossil theory and a dozen other biological and geological theories that he developed or contributed to, it is remarkable to me how very little Darwin got wrong in a book that was 600 pages long. We live in a science based world, or at least we like to think so, and this man manages to remain so relevant. It is the scientific method at its best, one part rigorous logic, one part observation, and one part intuition. The recipe works."
9,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,4,"Decry or applaud it, there's no question this work has had a profound effect not just on science, but the culture at large. What I wouldn't read this book for is the science, or in an effort to either defend or refute the argument for evolution. The core of Darwin's argument certainly is still what was taught in my Catholic high school biology class (taught by a nun). In a nutshell, the theory is that given there are wide-ranging subtle Variations among organisms, the Malthusian Struggle for Existence causes by means of Natural Selection of the inheritable traits that are the best Adaptations to the environment the Origin of Species or as Darwin calls it, the ""theory of descent with modification.""But, after all, this book is now over 150 years old. Science is about explaining natural phenomenon and correcting mistakes through observation, experimentation and falsification--not dogma--and so is always a moving target. I know that. But I still raised an eyebrow when in the first chapter of the book Darwin said he believed the ""most frequent cause of variability"" was caused by the experiences of the parents before conception--such as cows' udders being larger in countries where they're milked because the habit of milking by itself alters in the reproductive organs what is inherited by the next generation. WTF Darwin? When Darwin first propounded his theory of evolution (a word never used in the book by the way) through natural selection, Mendel had yet to discover the basic principles of genetics in his experiments with peas and Watson and Crick had yet to unravel the structure of DNA. Nor was continental drift known and understood, so there were notable gaps in Darwin's reasoning that has since been filled. Stephen Jay Gould, one of the staunchest defenders and popularizers of evolution is famous within science particularly for where he differs from Darwin. Darwin thought changes in species were very gradual. Gould favors ""punctuated equilibrium"" where there are rapid changes followed by long periods of stability. That's why scientists today talk of the ""theory of evolution,"" not of ""Darwinism"" as if a scientific principle is an unchanging creed and Origin of Species scripture.So, the book is dated and filled with lots of details I'm sure are just plain wrong and might be onerous to unlearn. That does make me reluctant to give this book top marks despite its profound impact. Someone interested in modern evolutionary science would be better off picking up a copy of a book by Jared Diamond, Richard Dawkins, Carl Sagan (although by now I suppose his very readable Dragons of Eden is dated) or Stephen Jay Gould. So, was there no value in reading On the Origin of Species? I wouldn't say that. It's surprisingly readable--or at least understandable. There are definitely dry passages that were a slog to get through, my eyes glazing over as Darwin gave example after exhaustive example to make his points. However, I couldn't help but be impressed by the knowledge of nature shown by his wide-ranging examples from every continent from ants and bees and algae to pigeons to zebras. Given the way he cited various authorities and spoke about his own experiments, I definitely felt that here was a master generalist and enthusiast on nature. Moreover Darwin does have a gift for metaphor and illustrative examples. I was particularly taken by his explanation of ""inter-crossing"" and the function of sex in creating biological diversity. I also was struck by how cautious and civil in tone Darwin is in his arguments, devoting an entire chapter on what he saw could be the flaws and holes in his theory--particularly the issues of transitions between species and intermediate forms. Bottom line? Arguably this specific book had as much influence on the literature and politics of the next century as Freud or Marx, so I think there is historical value in reading this, preferably in the first edition (which is what I read) that exploded upon the world in 1859."

""If, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up, for instance, to the third stage, and were put into one finished up to the sixth stage, so that much of its work was already done for it, far from feeling the benefit of this, it was much embarrassed, and, in order to complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the third stage.""
On the Origin of Species is one of the most important books ever written. Although a lot of people-scientists, naturalists and the like-were coming to the same kind of conclusions, Darwin was one of the first who wrote it all down in a profound and concise manner and used his influence and friends to make it a well-known theory: the theory of evolution.There is only one thing you need to know before you read this, and that is that Charles Darwin was a very religious man. This is a five-star worthy book, but my ignorance of this fact caused me to be so infuriated by the end that I couldn't bring myself to rate it higher. It is written exquisitely: if you've read anything particularly science-related in this day and age you will notice how science-related it is. The words, the terms, they're all very much science-related and it can be so difficult to really understand and comprehend what you're reading because it's almost in another language.This is written very much in the way any Victorian novel would have been written. There is a smattering of Latin terms, but for the most part it is easy to understand if you get in the right frame of mind as you would a Classic. It can be heavy going, however, as the paragraphs are long and often repetitive, but his thoughts on pigeons are the most endearing things I've come across: this is Victorian science and it's all about pigeons.To go back to why I only rated it three stars: throughout at no point did Darwin mention God or the creation of the world, except perhaps in very subtle reference and the theory of evolution and instinct reigns supreme, until the very end when he concludes that God did not create the world 1859 years, but millions of years ago, instead, and that all current flora and fauna are descended from the original God-created animals. I should have expected something like this but I did not and that annoyed me more than it should have. Of course, it makes the entire thing that much more impressive, though the horrific experience Darwin must have gone through as he tried to make a religious-belief co-live with a scientific frame of mind would have been supremely agonising. It's wholly my fault for this ignorance, but I still can't bring myself to heighten it.It's still one of the most important books ever written and its legacy will never become diminished, but it is often repetitive and sometimes out-dated with quite a lengthy part about geology which is fairly unremarkable, but his amusing and enjoyable experiments with flowers and his views on pigeons are just a delight.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy"
11,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"My book group selected this book for discussion probably because of the historic impact it has had on the field of science. However, I found it to be very worthy of respect from a literary viewpoint. Charles Darwin's writing comes across as a methodical thinker and patient explainer to many recalcitrant readers who are determined not to believe a word he says. He had me convinced after only a couple dozen pages, but he kept doing what seemed to me to be piling on observation after observation, explanation after explanation, until after a while I felt like crying out, ""Enough already, I believe!"" Frankly, I was impressed by the breadth of knowledge about the natural world already accumulated by the middle of the 19th century as demonstrated by this book. There are obvious things poor old Darwin didn't know about, one of them being the laws of genealogy discovered by Gregor Johann Mendel. Mendel was a contemporary of Darwin, and I have heard that a published copy of Mendel's study was on Darwin's book shelves but it hadn't been opened or read. Of course Darwin wasn't the only person who ignored Mendel. Mendel's work wasn't appreciated for its contribution to understanding of inherited traits until after his death. Meanwhile Darwin is writing this book giving many observations regarding the variability of crossings of various plants and animals, but doesn't understand why.Also, Darwin was plagued with physicists of the time who calculated that earth couldn't be as old as needed for Darwin's theory of natural selection to accomplish all the required changes. The physicists were basing their calculations of the rate cooling of the core of the earth. Of course they were wrong; what they didn't know about was radioactive decay which gives off heat they weren't making allowances for. It turns out the earth is even older than Darwin would have guessed.And of course the really big advance of science that Darwin didn't know about was the DNA double helix. Darwin insists that life forms need to be classed according to genealogy, and he speculates that in the future scientists will be able to classify life forms more accurately as more knowledge is obtained about them. Darwin would be amazed to know how precisely genealogy can be determined these days. For example, it can be determined that humans are more closely related to fungi than to photosynthetic plants.I listened to the audio version of this book. This is an example of a book that is much easier to listen to than to read because of all the big Latin words used in describing species. Having the words read aloud made them fit into the context of the sentence much better than if I were trying to read (and probably skip over) those unfamiliar words. There were six editions of ""Origin of Species"" in Darwin's life time. It could be argued that the 1859 edition is the second best version of this book with the 1860 British edition being slightly better in that it contains some insignificant, but non-substantive, corrections. The editions of 1861, 1866, 1869, and 1872 are all inferior. In them Darwin made changes and expansions in an effort to meet the objections that arose during those times. The modifications expanded the book and clouded the argument. Since most of the objections that were raised would be regarded as silly today, Darwin's arguments against them are of interest for social history, but not for Darwin's theory. I think that most published copies today are based on the 1872 edition. If you have an earlier edition you will find that it is shorter and, as indicated above, is probably better.The following quotation is from the sixth edition and not in the earlier editions. It is from a section of the book on instincts and follows a couple paragraphs discussing the habit of some birds to lay their eggs in the nests of other bird species. Mr. Darwin has just sighted some of the observations of the nesting habits of a type of cowbird [Molothrus Bonariensis] written by a naturalist colleague. ""Mr. Hudson is a strong disbeliever in evolution, but he appears to have been much struck by the imperfect instincts of the Molothrus Bonariensis that he quotes my words and asks, 'must we consider these habits not as an especially endowed or created instincts but as small consequences of one general law, namely transitions?' ""I take from the above that Darwin was enjoying the irony of a naturalist from the creationist camp finding it difficult to attribute to God the endowment of the slothful nest making habits to the cowbird. Since the behavior is repugnant it must have been caused by that old nasty evolution stuff (i.e. the work of the devil)."

Or, perhaps you are a student participating in one of nation's modern and progressive science classes, learning about the Origins of Man, but confused by the lack of scientifically observable studies missing from your text books.

13,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48327873-markus,5,"On The Origin of SpeciesDarwin (1809-1882)Darwin published this book in 1859. It is his scientific treaty based on the idea of all organism living on the earth to be descendants from one or several original progenitors.The work is mostly a transcription of the author’s notes throughout his years of study and his famous voyage on the HMS Beagle to the Southern Hemisphere. It had likely been addressed to the quite sceptic scientific community of his time, to demonstrate his idea and to bring supporting material enough to convince and to proof its validity. Apart from the excessively rich scientific vocabulary, the book is pleasant reading. A few quotations will give some insight: ""This Abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. I cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements, and I must trust to the reader reposing some confidence into my accuracy. No doubt errors will have crept in, though I hope I have always been cautious in trusting to good authorities alone. In considering the origin of species, it is quite conceivable that a naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryonic relations, their geographical distribution, geological successions, and other such facts, might come to the conclusion that species had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties from other species.”The work is developed in chapters:Variations under Domestications,Variations in Nature,Struggle for existence,Natural selection; or Survival of the fittest,Laws of variation,Difficulties of the theory, Miscellaneous objections to the theory of Natural Selection,Instinct,Hybridism,On the imperfection of the Geological Record,On the Geological Succession of Organic Beings Geographical distribution,Mutual affinities of organic beings, Embryology,Quotations from Recapitulation and Conclusion: ""I see no good reason why the view given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of anyone. It could be just as noble a conception for a Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws. The belief that species were immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the history of the world was believed to be of short duration; and now that we have acquired some idea of the lapse of time, we are apt to assume, that the geological record would have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species. Now, things are wholly changed, and almost every naturalist admits the great principle of evolution, over the old belief in the creation of species from the dust of the earth. The laws of Nature, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to the struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural selection, and the Extinction of less-improved forms. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one.”I have much enjoyed reading this book and am glad not to have missed it. I recommend it to anyone interested in Natural History or just in knowledge as such."

At times, it was hard getting through this book, mainly because it's dense and sometimes Darwin tended to drag and not get to the point, but I'm glad I finally read it. However, I think I should have read this at another point of my life - I mean, it was exasperating to read something I had just studied at a biology course I was taking. I still don't regret reading this. If you're considering on whether picking this book or not (yeah, I'm actually recommending it), I suggest you do it between your leisure reading because it can get tedious if you swallow it all at once."

I was never taught the Theory of Natural Selection in school but only heard it mentioned when some adults scoffed at it. Thankfully, my natural talents steered me away from a career in Biology or Genetics, so this lack of knowledge didn’t affect my career prospects. It just affected my understanding of the world. I learned years later the basics of the theory but this just piqued my interest about reading the actual book. I always have problems with Victorian authors (very long sentences) so the print version gave me some difficulty. If it weren’t for Richard Dawkins' excellent narration, I don’t know that I could have enjoyed this book as much.I’m almost shocked that I was able to follow the concepts herein as well as I did. I am amazed that Mr. Darwin could write this book (one of the most important in the history of science and the whole world) in such clear, concise way, that a person with minimal understanding of the topic in general could follow along so well. The concepts are explained logically with tons of examples so the reader is not left dangling wondering what he meant. Not only that, but he also writes beautifully and the prose is sometimes as poetic as it is instructive:As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications.From the beginning, I understood this wasn’t a book I could listen in one sitting or while doing other things. I took it slowly and that allowed me to think things through. It made me think a lot about our place in the world and how sometimes we think we are above the system when in fact, we are just one creature among millions and not the most important in the grand scheme of nature (if we were to go extinct, the planet will continue merrily along.) It made reflect in our attempts to control nature, to see change as a bad thing, and our hubris that we can keep in check a process that has moved relentlessly forward for millions of years.Darwin was certainly cognizant that his theory wouldn’t be accepted immediately: “Any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory.”  But I think he would be surprised by how much discussion there is still going on about the subject, specially given that DNA evidence has already proven he was correct in thinking that every living being sprouted from a single progenitor (mind staggering as it seems.)As I already mentioned, Richard Dawkins is the narrator for this audiobook and he did an amazing job - you could tell he's probably read this book a million times and knows it like the back of his hand. His diction was very precise and clear; and his enthusiasm for the subject was contagious. It almost feels like Darwin is the one speaking. Overall, a must read for anybody with an interest in learning how we came into being. "

Not because it’s poorly written, archaically worded, or just a boring topic- all untrue- but because the ideas were so influential that the entire book is just one big “duh, yeah, I’m already on board with this, you don’t need to harp on so much, I see what you’re getting at and I agree it makes sense.” (I remember a similar feeling with Singer’s Animal Liberation, for example.)  This is obviously one of those books. If you’ve got a high school diploma, you already understand natural selection, and if you’re interested in biology at all, you probably also understand the evidentiary support/finer tunings of the theory.  Essentially this is like, 700 pages of Darwin giving evidence for his theory by listing out different animals or plants and discussing how the variations imply a common ancestor/his theory and how they disprove his opponents’ arguments. Pigeons with X number of tail feathers, horses with leg stripes, radishes versus rutabagas. Lots and lots and lots of details about things like this.  I’m glad I read it because Darwin is clearly anxious nobody will believe his wild new theory, since he throws so much evidence at the reader. This serves, to me, as a fantastic reminder that this was, in fact, a radical kooky theory at the time and nothing in science should be taken for granted as truth because there is always, always always, a shakeup on the horizon that will make us question everything. And no era is immune to that- every era has thought itself “finally at the truth” and every time we’ve been wrong. As we are now, in ways we can’t even imagine yet."
18,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29868756-katie-bananas,5,"Celebratory 2:00 am review, just great!!! When I finished this, I was definitely clapping my hands!! This is not a story if you are one of those who are mad excited to read it. It's a tome of its size that is equivalent to an encyclopedia with depth, width, and value. It's the densest nonfiction I have read. It is an attempt to read a genre I really wasn't familiar with. Since I got into reading, I believe that nonfiction is one of the genres that is most daunting to me. In 2016, I definitely attempted a few; yet, I never really expected to grab this one off the shelves like that and just read it. It has an encyclopedia feel and it definitely reads like one as well. Charles Darwin is quite the familiar science genius known to students studying biology everywhere. He along with Mendel, the father of genetics, are the monsters for biology making it seemingly hard. As I mentioned above it's not a story, and it's not a simple read or a book for enjoyment. It is also not a list of drone. It's a rather valuable read of its size with historical touches and very good research on animals and all their genres with density and heaviness. The theory of natural selection as studied in class is not well explained by mere professors. I bet these clowns never came to attempt reading this. I'm repeating it's not a novel and a story you read for leisure time. Professors want to finish curricula, and that's why that's the part that's rushed at the end. I dreaded the study of kingdoms and phyla and Darwinism, because it was never properly explained.After reading this, I think my self respect and self esteem both grew at sheer, personal will while experiencing this book. Before reading, my imagination was always centered around the fact that this book is boring and I'll never find it on ebook. Now, I come to say that I was really thankful to my library for providing it online. Natural selection as emphasized, is the pure fact that all animals are picked out in accordance of their strengths and most intricate and distinguishable characteristics to build the up and coming generations. With this critical focus and specific selection comes variability. Variability is the guy who screams so loud, that for instance, a rose and an orchid are not the same, even though they are both very well known beautiful flowers to the sight of our eyes. Different species of dogs and bees evolve to not be the same. Each animal evolves to have their varied kinds and characteristics. I think of it as myself reading a book and loving it at the end. Did I necessarily love each page? Not necessarily, which presents myself as selective; however, I may have liked the book for its content or flow of a story, even though I didn't like a character or two, or even three. This book is my dense pride of 2016. It will mark my last nonfiction of the year, not because I had enough and finished a book; but rather, because of its mere volume, density, and pure heaviness. I intentionally took long breaks to go back and think what I learned, it really was a ton of material!!! This doesn't make it a textbook. It's an awesome encyclopedia full of potential with long lists of animals who were very well researched down to the hairs on their skin to state their merest and very specified difference, as to say: ""We are both redheads, but you specifically have this characteristic pimple or bump, which makes you slightly different"". Natural selection is a dense concept to attain and learn, because of how variability in the varieties are sincerely observed. I had mentioned that I skipped a whole chapter, which I ended up reading at the very end. It was the chapter on the objections against the theory. I was wondering why is this in the middle of the book, rather than at the end? I skipped it at first to first learn about the theory and various research along with all the researchers who helped Darwin writing this book with insights on their research. Objections, I thought came later. The reason why they came in the middle, I later on discovered is for the fact that these particular objections were not covering the whole book, but rather the first few chapters.It was very good, very dense, and a very important scientific classic. It needs a good amount of patience and belief in your progress. I have a different appreciation for animals and plants knowing that the best of its kind supplant all the others, making it really significant and absolutely striking. Seriously? Yes, absolute genius of a volume!! :)"
19,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1496261-cora-judd,5,"Richard Dawkins' narration of this book is excellent -- I enjoyed it immensely, however, without my semester of physical anthropology, the essential points would have required much more mental attention. Dawkins inserts clarifying information throughout the book and while Darwin's writing is wonderfully clear, I think more of Dawkins' notes and updates would have been an enhancement.I was surprised to see how diverse Darwin's background research was and how elegantly he wrote. He anticipated counter-arguments to his ideas and cleanly, systematically eliminated them. As he concluded each level of his argument, the gaps in his knowledge (due to gaps in scientific progress at the time of his being published) required that he make certain logical leaps and assumptions. These were especially interesting because he was invariably correct, as time has shown.Dawkins abridged the book to some degree which makes me leary - I want to know what the author intended the reader to know. And because the subject is still (astoundingly) controversial, abridging anything of this nature will likely invite criticism."
20,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2345961-pollopicu,2,"What in the world made me want to read this Goliath of a science book? My goodness! I guess if I had to search deep within myself I would have to say I wanted to read anything Darwin, just to see what all the fuss was about, but mostly because of the reviews I read on Goodreads. I thought The Origin of Species would turn me into the science-loving person I always thought lurked inside me.The main reason I finished it is because any science book that has had this much publicity deserves to be read and finished.First of all, it contained a considerable amount of text for a study which was only suppose to be a treatise. This book wasn't difficult to read, as many would have you think. It's not. In fact, it's pretty straight forward. But are you interested in reading 700 pages of things having to do with birds, aquatic mammals, cattle, beaks, gills, bills, plumage, fauna, fowl, pollen, eggs, and embryos? Don't get me wrong, I'm as interested to hear where we might have originated from as much as the next person, but if you take the book at face value, who would be interested in reading page after page of detailed observations of animals most of us will live a lifetime without even having encountered and if we do, so what. I say that as a lover of nature. I mean a LOVER of all things outdoors that have to do with looking at stuff, not reading about it. Where I live we often see herons, and gorgeous owls, foxes, snakes, etc, but I don't want to read 700 pages about them. I want to admire them for a while, but then keep it moving.From what I gathered, it seems to me that scientists and naturalists can't even agree on the differences between species and varieties to begin with. A lot of these studies aren't even conclusive, which makes a lot of sense now since it's a book on the THEORY of evolution. I didn't stop to think of the literal definition of the word ""theory"". Had I paused for a moment to give it thought, I would've realized I would be committing weeks to a treatise that is basically speculation. To me that's a huge waste of time when there are so many other books out there to read. Give me history or give me straight up fiction by topics on theory seem pointless to me. Also, the idea that Darwin's theory of evolution was indirectly responsible for the genocide of so many people during the Nazi era is simply horrific. I had no clue when I began reading this book that Hitler was a follower of Darwin's theory, taking it to heart (a bit too much) the supposed superiority of the white race, hence, making all other races inferior, and therefore extinguishing them. The Subtitle of The Species of Origin was suppose to be “The Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life.” Darwin referred to inferior races as ""savages"", and by savages he meant people with darker skin, such as Native Americans and Africans. Darwin, being the prolific and respected scientist he was, influenced many people (through his work) to practice prejudice, racism and oppression. Hitler believed that the human gene pool could be improved by selective breeding, very much like that of cattle in farm breeding, thus protecting the ""superior"" race. This is simply horrifying.In the end I'm glad I read this book, although I hated the actual reading part. Not so much because of what it contains, but because of the role it has played in our history, of which I was clueless about. In the frustration of reading this book, I made the effort to dig for more information about why so many modern day people are still fascinated by it, still not sure, but I did learn a lot from it, and it did inspire me to dig deep into other genocides that have been committed around the world in which this book may or may not have been indirectly responsible for. However, the book was absolutely tedious. It's like reading about a subject you absolutely loath, like sports, or construction. The part of the book that actually cracked me up was chapter XII (Geographical Distribution) because after having read what seemed like 200 pages of that, the next chapter (XIII) was called ""Geographical Distribution continued"", lol. At that point I was delirious and might have lost it. It's very rare for me to purposely not recommend reading what people consider a ""required read"", but this was a tough one. If you want to read it to add it to your library, go ahead, but I'm giving you fair warning, it's laborious like nothing you've ever read. You will have to see for yourself. "
21,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen,3,"3.0 to 3.5 stars. Not anything like what I would call a ""fun"" read, but I am really happy that I finally read this book given the tremendous influence it has had on the history on modern scientific thinking. The book itself, while dry, is fairly accessible and is not bogged down with overly complex scientific jargon. I would read a couple of chapters a day in between my ""pleasure"" reading and it made the book much easier to absorb. Definitely worth reading. "

And we should be proud that we are the only species that has figured out how we came to be."" ~Jerry A. Coyne, Ph.D., University of ChicagoOn the Origin of Species is Darwin laying out his theory of natural selection in precise, laborious detail. He knew quite well many of the objections and arguments this supposition would invoke, and he counters every anticipated antagonism with a barrage of evidence gained from detailed observation and/or astute experimentation. The idea that plant and animal species evolved from common ancestry was an affront to 1859 sensibilities and the courage required to challenge widespread, ingrained superstition and misinformation must have been enormous. And yet, here it is. The imperfect but substantial cornerstone of biology, biochemistry, psychology, genetics, anthropology, neurology, primatology, embryology... the list is immense.

23,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17891225-karnika-kapoor,5,"Not to my surprise, many questions that are thrown at Richard Dawkins by the creationist on debate panels have been answered as it is in this book. If only people read this by themselves!It was fascinating how the ""missing links"" was explained by Darwin in a context of geology. Most importantly he was indicating towards Tectonics (that was brought into light many years after darwin's time by Alfred Wegener). Clearly, Darwin was way ahead of his contemporaries. I knew it took him years to publish his work (arguably, partially because of psychosomatic dissonance), but the intense work on gathering information and years of research bolsters his point. He indeed wanted to be very sure of the theory. I am amazed by darwin's thought process that seems very instinctive to anyone who grew up studying about evolution ... however, being the forerunner in joining the dots on the same is very nonintuitive which marks his brilliance. Highly recommended to the Creationists. "
24,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21797839-rafael,4,"im just rating this 4 stars because of its complexity, but not for the contents of the book, witch can rightfully be called a piece of art, this has to be the most complex read i had in years, it's a beutifully explained book on evoulution of especies by natural and human selection, it is incredibly detail and meticulously explained, for maximum enjoyment you must know selections and natural order to fully understand this book as well as geography and different science studies, the variety of especies mentioned in this book is very wide and unless you have a picture of each especies or variety you would be fairly lost, this not a book to take easily as i wrongly did at first but it's an stupendous read if you love science, it is very heavy and will challenge you to finish it and is up to you if you do it, for me it is a really complex read but a fulfilling one in the name of science."
25,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"It took me awhile to drag myself into reading this one. People have always commented that it was so dull and that it was convoluted and hard to follow and I have always believed in evolution and found modern books very accessible on the subject so I thought why bother? Then again I have a thing for classics, and as my list of books on evolution grew I started to chide myself that I still had not even read from Darwin's own hand. So I bent to the grain and pulled it out. This book was nothing like what I expected. Absolutely NOTHING like what I expected. If you read this with an open mind, slowly and take each of his points into consideration you find an absolute flawless logic to his argument. It is well presented and actually I find that compared to many scientific articles it is clearly written for the wider audience. Darwin wants you to get it. He wrote as plainly and carefully as he could. He did not propose his idea half assed or hurriedly. I was floored to find that all of my favorite arguments for evolution came straight from the horses mouth as it were. Darwin got it. He really really got it. He went at it from every angle he could, geological time scales, fossils, birds, plants, animals, interactions, sexual selection, selection on islands, selection in various terrains. He broke it down bit by bit and said: Look guys, I hardly wanted to buy this myself but this is how it is. Just look! See for yourself. Make up your own mind. His methodical manner is hard to shy away from. He did not come up with an idea and let others run with it. He did the research, he talked to people, he took it from all angles and presented it in the clearest manner possible. Yes I have to admit that the writing was a bit dry, but the river of content was overflowing, and the proposal was elegant and clear. What a wonderful contribution. I am honored to have read this work and chide myself yet again for my hesitation. "
26,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22315959-morgan,1,"I can now truly say that, having read the Origin of Species, I find the theory of evolution to be complete and utter hogwash. Darwin never truly gives an explanation for how microevolution can realistically extrapolated into macroevolution. Also, when he brings up objections against his theory, he gives an elaborate excuse for why he cannot prove his point rather than proving it. I am still a firm believer in Creation. It is a lot more logical than evolution."

28,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6051061-t-d-whittle,5,"I know the world has not been waiting with bated breath for 160 years to hear my opinion of this marvelous book, but I wanted to add my praise anyway. This is such a beautiful read. Darwin makes his argument for descent through modification of all organic life with such patience, eloquence, and clarity that it's awe inspiring, especially when one bears in mind that DNA and its sure-fire evidence of descent had not been discovered yet. It's truly remarkable that Darwin was right about almost every detail, using only the tools he had to work with in the nineteenth century, his formidable intelligence, and his sparkling intuition. I understand completely now why he is considered one of the few dozen greatest minds of all time, since recorded history.Darwin writes like a dream. He is gracious to and appreciative of his fellow naturalists. He's honest about the limits of what could be known with certainty, and what could be only guessed at. This style of writing in science is a breath of fresh air from a bygone era. I found Darwin's exuberance regarding his subject contagious, and am including a some of my favourite passages below, so that I can remember them.One thing that made the reading a bit tricky is that I do not speak Latin and, even if I did, would not necessarily know the names of plants and animals by their scientific labels; thus, I did not even recognise the names of common animals in my own country: the kangaroo and the platypus! Given that this book was written for Darwin's contemporaries who were laypersons, I wonder how they would have known these names, or if they read Darwin whilst having editions of botanical and zoological binomial nomenclature nearby? I had Google, of course, but found it also helpful to keep charts of geological eras at hand, an excellent globe, and maps of the world reflecting things as they were at the time of Darwin's writing. ""It is a truly wonderful fact—the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity—that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to group, in the manner which we everywhere behold—namely, varieties of the same species most closely related together, species of the same genus less closely and unequally related together, forming sections and sub-genera, species of distinct genera much less closely related, and genera related in different degrees, forming sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes, and classes. "" (pps. 170-171)""All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the enunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together or separating objects more or less alike.But I must explain my meaning more fully. I believe the arrangement of the groups within each class, in due subordination and relation to the other groups, must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural; but that the amount of difference in the several branches or groups, though allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor, may differ greatly, being due to the different degrees of modification which they have undergone; and this is expressed by the forms being ranked under different genera, families, sections, or orders."" (p. 404)""As all organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived on this earth have to be classed together, and as all have been connected by the finest gradations, the best, or indeed, if our collections were nearly perfect, the only possible arrangement, would be genealogical. Descent being on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the term of the natural system."" (p. 427)""On the view of each organic being and each separate organ having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable it is that parts, like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of some beetles, should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility! Nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal, by rudimentary organs and by homologous structures, her scheme of modification, which it seems that we wilfully will not understand."" (p. 452)""But the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one species has given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are always slow in admitting any great change of which we do not see the intermediate steps. The difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists, when Lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been formed, and great valleys excavated, by the slow action of the coast-waves., The mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of a hundred million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many slight variations, accumulated during and almost infinite number of generations."" (p.453)On the imperfection of the geological record: ""The noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record. The crust of the earth with its embedded remains must not be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection made at hazard and at rare intervals. The accumulation of each great fossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on and unusual concurrence of circumstances, and the blank intervals between the sucdessive stages as having been of vast duration. But we shall be able to gauget with some security the duration of these intervals by a comparison of the preceding and succeeeding organic forms. ... "" (p. 457)This passage is so eloquent, and yet I do not believe mankind, at least, has continued to evolve towards perfection. So sadly optimistic: ""Authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view that each species has been independently created. To my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator, that the production and extinction fo the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the birth and death of the individual. When I view all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled. Judging from the past, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a distant futurity. And of the species now living very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity; for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the greater number of species of each genus, and all the species of many genera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct. We can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to fortell that it will be the common and widely-spread species, belonging to the larger and dominant groups, which will ultimately prevail and procreate new and dominant species. As all the living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the Silurian epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world. Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection."" (p. 459)""Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."" (p. 460)"
29,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1528196-joe,3,"Having finished Origin, I am taking the liberty of adding a few comments at the top of what I posted when I first added it to my ""currently-reading shelf."" To the would-be classics reader who is a bit daunted at the notion of tackling a fourteen chapter science book written in 19th Century technical terms I offer the suggestion that the back half of Origin is purely optional and can be let go. The first six chapters are the most enjoyable. Four is the big one, where Darwin presents the big pitch, with One through Three being the wind-up to prep the audience. Six is fairly unusual in science literature, being an effort to admit problems with the theory and making efforts to address them. Chapter Seven, on instinct, is aumsing but not vital to the core of the work if your attention is already starting to wander. The rest that follow involve technical arguments that may be pointless to most modern readers. To follow why Darwin makes them one would have to conversant in the state of the art in zoology, botany and geology as it was 150 years ago. I skipped much of it.A few points readers with only a casual knowledge of science may take from this book- Evolution predates Darwin, whose contribution is actually the mechanism of natural selection which explains how it works. He also contributed another mechanism, sexual selection, for traits inherited for their value in obtaining mates. Darwin offers an unexpected chuckle in a quote from Aristotle which suggestive of an understanding of something very much like natural selection.>What follows is old commentary.I am reading this one for the historical value, not the science. A big joke is that people of a certain outlook do try to read it for the science so they can refute it. Silly. Origin is as about as state of the art on evolution science as Newton is on 21st Century string theory. Ah, well.What I have found interesting so far is the struggle Darwin goes through to make his argument in the absence of the kind of modern scientific language or terminology that would have made things simple and clear to his readers. Even more interesting is that Darwin had no clue as to the mechanics of inheritance and admitted as much (the discovery of DNA was a long way off in the future), and yet was able to work out so much on his own without that knowledge.Cool factoid: Darwin took his time pondering his theories for many years before suddenly rushing to get them into print. It seems that while he was taking his time another naturalist named Wallace worked out natural selection too...and then wrote to Darwin for help in placing his findings in front of the right experts! You know how the science establishment is about giving credit to the first one to publish and forgetting the also-rans who came to the same conclusions just a tad too late. One party gets into the textbooks of future generations, while the other is lucky to become a footnote.I'll post some stars when I'm done reading."
30,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"So this is the foundation of the theory of evolution. No, Darwin was not the first or only one with musings much like the ones described in this book, but he took some other people's theories (incl. that of his own grandfather) and took them further or perfected them.After having spent 5 years on the Beagle and thus seeing all kinds of places, Darwin had returned to England. It would be many years before he published this book but during the last stretch of the journey, Darwin had discovered something along some of the specimen he had collected on the Galápagos Islands. No, it was not his famous finches. Those he had forgotten (or not known) to label, thus no longer knowing which bird came from which of the islands. It was also not the famous tortoises as every single one of the ones taken on board the Beagle had been eaten and the shell been thrown overboard.Luckily, there were still the mockingbirds. And like all animals on the Galápagos, they too were different on every island and he HAD labelled them.Thus, he saw that while they were all mockingbirds, they had slight differences, especially when it came to their beaks, which gave him the idea of them being specialized to the life conditions on their respective island.It was also the Galápagos Islands that gave him the idea of volcanic activity birthing an island. He just didn't know about plate tectonics yet, sadly, as that theory was only established (and proven) about 100 years later.Thus, he talks of evolution as nature's way of selecting traits most suited for whatever life a creature lives. He talks about sexual selection and extinction of animals.Think back to those times: mankind thought themselves the master of the Earth, as God had willed it. God, the omnipotent being, had created all things. Evolution, therefore, was blasphemy as it meant God either at least changing his mind or having made mistakes. You can imagine how some people reacted once this book had been written and published.However, while reading this book, I was delighted to see that Darwin never bashed religious people but simply didn't talk about religion at all. Maybe he had learned not to broach the subject since he was married to a Catholic. *lol* Instead, he simply laid out his theory and his reasons for having established it, giving ample proof while listing the single steps. And whenever there was a gap, he would address it and explain why it was there, what the likely answer was and, again, why.I was astonished and more than pleased to see how he had written this book. Much like in his journal about the voyage on the Beagle, he shows a beautiful writing style and wrote this book not only for scholars but - and this was radical as well - for the layman to understand. A complex and new concept explained in a simple way to make the science accessible.Like when he talked about humans breeding dogs to be of a certain size and character traits or gardeners crossing different flowers to get certain petal shapes and colours.He took Humboldt's ""web of life"" and transformed it into his famous ""tree of life"". There were a few minor errors (we know now) but all in all, his logic was sound - only limited, sometimes, by some thing or other that hadn't yet been discovered or explained. My hardcover edition had beautiful illustrations. Some were Darwin's sketches, other were oil paintings of animals he was talking about in the book. However, much like with the other book, there is an audio version narrated by Dawkins that is really very good despite being abridged.Where humankind would be without Darwin and this book, I do not know. We owe Darwin and his work a lot, though, that's for sure."

32,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477945-kendall,5,"Finally re-read after decades of good intentions. For a recondite classic it is full of surprises, mostly pleasant; its supposed impenetrability largely confined to parts we already knew were directed at specialists—I admit to slogging through the section on barnacles, for example. But Origins is highly readable, pleasurable even, almost in the way of an Edmund Wilson essay. Darwin proceeds deliberately through the mountain of evidence he collected over twenty years as he constructs a virtually unassailable intellectual structure. Freely recognizing arguments against natural selection—the central thread of the book—he gives his best arguments based on the knowledge of his day while carefully pointing out its limitations. I was not prepared for how well he anticipated later discoveries—Mendel’s pioneering work in genetics didn’t see publication until the early 20th century yet dovetails almost seamlessly into Origins exposition, as does the Modern Synthesis. If you’re interested in any of the broad fields of biology-evolution, taxonomy, genetics—The Origin of Species is a must read. If you are a creationist, even in its deceptive guise of intelligent design, you are not intellectually honest if you have not read and honestly come to grips with this book; which gives the lie to the railings of a few misguided Christians and Muslims who seem to think it a product of their devil. Yet, so thoughtful and measured a book makes it clear any devils are in the eye of the beholder. "
33,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,4,"In reading The Origin of Species, one of the things I found myself respecting most about Charles Darwin was his aversion to dogma, religious or otherwise. He was generally logical, reasonable, and slow to jump to conclusions, and it seems to me that the enduring quality of this book owes much to these traits in its author. 
""From these and similar considerations, but chiefly from our ignorance of the geology of other countries beyond the confines of Europe and the United States; and from the revolution in our palæontological ideas on many points, which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have effected, it seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the succession of organic beings throughout the world, as it would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on some one barren point in Australia, and then to discuss the number and range of its productions.""

34,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13229843-ben-batchelder,1,"Charles Darwin’s “The Origin of Species” promises a lot. A back cover blurb says, “Next to the Bible no work has been quite as influential....” I’m not a scientist, but with a build up like that I had to give it a try after enjoying “The Voyage of the Beagle” (reviewed 9/5/13).It is a slog of a read, yet Darwin’s enthusiasm for his subject, the excitement he conveys in outlining the work of his lifetime and popularizing a scientific movement, are palpable. Ironically, Darwin was not a scientist himself, but a “naturalist,” whose first job in the field – to be the Beagle’s naturalist-on-board – was a bit of a lark, suggested by friends, after his prior path to becoming an Anglican pastor (his father’s preference) came to naught.His insights – not entirely original, as he really consolidated lines of thinking going on for several generations – stemmed not only from his visit to the Galapagos Islands on the Beagle, but from observing man-driven selection in the breeding of domesticated animals.  I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man’s power of selection. But the expression...Survival of the Fittest is more accurate...” (p.61) Yet the problems start right away. As Creationist Kent Hovind has pointed out, the assumption that natural selection causes evolution is problematic, for “natural selection” never creates, it only selects. Furthermore, “survival of the fittest” is a tautology, for by definition the fit survive and the survivors are fit. As Hovind points out, natural selection might be more clearly called differential reproduction, that is, some reproduce more than others.And what drove Darwin to this line of thinking? It turns out he was a Malthusian, the Chicken Little of his time:It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage. Although some species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them. (p. 63) The implication being, for some to live, others must die. Death, then, turns out to be the selection method of the Universe, in the never-ending struggle to survive. Or, as he succinctly states, “Thus, extinction and natural selection go hand in hand.” (p.161)Sensing how grim his outlook might appear, Darwin tries to pre-empt: When we reflect on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply. (p.75) Call it the theory of Happy Death then, one of many assertions that don’t ring true. No fear is felt? Death is generally prompt? Well, then, bring on more of this necessary (per Malthus) and creative force!Elevating nature to a Capitalized Power, Darwin characterizes it as less selfish than we: “Man selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the being which she tends.” (p.79)Around this part of the book came the first of many mentions (that I noticed) of the phrase “scale of nature,” which of course is a direct descendent of Plato’s and Aristotle’s Scala Naturae, showing a direct link to the pagan concept of a hierarchy of development that was transformed into the the Great Chain of Being by the Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century. This pagan belief in a hierarcy of more and less developed beings may have influenced Darwin’s unfortunate choice of sub-title: “By Means of Natural Selection of the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.” It is difficult to find a modern edition of the book that hasn’t scrubbed clean this evidence of Darwin’s easy racism. (Only in my 150th Anniversary Edition, from Signet Classics in 2003, could I find the sub-title in any edition on-line – tucked away in a title page inside.) One can see why Darwin’s boosters try to re-write history, for the sub-title’s “favoured races” helps explain how Social Darwinism – only disavowed by evolution’s supporters after the horrors of WWII – created so much havoc in the 20th century. (Marx and Stalin were nominally Christian before reading Darwin; both Stalin and Hitler appropriated Darwin for their perverted, murderous philosophies.)In terms of other influences, Darwin often refers to Charles Lyell and his (literally) ground-breaking “Principles of Geology” which, by positing long geological ages, gave breathing room for Darwin’s theory of numerous “slight variations” to evolve, of minuscule improvements multiplied over unimaginably many iterations. He goes so far as to warn skeptical readers:	He who can read Sir Charles Lyell’s grand work on the Principles of Geology...and yet does not admit how vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume. (p. 316) If you are detecting a certain stridency, you are not alone.And what was it that excited Darwin so much to dedicate his life to? Simply stated, it is the mechanism by which modifications occur within a species in response to environmental pressures. The same way that man could take the primordial wolf and encourage endless variations into hundreds of dog breeds, so could evolution (in what we would call today, micro-evolution) encourage those famous finches of Galapagos Islands to vary in beak sizes in adaptation to micro-environments.But Darwin wishes to go much further than that. In fact, he seems to indulge in frequent straw man arguments, saying that “special creation” would have no explanation for the facts he marshals, as though his critics assert dogs could only have been independently created at the beginning of time.Perhaps something like this was the prevailing wisdom at the time – that no species, or what we might call sub-species today, could develop into another. Yet, to contemporary ears, he doth protest too much.In fact, he takes his valuable insights and then extrapolates them to incredible lengths. (The theory of evolution remains just that, a theory, rather than the supreme law as treated by so many moderns.) His animation takes wing with passages such as this:	It is a truly wonderful fact – the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity – that all animal and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other... (p. 126) After long dancing around the controversial bush of his own creation, by book’s end he admits, “I believe that animals are descended from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal or less number.” (p.502) But even here he prevaricates, for in the book’s last paragraph he triumphs, “There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator [Nature?] into a few forms or into one...” (p.507) So which is it? Four or five or just one “form”? Either way, now we are really talking about Macro Evolution!Yet, sadly, not one concrete example – that has then or since been confirmed as a proven fact – is given of one species evolving into a wholly new one. (In fact, from our more modern understanding of mutations and how DNA works, mutations never allow for a gain in information, only its loss, which makes evolving from the simple ameoba to the incredibly complex human being patently impossible, the stuff of pure fantasy.)To his credit, Darwin brings up (what were at the time) the objections most “fatal,” or potentially fatal, to his theory. One was related to the fossil record, the other to how evolution could possibly explain for extremely complex organs which would have been useless when only partially created and, under the logic of the theory, would have been eradicated by natural selection long before completion.Let’s take the critical area of fossil evidence, or complete lack of it. Darwin readily admits there should be countless examples of intermediary forms (for example, showing how a reptile grew wings to become a bird), and asks:	Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely-graduated organic chain, and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory. (p.314) The reason, he answers back in 1859, is “that the geological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect” (p.327), that is, we hadn’t dug up enough fossils yet.Jump ahead over 150 years, with numberless excavations and bones found all over the world, and there are still no such fossils. While there have been numerous hoaxes, including Piltdown Man, Nebraska Man, an the Archaeoraptor, or “dino-bird” – such is modern man’s obsession with trying to prove evolution – the lack of fossil record is a real brain-twister for evolutionists. As Colin Patterson, the late senior paleotogologist of the British Museum of Natural History, admitted, “there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument.” (1979 letter to Luther D. Sutherland, cited in his “Darwin’s Enigma: Ebbing the Tide of Naturalism,” 1988, p. 89)The other big strike against evolution, forwarded by Darwin himself, was the feasibility of countless small evolutionary steps creating a complex organ which is all but worthless until whole. 	To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberation, could have been formed by natural selection seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. (p.172) His stab at explaining away the problem, as absurd as those by current apoligists, such as Richard Dawkins, is to find the tiniest benefit from even 100th of an eye which, multiplied over eons, brings us the remarkable present. For, “if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though unsuperable by our imagination, should not be considered as subversive of the theory.” (p.172) So something “unsuperable by our imagination’ should not be subversive to the theory?							 Yet, to my layman’s eyes, Darwin makes relatively few such categorical errors. Although DNA’s molecular structure would only be discovered nearly a century after the book’s launch, he rightly conjectures the inter-relatedness of all life, saying “that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking...” (p.437) as “the one known cause of close similarity in organic beings...” (p.432). Yes, it turns out all organisms were created with the same basic genetic code or language, known today as DNA.But he takes his conjectures to overwrought degrees, using morphology (the study of form and structure of organic beings) to imply all animals descend from the same ancestor (or two) and embryology to claim our ancient forms are revealed in early embryonic development. Among the many hoaxes used to try to confirm Darwin’s work, embryology as proof of evolution has, perhaps, the longest legs. Remember the Intro Biology chart which shows how the earliest human fetus has fish-like “gill slits” which proves that among our ancestors are dead fish? Or the one which supposedly demonstrates how all vertebrates look nearly identical soon after conception? Despite the drawings, originally from one Ernst Haeckel in 1874, having over a century ago been revealed as fakes, they still grace many biology textbooks.Much has changed since Darwin’s book was published, so we shouldn’t be too harsh on the man. You have to wonder, though, if Darwin were alive today and realized that fossil evidence still did not exist, would he be consistent and admit he went too far? (Today’s evolutionists have tried to explain away the lack of fossil record with a new theory, called punctuated equilibrium, or vast periods of no change followed by sudden and great leaps – hence the scarcity of fossils – but Darwin himself argues against it. (p.187))Darwin also believed in only a simple structure at the atom level, facilitating the idea that man could evolve from, say, an ameoba. But DNA has proven the opposite, that the number of genes within one human body of over 100 trillion equals the number of stars in 1,000 galaxies (of 100 billion stars each). We also now know that in mutations, the supposed engine of evolution, information is always lost and never gained.Knowing what we know today, would Darwin still believe in Darwinism?While his excitement in synthesizing a ground-breaking theory is palpable, did Darwin really need to macro-itize the obvious truth (in retrospect) of micro-evolution? It makes you wonder if there can be too much of a good thing. I recently read a review in the Wall Street Journal titled “The Ship of the Imagination” while pondering Darwin’s work. Rather breathlessly, the reviewer exults, “[the author] tracks other scientific efforts to achieve the apparently miraculous, including mind reading, the search for immortality, love potions, and the creation of demi-gods – or at least superhumans.” (Michael Saler, WSJ, 12/18/15) Could too much imagination be a bad thing?Since Darwin, science has become increasingly untethered from ethical considerations. Interestingly, as Vishal Mangalwadi pointed out in his magisterial “The Book That Made Your World: How the Bible Created the Soul of Western Civilization,” no major new scientific laws have been formulated since in the last century following this untethering.Arguably, what we have now is less science than Scientism, where flawed theories such as Darwin’s have to be treated as the Law of the Land. The same Colin Patterson mentioned above searched for evolutionists who, out of the public glare, would stand up for evolution as we understand it today. Revealingly, from several such encounters he wrote:	I’ve tried putting a simple question to various people and groups of people. Question is: Can you tell me anything you about evolution, any one thing, that is true? I tried that question on the geology staff at the Field Museum of Natural History and the only answer I got was silence. I tried it on the members of the Evolutionary Morphology Seminar in the University of Chicago, a very prestigious body of evolutionists, and all I got there was silence for a long time and eventually one person said, “I do know one thing – it ought not be taught in high school.” (Cited in Stephen Jones, “Evolutionsm and Creationsim,” 11/5/82, p.1) Could it be that Darwin succumbed, too, to the vanity of his own imagination? And for how much longer must we carry him aloft?"

This has nothing to do with religion and humans are more a footnote. This is a biology book mostly about animals and natural selection. While this book talks a little about evolution, that's not really why it's important. I think some reviews and people focus too much on the history of this book rather than what is actually in this book. If you don't pick up the fact that Darwin was hugely into birds and they helped his studies, reread this book again. Every chapter he talks about some kind of bird and relates it to the primary subject. The controversy seems to have started by one little part in this book, but it's his other book where he talks about humans. He ignored humans for the most part because of Malthus.While this is an important read, this book gets boring if you're not interested in zoology or biology. I've said this before but I had ducks for three years, so I'm very interested in animal studies. I didn't really want to read this book before only because I knew my past self would find this boring. Just know what your about to read instead of thinking everyone needs to read this before they die."
36,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I’m doing a biology degree, and I’ve always been an admirer of (and a believer in) the theory of evolution through natural selection, so it seemed high time I finally went to hear it from the horse’s mouth. Not that Darwin came up with the idea out of nothing, of course; it was “in the air” at the time, and other scientists were thinking along similar lines — Lamarck and Darwin’s grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, to name just two. Not to mention, of course, Alfred Wallace, who could’ve beaten Darwin to publication.But Charles Darwin was the first to publish a theory which really made sense, which hung together and was testable. He may not have known about genetics or had a clear idea of how heritability occurs, yet it’s startling to read this and realise how close he was to right at times. He may not always have backed the right theories, but he considered everything he could imagine, and carefully related it to his own theory. It’s remarkable just how willing he was to consider where his theory might be wrong, and discuss those weaknesses. It’s also remarkable how often he tested what he could, whether it be the germination of seeds soaked in sea water or how pollination works; he may not have had the equipment that we have now, but his attitude is surely a lesson that every aspiring scientist should take to heart.Honestly, I don’t know how anyone can read this and come away without understanding Darwin’s theory. He’s painstakingly clear, at length, with examples. If you’re reading this and coming to the conclusion that he didn’t support the idea of one species evolving into another, “macroevolution”, your reading comprehension is at fault. He makes it quite clear that “microevolution”, small changes in existing species, can and will lead to new species.Darwin was not right about everything, but he was right in many key ways — and he would be the first to admit that he could be wrong. He gave us a working, testable theory, one which has ample proof both in his work and in the world around us. Creationists have far too much to explain, by comparison.Originally reviewed for breathesbooks.com."

""The Origin of the Species"", presented here in its full first edition format (because the next 5 editions of it were just more in depth renderings on the same subjects, with some response to subsequent criticism added on top) does not include a single page, line or speculation on the origin of man. That, Darwin left for another book - you guessed it - ""The Descent of Man"". I've been meaning to read Origin for a long time, and have finally gotten around to it, expecting to be impressed and have my curiosity satisfied. I am and it was. I won't talk here about the writing itself, because it truly is just a long form scientific paper detailing experiments and hypotheses, trials and tribulations and the knowledge Darwin and others had on the subject. But I will say this: when you're reading it, bear something in mind. Think about the nuclear bomb-like quality this book had at the time it was published in intellectual circles everywhere. Think about how it shook and shattered the foundations of a Church which had been in power for around 1800 years at that point. Imagine the heretical nature it must have had (as it has today) in the eyes of indoctrinated people. And then think about how easy it is today for schools to refuse teaching evolution because ""it offends"" them, because it's not the truth they want. A few men - Darwin included - have dedicated their lives to a truth that even they didn't like and believe to begin with; they struggled with their own findings; they hated that they couldn't find evidence that would be more in line with their beliefs from childhood. But they never let that stop them. And they have given us the foundation for entire fields of science, from which we benefit from this day, whether we choose to accept it or not. I tried to read Origins with the mentality of a mid 19th Century and 2018 individual at the same time... it's awesome from both vantage points. "

Charles Darwin is the prophet of the natural selection theory and the Godfather of the struggle for survival.Darwin's work ""On The Origin of Species"" gives you a feel at times that you're reading something between a textbook and a book. This book is a short summary of his Voyage and 15 years of studying and researching organisms prior to writing this book. On the other hand, Darwin gives us an extensive detailed elaboration of his theory of evolution by means of natural selection.I wish he could have wrote more with regards to the humankind Species, but it was a different time, and writing this book was probably risky in itself.He was such a humble gentleman that he dedicated big portions of his book to the possible difficulties with his theory.I've read the Serbo-Croatian translation Postanak Vrsta autora Čarlsa Darvina / Akademska Knjiga 2009 6th Edition Publishing / 573 pages / 158,662 words."

It would have to be included on any short list of 'classics of science'. I have docked a star to reflect the fact that it's not always easy reading - there's that verbose quality to its style that characterizes most writing from the Victorian era. That said, I should point out that ""The Origin of Species"" is completely understandable to any general reader willing to give it a careful reading. You don't have to be a biologist to follow Darwin's argument. Two aspects of the book are astonishing; both underscore the brilliance of Darwin's accomplishment. The first is just how right he got things; the second is that he managed to fit all the major pieces of the puzzle in place with no knowledge of the actual mechanics of heredity. Mendel's work on genetics adn the elucidation of the structure of DNA would subsequently flesh out the details of the scheme proposed by Darwin; one has to bear in mind the actual state of knowledge in Darwin's time, and the prevailing intellectual climate, to appreciate fully the revolutionary nature of his argument. Upon re-reading the book this past weekend, I was reminded of certain endearing aspects that I had forgotten. One is Darwin's willingness to point out, and try to answer, what he perceived as the potential weaknesses in his argument. This is another: ""Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have, after deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons"". Not quite as glamorous as the beasties he got to see from The Beagle, but he's continually observing, gathering data from any source available, always asking questions. You gotta love this book.

What I mainly found was:a) Creationists who didn’t read the book, but nonetheless needed to assert that humans are not descended from apes.b) Confused readers complaining about some obnoxious character called Alex. Since it was improbable that Darwin had given pet names to any creature whether living or fossilized, I looked into this one further and realized that a rather bad Nino Ricci novel was merged with Darwin’s science book. What a shame, Goodreads.c) Other confused readers who decided to give Darwin a one-star rating because of Ray Comfort’s introduction, which I think is utterly unfair to Darwin, although utterly fair to Comfort. Bash - Creationism Suite No.1 - PreludeThe edition I first started reading has a certain Ray Comfort gift us a very Special Introduction. This Mister – who also turns out to be a Christian Minister – desperately struggles to install the idea of a supreme being into Darwin’s theory before the latter gets a chance to speak. Mister Comfort Zone elaborates on moronic arguments that would make God himself flush with embarrassment, only to arrive at the conclusion that the complexity of life as we know it could not have evolved by chance (synonymous with eco-biochemistry in the creationist dialect). The conclusion of the book’s introduction, then, unlike the conclusion of the book itself, is that The Origin of Species is intelligent design.I’m surprised that decontextualizing quotes from prominent scientists to make them fit into the Comfort Combat is not considered an intellectual property infringement. The fact that this edition made it to print instead of court is very telling. For its disgraceful attempt at spoiling a science book with bad writing, the introduction deserves no stars at all. It’s almost a shame that it isn’t featured on GoodReads separately, but I won’t give Darwin’s book a low rating on its account. I’ll just pick another edition. The Origin of SpeciesReading On The Origin of Species isn’t about being introduced to a theory you know nothing about. Anyone remotely interested in evolution will reach this book as the culmination of a long winding road of scientific discoveries. It is still a priceless read, because of the quality of research and of its presentation. I have yet to find a work of art as beautiful as this science book.Darwin isn’t humorous in his writing. He is grave, patient, and humble. He is, beyond any doubt, the most modest of all the scientists I have ever met or read. Consider this: “To arrive at a just conclusion regarding the formation of the eye, with all its marvelous but not absolutely perfect characters, it is indispensable that the reason should conquer the imagination; but I have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at others hesitating to extend the principle of natural selection to so startling a length.” Moreover, he is so meticulous and precise that my sapient brain could die of fulfillment. Every tiny detail attended to—and there are so many—makes the whole of my intelligence appear tinier and tinier. It is most incredible that Darwin had to rely on empirical data, having no access to (and indeed no knowledge of) the genetic material, the basis of hereditable mutations. This intuition is beyond my comprehension. How could one man foresee such an immense and intricate scheme of things despite the widely accepted, unquestionable doctrines of his time?Compulsory Postscript: Tim Minchin on Americans and Evolution."

After reading it, I whole-heartedly agree with the statement. Only when one reads Darwin's perspective on such topics as breeding, domestic speciation, migration, instinct, etc. does one come to fully realize how much this book ushered in a new age of modern thought. The Theory of Evolution is so pervasive in the mindset of today's world that only by reading the work can one understand how much of a statement Darwin was making by risking its publication. He very literally changed the world or, rather, told us how it had been changed.Within the book Darwin also makes many references to the ""beauty"" and ""wonder"" of nature, something that I found quite fascinating considering how many (or at least some) believe his works to be the antithesis of religious ideals. I gained a respect for Darwin's knowledge and love for the natural world that surrounds us, and there is no question that his words caused me to appreciate nature in both a scientific and spiritual sense. As my opening quote demonstrates, you owe it to yourself to read this book. It changed the way mankind viewed the planet, their relationship with it and, indeed, their relationship with their very origins. ""There is grandeur in this view of life..."""

Because reading this is pure torture. I've studied Dawrin's theory so I was interested in the way he came up to those conclusions. I was pretty surprised that he even managed to do it considering how much he didn't know back then. But the way the book was written... I won't lie it's a great sleeping aid. The repetitions and multiple examples for the same thing must have been crucial for convincing people back then but made me scream. I hate evolutionary genetics because for some reason I find it extremely boring. Still this is one of the pillars of today's biology so as a biologist I had to read it.

However, in the last chapter, he takes his time to briefly explain to us everything he has taught us during his works, in order to makes us perceive the wonderful struggle for existence surrounding us.The book makes you feel something like ""you deserve to be amazing, because life took such a contrivance to conceive you""."

You will want to jump to the Introduction, itself pretty turgid:""Indefinite variability is a much more common result of changed conditions than definite variability, and has probably played a more important part in the formation of our domestic races. We see indefinite variability in the endless slight peculiarities which distinguish the individuals of the same species, and which cannot be accounted for by inheritance from either parent or from some more remote ancestor."" OK, then! On to Chap. 1: ""When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants, and compare them with closely allied species, we generally perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less uniformity of character than in true species. Domestic races often have a somewhat monstrous character; by which I mean, that, although differing from each other and from other species of the same genus, in several trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part..."" Less turgid, but still pretty tough sledding, at least for me. Trying Chap 2: ""I am convinced that the most experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the cases of variability, even in important parts of structure, which he could collect on good authority, as I have collected, during a course of years. It should be remembered that systematists are far from being pleased at finding variability in important characters, and that there are not many men who will laboriously examine internal and important organs, and compare them in many specimens of the same species.""OK.

Darwin was unusually reflexive and tempered in his writing, probably owing at least in part to the heavy disapproval he know he would encounter from everyone from the clergy to other scientists, but props to him for writing in a way that is at once confident and humble. Reading this after Feyerabend's Against Method, the major thing I took away from it was that science should always leave itself open to the consideration of new theories, even if those theories contradict the logical systems that presently reign. In the case of Darwin, it is utterly apparent (to me) that Natural Selection is an ethical and valuable creation myth that opens the field of scientific inquiry to an untold number of fresh possibilities. That it was abused by so-called social Darwinists and other politically motivated actors only reinforces my feeling that the ethical implications of all scientific theory should be subjected to at least as much rigor as data, methodology, and repeatability.Finally, Darwin uses awesome examples of strange animals."

But even from a strictly layperson's view, there are a number of things about The Origin of Species that greatly impressed me.His careful observations. It is obvious that he cared deeply about his work. He had made careful observations and comparisons about many species, both plants and animals. It is quite clear that he passionately loved nature.""He must be a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a [honey]comb, so beautifully adapted to its end, without enthusiastic admiration.His elegant use of language. While the target audience of The Origin was his fellow scientists, he wrote clearly and plainly enough that a non-scientist could follow the main points of his argument. At the same time, there is a beauty and elegance in his use of language:""... it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts... not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.""His humility. He openly admitted the weak points of his theory - in fact, there is an entire chapter entitled ""Difficulties on Theory."" In addition, he gave credit to other scientists for their contributions to both his and their own fields of research. And yet, he doesn't back down in the face of objections. Consider this emphatic statement concerning geologic time:""He who can read Sir Charles Lyell's grand work on the Principles of Geology, which the future historian will recognize as having produced a revolution in natural science, yet does not admit how incomprehensibly vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume."" The fact that Darwin reached his conclusions from observation and experiment before the birth of modern genetics is even more remarkable. His postulation  ...that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other... has certainly been proven true by modern DNA evidence.It goes without saying that a considerable amount of his work has been superseded with newer and more accurate findings. Mr. Darwin died before the development of the theories of continental drift and plate tectonics. While reading this, I couldn't help thinking how amazed he would be if he were able to see all of today's various fields of science, especially DNA research. ""The whole history of the world, as at present known, although of a length quite incomprehensible by us, will hereafter be recognized as a mere fragment of time, compared with the ages which have lapsed since the first creature, the progenitor of innnumerable extinct and living descendants, was created. In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches.""Now for the criticism. Mr. Darwin tends to repeat himself. Perhaps he did this on purpose to reiterate his position. I confess, I skimmed the final chapter titled ""Recapitulation and Conclusion."" Also, as has been often noted, Darwin was in a rush to publish and omitted quite a lot of data that supported his conclusions. As Thomas Henry Huxley said about The Origin of Species:...a sort of intellectual pemmican - a mass of facts crushed and pounded into shape, rather than held together by the ordinary medium of an obvious logical bond...Again, for sheer want of room, much has to be taken for granted which might readily enough be proved... the novice in biology is apt to complain of the frequency of what he fancies is gratuitous assumption .(Yet, in spite of those rather harsh words, Huxley was one of the most vocal and vehement supporters of Darwin's theory, becoming known as ""Darwin's Bulldog."")"

The Apollo guidance computer had less computing power than average modern family car. This is how we should view Darwin's 'Origin Of The Species'. It is an absolute triumph of empirical evidence based science. By the most constant and careful observation of the natural world Darwin not only worked out the theory of evolution he also quite correctly realised that all life forms on this planet are related to one another, ""by which all living and extinct beings are united by complex,radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities into one grand system""The first two chapters and the last chapter are where the general reader can feel the sparkle of Darwin's ideas and his profound infatuation with nature and its works. These chapters are also the best written and not surprisingly are a thrilling rush of theory and ideas.The vast bulk of the work is the minutiae of his ideas. It is, I have to say, cumbersome to read. It is the sort of sub clausal slog that a lot of nineteenth century writing gets bogged down in. Darwin's modesty in quoting and attributing to others and his unfailing scientific fearlessness in saying 'OK here is where my theory falls over' makes him a figure of unimpeachable scientific integrity.After reading this book I can understand the affection and respect that Darwin has been held in by those who try to base their lives in reason and science."

Definitely 5/5.Darwin's theory in a nutshell: Nature selects organisms with certain features (variations) to pass on their traits that help them survive (against competition – for food, shelter, mates – the environment and predators), forming different species (descendants with modification from a common ancestor) over many generations. Other factors that contribute to natural selection: diversification, living conditions, disuse of body parts. The species that can’t develop such traits eventually go extinct because nature keeps populations in balance (no population can grow forever, not even us: see Lovelock).Natural selection also modifies instincts (e.g. geometrically perfect beehives), and through variations in their reproductive systems why different species can’t procreate with one another (and if they do, their offspring is sterile)"

Which was my first encounter in Charles Darwin and all he and his work was about - Darwin’s finches, natural selection, evolution over time and his revolutionary voyage on the HMS Beagle was in just about every genetics module and evolution base modules I was taught. I’ve been encountering snippets of his work all throughout my studies, a quote here, an excerpt there and thought it was about time I go straight to the source and read On the Origin of Species. It’s such an original, a legend in its own right in its revolutionary reports and observations. I find it quite frankly amazing how much this amazing man deduced and discovered considering it was during a time when many of the scientific discoveries we have come to know now as common knowledge (like DNA) were unheard of back then. I’m glad I finally got round the reading the writings of the man who shaped our world in so many ways with the science he produced in this book.

In the twenty-first century, this book should not be read for the science it. Darwin didn’t know mutations, he didn’t even know Mendel’s Laws! The important thing about this book is the change of world view it brought: we, humans, are not special! This story is not about us! In a way, it feels like the cruelest joke in existence has been played on us: we became self aware only to realize we are not protagonists. We are not on the top of the evolutionary scale, we are not more perfect than other living beings. This story began much before us and will probably end long after us. “Origin” helped us realize that.Darwin was a man ahead of his time, and I admire him greatly.Excellent read! "
54,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1334545-david-s-t,3,"I figured while I was on my evolution book kick, I might as well go back to the original (well sort of the original, Alfred Russel Wallace published a paper on natural selection which prompted Darwin to publish this “abstract”). Now that I'm finished I feel two different ways about the book, a loved yet bored type of feeling. First I'm amazed at just how much of Darwin's theories and ideas are accurate and accepted even today 150 years later (which is a pretty darn long time in science). One thing you have to appreciate about this book is that its pretty evident that Darwin didn't just rush out and publish this theories but thought about every possible question everyone could have and he attempts to answer them all. Another question he spends a lot of time on is how flora could make it to islands, he goes through page after page of experiments trying to see how long seeds can stay in salt water and still germinate. Even better way back 150 years ago Darwin already anticipated the irreducible complexity argument of the eye and proposed his own ideas about how the eye could evolve and how each gradation is useful in itself. Some times the prose was pretty amazing, I think the famous line about “There is grandeur in this view of life.....” is one of my favorites in any book I've read.So as amazing as some parts where why then did I rate it 3 stars? Well for every amazing part there are page after page of material which is (to me) just plain boring. The prose which is great in sections is pretty tedious in other parts. The fact that he thought of every question means that he goes over proof after proof. Remember the salt water and the seeds mentioned above, well its cool at first but 40 pages of his experiments makes me start to care less and less. There were also a few parts which he got wrong, he spends a whole section trying to figure out why certain animals can't cross breed, something which is quickly addressed now days with DNA. I think at another part he denies that there ever were any mass extinctions (something we know happened several times in the earth's history). Another thing which made the book a little harder for me is Darwin mentions lots of people and animals I've never heard of, of course a better reader would have spend time looking them up but I just read on, I guess I didn't care enough to do that much research for the book. So overall for importance I'd rate this book a 5/5, but I have to factor in enjoyment and I so its gets the lower score. Truthfully this book is 150 years old and written in Victorian English, its very important, but there are better books on evolution out there, so if you're curious about the fascinating world of evolution, start elsewhere, only if you're curious about how the theory got started pick this one up.

I should not have been and am glad I did for the following reasons,1) The book reads as well as any of the good popular science books available on audible. It is written as if his attended audience is for a 13 year old. That's how good of a writer Darwin is.2) I had obtained a google book version, but couldn't bring myself to read it, and I had obtained a free audio version floating around the net, but this audio version is professionally read and doesn't suffer at all from the narrator.3) The book lays out a very complicated argument in 13 basically independent chapters. Each chapter by itself is enough to convince the listener of the fact of evolution by natural selection. The author is very smooth at telling you what he's going to tell you, then tell you, and then explain to you what he has just told you.4) The book is a guidebook on how to lay out an argument and convince others to your viewpoint. He makes sure that he fairly presents criticism that could attack his theory and refutes it masterfully.5) My favorite reason for having read this book is that my smugness index has gone up. When I come across people who haven't read the book and deny the scientific fact of evolution I can now say that I have listened to the book and smugly add statements like ""even a thirteen year old can understand evolution, haven't you even read 'On the Origin of Species'""."

In all honesty, this one was a challenge to get through at times -- often tedious in the sheer amount of detail, and the frequent repetition and reiteration of key arguments. I wish it had been about half as long, but I'm glad to be able to say I've read it. All that said, this book is a tour de force. The mark of a good theory is that it seems blatantly obvious in retrospect. I often had to remind myself what a revolutionary idea this was at the time, and yet the strength of Darwin's argument is overwhelming. The breadth and depth of his knowledge and research is also astonishing -- from talking about crossbreeds of plants I've never even heard of, to laying out the specific geological conditions under which fossils can be formed. It's hard to believe that he was able to lay out this theory well before the discovery of Mendelian inheritance (let alone DNA) and Pangea. The fact that he was able to come up with this elegant explanation of the origin of species without that knowledge, and still make such a compelling argument for it, is so impressive. ""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."""

61,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5958504-jacob-aitken,3,"At best Darwin can explain the survival of the fittest, not the arrival of a new species. Survival, not arrival.If this book were written today, it wouldn’t have caused such an uproar. Some of that is we are familiar with his thesis. But not all of Darwin’s book is controversial. Parts are quite technical and of interest only to bird specialists and such.The mechanism of evolution is natural selection. Interestingly, Darwin is still using causal language, in noting that there must be some “efficient cause” (Darwin 9).Key point: “A much more important rule….is that, at whatever period of life a peculiarity first appeared, it tends to reappear in the offspring at a corresponding age” (11).Darwin gives a running commentary on different changes in microevolution. Most of this is true, but illustrates a point left unsaid: all of these variations are evidence of design (by humans), not of random selection.Darwin admits no one has come up with a good definition of species (24). This point shouldn’t be overlooked. If specieses aren’t locked in stone, then we need to acknowledge the possibility that a critter could be “80% dog.” Or even more alarming, 75% human.He admits that varieties cannot be distinguished from species except only if we have the intermediate links (31). This is the Holy Grail of Darwinism.Darwin comes back to this point at the end of the book. By the end of the book he is quite clear that our classifications aren’t arbitrary, but follow a logical and natural order. I agree with him, and while this isn’t a contradiction per se, it does show that Darwin comes down to some sort of unity and not pure randomness. I hesitate to use the word “design,” but you see where I am going.Thesis: Natural selection is the preservation of favorable individual differences and the destruction of those which are injurious (40).Darwin admits his term “Natural Selection” is misleading. Evolution posits a blind, unguided process and natural selection implies an active guider. And Nature’s evolution takes place over “long periods of time” (49). This is key because it will create huge problems with the Cambrian fossil record.Darwin follows up with objections raised. Most of these are quite uninteresting and is literally an argument against certain bird specialists. He does make one interesting comment in passing (chapter 7)“Lastly, more than one writer has asked, why have some animals had their mental powers more highly developed than others, as such would be advantageous to all” (106)?This anticipates Plantinga’s “Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism.” If I don’t have a mind or soul, nor have I freedom, this means that everything I do is causally determined by events, circumstances, and neurons firing. This means either (a) beliefs themselves are physical states (remember, on Darwin’s reading there is no soul) or (b) are reduced to physical states. If that’s the case, in order to survive I don’t need to believe in (x), I just need to react vis-a-vis my nervous system. If naturalism is true, then why should I believe it to be true?Of course Darwin doesn’t mention any of that, nor do his critics. I think the reality and presupposition of the soul was still dominant that there was no point. Later in the chapter Darwin mentions of a certain species’s “Powers of movement” (115). I find it interesting that he is still using Aristotelian language.Chapter 8: InstinctMost of this chapter is a reflection on the relationship between instinct and habit. Nothing major hinges on it. The only possible problem arises when we get to categories like “dispositions” and the like. These aren’t physical states. They are mental states.Darwin is very honest about the conditions under which his theory would be falsified: where is the evidence? And did that evidence arise gradually or at once? To be fair, he offers different models that explain the evidence (or lack thereof). That is a perfectly legitimate move in science, and he ends the chapter with admittedly beautiful prose. But let’s pay attention to what he just did: this isn’t merely using the scientific method and testing a hypothesis. We are now substituting a model to explain away the lack of evidence.ConclusionI don’t know if the whole book is worth reading. And regardless of my criticisms of Darwin, I strongly urge fellow theists to read this book. If you read it you will be better informed on evolution than most federal judges and ACLU lawyers. But you probably don’t need to read the whole book. Definitely read chapters 1-2, 4, 6, 10, and the final few pages."
62,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19578583-chip-hunter,5,"Charles Darwin’s works describing his theories of Natural Selection and Survival of the Fittest, may be the most impactful scientific book ever written, having had such a dramatic influence on our thinking of biology, and having largely withstood the test of time. As a plant geneticist and molecular biologist it has been on my personal reading list for too long and I finally found the will to tackle this not-always-thrilling read. The book is certainly longer than it needed to be to convey the most important points, especially as much of it is dedicated to defending the theories from criticisms which do not seem worth defending against given our current understanding of biology. Still, his eloquence and clear thinking succeed in simplifying a mind-numbingly complex system of nature and making his explanations seem obvious and incontrovertible. One thing that comes through clearly when reading Darwin’s work is the obvious sense of wonder with which he regarded the natural world. He was a Naturalist in every sense, examining organisms and conducting experiments, spending his life detailing observations and accumulating knowledge that most others of his time probably considered useless. It is easy to imagine a young Darwin crouched to pollinate a flower or on hands and knees examining the behavior of ants. His love of nature and appreciation for the nearly-unfathomable complexity of life is palpable.ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES begins with confusing speculation about hyper-variation in domesticated animals compared to those in the wild. Darwin then moves into a discussion regarding the ancestry of domestic animals relying on the then-current understanding of domestication and divergence under selection during breeding. Next he addresses the incompleteness of the geological record, spending a lot of time laying the groundwork for his later arguments for why intermediate forms of life are not abundant in the fossil record. It is not until Chapter 3 – “Natural Selection”, that Darwin really introduces the meat of his theories. At this point the book becomes fascinating, discussing complexity of ecosystems, struggles between life forms, ecological webs, niches, and balance. His observation that the most intense competition in nature would be between “allied” (similar) species, and thus recently evolved forms would most directly compete with their closest ancestors, was astute. This point becomes a central pillar for explaining why advantageous traits proliferate and why dominant forms outcompete their closest ancestors, forces that encourage growing complexity, increased fitness, and ecological diversity. Darwin discusses cycles of variation, selection, and extinction that he postulates must have happened innumerable times across vast stretches of time to result in the current diversity of life. His arguments are presented so as to be unavoidable and obvious when taken one at a time but which together claim to explain the unfathomable complexity of current and extinct life. It is with some degree of awe that we realize what amazing insight Darwin had to envision such an all-encompassing theory with only a tiny fraction of life’s history and complexity to examine.One claim that has not withstood the test of time, but which Darwin referred to probably half a dozen times is Natura non facit saltum “Nature does not make a jump” or “Nature does nothing in jumps”. He uses assumption to apply unnecessary constraints to his theories, insisting that change must be gradual and occur in small increments. We now realize this is overstated and that abrupt and major changes are commonplace in the evolution of species. Another area where Darwin didn’t get things quite right surrounds his postulation that heritable change is somehow guided by the conditions (environment) of life. He considers some force acting on the reproductive system to cause increased and nonrandom variability and thus appear almost purposeful in adaptation to changing climate or geography. There may be something there regarding adaptive epigenetic changes, but these are not the forces of speciation and long-term evolution that Darwin was describing. It is interesting that Darwin honed in on reproduction as being so critical for driving variation, going so far as to calling the beneficial outcome of breeding and sex a law of nature. Of course, with no understanding of genetics and sexual recombination, falling back on a law of nature is understandable. Finally, Darwin spends time describing a tendency of life forms to revert to an ancient state, citing patterning on domestic horses and pigeons re-emerging after inter-breed crossing. Here is an area where Gregor Mendel’s findings would have been important for correct interpretation. Indeed, it is unfortunate that Darwin was not familiar with Mendel’s work, which was being recorded contemporaneously with Darwin’s work, but which was not published widely until its re-discovery in about 1900. The discoveries regarding inheritance and gene theory by Mendel would have been recognized as important by Darwin and fit seamlessly into his theories (as they later did).What is absent from the book is also important. Sensitive to the political ramifications of his theories, Darwin makes almost no mention of the relationship between man and animals, with the exception of a brief statement that as a result of examinations guided by his theories “Light will be thrown on the origin of man and of his history.” Another surprising absence to me was that of “Darwin’s Finches”, the famous short-, large-, or long-beaked finches that Darwin observed in the Galapagos Islands and which are used as the textbook example of Natural Selection in the teaching of evolution. Finally, Darwin goes out of his way to ensure his readers that his theories have nothing to say about the origins of life in general, a claim that has since been disputed but about a topic that still puzzles evolutionary theoreticians to this day. The close of the book eloquently states the wonder with which Darwin made his observations: “There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.” That word, “evolve”, only occurs in that last sentence of the book, but encapsulates so well the process of improvement through change we now take for granted when considering biology. This work of Darwin’s is justly credited with the emergence of that so-crucial aspect of our current understanding of life."

What a dummy! He thought Giraffe's necks got longer because each generation kept straining to reach ever higher leaves. Well, Darwin thought the same thing. In a section called Use and Disuse he says, ""I think there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited"". He's a genius anyway, even if he didn't know how mutations actually happened. His passion shines out of every page. He argues, that since varieties of horses, when bred together, often show the same pattern of stripes, the ancestor of all horses must have had those stripes. He says to believe otherwise is to ""make the works of God mere mockery and deception; I would almost as soon believe with the old and ignorant cosmogonists, that fossil shells had never lived, but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now living on the sea-shore"". There's a little unintended irony in his describing convergent evolution as being like two men independently hitting on the same invention. He actually had to rush this book into print to beat Wallace, who independently developed the same theory. It's obvious that lifetime's observation went into this book. Just reading the examples of experiments he did and behavior he observed is exhausting. Dogged observer and experimenter that he was, he also gets a little mystical sometimes, talking about an unknown bond between species related to the ""principle of life"". He is also surprisingly parochial at times. At one point he refers to the ""most impressive"" observations of a ""Mr. Smith of Jordan Hill"". He explains that, in light of his theory, classification should be regarded as demonstrating descent, not the plan of the Creator. He published this document in a world in which almost everyone was a creationist. In the final chapter, he says, ""Nothing at first can appear more difficult to believe than that the more complex organs and instincts should have been perfected, not by means superior to, though analagous with, human reason"". He then goes on to explain why his theory is actualy indisputable. Tough guy. His theory is called revolutionary, and he cites no contributors, as if he made the whole thing up himself. Yet, he seems to refer to battles between evolutionists and creationists. He talks about embryos displaying characteristics of earlier species. To him, the stamp of evolution could not be plainer, and creationists ""willfully will not understand"". Carrying the implications of evolution theory back to the beginning of life, Darwin conjectures that animals descended from four or five progenitors, and plants, perhaps, less. Then he goes further, hypothesising ""one primordial form, into which life was first breathed"". "

We all know what it says, and anyone who has read any of Dawkin's books, or any book that covers evolution in any way, will have read largely the same things. I was in fact surprised by how much of the scientific proof of evolution comes from Darwin himself. Essentially everything that can be externally observed, he came up with. The whole book is just proof upon proof of the theory of evolution. If you are already convinced, it's ok to read just the last chapter, which is breathtaking. If you are struggling to understand, or trying to convince someone else, read all of it. More so than modern books, Darwin's original properly argues against simple ideas that a person could object without really knowing much about complex science. It also gives you the proper understanding of the enormity and all-encompassing research that went into coming up with this theory. Darwin did not pull it out of a hat. This is his life's work, and it is probably one of the most impressive a single human has ever created. By the end of the book, I came up with a metaphor to describe Darwin and creationists. If understanding the world can be compared to assembling a puzzle, Darwin sorted through all the pieces in the box, collected the edges, and laid out the frame, so that future scientists could then build on the inside. The creationists would be a 5 year old who is trying to glue the puzzle pieces to a soccer ball because his dad said that only ball games are real games. There are a few objections that Darwin had to deal with but did not have enough evidence at the time to present, but they were all within the accepted understanding that the world was at least millions of years old. He had to deal with naturalists believing in independently created species, not flood-believers. The fact that not only this debate is going on in the 21st century, but that the opponents have regressed to even more absurd beliefs, is just shameful to humanity. What he describes in the Origin of Species is enough to change textbooks, and everything discovered since has done nothing but converge on the same answer: species evolve, and natural selection makes it happen."
68,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10361721-dmitry-belyavsky,5,"Several aspects of the book surprised and delighted me.I didn't expect this to read as a novel, and it was not one, this was a philosophical thesis, and the result of some 30 years of research and contemplation which has not gone to waste.As a non-native English speaker I expected this to be a upstream struggle in comprehension - it was not. The language is only slightly archaic but overall is surprisingly down to earth once I got used to the style of the narrative.The logic and the examples used to support it were clear.Charles Darwin did not make his conclusions lightly and had full understanding of controversial nature of his work, but felt it was necessary to express the truth that was revealed to him through his research. It is apparent from this book that he had discussed each and every point of the theory at length. Much with those who were like minded and just as much with those who opposed him. And he relates the counterpoints in this very volume along with his reasons for thinking why these counterpoints are invalid.On this what surprised me is that (at least to my knowledge) the biggest opponents of evolutionary theory today (let's call them creationists for simplicity) have not came up with any new counter arguments to it. Everything creationists are saying today against evolutionary theory Darwin has answered already in this very book. Should they only ready it and follow the logic.... but I digress.In conclusion I should point out that this isn't an entertaining book, and at times it does become tedious, but it's invaluable educational and historic piece that anyone interested in evolution and modern science should ""suffer through"" at least once."

It seems to me that through the years as each new ""scientist"" or ""expert"" has come up with their own ""pet"" theories, they twisted and/or ignored the parts of this book they didn't like, but still attributed them to Darwin. That way they could make it SEEM Darwin was backing up what they were saying.The biggest case AGAINST Darwin is Darwin HIMSELF! Just the parts of this book that discuss how women are actually ""lower forms of life"" than men is enough to make you want to throw this book away (or at least cause a serious rise in blood pressure).If you are going to refer to something as ""Darwinism"" at least it should be something he ACTUALLY wrote or believed.Read this book from cover to cover and see what non-sense it is. It is full of holes in reasoning and his bias reflects the TIME & CULTURE that Darwin was a part of. It does not resemble today's ""Darwinism"", which almost always goes hand in hand with Atheism.Darwin believed in God as the Creator. It is prevalent throughout this book. One of the few things he got right, but the main thing nobody wants to attribute to him. Read ""Origin of the Species"" and see how much ""blind faith"" it requires and how many basics of science that we now know but Darwin was clueless about. If he could be so incredibly wrong about some things, how can we trust anything he says?Laura-Lee Rahn"
70,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12484910-charbel,5,"Reviewing a timeless book like this one is no easy task, but after having read it three times I might be able to put something together.The Origin of Species is one of my favourite accounts of the theory of evolution. It's not the first piece about the theory ever written as many believe, nor is it compatible with everything we know about evolution today. What makes this book special, however, is the narrative. As Darwin guides the reader through the proposed theory of the origin of living organisms and their gradual development, only one word can come to mind: elegance. Elegance in the ideas, elegance in the delivery, and above all elegance in the acknowledgement that there is so much that is unknown (at his day).One particularly pleasant aspect of the book is the tremendous amount of examples that Darwin provides. Reading the book becomes then like browsing a catalogue of various fauna and flora from all over the world as you slowly begin to understand the basis behind the theory. It's not a book to rush through, nor is it the book that I'd recommend for getting acquainted with the subject (for that purpose I recommend The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution), but it is the book to read if you want to go back and understand how the theory of evolution began to develop and why it is often credited to Darwin."
71,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12558730-m-m-strawberry-library-reviews,1,"Darwin's 'Origin of Species' was a groundbreaking work that added a whole new dimension to science. Many fields of science, such as biology, chemistry, and medicine, have all benefited from the teaching and understanding of evolution, and these mentioned fields (and more) also prove evolution, so it was a win-win situation for the scientific world.If you want to buy Darwin's work, do NOT buy this version. A 150th anniversary edition certainly sounds cool, but unfortunately, the (in)famous Creatard Ray Comfort isn't content with writing a bunch of books about how Creationism is the cat's pajamas. No, he just HAS t0 go after the book that started it all.His introduction comes across as tl;dr (too long; didn't read) Mind you, tl;dr doesn't mean to not read it, it means that something is very long and irrelevant. Mr. Comfort makes several false claims in his 'introduction', trying to debunk Darwin as much as he can. Comfort's attitude comes across as very condescending, and his 'research' is the usual straw man argument offered by Creationists over and over and over. It is painful to slog through, and even more painful to know that people actually agree with him. He also makes horrible claims - that Darwin ""created"" the ""idea"" of evolution to spite religion (how can something be created if it'd always been there?) and tries to blame Darwin for Nazism (ORLY?) and provides virtually no evidence for his claims.If you're interested in Darwin's work. Amazon has several other editions of Origin of Species, without some insulting Creationist babble as the introduction. "
72,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10008363-salema,3,"This book honestly was hard to get through. 30% into the book and I was looking for the light at the end of the tunnel. At first I thought it was a badly translated book because the punctuations and the grammar were all over the place. Then I remembered Charles Darwin was English. Why would he need this translated? I did not enjoy the way it was written and there were so many repetitions, I wondered if I was reading the same pages over and over. Bear in mind I am a cell biologist, so reading scientific manuscripts are a routine to me and I rarely find them tedious.Now for the main content of the book, I found Darwin’s theories very fascinating as to how existing creatures came to be. He does not once bash any religions and their ideologies but merely requests that to not liken the way a “Creator” would create a being to how we would conceive the process of creation. For the most part he dwells into how creatures share a common progenitor with so many transitions to form different species; their changes being gradually and slowly influenced by the environment and the need for special traits. This gradual finessing of organisms and the complexity of it, could be considered a godly process.It is a must read but it requires a vast amount of patience and diligence to see this book through. I would’ve given this book a four star rating but deducted a point for the prose."
73,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/869064-jeremy,3,"While this is obviously a hugely important piece of work that had major implications for evolutionary theory, ecology, and eventually genetics, it's one of the most dully written things I've come across. When he talks about the theory itself it's fine, but he spends so much time explaining things like pigeon coloring, and plant stamens, that I found myself throwing it down from sheer boredom. I was surprised by how tame the text was considering the firestorm of bullshit that asshole creationists have raised in its wake. Even at its most provocative its still very sedate, very victorian. Having attended public school in Kansas at a time when our fundamentalist christian school board was doing everything in its power to legislate these ideas out of our curriculum in favor of intelligent design, I was surprised at just how un-polemical Darwin actually is. And while this seems like the obvious place to start if you want to read about evolutionary theory, many writers who came after him summed up these ideas far more compellingly and comprehensivley than he does."
74,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1635782-mike,4,"I listened to an abridged audio version of this book and it was enough for me to get the point. This isn't the devil book that many people want it to be. Darwin doesn't spend much time on the theological implications of his theory. He is on a mission to present evidence of his theory. What I wasn't expecting was how often he talked about the alternate theory of ""creation,"" which has little to do with the biblical passages in Genesis and everything to do with the idea of spontaneous generation of new species. Darwin even quotes Genesis to illustrate a point having to do with genetics. In the end, Darwin isn't out to foil the Christian faith. He is presenting evidence and defending critiques of his theory of natural selection. Read this one because it is hard to listen to."
75,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27271235-twila-newey,5,"I am in love with Charles Darwin. There are sections of this book that read like poetry. His careful attention and love for the natural world is woven inextricably through the text. Natural Selection is a She and what he describes as a hierarchical struggle for survival I see as a series of resurrections, life in increasingly perfect forms. I have a whole series of poems (30 so far) that have grown out of pairing this text with the Christian Gospels. The theme of impermanence runs through both. Wonder runs through both. I highly recommend reading this book and not allowing other people's interpretations to stand in for Darwin's pure delight."

85,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/544212-gijs-grob,5,"'The Origin of Species' is one of the classic texts of science, and one of few world-turning texts, comparable to Karl Marx's 'Das Kapital' (1867) in its wide-ranging influence, far outside the limits of its discipline. The text is not only remarkable for its groundbreaking theory, but also for its thoroughness, modesty and surprising target audience: Darwin wrote 'The Origin of Species' for the (informed) layman, so everyone could read about his new insight, not only a few naturalists. Inside his book, Darwin not only explains his theory, but gives a massive amount of (circumstantial) evidence, almost overflowing the reader, while frankly indicating the gaps in man's knowledge (in Darwin's time, both genetics and continental drift were utterly unknown, hampering some of the foundation of Darwin's otherwise very sound theory). For the modern reader some chapters raise a ""duh""-feel, as one all too easily forgets that Darwin defends his theory against one important competitor: independent creation of all species. Darwin makes utterly clear that creation doesn't stand a chance in explaining the phenomena observed, but wisely keeps the further implications, like theological ones outside his book. Nevertheless, Darwin's sharp observations and wealth of evidence is outstanding. Not only did he observe nature well, he also conducted several experiments to support his theory (for example, the resistance of seeds in sea water to explain colonization of remote islands, or experiments with various species of slave-making ants, to show that even instinct can be formed by natural selection). Moreover, Darwin clearly is not an isolated figure, but one who draws on the work of countless other naturalists, whom he all mentions with respect, even if he discards some of their opinions. To name one of Darwin's remarkable achievements: by clever calculation based on simple assumptions Darwin estimates the (Cretaceous) chalk formations of The Weald in Southeast England as being 400 million years old. This may an overestimation four times the formations' real age, it still comes surprisingly near, when compared to contemporary dating attempts, in which the Earth's complete age never went further than a few hundred thousands years back. Darwin even gains deeper respect when pointing out the gaps in his own theory: indeed, he has no idea how heredity works. Nor can he explain the Cambrian explosion (which he sets in ""the lower Silurian""), but he rightly predicts that this is preceded by a very long time (the Precambrian) in which the process of evolution was very slow. Likewise, Darwin cannot explain the floral similarities between South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, but he predicts this problem will be solved in the future. And surely in the 20th century it was, by continental drift.Despite the gaps Darwin is confident that he is right, and he concludes his book in an upbeat tone: with his theory all biological research suddenly makes sense, and truly today his theory encompasses all biological thought. He predicts that ""light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history"" (page 458) and ends his awe-inspiring book with these great thoughts: ""When I view all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled (.....) As all the living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those who lived long before the Silurian epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world. Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length. (.....) There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."""
86,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21155710-maria,0,"The beauty of this book lies at least in five aspects: the broadness of the target audience, for the thesis is made clear for anyone with no previous knowledge of the matter; the impact it had and has still on humanity; the beauty of the writing itself, enhanced by the clarity of thought; the painstaking exploration and management of ideas - points being explored with no bias and proven through analytical demonstration, making Darwin's modus operandi a standard for scientific enquiry; and lastly, the quality of the ideas themselves, which, even if no longer revolutionary, remain thought-provoking and applicable to day to day life.I repeatedly had to lift my head from the book to contemplate some of these ideas, and frequently I could not go on reading because they remained undigested in my stomach, precluding the advance. For me, this is a sign of a great book.The term coined by sociologist Herbert Spencer to describe natural selection - survival of the fittest - is an interesting one, although usually misinterpreted. Fitness in this sense refers to an organism's capacity to thrive in its environment well enough to breed. And the human lesson I take from here is adaptability. Natural selection is a protracted mechanism, and though we can grasp traces of it, we don't live long enough to watch it as it produces significant change. However, in our smaller scale, we can observe a phenomenon quite similiar to natural selection, not necessarily for reproductive purposes, but most always related with success. Survival of the fittest on a human scale can be translated as adaptability to one's environment and ultimately oneself. This would be a long dissertation that has no place in this review.I tend to take a dislike to rating non-fictional, moreover scientific books. For all the reasons previosuly presented, and not for finding the thesis perfect, if I were to rate it, I would probably rate it 5 stars, but I have not yet overcome my aversion to classifying the monuments of scientific endeavour.I'll wrap up with one of the passages that had me thinking a great lot and for many a day: ""monstrosities cannot be separated by any clear line of distinction from mere variations."""

Given the evidence he sets forth in this book, it's a very weak claim and honestly a poorly made scientific hypothesis. His representations of the opposing view (creationism) was mostly that of scoffing and mockery (""what came first, the seed or the flower"" and ""this is all to complicated to possibly imagine that it was created to be this way"") that don't really cause problem for the creationists. I did appreciate his consistent reference to his peers and how much they influenced him going into his research. It shows that he went into his research with a bias toward evolution and his resulting hypothesis would clearly uphold that initial presupposition. He also openly states that if there is anything discovered that is of irreducibly complex form, then his theory would fall to pieces."

What i did like about the book was that it included Charles Darwin’s struggles and views about how animals, insects, and many different species are distinctly different in their own way and how they evolved in their own way. Many factors such as change in climate, or even the change of traits in animals over time can be caused by natural selection which is one of Charles Darwins theories. Overall, although it was difficult to follow with his complex scientific literature it was an interesting book."

From my perspective, Darwin wrote tolerably well, and showed that he had studied his field. But he had also clearly made up his mind against a personal Creator beforehand, so he never really follows the evidence where it leads, and he allowed himself to be convinced by some pretty weak arguments. To me, he is at his best when demonstrating that a crab can evolve a longer eye stalk (microevolution) or lose it altogether, but he fails completely in even explaining how it would evolve an eye in the first place, much less in explaining how the species originated (macroevolution). And since this was his stated intention, that is a pretty astounding failure."

92,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52092570-rohit-sharma,5,"I have read about 175+ books in last two years and not exaggerating that almost every tenth book mentions either Darwin's theory or the book in question one way or the other. So much so that I was very curious for almost last two years to pick it up myself and read what actually he had written way back in 1859. I was shocked the way it gets mention not only in Non Fiction (mostly), but also in Fiction and even in a love story (Imagine it gets mentioned in a Jojo Moyes book too). But when I read Yuval Noah Harari's (Sapiens) and followed it with a book written way back in 60's about a court case where they debated over Bible Vs Darwin, it was simply too much for me to resist it anymore :). And then, my favorite Dan Brown came out with his new book called ""Origin"" exploring ""Where do we come from"" and ""Where are we going"". Curiosity actually killed the cat and I picked it up some 15 days ago, mind it, it isn't an easy read like any other book but way too interesting. Specially if you have any interest in ""Origin"", History, Geography, Biology and even Science, this is a must must read. Even if those subjects do not interest someone, it can be read for its literary merit too, I totally loved it. Although after reading I can claim that this book is actually a summary of his findings and these 700 pages are way too short to explain everything, going by his writing I am doubly sure that the actual theory must not be any less than 10000 pages for sure as he mentioned at so many places that he wasn't going in great details due to space constraints. On top of it, his findings weren't finished by the time he started writing this and as his health wasn't too good, his good friends and colleagues forced him to come out with this. Unbelievable that is to know and surprising is the entire book. I had no idea before reading the book that what I was getting into, this isn't just a book or a theory given by the great Charles Darwin but an encyclopedia of knowledge about the origin of life on planet earth. How everything came to be and moved from one place to another, mind-blowing is his research, theory and conclusions which he kept open to debate with people and imagine even after 150 years, we are still debating on it. I just couldn't imagine what kind of Lab he must have at that time and how far and wide he must have traveled to gather the data he has put in his theory, unbelievable. Another fantastic thing about Darwin was, not once he was afraid of giving credit to so many of his colleagues, eminent scientists and professors as he kept mentioning their names with what they thought and how it helped him to come to the conclusions that he had drawn, simply too good. Starting from the bacteria's to germs to insects, birds, animals, humans and even dinosaurs, he hasn't left anything which doesn't gets a detailed mention in this book. I really wonder how deep and terrific would be his actual detailed findings which may not be available for us lesser mortals but the scientific community must have access to those works. Although those details may not make any sense to us unscientific and god fearing people, but he was always open to other parallel theories too and never made fun of them. The way it covers the Human Origin timeline and the life on planet earth is just superb. Darwin was sure that no one can predict the exact time how long life has been here on this planet (at that time). The way he calculates the life as well as what data do we have in our hands as of now a mere negligible that we haven't yet explored an iota of what is actually there on this planet is simply mind-blowing and convincing too. This will now be one book that I am going to force every teenager that I know to read without fail, more than for sure Blyton's and Dahl's. Its an amazing encyclopedia that everyone should read. I am glad and sad both to have read a Kindle version of the book. Glad that I could actually access the meanings immediately by tapping on the terms that I had never previously heard and sad that it didn't had any of the diagrams that he made which should be available on a paperback :(. Also, now, I guess I have to go ahead and read Yuval Noah Harari's ""Homo Deus"" which takes it all to couple of steps ahead where Darwin left it. Surprisingly when I bought this book (almost a year ago) it was absolutely free on Amazon (for Kindle). If you have read this, do let me know how you like it, if not, you've got to read this without fail. This will now-onward be one of my all time favorite Non-Fiction for sure. A very highly recommended back for all. "

After all, there hasn’t been any other person’s work (that I can think of) that has been more used as a weapon against Christianity. Before giving my review I think it is only proper to explain my reasons for reading this book in the first place.1) I like to read almost any book that is very influential and has left a lasting impact on the culture at large, whether good or bad. My natural curiosity gravitates me towards the roots of certain ways of thinking and why it is certain outlooks and beliefs have gripped people so.2) I think overall it is healthy to try and understand beliefs that may be different than your own. It can help clear your head of overconfidence in oneself and bias as well.3) I always get somewhat annoyed when I hear an atheist make arguments against Christianity, and yet remains quite ignorant on what it is the Bible actually says - or they don’t even bother to read the text, or doctrine, in context. In a similar vein I think the reverse is also true. I imagine it would annoy atheists for Christians to make arguments against evolution yet being ignorant on what the theory actually claims and doesn’t claim. And I believe that as Christians we should do our best to not be hypocrites and follow the evidence wherever it leads. As Peter once said, “Always provide a reason for the faith that is in you.”As an obviously biased reader, I will still try my best to give as objective a review as I can.First. I would like to address my own misconceptions about evolution theory that this book helped clarify. When I was growing up I was under the impression that the theory taught that if an organism wanted or needed something bad enough that after tens of thousands of generations that organism would eventually acquire those features. A common example would be a giraffe desperately needing to reach those high up leaves and thus grows a longer neck (in time) to accomplish this task. Or as a joke I heard when I was young, “If evolution was true mothers would have six arms!” While the joke is still humorous today, it is still a distortion on what the theory is claiming.This quote I think clears it up nicely:“... any variation, however slight, and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be any degree profitable to an individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring. The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of the many individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a small number can survive.”In other words, an organism’s offspring will inevitably carry with them (slight) variations. Some of these variations will be beneficial, others harmful, and others neutral. Those that have beneficial variations will be more likely to survive and leave offspring, which their children will then inherit those same features, and those that inherited harmful variations will be more likely to die off. An example would be, say, a rabbit having a certain shade of fur that helps them blend into the environment more than other rabbits. These adaptations are accumulative through many thousands of generations (the theory goes) which over time add up to the major changes you see today - Note: I’m just stating the book’s claims, not endorsing any particular viewpoint.So in summary, it’s not as if evolution is “aiming” for any particular goal. It’s not aiming for anything at all. Variations happen, and natural selection weeds out the ones who are less adapted to survive, while favoring those who are more adapted and will be able pass on their genes to their offspring (interesting to note, this book was written before anything was known about genes, or the discovery of DNA).Darwin uses the examples of livestock breeders of horses, cows, sheep, etc., as well as the countless breeds of dogs to use as a backbone for his point. If a person desires a certain feature in their animals, like say a thicker wool for their sheep, longer horns for their bulls, swifter legs for their horses, and so forth, then they will only let their best animals breed amongst themselves to prevent any crossing. This is called artificial selection since it’s driven by man’s desires rather than nature’s.Before being able to accept the evolutionary premise of decent with modification (by means of natural selection) one first has to accept two other prepositions. 1) That the earth and all life on it is unfathomably old, for without that, there would be no time to accumulate all the vast changes and diversity that we see today. And 2) (and this one is longer to explain) is the Essay on Population by Malthus, which Darwin drew much of his inspiration from. Basically, it argues that populations grow quicker than there is food and space to support that population. Because of the many complex relationships organisms have with each other, any slight advantage, or slight change in environment, tips the scales in favor of one group over the other.Take for instance the population of cats. The more cats you have the less mice you have. And the amount of mice affects how many bees there are because they destroy their nests. And the amount of bees affects how many, and which, flowers get pollinated. So, indirectly, the population of cats actually determines the number of flowers there are ... which at first sounds silly.The other misconception I had about evolutionary theory was how it got looped in with other populars idea. Like the idea of life just “popping up” one day out of the blue. But Darwin’s theory doesn’t even touch on the idea of where life itself comes from ... it only explores how life became so diverse (once you had it to begin with). In fact, in his day, many people held the incorrect view that creatures like frogs and flies “spontaneously generated” and no one knew better. And a third misconception I had - (the last one, I promise) - was about Darwin himself. My view of him growing up was that he was an anti-religious fanatic that was trying to disprove God ... but I come to find out that his views were a bit more complex than I originally thought. For instance, in Darwin’s early years he was actually studying to become an Anglican priest ... but then later devoted his time to studying nature after taking a five year trip around the globe.There are many quotes in the book that reference God in a positive light (though to play devil’s advocate it’s entirely possible he was trying appeal to people’s religious sensibilities since most people were religious in that era). But you can check them out yourself:“There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according the fixed laws of gravity , from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.”And...“... I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed by the Creator.”NOW that we’ve got some of those things cleared up, let’s get to the work itself.Was the book well presented? It was actually surprisingly readable, to be honest. It felt like he was addressing a very broad audience, at times going into subjects that only experts in their field would be interested in ... while many other times making his point in common sense terms so that laymen like myself could enjoy.Was the book well argued in defending its premise? I think parts of it were compelling and convincing ... but there are still many difficulties in accepting its grand conclusion. For instance, Natural Selection isn’t in my opinion a controversial viewpoint in today’s world. Whether you’re a Christian, Buddhist, Atheist, etc., everyone pretty much accepts that creatures adapt, at least a little bit, to their environment, and can change their characteristics or instincts over time. Where the difference lies in what are the limits? Some argue that Natural Selection takes place but that earth hasn’t existed long enough to account for the vast variety we see today. While others believe that it wouldn’t matter how much time you had ... and that Natural Selection isn’t a strong enough method to drive these changes. And others, still, make distinctions between the classes of species for religious purposes, like the political candidate William Jennings Bryan who had no problem accepting the theory as a whole, but with one distinction ... that man was specially created.In Darwin’s defense he did actually dedicate an entire chapter discussing all the things problematic that he could think of with his theory. And, quite rigorously, addressed those problems time and time again ... which at least shows to me that he wasn’t quite as dogmatic as I originally supposed.The Biggest Difficulties in His Theory:Evolution is extremely slow and takes incredibly gradual steps, that accumulate over time. But how does one account for complex organs that couldn’t be perceived as adapting gradually, as each infinitesimal step wouldn’t necessarily by advantageous until it was complete?Darwin raises this concern on the topic of the human eye:“To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.”While he goes on to say that he believes this indeed did happen, it requires a bit of an imagination to envision it.The other difficulty is envisioning creatures ssslllowwwlllyyy adapting to entirely different environments. For instance, it is believed that many land creatures today, their ancestors used to live in the ocean and vica-versa: that whales used to have legs on lived on land. Or even more complicated to imagine ... a creature that could “slowly” acquire the ability to fly? I just find it really hard to swallow.Darwin does offer examples in nature where animals are not quite in a single domain, but rather intermediate between domains. A crab, for instance, is semi-aquatic, able to crawl in the water as well on land, and has legs. Frogs are amphibious: they can go in water and on land. Flying squirrels and flying lemurs don’t completely fly, but they can glide from tree to tree. And bats, while maintaining complete flight, it accomplishes this through a very unusual manner: through stretched out skin instead of feathers.Even so ... imagining the lineage of say a dove or hummingbird, where complex flight was acquired rather than just inane is ... difficult, to say the least.The other difficulty is summed up in this quote: “Was Darwin’s work the product of genuine induction and empiricism, it was asked by commentators such as Sedgwick and Owen, or was it, rather, a pseudo- or meta-historical reading of an unproveable past?”Some of the evolutionary narratives for how certain creatures gained their specific characteristics, I freely admit, can be quite compelling. But compelling or not it’s still hard to escape the fact that to create the hypotheses requires a healthy dose of imagination. How would we ever know what the ancient, unknown, progenitors of modern day creatures looked like and behaved? All they left behind are bones, and the evidence is vastly incomplete.I guess to counter the argument of talking about an unproveable past is to compare it to a detective’s work. We don’t “know” what happened back then without having lived it ourselves ... but sometimes we can find hints and clues to what might seems the most likely explanation. To use an example, there’s actually a place on earth that displays a rock wall with fossilized footprints on it. You can actually go and visit it. Reason would suggest that those footprints took place at time when that was rock wall was at one point horizontal to the earth rather than vertical.Or maybe one could say that God created a rock wall with fossilized footprints on it (but something about that seems off).The Biggest Strengths in His TheoryFor me, the topic that makes me stop and question the most is the discussion of what are called “vestigial organs”. Parts of the body that either don’t seem to serve much of a purpose OR seem better suited for a different animal. It’s the age-old question of, “Why do men have nipples?” Or “Why do certain creatures like underground moles, and fish that live in dark caverns blind?” Or, “Why do certain birds have wings but can’t fly?” The famous example would be that of an ostrich. Their wings are nearly identical to that of an eagle, and were you to transpose those wings onto a smaller creature, it would be perfectly suited for flight. The evolutionary argument is that an ancient ancestor of the ostrich developed wings for its purpose ... but somewhere along the line, through their disuse and perhaps belonging to a different environment, the ostriches of today no longer need their wings (and indeed CAN’T use them for flight).Darwin lists many other examples as well ...”Many other facts are, as it seems to me, explicable on this theory. How strange it is that bird, in the form of a woodpecker, should have been created to prey on insects on the ground; that upland geese, which never or rarely swim, should have been created with webbed feet;..”And if you think about it hard enough, one can list even more examples, like why a panda bear has a sixth thumb when it seems somewhat unnecessary? Or a koala bear that only eats eucalyptus leaves despite having extremely little nutritious value? Or a penguin (that is technically a bird with a beak and two little legs) in fact, does the opposite of what one would expect ... swim. I’ll address the theological counterpoint in my next paragraph.Addressing “Bad Design” Arguments From AtheistsMany atheists will look to flaws in nature and use them as weapons against the idea of God. “Why are human beings so prone to lower back pain? I would NEVER design humans like that ... if I were God.” “Mosquitos that spread disease and suck blood ... parasites that live in other organisms? Bad design! Case closed!” And so on and so forth.And while it’s a tempting game to play I find it rather presumptuous on the part of us humans. What we are really saying is how WE would create things if WE had the capability. But that’s not an argument against how things WERE created. And why is it we should expect that everything should have been created “perfectly” (whatever that means, depending on your definition of “perfect”). One could just as easily argue that the fact that all organisms are born to eventually die is a flaw. Heck ... I think it’s a flaw that humans can’t fly or shoot laser beams out of their eyes. No creator needed, thank you very much.*for the humor deficient that was sarcasm right there*If you read the Book of Job you’ll find two entire chapters dedicated to talking about these curiosities in nature. How God “feeds” the ravens and lions (yes ... both carnivorous creatures. He’s not giving them broccoli!) ... how He delights in the strength of war horses ... and how an ostrich buries her eggs in the sand even though predators might crush them because “God did not grant the ostrich wisdom.” ... yes, you heard that right, He delights in the stupidity of ostriches (His OWN creation!).But in any case .... I’ll move on to some of Darwin’s other observations, involving the similarity in structure of many diverse beings:“What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of a horse, the paddle of a porpoise, and the wing of a bat, should allow constructed on the same pattern, and should include similar bones, in the same relative positions?” He goes on to say that the size and form of these bones will vary greatly ... but never the order and basic design.It’s an interesting argument to suppose the similar structures in animals with VERY different habits might lend some credence to the idea that different organisms developed and used their characteristics in different ways ... but still kept the same basic blueprint.But as Darwin himself admits ... one could also say that God just created things like that, as he says:“On the ordinary view of independent creation of each being, we can only say so it is;— that it has so pleased the Creator to construct each animal and plant.”It’s up to you to decide which is the more compelling argument.The other issue I found to be interesting was the topic of migration. It’s not enough to believe that all organisms descended from some original ancient ancestors ... but that these ancestors also were in the same place, which means that species had to have done quite a lot of migrating. Take llamas and camels for instance, both believed to have been descended from a common ancestor (whether atheist or the very popular Young Earth Creationist publication Answers in Genesis believe this) ... however one species is in South America and the other lives in the Middle East. How did THAT take place?However, it’s a problem for both atheists and Christians alike, because Christians view (depending on your interpretation of the Bible) that all animals migrated from one spot as well ... off of Noah’s Ark in the hills of Ararat. Addressing Thorny Theological Implications:This may be an unpopular opinion but I don’t actually equate evolutionary theory with atheism. Sure, it’s true that the majority of atheists believe in it whole heartedly, and the majority of Christians reject it (that is, to varying degrees, in any case). But the definition of a Christian is very limited in scope, according to the Bible, and that is the belief that Jesus Christ died for your sins and was buried and alive again after three days. That’s it.Will there be any theological problems with believing in evolutionary theory? Absolutely. A great number of them in fact. I will discuss some of them in following passages.TO BE CONTINUED"

95,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12807932-b-j-richardson,4,"I think if this book were to be written today, it would have caused far less of a stir than it did a century and a half ago. There are two reasons for that. 1) Most of what this book is not in the least controversial anymore. At the time, his thinking on Natural Selection (survival of the fittest) was revolutionary. Today, even the most hard-headed, ignorant fundamentalist will acknowledge it as fact. 2) This book is too boring by modern standards to hold the interest of anyone besides a specialist in his field. Most readers today do not have the discipline (or intelligence) to wade their way through this book that is far too detail or case study oriented. Getting bogged down in the minutiae is something that none of us can do anymore. We would rather have the cliff notes. Or better yet, give us a 5-minute youtube summary. Darwin is clearly a brilliant man who loves the workings of nature. He is also incredibly well read and researched in the topics and must have had a mind-boggling correspondence list with other naturalists. You could literally cut away 90 percent of this book and still have a very convincing core set of propositions. But no, Darwin piles fact upon fact, example after example, illustration upon illustration, to demonstrate that natural selection very clearly does lead to variation among species. There are two major weaknesses in his case in my opinion. The first he openly acknowledges. His definition of species is very fluid and I am pretty sure it is not quite the definition science textbooks would use today. The problem is, no definition that I know of seems to always cover every case. To my knowledge, THERE IS no perfect definition of species. So we can't look at what the word means to us, but rather how it is being used by the reader. Yet Darwin seems to use it slightly different ways in different parts of this book.The second weakness I felt this book had is that he talks about natural selection as a driving cause but I see it as more of an effect. To be fair, the field of biology had not nearly developed enough for him to know anything about DNA, genetic variations, etc. He simply accepts variations as a fact but then seems to talk of them as though they are driven by need. The land is getting dryer and so variations will occur in which some animals are better able to retain water. Then natural selection kicks in and these mutants win out. Yes, natural selection will choose the fittest, but how did such variations occur in the first place. From Darwin... ((silence))In all, I think this is an incredibly important and groundbreaking book. I'd say it is probably fair to say it was the most important work created in the 19th century. But should everyone read it? No. I don't think that is necessary. I think everyone should know what he wrote and how it changed the way we view our world, but I am sure there are plenty of fair and balanced summations out there the average reader can get their hands on. Honestly, I don't think at this point I learned anything new by reading Origins. I simply can check it off my bucket list and move on to something else."
96,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2028989-3brittany,4," Books have been around for as long as I can remember. The first book I read was “Green Eggs and Ham” by Dr. Suess. As I grew older, my vocabulary improved, my knowledge improved, and also been informed about history by reading and researching. Do I believe books should be banned? I say no because books are written for many reasons. Books address society problems that everybody will face one day in life. What’s the point of having a book if people are going to ban them? I believe that if parents have a problem with a book then they shouldn’t let their child read it, but don’t jeopardize every other child’s knowledge. Sex,drugs,murder,and lies are what goes on in every community all over the world.Nobody can escape these things because the world isn't perfect and this occurs everywhere.Books adress these issues and in some cases tell you how to handle them.The book ""Joy Of Sex"" talks about sex and many other things that deals with sex. Is this bad? No because every person in this world have heard of sex on way or another, so why can't one read about their dessires without it being banned.Whats the point of haveing a book? To read! I believe people who bann books are banning books out of their own self interest. ""Theory of Evolution"" was a THEORY not a FACT and parents took it all the way to court for what? Ending many kids of learning about different beliefs in this world. Parents have a right to tell kids weather or not they can read a book. Every child is different so is every parent. I believe if a parent doesnt want their child to read a book DON'T BUY IT, but don't jeperdize every other person who enjoys reading. I honestly love books and with books being banned my reading isn't improving. So I'm anti-banning books because books were written to be read not to be banned."
97,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24564675-darwins-myth,2,"It's interesting how the entire title is left off this book, which essentially shows the author as being a racist (i.e. favoured races). And before anyone says,""favoured races"" is only talking about animals and plants, that's a lie. You'll only need to read the book to prove you're wrong.Chapter 6 gives interesting concerns from Darwin, as to some of the problems that his ""theory"" had in his day, and those problems are still prevalent today... such as, the complexity of the eye, and the well-defined animals that are in the world, when they should be in a state of ""confusion"" if his ""theory"" was true. Those transitional fossils are still missing, unless someone can provide the ACTUAL transitional fossils that link a reptile to an Archaeopteryx, OR, the ACTUAL transitional fossils that link a land animal to the whale... which are perhaps, the 2 hyped-up bragging points for evolutionists. Drawings, computer graphics, empty words, charts, plastered facsimiles, and list of names without the fossil PHOTOS, are NOT proof of Darwinism.This book is well overrated and shouldn't be called a science book by any stretch of the imagination, simply because a lot of imagination was used to create this book. There were many verbs used to show how uncertain or unsure Darwin was, in his own ""theory"". It's fortunate for him, he had a lot of liars and hoaxers to help him promote his ""theory"" over the years, which is the only reason why it's still taught in schools. Take away the hoaxes and the lies, Darwinism doesn't have a fossil leg to stand on. It would make a great science FICTION movie, though.I raised my rating from 1 star to 2 stars because of Darwin's honesty in Chapter 6, where he listed reasons for why his theory would be considered wrong. Those reasons are still a very high hurdle for evolutionists, even today."
98,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5590114-greg,5,"Not much to say here except that the book was more accessible and more interesting even today than I expected it to be. I expected to know pretty much everything that Darwin would say from science class, but I did not.The book will be tedious for those who don't have analytical scientific minds because each chapter and section are structured to advance the argument that the diversity of species in nature descended from a small set of original progenitors via natural selection. This often involves literally listing out each possible scenario for each argument under discussion and examining each one in turn, or explaining in detail facts which support the arguments he's advancing, but at a minute degree of detail so that no room for interpretations other than his are left.All I can say for those who are religiously opposed to the theory of evolution by natural selection is ""read the book."" If you disagree with evolution, don't do so from ignorance. In some places, Darwin goes far to reconcile his doctrine with religious creationist belief. He gives perhaps the best attempt that I've read to reconcile evolution to creationist doctrine when he discusses the ""perfection"" of the eye, and our tendency to compare the eye to the telescope.He says (paraphrasing) ""We tend to believe that the eye could not have been created by degrees because the telescope was invented by design by man. But why should we be so presumptuous as to think that the Creator invents in the same way that man invents his devices?"" Good point--isn't in possible that God's acts of creation are not similar in nature to man's acts of creation, and that arguing by analogy to man's creative process is too presumptuous?A very worthwhile read."
99,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/211995-finley,4,"The Origin of Species is an amazing book. Reading it, I felt as though I was looking in at Darwin's life--experiencing his anxiety over publishing such controversial work and feeling his excitement as he unraveled the theory. It surprised me how much Darwin covered and the lengths to which he was able to flesh out the theory of Natural Selection without the use of genetics. At times, it almost seemed as if he was on the verge of actually discovering it! The language is a little hard to get through--very eloquent but also very...shall I say...stuffy old man English? After the first couple chapters though, I found that I adapted to it and was able to understand most of what he was saying. The book is thorough. In the sixth edition, he added a whole chapter to deal with the various objections that people had made against his theory, including the lack of transitional fossils (no longer a problem). He dealt with all of these arguments fairly and articulately.To anyone who wants to learn more about evolution, I would say this: Don't start with the Origin because there is outdated information in it. I would start with the Ancestor's Tale by Richard Dawkins. But THEN: READ THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES, because it is a wonderful book and probably one of the most controversial and revolutionary books in the field of biology (it also takes center stage in the creationism debate, being popularly quote mined). It is also a good lesson in history and the evidence and arguments that he makes clearly demonstrates the mood in the scientific community at the time. "
100,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,5,"I have just finished a rereading for the 4th or 5th time and as always I am stunned by the depth and breadth of Darwin's work. A lifetime of gathering facts and analysis succintly set forth in this lttle volume. Probably the most important single work in the history of science.I don't believe that anyone can consider themselves to be educated if they have not read this book. Of all the sciences what can be more important than a general understanding of how we got here.To remember that the work was rejected by a majority of the literate world when the first edition was published in 1859, is to understand the profound difference between knowing and believing for most humans.Fortunately for Darwin no church could put him on trial as had happened to Galileo in 1632 for suggesting that earth was not the center of the universe.The fact that current polls show 55% of Americans believe that Darwin's theory is not correct is testament to the continuing difference between knowing and believing. Read once again 12/30/15. I should mention a favorite piece of trivia, the incredible coincidence that two of the greatest humans who have ever lived were born within a few hours of each other, Charles Darwin and Abraham Lincoln.Just finished (8/2016) reading the 6th and last addition (1862) which has a lot of excellent rebuttal by Darwin to objections raised by real naturalists over the years since the original edition in 1859.Just finished (4/17) the 2nd edition which contains a large preface in which Darwin listed all of the earlier authors who postulated that species must be descended from earlier species, starting with his own grandfather Erasmus Darwin. Darwin was criticized after his first edition was published that he wasn't giving credit to those who went before him, so he added this preface to correct that oversight in the first edition. The curious thing here is that it was realized that species had evolved, but no one person had figured out why they evolved. Thomas Huxley, when he first read Darwin's theory, said ""how could I have been so stupid not to think of that."
101,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17307557-amal-shoeib,3,"Whether you agree or disagree with Darwin's theories, the man is a genius! For this book has had the deepest impact on science and the study of variation of species.Well, I admit I was quite bored while reading this one, the book need a much greater deal of mental awareness than the one I invested :( There were moments when I leafed the pages frantically just to finish it :DIt was basically about the struggle for existence of Species: the conflicts and disputes against nature, climate conditions the availability of food and disputes between specieses and between members of the same species. The species that can survive the drastic conditions will reproduce and live longer and the ones that are feeble and unable to survive will extinct. and that's precisely the concept of ""Natural Selecetion"".The rhetoric of Darwin is very accessible and clear to the audience. I also admired the fact that Charles Darwin is not the kind of philosophers who just relax and sit in their chair( e.g Descartes) and ponder the world.On the contrary, he went on a 5-year voyage to explore the nature and varieties of the species.This book specifically has nothing to conflict with religion as people claim! maybe the other books of Darwin do! but I keep on exploring his mind."
102,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16380418-benjamin-nielsen,4,"This book is surprisingly easy to follow. Darwin did not, of course, have access to the 150 years of scientific advancement we have now, but he was still surprisingly correct and the evidence he provides would be enough to silence even modern day creationists. It is also a great example of the humility of science and of Darwin himself. He calmly explains his reasoning and his conclusions and gives people example of exactly how to disprove his theory. Some of the more dated problems he brings up are also quite entertaining to read. For example, one of the biggest problems he foresaw was how animals could have gotten from one continent to another, to then diverge into the diversity we now see. He thought maybe seeds drifted across the ocean and maybe a bird managed to fly across but he never really thought they were satisfying answers. Of course, we now have a completely satisfying answer, arrived at independently by geologists. Namely, that the earth was at one point all together. Anyway, this was a fun book to read. Reading it yourself will give you some interesting science background. "
103,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7347898-elisa,5,"Every bit as important and ground-breaking as every reference out there makes it out to be. And, surprisingly, it's not hard to read at all. Darwin was not a scientist: he was a naturalist, an observer of nature, and that's what makes his work not only commendable but also very approachable. For me, everything he explains about descent through modification and rudimentary organs and common ancestors not only makes sense but is corroborated by the principles of Biology concerning classification and evolution. Darwin, contrary to how creationists reacted and are still reacting towards him, does not confront the idea of ""God created everything out of nothing"" and dismisses it as nonsense (except maybe a little towards the end, when he writes ""Do they really believe that atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues?""). He takes more of a perplexed approach and doesn't seem to understand why they can't look at the facts.This man definitely changed the world. (A note on the Kindle edition: it seems abridged and it doesn't include a chart that the author refers to several times). "
104,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310403-kyle,4,"Very convincing argument, hardly long at all, related in a calm voice that inspires interest in what must have consumed Darwin for over a decade - with all the experiments he writes about one can imagine him in his backyard, examining bird droppings, or in his lab, testing how long an apple would float in salt water. How he need to write how much he trusts others informing him, even his own son at one point. For all of his calm, rational explanation, there is still enough digs at contrary naturalist and Creationists to keep thing interesting. Congratulations to the modern-day naturalist Peter and Rosemary Grant for getting the much-needed hard data to back up Darwin's ""very long argument"". Interesting, too, how often he keeps leaving things unsaid, mention how he will explain points more fully in his larger work that was to follow - nevertheless, enough has already been said on this fascinating theory of his, and I would look forward to finding out how much other scientific pioneers, such as Sigmund Freud, own Charles Darwin in debt."
105,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3387048-adam,4,"Spoiler alert: this book contains references to the existence and likely validity of modern science.Reading this was an interesting experience. I didn't find it a thrilling read, and I wouldn't recommend it as a must-read, but it was enlightening to be exposed to the time and environment of science and the world when this was written. It's kind of shocking to the system to think that he's having to make an argument to prove that all of his theories in this book are more likely to be true than creationism when they are so deeply ingrained in our current fundamentals as fact, and yet also immediately relevant again with the resurgent debate on creationism. It is also interesting to re-explore the foundation of how/why Survival of the fittest dictates our world. If those things sound interesting, I think you'll be happy exploring the book. It took me a lot of patience and perseverance to absorb all of the information and stick with him through the entire process of stating his case; I'm glad I didn't quit."

The book was so beautifully written (and read), and the argument was so convincingly laid out, that I felt enjoyably entrapped. An essay in the New Yorker, pointed out by a friend, nicely characterizes Darwin's very planned and masterful writing: http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/200.... It's not obvious that one need read the original book about such a basic and widely taught subject, but in this case I feel one must. I suspect that others have felt the same, which is why Darwin is sometimes read in literature or history of science classes. But it's nice to read just for yourself, later in life, after having read a pile of other ""popular"" science books, which lack the eloquence and purpose of this volume.The abridged version of this ""abstract"" seemed plenty long, and I supplemented by flipping through David Quammen's illustrated edition."

But it is great in the sense that it allows you to see how Darwin thought, and how far we have come in 150+ years. It is a well-reasoned argument that stunned the world so many, yet so few, years ago. Writing was Darwin's only way to communicate with the outside world. I wonder how he spoke, what his own defence would be if he had chosen to speak for himself rather than have Huxley speak for him. The outrage the book provoked is best remembered by Bishop Wilberforce's wife's comment concerning evolution - ""Let us pray that it is not true, but if it is true, let us pray that it not become generally know."" Sorry about that. So many people still do not accept evolution as fact, but one must accept the notion that it takes 400 years for knowledge to reach the lowest intellectual levels of society. 250 years to go!"

Charles Darwin commenting on the cell-making instincts of the Hive-Bee.Last year I read The Voyage of the Beagle, Charles Darwins travel journal from his trip around the globe. I wrote a review and I can wholeheartedly reccommend the book. The collections he made during the trip, the following studies, and numerous experiments that led him to formulate his famous theory. Not to mention all the correspondance he did with the many experts in various fields. Whenever the term ""evolution"" is mentioned, it is very easy to picture Charles Darwin being the lone genius figuring things out. After all.. in textbooks his picture his usually right there. But in reality this was far from the truth as there was lots of people influencing Darwins thoughts, work and ultimately the reason that the book got published at all. Darwin was probably still a genius though. Just not a lone genius. The book is organized as follows. First there are a few chapters where he discusses how animals and plants varies under domestication and in the wild under nature. He then continues in discussing the struggle for existence between individuals and between species. How that inevitably leads to the survival of the better adapted, or survival of the fittest as the more famous expression puts it. There are a few chapters on difficulties and objections to the theory, the geological record, geographical dispersal of species, hybridism between species, instincts and the book is neatly summed up in the last chapter. Most chapters has a little overview in the beginning of the following content, as well as a nice summery at the end of the chapter. So you'd think this is pretty easy read. But no it sure isn't. Some parts are beautifully written where as other parts are more on the difficult side. Long sentences and complicated grammar makes it to be a much more difficult book than it could have been. But then again it was written almost 160 years ago and languages do change. You might even say they evolve. (pun intended). Darwin was also in a rush because other naturalists were stumbling around with very similar thoughts. Alfred Russel Wallace being the most famous of them. His letter to Darwin actually prompted him to write the book to begin with. Originally Darwin intended to write a much larger and more extensive book with all kinds of evidence, experiments, and detailed notes. But he was forced to write quickly. Which he constantly laments and almost apolagizes for. So I guess that could also make the text more difficult to read. Either way I kind of got around this by listening to the audio book during my commute to work. And then reading the carbon copy before going to bed. The audio book was in english and I mainly read a version in norwegian, but I also flipped through the 150th year anniversary edition in english. Some times I was ahead with audio and other times I was reading ahead. either way it was like deja vu the entire book.Darwin spends alot of time in the book discussing how skilled breeders are able to change the domestic pidgeon. I'm sure that these examples worked alot better in the Victorian era when this was a very popular hobby. But now this is not very relevant any more. I wonder what species he might have chosen instead if he wrote the book today. So what is this evolution business anyway? Well.. Charles Darwin summed it up in the subtitle for his book. The full title of the book is ""The Origin of Species by means of natural selection of the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life."" See what I mean by long and complicated sentences?It basically means that all organisms tries to increase in number, but as the resources are limited, this results in competition. There are slight variations between individuals which gives them slightly different rates of success in this competition. The most successful will propegate and will leave more decendants than the less successful. I think you can boil down the evolutionary principle down to this. Or as he puts it himself: ""As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.""What really hit me while reading this was Darwins keen sense of observation, his ingenuity and his ability to reason. In the chapter about the geographical dispersal of species he discusses how different animals, plants and birds might spread from a continent to distant islands. It is quite obvious that winds might blow birds to distant islands, but he also discusses how these birds might bring seeds with them. Darwin actually tests how the feet of ducks might carry mud, and therefore also seeds, or how long lots of different seeds are able to survive immersion in salt water as well as in the gut of birds and find that alot of seeds germinate after weeks. He calculates the distance traveled by sea currents in the same amount of days and is therefore able to claim with confidence that almost any island can be populated from distant continents. During his travels the young Charles Darwin found fossilized sea shells high up in the Andes and he also experienced a major earthquake. "" A bad earthquake at once destroys our oldest associations: the earth, the very emblem of solidity, has moved beneath our feet like a thin crust over a fluid; - one second of time has created in the mind a strange idea of insecurity, which hours of reflection would not have produced. ""He wrote extensively about the formation of coral reefs and islands, as well as vulcanic islands. This led him to claim that the earths crust had oscillated up and down many times in geological periods. This would explain how the marine fossils were located high up in mountain ranges. It seems like Darwin were only a tiny bit away from realizing that the surface of our planet is divided into large tectonic plates. He even mentions that the he doesn't believe that the continents had once been attached to each other due to lack of evidence.Imagine Darwin getting his hands on dated rock samples from increasing distances from the mid-Atlantic ridge as well as detailed charts of the sea bottom. I think he would be absolutely deligthed!Would I reccomend this book?It depends I guess. If you've already read a few books about evolution you won't find anything new in Origin of Species. But you will find lots of interesting little stories, experiments and thoughts by Mr Darwin himself. And that I can definetely recommend! The last chapter of the book sums up the entire book. So if you're not inclined to read the entire thing you should at least read that. The article on Wikipedia is a great place to learn more about the book.If you really want to dive in and get your hands on Darwins letters, publications etc. you should check out Darwin Online""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."" If you want to learn about evolution in general you are probably better off reading a few books by Richard Dawkins. Especially The Selfish Gene or Greatest Show on Earth.For the Norwegian crowd I can definetely recommend Darwins teori or Evolusjon by Erik Tunstad. Both are great!  Why should you learn about evolution?The theory of Evolution connects us to every other living being and proves that we are all related. Just like earthworms, emus and elephants we have evolved into what we are today. Evolution punches a big hole in the belief that humans are separate from nature. There is very little about our nature that does not find its counterpart in other animals. Albeit sometimes in simpler form.According to the primatologist Frans De Waal whenever we try to specify something that humans are special, after a few years it is discovered in other parts of the animal kingdom. Whether it is the use of tools, use of language, walking on two legs, waging war, and even altruism has its animal counterpart. Evolution also punches a big hole in our tendency for essentialism. Meaning our inclination to think that species are fixed enteties in time and space. Biology is a messy field and variety in all kinds of expression is to be expected. It should not come as a surprise that sex, gender and our sexuality is complex. Homosexual behaviour is as natural as anything and has been documented in hundreds of species.Proper knowledge about evolutionary biology should demolish the human tendency for homophobic attitudes, for racism, gender inequality etc. By learning and understanding evolution you will understand how and why almost all fruit and vegetables we eat today didn't exist in the past, You will understand why we cannot cure the influenza once and for all, why antibiotics work and why resistance to them is a very real danger. we might actually loose that incredible tool in a short time.""Evolution is the single best idea anyone has ever had"" in the words of the contemporary philosopher Daniel Dennett.

125,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72697132-chloe,5,"Personal Response:I loved reading Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species. This book speaks to my language. I love science because it is my biggest passion in life. I have to know both sides of the argument to make an educated decision about what I believe. That is why I read this book. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Darwin’s notes and looking at the sketches of his discoveries. Although he had more mature wording, I was able to understand and comprehend what he was saying. I rely heavily on science and facts and evidence to back up the facts. I enjoyed reading the book. Plot Summary:Darwin embarked on a large journey for his studies. He was on a ship named HMS Beagle. The journey lasted five years. He didn’t write anything until five years after his trip. In the book, Darwin talked about how he discovered many new species and about his observations on other ones. He studied each species carefully. He drew sketches of each species. He started to see a pattern. He theorized that many of the animals and plants were evolutions of another. To quote him exactly “The great majority of naturalists have believed that species were immutable productions and have been created: this view has been ably maintained by many authors. A few naturalists, and several who have not particularly studied natural history, believe, on the other hand, that species undergo modification, and that the existing life forms have descended by true generation from pre-existing life forms (Darwin 1).” He went on to describe each discovery in great detail. He also described the differences between plants and animals with sketches of each. He said “I am fully convinced that species are not immutable; but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species, in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species. Furthermore, I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification (Darwin 13).” He also discussed climate properties by saying “Living free under the cold climate of Faroe in the north of the Falklands in the south, and on many islands in the torrid zone. Hence I am inclined to look at adaptation to any special climate as a quality readily grafted on an innate wide flexibility of constitution, which is common to most animals (Darwin 127-128).” He goes on to say “How much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate is due to mere habit, and how much the natural selection of varieties having different innate constitutions (Darwin 129).” He described each discovery in great detail. He later theorized that life evolved. Darwin said “There is a grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved (Darwin 433).”Characterization:Darwin grew as a person. Darwin was raised as a little Christian boy who obeyed all he was told. As he was growing up, he began to realize that there was more than what was in the book of the Bible. He started to grow and have an open mind in what lied beyond the Bible. He disobeyed his family and ventured on for his studies. The readers of this book grew as well. Their knowledge and understanding of science grew. This book altered many people's understanding of life. Impact of setting:After countless years of writing the book, it was finally published on November 24th, 1859. In the UK in 1859, most of the population was religious. The concept of “evolving from apes” wasn’t as openly accepted as it is now. As time went on, it was a more accepted concept. After this book was published and released, people became more open-minded. Recommendations:I recommend this book to any science driven person over the age of 16. Both genders would benefit from reading this book because it greatly explained what the world had such a problem with. This book gives both sides of the creationism versus evolution argument. Both genders would benefit from knowing each side so that they can make their own decisions. I don’t recommend this book to anyone under the age of 16. There are a lot of mature words that younger kids might not understand. "

I suppose I can understand why, though personally I see the relationships of science and religion not as mortal enemies but as close allies, each granting us one part of the truth, one helping us better understand our physical selves in the natural world and the other our spiritual selves in the immaterial world. Whether you take a particular stance or not, or whether you stand in the middle, or whether you just don’t know, both science and religion are arguably invaluable. I think most people can agree, at least to a minor degree, the significance of both.
""Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved...” 
Another interesting fact, is that after reading On the Origins of Species, it is blatantly clear that the theory of evolution by natural selection does not contradict theories of creationism or the principle of intelligent design and does not challenge the existence of a god, or The God, in my opinion, but rather works harmoniously along side many religious world views. I recommend researching the theistic theories of evolution for more on that. Natural selection does not clash against natural theology. The theory of natural selection only gives further insight and a unique and fascinating scientific glimpse into how species have changed and adapted, over time, to survive the harsh laws of nature.
""Darwin's theory of natural selection issued a profound challenge to orthodox thought and belief: no being or species has been specifically created; all are locked into a pitiless struggle for existence, with extinction looming for those not fitted for the task. Yet The Origin of Species (1859) is also a humane and inspirational vision of ecological interrelatedness, revealing the complex mutual interdependencies between animal and plant life, climate and physical environment, and - by implication - within the human world. Written for the general reader, in a style which combines the rigour of science with the subtlety of literature, The Origin of Species remains one of the founding documents of the modern age."" 
-Book BlurbAnyhow, I’m not here to argue a point per say, only state my personal opinions. Although the writing was pretty dry (in a truly scientific way) the text is very important and well worth the read. Some of the theories presented in this book are these:1. Every species is fertile enough that if all offspring survived to reproduce, the population would grow.2. Despite periodic fluctuations, populations remain roughly the same size.3. Resources such as food are limited and are relatively stable over time.4. A struggle for survival ensues.5. Individuals in a population vary significantly from one another.6. Much of this variation is heritable.7. Individuals less suited to the environment are less likely to survive and less likely to reproduce; individuals more suited to the environment are more likely to survive and more likely to reproduce and leave their heritable traits to future generations, which produces the process of natural selection.8. This slowly effected process results in populations changing to adapt to their environments, and ultimately, these variations accumulate over time to form new species.The theory of natural selection explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment. It makes sense of the geological record, biogeography, parallels in embryonic development, biological homologies, vestigiality, cladistics, phylogenetics, and other fields, with unrivalled explanatory power; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as medicine and agriculture. Overall, On the Origins of the Species, was a informative glimpse into the theories of Darwinism. [OFFICIAL RATING: 3.5 STARS]FURTHER QUOTATIONS: ""A grain in the balance will determine which individual shall live and which shall die - which variety or species shall increase in number, and which shall decrease, or finally become extinct.""""One general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.""""To conclude, therefore, let no man out of a weak conceit of sobriety, or an ill-applied moderation, think or maintain, that a man can search too far or be too well studied in the book of God's word, or in the book of God's works; divinity or philosophy; but rather let men endeavour an endless progress or proficience in both.""""Let it also be borne in mind how infinitely complex and close-fitting are the mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life; and consequently what infinitely varied diversities of structure might be of use to each being under changing conditions of life.""""How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man! How short his time! Consequently how poor will his products be, compared with those accumulated by nature during whole geological periods. Can we wonder, then, that nature’s productions should be far “truer” in character than man’s productions; that they should be infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher workmanship?""

127,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4369018-lee,5,"If you had an idea, perhaps one of the most important ideas of all time, but one that contradicted the established doctrine of a millennia old institution, how would you convince people your idea was right? And let's make no bones about the importance of Darwin's theory of evolution. As (the Russian Orthodox Christian) Theodosius Dobzhansky would famously put it over a century after Darwin's masterpiece was published: ""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.""Looking at the modern online ""debate"" (and by using that word I stretch its definition well beyond its elastic limit) between the pro- and anti-evolution camps, it's a rather depressing scene. The anti- camp tends to get hung up on the meaning of the word ""theory"". I'm currently striving to make a career out of studying number theory. Given that the theory of numbers requires an abstraction of thought far more chimerical than any theory in the physical sciences, perhaps these masters of debate would suggest that numbers don't exist either and thus the Thomas More Legal Centre will start giving out millions of dollars to the needy — after all what is a million? No, seriously, what is a million? (Or in a more earthy example courtesy of Tim Minchin, maybe those who dismiss evolution as being ""just a theory"" feel the same away about the theory of gravity, and maybe they'll just float the fuck away.)The pro-evolution camp fares little better to be honest; and by the pro- camp I'm not talking about the scientific community. Scientists know evolution is the basis of how life works, most of them are about as willing to have serious debates on it as I would be to debate the true value of pi. No, by the pro- camp I mean the youtube commenters and the such like whose responses to Creationists tend to invoke the promiscuity of the latter's mother.Based on modern sentiments, then, to convince Victorian England that his theory of evolution was correct Darwin presumably launched a scathing attack on the Church and highlighted the fact that we must descend from smelly, hairy apes because he'd seen yo' momma. Zing.So is that how he kicks off his treatise, with a rousing assault on the enemy? Not exactly. He talks about dogs. And chickens and goats. And Mr Blyth, who knows more about domesticated fowl than you or I ever will. Oh, and pigeons. There's a great deal about pigeons. The first chapter is in fact distinctly unrousing. ""We know all this, Charles!"" you feel like yelling, ""Shut up about the God-forsaken pigeons already."" Chapter two rolls around and the talk of pigeons ends. Praise be. What begins is Darwin's definition of ""species"". Given the work's title it seems fair enough that we should know what a species is, so Darwin defines one as being a collection of animals that can interbreed. He notes some empirical facts about the geographical distribution of genera and varieties and again the whole chapter is entirely unobjectionable.Chapter three follows up by pointing out that exactly how one wishes to divide up living beings into groups is immaterial and will always be slightly artificial. What we can agree on is that within each grouping of alike animals or plants there is individual variation, as discussed in Chapter 2, and we know from domesticated animals and plants that living things tend to pass on certain characteristics to their offspring; and if we didn't know that when we started the book we do after the extensive discussion in Chapter 1. Finally, again from domesticated stock, we know that offspring inherit much from their parents, but will sometimes have quirks of their own. Spend enough time gardening or with an isolated group of animals and you won't be able to refute this. Thus, Darwin points out in Chapter 3, what happens if one of these distinct quirks the offspring develops is actually advantageous? Slightly better camouflage, say, or the ability to survive with less water, or seeds that are slightly more palatable to birds, or flowers that are more attractive to bees? By the definition of the word advantage this offspring would have a slightly better chance of surviving and producing offspring of its own. Only slightly better, yes, and still open to the whimsy of the environment, but better nonetheless. And if humans can turn wolves into Basset Hounds in a few hundred years, presumably over a few hundred thousand years these small statistical gains can add up to result in a living thing that is so far removed from its descendant that breeding would be impossible between the two of them. Thus we have: the origin of species.Darwin, it should be pointed out, has nothing to say about your or anyone else's mother in The Origin of Species.It's hard not to smile during the first few chapters of the book. Darwin lays out truths so self-evident that no one could refute them without losing all credibility. It's slow paced, sure, but only because Darwin is making sure that there can only be one inevitable conclusion. Even if you think your faith is irreconcilable with the conclusions he draws I think you'd be hard pressed to fault his logic. Indeed, most doubters of evolution seem to be Young Earth Creationists, those who believe that the Universe was created on Saturday 22nd October, 4004 BC, a remarkably specific date determined by the Irish Primate James Usher (not to be confused with rhythm and blues singer Usher Raymond IV who, to the best of my knowledge, hasn't made any attempt to calculate the exact age of the Earth). It's no coincidence that the Venn diagram of Christians and non-believers in evolution tends to intersect on this particular group: Darwin's theory requires hundreds of thousands of years for undirected evolution to work. A cat with laser eyes might have a massive advantage over its brethren but that advantage comes to naught if it gets ran over before it can make laser-kittens. Over many years, though, the chances of every laser cat that randomly appears being ran over tend to zero. Fortunately for Darwin, Victorian geologists aged the Earth at many millions of years old, ample time for laser-kittens.As important as what is in the book is what isn't in the book. I smiled as I saw where Darwin was going with his argument. But oh how I cringed every time he tried to explain the mechanics of inheritance but couldn't because Mendel's theory of genetics wouldn't be widely publicised for another forty years. He also, wisely, doesn't apply his theory to humans, merely suggesting near the end of the final chapter that via evolution, ""Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."" By the 1870s and his publication of 
The Descent of Man
 England had almost unanimously accepted evolution and was thus more willing to accept that man too had evolved from ""lesser"" lifeforms. Indeed, one of the more controversial aspects of Darwin's later work wasn't that we might have evolved from the same creature as did chimpanzees and orang-utans, but that the civilized English gentleman sipping his tea in the club was of the same species as the dark skinned, spear-carrying savages one heard of in fantastical books. That even this revelation was accepted by the majority of readers hopefully conveys the power of Darwin's arguments. And one more thing that doesn't appear in The Origin of Species is the woeful line that ""we evolved from chimps"". Few statements show a more feeble understanding of evolutionary theory than the notion that most extant species have been the same for hundreds of thousands of years while new species branch off. After all:(Image by Matthew Bonnan as part of the Second annual Stick Science Cartoon Contest.)Whatever your personal beliefs, it's hard to claim that The Origin of Species is anything short of a masterful argument. If, as Young Earth Creationists claim, God made the Earth look four and a half billion years old, hid fossils in the ground, and constantly tweaks species to better suit their environment but makes it all look like it's occurring naturally, then Darwin simply brought us all one step closer to understanding God. If on the other hand God either isn't there or doesn't care, then Darwin brought us one step closer to understanding the Universe itself, and I can think of no goal more sacred than that."
128,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38538651-steven,5,"I LOVED this book for about a hundred different reasons and I am frustrated that I cannot write them all down. I'll give three reasons why I loved this book: First, having no real sense of who Charles Darwin was, I found it delightful to, right from the start, be immersed into the thinking of a very careful, cautious mind who is acutely aware of how hard it is to get anything right. The book gives on the feeling that when Charles Darwin recites the alphabet, he first cross-checkes every letter with twelve different dictionaries and then examines if the alphabet would be better with each particular letter or if another should be substituted instead. For example, Darwin devotes an entire chapter to possible objections to his theory on the origin of biodiversity. This was no flippant exercise. He so seriously and studiously considered any and all evidence that may indicate this theory is wrong that, 160 years and several scientific revolutions later, objectors to Evolution still pretty much follow the playbook listed in chapter 6 of his book. And, his reasons for why these difficulties can be surmounted still apply. That's amazing! I don't know anybody who thinks like that. Second, I did not know that the theory of Evolution emerged from such a simple premise. If ever there was a place where the phrase, ""a relentless march of logic"" could be applied to  On the Origin of Species . Here, evolution is described so simply and logically that I found it hard to see the biology through any other lens. It goes like this: 1. When animals reproduce, they tend to produce slight changes in features that can be passed down to the next generation. 2. Animals and plants are under such intense and very fierce competition that the majority of living things are either eaten by something else or starve to death. 3. Any variation that gives even a slight advantage in this competition makes a huge difference in survival and reproduction. Disadvantages lead to a speedy death. 4. If any of these advantages are heritable, than generations with the advantageous trait will further reproduce and eat the food and live in the space of their less capable cousins, killing them all off. 5. Repeat steps 1-4 over a million times. Darwin concluded that after millions and billions of cycles over varying climates and geologies, advantageous variations would accrue and produce biodiversity. It's amazing to me that such a simple premise has held up under several very big scientific revolutions such as the discovery of DNA, the theory of plate tectonics (which only came out in the mid 20th century), and the discovery of viruses. The third reason I loved this book is because I get the sense that Darwin spent at least one if not two decades examining every one of his preconceived notions and biases. That must have been hard and humbling. This book not only changed the world, but it represents a significant effort by the author to pursue a fair, well reasoned, and well supported view of the world despite how shocking those discoveries may be to ones one world view. "
129,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70163959-lalu-zam,5,"If you put yourselves in Darwin's position at that time, then his writing is certainly brave, ahead of his time, and indeed revolutionary. It certainly caused a hot debate at that time, and of course until now because it questions the nature of the origin of the species which always has been monopolised by the creation dogma especially from religious understandings. Nevertheless, Darwin gave his explanation simple and clear. The basis of his theory is modification of descent over a long time period. The nature selects individuals based on his ability to struggle with his own kinds, other individuals, and of course the environment. The accumulative traits inherited over long period of time and over enormous successive generations piles up causing a diversification organisms into (several) distinct species that might be quite different from their progenitor/common ancestors. In struggle of existence, each species will have to race against everything that caused extinction or termination of its existence. This explanation is highly reduced from the more sophisticated explanation presented by Darwin in his book of course. He also explained some arguments for his theory of natural selections such as the similarity of embryos, the modified base organs on several distinct species, the varieties of domesticated species, the existence of rendered (un-useful/left-over) organs, etc. Regarding of the difficulties of his theory, such as the problem of migration of the same species around the world, the insufficient fossils of intermediate forms from geological reports, the problem of instinct, and the wonder of complexity that likely must be given completely in order to work perfectly, etc, he indeed gives a very plausible explanation without going astray from his basic principles of natural selection.Not only that, he even managed to give some remarks -he probably realised or not - that has been proven in our current time, such as the continental drift (the continents are constantly moving slowly over time) arguments helping the migration of some wide spread species, the hypothesis of LUCA (Last Universal Common Ancestor) as the first progenitor of all living things, and the hypothesis about the agent of information that are transported from parents to its descendants which is liable to change or modification over time which we know now as genes.Lastly, his arguments in all part of his books about his theory being the only plausible, logical explanation of origin of species over the creation dogma probably the only reason why his theory is still controversial and hard to be accepted by some religious people from all major religions. Nevertheless, his theory has expanded our understanding about life on Earth to the point that now we can codified each organism's DNA and probably edited them for our own benefit in the future. This shows that his achievement should be put at least in the same level as Newton's revolution in physics."
130,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75313617-ravi,4,"A long and thoroughly researched argument explicating the beautiful theory of evolution. One of the funniest things about this book is how insanely long and detailed it is, while at the same time Darwin repeats many times throughout that he wishes he could go on and give more examples but he doesn't have room here. I learned a lot reading this (slowly) over the course of 10 months. One of the more mundane things I learned which I never put together was the fact that the words ""generic"" and ""specific"" are directly related to the words ""genera"" and ""species."" Darwin lays out his argument in many chapters and often uses more familiar concepts as analogies or evidence for his theory, which I thought was a good approach. For example, he starts by talking about domesticated animals: Here we have (unknowingly) taken advantage of evolution to gradually create modified forms of animals over successive generations by selective breeding. The same thing occurs in nature but the external stimulus is varying environmental conditions or competition between species rather than human intervention. He also uses the analogy of language which I thought was interesting and apt. Languages can be grouped into families and categorized into genealogical trees just like living things. Both evolve from common progenitors and can break off into new languages (species) or dialects (sub-species or varieties). Also, he equates ""rudimentary parts"" or vestigial organs to letters in words that we no longer pronounce yet which give a clue to the word's origin. What impressed me was the amount of thought and decades of research that Darwin put into this. He is absolutely devoted to this as exemplified by this experiment he conducts to understand the geographical distribution of plants and their possible methods of dispersal and subsequent germination:""I forced many kinds of seeds into the stomachs of dead fish, and then gave their bodies to fishing-eagles, storks, and pelicans; these birds, after an interval of many hours, either rejected the seeds in pellets or passed them in their excrement; and several of these seeds retained the power of germination.""Now that's dedication!He ends with this marvelous sentiment:""There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved."""
131,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91201685-astrid,4,"I found this book in a neat book shop in London. Without any hesitation I decided to buy and read it. But what caused my immediate decision? I suppose it was Curiosity as always. Just like Darwin I was curious about the origin. In my case the origin of the current scientific theory on evolution.And my hope was fulfilled as I had a worthy experience reading Darwin's original lines in this full extent since it was actually real personal and far less distant than getting to know his ideas through translations, summaries and added up conclusions in school lessons. It wasn't easy getting into this language and style of writing especially due to the fact that I am not a native speaker but time and patience enabled me to get used to it. Ultimately I actually found Darwin's way of drawing conclusions pretty beautiful as I could discover a lot of fascination in his words.Some parts though were long-winded and tiring. Particularly chapters about geology as I already disliked this topic in school.On the other hand descriptions e.g of the 'inimitable architectural powers' of the hive bee or the hierarchical arrangement of ants and other insects and their causes were so vibrant and lively that I did not lose the pleasure and fascination I hoped for.All in all I am really happy having read this historical greatly important milestone (even though one should not forget that Darwin was neither the only nor the first one drawing conclusions leading to the theory of natural selection)!"
132,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38789239-liisa,0,"I decided not to rate this, because I didn´t know how. The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin is without a doubt one the most important books ever written, for which it deserves all the possible stars, but the reading experience itself wasn´t too enjoyable. In the time it was written people still believed that God created the world and all the species inhabiting it. To crush this idea, Darwin needed to convince and prove and repeat and repeat trying to explain things like natural selection, to prove how the history of our planet is unfathomably long and how extremely imperfect the geological material we have is. For someone to whom these ideas, all the ideas in the book, are unquestionable facts, this feels quite tedious. I am nonetheless glad to have finally read this classic. I think I understand Darwin better, understand the origins of the theory of evolution better, which is important as both of the subjects come up on pretty much every course I take in university. And The Origin of Species does have parts I enjoyed considerably more than others. For example, the final chapter which sums everything up is really well written and interesting. I might even suggest only reading that, if you want to get a glimpse into Darwin´s mind without having to read the whole thing. There Darwin also ponders how his theory might change science and how people will accept it. "
133,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2466848-joab-jackson,5,"Sometimes a piece of writing so closely describes the truth, that it itself becomes the truth. Charles Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species,"" first published in 1859, made its argument so thoroughly, so absolutely, it literally willed evolution into being in the human consciousness. Once in plain site, evolution made its own case, of course. But today the writing that first fully described evolution is anything but an emptied vessel. The book crystalizes not one but two major drivers of evolution: natural selection and community of descent. Natural selection is the shaping of traits from an expanding population competing for fixed resources. The second idea, groomed by the natural selection, is that all living beings can be traced back to a single entity. Darwin piles on example after example, drawing from Chinese encyclopaedias, farmers and cattlemen, hobbyist animal breeders, gardeners, the Bible, even deriving them first-hand by breeding pigeons and studying the survival of weeds in a small field. At he was a species geek, and can wallow happily on some arcane variation of an ant, bee or flower. Driving the rolling roads of Virginia, I've often daydreamed of a hard-bitten tobacco farmer two centuries back sitting down at a heavy oak kitchen table during some winter nights to read this English Nat'rlist's recently published account of how his own livestock changed over time. Darwin writes to make his case for this farmer. And for everyone. “Origin” is technical writing at its finest, writing about a concept so subtle and so complicated that it literally took the human race about 200,000 years to understand, and yet the writing is so clear that assumes no technical knowledge on the part from the reader, apart from basic fluency in the English language and some patience. "
134,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39751049-saravana,5,"This is a perspective-augmenting book. Almost anyone who reads will accept the fact that we are all descendants of some very ancient single-celled organism. But, understanding how we arrived at this conclusion in a systematic way is all this book is about. This excellent piece of research takes you in a step-by-step manner into the world of evolution and its nuances. After reading this book, you'll never look a pigeon or a horse or a dog the same way you did before. You'll start seeing the struggle for existence everywhere around you. You'll start paying attention to details of every organ of a living being. This book also taught me a valuable research lesson-Never restrict yourself to a particular field. Most of us know Darwin only as a naturalist but he is an excellent geologist and he aptly uses this skill to augment his theory of evolution. This book also taught me how much research one should do, how much knowledge one should possess, how much literature one should read if one wishes to change an existing worldview. Through his writings, one can understand how humble researcher Darwin is. This book(the version I read) did not include 'tree of life' diagram drawn by Darwin. This diagram is essential to understanding some passages in the book. I had to google the diagram. Here is a fun activity for people who are about to start this book: Count the number of times Darwin complains about the lack of space to write in detail."
135,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24430849-yuganka-sharan,5,"Charles Darwin, oh what have you done!If one were to list the most important people in the history of mankind, few people would be as assured of their place as Charles Darwin. It would be safe to admit that Darwin shall feature in the list of the top five greatest scientists of all time, along with the likes of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. His magnum opus, The Origin of Species, is an astonishingly vast endeavour. Let us try to imagine man’s view of the natural system before Darwin revealed his hand. Man had observed thousands of species in all parts of the world, all well-suited for their natural environment. Each animal was well-fitted in the economy of nature and occupied a certain place, and the mutual interactions of all the flora and fauna in any given region formed an organisational web that felt more or less complete in-itself. For naturalists at that time, it was impossible to think that such a (visibly) perfect system could have come into existence in any way other than divine intervention, and so creationism, quite conveniently, was provided as an answer for the incomprehensible complexity of the entire web of life, throughout the world. Some problems, though, stared them in the face. How was it possible, for example, that many European species managed to spread rapidly and even replace the endemic species of Australia? If each species had been created perfectly for the place it occupied, surely no other species could be better suited to live in that area. Additionally, if all species were specially created for any specific place, which would imply taking into account factors like climate and geography, then distinct regions of the world which had nearly identical physical and climatic conditions, for example certain regions in the Old World and New World, should have nearly identical flora and fauna. But this is far from the case, if you were to observe the fauna of, say, Australia and South America. In fact, the species residing in the plains of these continents are as different as they could possibly be. Just imagine an ant-eater and a kangaroo standing side by side. The theory of natural selection expounded by Darwin now seems so self-evident, that it is difficult for us to fathom what reserves of imagination must have been needed to come up with it in the first place. This beautiful theory says that there is a constant struggle for resources among different species residing in any given region, and the species that are more adaptive, more receptive to change will outlive others. And as they spread far and wide they will replace the species less well adapted – extinction is an inevitable consequence of natural selection as there is only a limited number of living beings that any ecosystem can sustain. Additionally, the species which thus kill off other species will have more members, meaning more variation and they will end up giving rise to more genera from their existing arsenal than others. In short, the more successful species will spread more widely, and determine the future rise of new genera and classes. This idea germinated in the mind of Darwin when he noticed how, within a few centuries, breeders had managed to create so many different varieties of pigeons. The Pouter, the Fantail, the Tumbler, the Jacobin – all these varieties share a common progenitor – the rock pigeon. Darwin observed that these varieties arose when breeders mated pairs of pigeons which displayed certain characteristics very strongly – the tail feathers in the Fantail, for example. This was a clear example of artificial selection by humans, who were concentrating only on the external appearances of the creatures concerned.Darwin deduced that a similar process was happening in the natural world, where members of the same species, and species of the same genera, were locked in a battle with each other for survival, resources and their place in the ecosystem. In this herculean endeavour, Darwin gives details of many experiments he conducted in order to find answers to certain questions – like, plants of how many genera may grow from a given amount of soil; extrapolating the distance to which seeds of various plants could travel across the sea aided by vegetative matter, and still retain their vitality, based on conducting an experiment that was basically a stripped down version of this process; comparing half a day old chicks of various pigeon breeds to see if some of the differences present in their adult configurations have been inherited at birth, and many others.Going through the book I wondered why the word genius isn’t traditionally associated with Darwin. Einstein introduced a paradigm shift in physics and his ideas were revolutionary to say the least, but so were Darwin’s. I think it is because even a person with average intelligence would be able to understand the ideas expounded in The Origin of Species, were he to read it, while this can surely not be said about the theory of relativity. In that sense, Darwin seems like that erudite professor who lives next door, and who shares his knowledge in engaging lectures when the two of you sit down to talk in the evening, whereas Einstein is someone whose ideas we can only appreciate from a distance, but never quite understand.The real and timeless beauty of Darwin’s idea is that his theory isn’t just restricted to biological systems, but they represent certain foundational concepts that will come into play whenever there are competing elements vying for the same thing – so there will be social evolution due to social selection (the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer), economic evolution due to economic selection (different kinds of economic systems work in different regions of the world based on the kind of society, culture and philosophies that drive those people), political evolution due to political selection (no wonder Marx realised the significance of the idea in how political systems in a given place will change over time), and so on. The list can go on and on and on. There are some books every person should read. This has to be one of those. "
136,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13959075-josh-anderson,0,"Reviewed 1-14-2011As a Creationist I decided it would benefit me to educate myself on the Theory of Evolution & so I went to the source. Although I realize nearly all modern Evolutionists agree Darwinian Evolution is problematic to its core & subscribe to “Neo-Darwinism” & newer updated forms of Evolutionary Theory, I believe the general public is led to believe Darwin is not only relevant but that he is to be regarded the one of the greatest scientists ever known. It’s sad that most people don’t realize the problems with Darwin’s Theory of Natural Selection, many he admitted & even wrote a chapter on in the book. I was impressed by Darwin’s thorough observations of all different studies of nature and how he was able to address various difficulties & theorize how everything came about by infinitesimally small variations that eventually replaced their progenitors. But a “grave” difficulty he faced then still stands today: where is the actual evidence? As great as his theory was, I just do not see the actual empirical evidence that it really happened."
137,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27084215-younes-benimam,5,"I have read quite enough about the theory before, but I wanted to see how the father of the theory put it , how he wrote about it, how he described it, and it was terrific. This work is grandiose.an incredible genius scientist, who revolutionized the science of biology and the way humans look at the world. With a large body of facts, the majority of which collected by himself during the journey of Beagle, it is impossible to reject the theories and the conclusions he provides. It feels disappointing when you see a lot of people talking about monkeys and mankind in reference to the theory, but what actually Darwin is talking about in his theory, that all species (literary ALL) have gone through the process of modification through the means of natural selection, all struggling to stay in existence and only the best suited can survive. ""When we reflect on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the belief, that the war of the nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply."" Chapter III : Struggle for Existence.It is so annoying too when you come across those who mock at the theory with no basic knowledge about this huge work. I wonder what Darwin would have done if he had been given the means we have today. He didn't know about DNA, genetics, the Evo-Devo, phylogenetic, but he could brilliantly found a solid theory: The theory of Evolution by the means of Natural Selection and the power of it is so immense. It is ubiquitous; you can apply it in any field of science, you can see it around you whenever you go, and you can relate it to anything you want.It has been 158 years since he wrote this work, and it will still continue be brilliant, influential, and debatable for many other years."
138,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71295985-tomas,4,"Easily ranking amongst the most influential and important texts in all of human history, this work also ranks as one of the most readable works in scientific literature. This is understandable considering the author rushed its writing in a feverish attempt to publish a widely available summary of his ground breaking theories (that took Darwin more than 20 years to develop) before a fellow scientist Alfred Wallace could publish his own similar ideas. While obviously far more modern and digestible than most other scientific works, make no mistake that Origins is a long, thorough and well balanced examination of Darwin's theories of Descent with Modification and Natural Selection. For someone with even minor experience in modern biological science, it is truly remarkable to observe how many ideas and arguments that are presented in this work form the foundations of our current view of the natural world. While the majority of this work can hardly be called ""entertaining reading"" and is often difficult to get through, Darwin is a subtle but capable writer. My personal highlight would be the short section in which Darwin explains the many instances of apparent slavery one ant species has been observed to inflict upon another, where Darwin lets his impersonal manner slip and his childish wonder and fascination with the world's many creatures shines through."
139,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83199000-sujaya,5,"This is a not a book to be rated and everyone might agree with me.I am reviewing this book as a layman with no background in these topics.This book is an epitome of facts and theories about every life on earth. I couldn't grasp many concepts discussed in this book yet there were many interesting facts to learn. The chapters on natural selection were abundant with facts and examples, it was comprehensive as the description, diagrams, explanations were all very simple. The chapter - Instincts was yet another very intriguing chapter where the inheritance of habits and instincts in several beings were explained. There are chapters which discuss complicated theories with Jargons that I found hard to get through but it is inevitable when reading such books. Its a fact that not everyone can enjoy this but I would say give it a try, there is nothing wrong in learning something new and out of the box."

This book has so much fundamental information about life on earth that they should be teaching this book in schools. The amount of research, the cross-referencing of other scholarly work, the experiments and deductions, the admission that his theory does not explain everything in the world - all of these things make it a seminal work in the evolutionary biology. The highly academic nature and some old English words makes it a hard to read book, at least to a non-English speaker. Darwin's theory was not so popular among his contemporaries and perhaps that has played a part in him going at great lengths to explain his ideas. I thought I knew what Natural Selection meant but I quickly realized that I was completely wrong. The number of examples Darwin gives on the struggle of life simply boggled my mind. It made me believe that he was a naturalist, geologist, biologist, botanist, anthropologist and much more. Contrary to the popular belief, Darwin neither supports nor opposes the Genesis creation narrative in this book.Most of us have studied his theory in schools but I doubt how many of us understand it. Look, I admit that this book can get tiresome and boring at times but it would definitely give a very different perspective on our own origin. This is one of those books that everyone must read at least once in their lifetime."

Luckily, this was neither. Though a bit dry in places, it still stands out as an amazing achievement, especially given what he did not and could not have known. Was nice to really feel the intervening years between discovery and final publication. His work on breeding (birds, dogs, horses), horticulture and barnacles as well as his wide readings in various subjects (notably geography) really made the work richer and more foolproof than if he had cobbled it together right after the voyage of the H.M.S. Beagle. He still got some details wrong, but what he did get right is simply astounding, even today."
142,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70242311-iliiaz-akhmedov,5,"This book is a must read. There are arguments against Darwin's theory and his meditations about the origin of species, but one must read this for another following reason and not necessarily agree with him. Charles' questions and observations are utterly resonating to one's guts, as in he urges for nature's call in you and connects the dots for your evolution in harmony with every other species. He touches on fundamental questions and connections that blew my mind and are visible even today on a vast scale of everything. What are your instincts and who taught you those? Why some hereditary peculiarities are sex dependent? Why embryos are so similar or different from adults across species? What do we define as a species versus a variety?"
143,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee,4,"Fairly profound work for its time, Darwin anticipated that his contemporaries most likely would not accept his conjecture. He published in order to rest his case with future generations who would be more likely to see his ideas as being a framework for biology.It stands to be that this work, while a work of science, is also a work of speculative science. Darwin obviously did not have access to the theoretical apparatuses of game theory, or scientific instruments and data such as genetics. Yet most of us today when looking at his work would say that it was ""good for its time"" when compared to the information we have today, missing the point of this book. The radical nature of this work is that Darwin laid out the lines of thought by which others could understand biology. Origin of species, while profoundly radical in its generation had a very modest domain: Darwin was interested mainly in introducing a generative apparatus for understanding taxonomy. He was not out to discover the origin of nature, or life, or anything wild such as man's purpose. He stuck to a very immanent goal within biology, that of mere classification. Darwin thus provided the radical approach of looking at a living creatures environment and its relation to its surroundings through genealogy and environmental context (such as geological time). This double part idea has often been dismissed by ""pure"" biologists who seek to render biology as a purely immanent field, reserving validity only for biologists (and not appeal to other disciplines such as paleontology or geology) as having any agency for explaining or exploring life, consciousness and the social totality of human purpose. Those seeking political fame through this immanent justificationism have this kind of intention as an academic endeavor; they buffer it with ""physics envy"" as mathematicalization can only easily render statistics for measurable variation, such as the frequency of genes. Attempting to quantize external parameters such as geological shift is far more open to speculation because there is no easy metric for this kind of physics envy approach.In a way, the causal truth of Darwin's ideas can only be expressed through the rational approbation of instrumentalization deemed to be rational. If we accept only tools that allow for the quantization of causation through immanent causes (such as a % of genes) then only those causes will be considered a-historically of external factors. Being a mathematics, we can always calibrate the relationship to be dependent on a reselection of criteria. For example, when Speed = Rate X Distance we can also see Distance as a Speed / Rate and so on. Purely formal relations can suggest agency through a variety of altercating circumstances which does not force agency to be determined in one particular way or another. Is change a function of time? Or is it a function of force? Or a function of space? In the same way, immanent instrumentalization of purely biological objects (such as genes, or the presence of a particular phenotypical adaptation) can be seen as having agency for natural selection or it can be understood through a variety of external criteria. To center the study as a matter of biological objects (genes) is one view, but we could also see it as a plausible calculation through the flow of entropy, or a shift of the ecology through mass change which takes us beyond the realm of biology inasmuch as it may take us beyond our current instrumental models.In many ways this book was kind of dull to read because it cycled through many familiar examples and ideas. It was however, refreshing because it allows us to calibrate positions within the various current debates in biology as they may attempt to ""steal"" the authenticity of Darwin's idea by emphasizing certain areas and ignoring others. Personally, I find appeals to the authenticity of Darwinism as a justification for the veracity of a particular theory to be ludicrous yet many very intelligent scientists will attempt to force the plausibility of their pet ideas through this authoritarian sublimation of Darwinism. So in that sense, reading Darwin allow us to see that Darwin was very careful in writing this book -- he took many years to do it -- in order to strike the correct balance in presentation so as to not upset his contemporary audience of naturalists. His very modest idea, that natural selection and evolution be utilized as a taxonomy has a very obvious utility that is present today.Yet we have 100 years removed from Darwin, an attempt to utilize this taxonomy as more than a model of understanding adaptation -- but also as an argument for progress, prestige and human organization. The implicit key for me here, is that knowledge is always a trace of material agency, that causal links enact a certain criteria for material interaction -- which, as stated above, as a formalism -- runs both ways.People will read Darwinism and see in it the ideology of various contemporary big-headed scientists who have pretentious to absolutist elitism, claiming that their methodology is in the same ""spirit"" as Darwinism. And that's sad. It's bad readership to see something in the past today and then dismiss the past as being ""you might as well read so-and-so"". In that sense, you've simply read your own conclusions in a text, and while satisfying your own sense of justification, wasted your time reading a book that you've already read before instead of reading the book that is right in front of you."

Most fascinating to me was how Darwin cited to so many other scientists whose work he drew on to make his arguments. While people like to portray Darwin as a singular genius, it seems like others were circling the same ideas and he was just able to put them altogether (thanks to his own impressive insights). Ultimately, this is not subject matter that I would seek out but for its historic significance. "

Incredible logical jumps to explain phenomena3. Willingness to admit that while he may be able to explain why some things happen, he might not be able to explain how they happen4. Level of detail5. readiness to incorporate randomness as a means of explaining evolutionSometimes incredibly dry and verbose.

146,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64009352-leif-biberg-kristensen,5,"One of the greatest books ever. Originally published in 1859, it's surprisingly readable, although it may feel a little long-winded in parts. That has of course a lot to do with the fact that today, most of us take Darwin's ideas for granted, while he had to be very thorough to make them as clear as possible. Many years ago I read Richard Dawkins' ""The Blind Watchmaker"", and I'm somewhat amused because Dawkins frequently used Darwin's own examples and basically did a rewrite of ""The Origin"". That is not a criticism of Dawkins; it's just that besides Darwin even the most brilliant are a bit outshone. If you get what I mean."
147,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41590197-yani,4,"Well this sure took some time to read, but it was fascinating regardless. Despite not having maybe all the necessary information to prove evolution, he nevertheless put forth a very consistent and robust theory and acknowledged his gaps of knowledge when they were there. Besides he did some creative research to add evidence to his claims, like the drowning of seeds in sea water to see if they could survive a marine trip to an island. The writing style is a bit dated and long-winded, but it isn't hard to read either. Anyway, I'm glad I finally read this milestone book im biology!"
148,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84225967-maggie-schedl,5,"I'm pretty sure I bought this book over two years ago, and for once in my life I am glad that I am really slow at things. It may seem counterintuitive, but this is not a good introduction to the theory of evolution. I am really glad that I have read and consumed much (a relative term) information on the subject before endeavoring to read this. Any modern reader today, without much previous knowlege of evolution, would find the subject, and the book, very boring I'm sure. Of course, that does not mean I didn't like it. You see I have given it 5 stars, in the same way I would give a classic work such as an Emerson or Melville a 5, but I wouldn't think put them on my favorites bookshelf. What I found most valuable was realizing the extreme effort that Darwin put into this abstract. The theory of evolution, or how he puts it as decent with modification caused by natural selection, was not a simple thing to suggest at the time. The painstaking effort he took to look at his ideas from every opposing angle he saw, and refute each and every one is admirable. It can also be boring, I will fully admit that I skipped a few pages when he was explaining his experiments on hive bees and their instinct of making ""perfect"" hexagonal wax honeycombs. And probably most people are not familiar with pigeon fanciers and their numerous breeds he brings up time after time. But however obscure fancy pigeons are today, in Darwin's time they were at least known, and were the perfect conduit for his theory. The genius of Darwin at conveying his concept is evident. It is one thing to realize that evolution has created the vast diversity of all life on earth, it is quite another to explain it in a way that is convincing. Yes, it wasn't immediately well received. But it is incredibly smart how he frames his abstract, with first discussing pigeon breeding and various other domesticated animals, where secretly the foundations of modification based on decent and natural section are all lurking. You almost cannot refuse his theory if you accept, and know, that all fancy pigeon breeds originated from the wild rock pigeon! And yet that is only the first argument, and he continues through topics such as instinct, geographic distribution, embryology etc and explains how everything we know about each topic fits with, and difficulties in each can even be explained by, natural selection. And I am sure any reader will chuckle darkly and nod at the chapter titled ""The Struggle For Existence,"" because we all know that one well. I found that where the book shined was in his summaries of each chapter, and his conclusion, where mere facts were put aside, and the personality of Darwin was more evident. How joyous it is to read a statement like this "".. when we thus view each organic being, how far more interesting, I speak from experience, will the study of natural history be!"" You can almost feel the personal revolution that must have happened inside him to come to viewing every organism as an incredibly complex piece of history, both independent, and deeply connected with every other organism! This is exactly what I love about the natural world and why I am personally fascinated with evolution. There is an inconceivable amount of history and unknown in each living being, and that is precisely what is exciting. Darwin says ""The mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of a hundred million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many slight variations accumulated during an almost infinite number of generations."" How strange is it that I want to, and many others do, study something beyond full comprehension. How strange is it to think about our own existence as a process we may not be able to ever wrap our brains around, yet we study it anyways. Of course we study it, how could we not! It surely effects every other aspect of biology in ways we do not understand, but that we will strive to for many years to come. I cannot review this book without mentioning that I made this face 😬 a few times. When Darwin touches on human evolution a smattering of times, it gets dicey, and maybe you know that Darwin's book ""The Decent of Man,"" is even more dicey. I have not read it. It is unfortunately easy to see where genetic determinism proponents could read some passages in this abstract uncarefully, and be fulled by their ideas. Darwin did not know what we know now about human variation, genetics, and the extremely broad concept of intelligence that are still being shown and fought over today, and yes it is improbably that anyone of Darwin's social position would be not racist at the time; so one must read this book and use their critical lens from time to time. I invite anyone who after reading this book to thus read ""It Is Unethical To Teach Evolution Without Confronting Racism And Sexism"" from evolution-institute.org as I am rereading right now. It is a complex thing to read the book that effectively changed the way people think about both their existence, and the existence of everything living they know on this planet. It is naive to think that it wouldn't be a hard read, both scientifically and socially. And it is naive to think that humans have reacted to it in always a quote unquote good manner. If you get anything out of this book may it be the deep way that absolutely everything we know is connected, both currently and in a vast history, in a way that must, and does, effect everything. "

172,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,4,"This is the book that started it all, and after reading Evolution by Carl Zimmer, I finally felt ready to tackle it. I had read much by Zimmer and others such as Dawkins, Prothero, and Gould. I don't much care for the stilted writing style of some nineteenth century authors. I find it confusing or boring, and this was no exception. Much of it was dry and clinical. He writes that he omitted long catalogs of facts, and for that I am grateful.Someone said you could give this book to a creationist. Maybe, but I would tell them to skip several chapters. There are many long discussions of problems that have been outmoded by the modern synthesis or that are uninteresting to anyone but a biologist, botanist, or breeder. Scattered throughout are interesting and clear discussions of natural selection and the struggle for existence, but there is much that is less than sparkling.It's good to get to the root of this theory that has held up so well. It is interesting to see what he got wrong with the incomplete knowledge of the time, but it is also important to not be arrogant or to think something we ""know"" now should have been obvious to Darwin. Rather we should wonder what we are getting wrong today that people will snicker at in fifty or a hundred years. For instance, Darwin was pretty certain that the domestic dog breeds came from several different wild species. That hypothesis continued to be accepted until very recently, when studies in molecular biology finally demonstrated they all are descended from one animal, which until this year was thought to be the modern gray wolf. The question, however, is still being investigated as more advanced technologies reveal new findings. Just this year a paper was published in PLOS suggesting the domestic dog did not descend from the gray wolf, but that it and the modern gray wolf share a common ancestor that is extinct, which is actually more in accord with Darwin's theory. (Don't you just love science?)Darwin was a product of his time. The casual racism that he expresses as he wonders why the barbaric savages didn't domesticate the plentiful plants and animals available to them is exactly what Jared Diamond argues against in Guns, Germs, and Steel.This book should be read by everyone, especially atheists and skeptics, to dispel the many myths that have grown up around it. One such myth is that it attempts to explain the origins of life -- it doesn't. Another is that Darwin ever said ""survival of the fittest."" That term was coined by Herbert Spencer, Darwin's contemporary, who perverted the concept of natural selection into social Darwinism and whose principles were embodied in the ideas of Ernst Haeckel. Haeckel's, which were employed by the Germans under Hitler. The term Darwin used was ""The Struggle for Existence."" But just mention Darwin, and ""survival of the fittest"" is what pops into everyone's mind. It is true -- a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.Would giving this book to a creationist do any good? I don't think so. All of their questions were anticipated, asked, and competently answered by Darwin in this book. The fact that they appropriated his questions and continue to ask them today, while still ignoring his answers, indicates they have never read this book. (Hell, most of them don't even read their own Book!)Darwin was humble, careful, and cautious. In today's casual speech, he would say ""I could be wrong, but...,"" or ""some of this is guesswork but..."" or ""here's what would blow my theory out of the water, if anyone could find it, but I have not been able to."" All of his conclusions were tentative. He invited criticism and correction, because that's what scientists do. I'd like to see self-styled ""creation scientists,"" such as Dembsky and Behe, show the same rigor and humility.Creationism was big in Darwin's day. He repeatedly stated how his discoveries argued against ""independent creation."" The bible was probably the main ""scientific"" reference book of the time. It informed all scientific inquiry -- cosmology, geology, biology -- with little or no challenge. It's not surprising that Darwin's theory was resisted at the time. But why it still is challenged so strongly 150 years later in my hyperreligious, ignorant pocket of the world (the U.S.) is a mystery to me. It must make us all look like yokels to the rest of you."
173,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63319555-rachel-welton,0,"Finally got around to reading this. I was surprised, although I don't know why I should have been, to discover the depth and range of the discussion Darwin presents. I can't believe I didn't read it 30 years ago."
174,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,4,"This book had been in my reading queue so long it might have grown roots there. Every time it worked its way to the top, I would find a reason to read something else. But now, in this age of anti-intellectualism, anti-science fervor when some governments (such as that of the state of Texas) would ban and burn this book if they could get away with it, it seemed to me that the best response was to actually read it. So I did. It was not an easy read. The book was written for non-specialist readers but not really for the general public, and Darwin went into great detail, using the scientific vocabulary of his day, to explain his thinking, his methods, and how he came to formulate his theory of how species came into being and how they continue to evolve. Throughout the book, he continually gives credit to those scientists who have come before him, as well as his contemporaries, who have contributed to his process and to his findings.He also lays out in detail various arguments that might be made against his theory and then does his best to answer them. They are much the same arguments that one might hear from a creationist today.Darwin begins his explanation and defense of his theory by discussing animal husbandry. He writes of humans' effect upon their domesticated animals, breeding them to enhance the characteristics which they find attractive and want to encourage. He spends a great deal of time discussing pigeons and how humans have shaped them into many different breeds that differ in great detail from the original rock pigeon. He will return to the example of the pigeon throughout the book.He then goes on to show that Nature works in essentially the same way as the human breeders of animals. The difference is that humans try to attain the ideal they are seeking in as few generations of the animal as possible, while Nature works on the scale of geological time. Thus, creating a species through natural selection may take thousands and thousands of years with minor, almost imperceptible changes taking place with each generation.But those minor changes are of the greatest importance. Each tiny adjustment is tested in the crucible of survival of the fittest. If it is a change that will help an entity to survive, the change will be retained and probably enhanced in the next generation. If it is a change that does not contribute to survival or strengthening of its host, then it will be discarded - along with the host. This process is completed time after time across the eons with the goal always being that of survival and creating a better host.It is now 157 years since Darwin, with some trepidation, sent his book into the world. We know that the book created a sensation in the scientific community and the general public at the time, and it generated considerable and sometimes fiery scientific, philosophical, and religious debate. After more than 150 years of such discussions, it still creates controversy in some quarters, but it is accepted as the foundation of evolutionary biology and there is no well-reasoned argument against it. Those who refuse to accept it generally do so on the basis of their religious faith which admonishes them to accept the holy book of that faith as history/science/philosophy, and that, of course, is their right.The rest of us accept Darwin's theory as the unifying concept of the life sciences and view him as a hero in the history of science and the promulgation and popularization of the scientific method of thinking. Though we may still only see through a glass darkly, the light that shines through is in large part due to his work and writing. (Obviously, the book is worthy of five stars. It gets only four from me only because it was such a bloody ordeal to read!)"

177,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/949994-laurie-olsen,3,"I wanted to read what Darwin actually wrote, not just what other people say that he wrote, so I got this in an audio-book and listened to it during several hours on the treadmill.It's definitely not a page-turning novel but it is still very interesting. It's a bit dry, which I guess meets expectations for a scientific treatise. His thoughts on 'natural selection changing species over time' are famous of course. I also found his discussion on migration of different species around the world very interesting.As to the handful of issues that make Darwin so controversial I would have to say the following:Obviously one of the biggest 'controversies' is his theory on the origin of the body of man. I was surprised at how very little he actually discussed this in his book. While he did intimate towards the very end that future research will throw much light ""on the origin of man and his history"" he made absolutely no claim that man descended from monkeys. A second controversial topic might be the age of the earth. Obviously it takes a tremendous amount of time for his theory to have been fully played out from the beginning of creation. Again geologists even pre-Darwin had discovered that the age of the Earth is in actuality significantly longer than 6,000 to 13,000 years.The final controversial issue might be that people think Darwin proposed atheism. Some seem to think that somehow by suggesting that the origin of species happened through a natural cycle of evolution vs. God creating every single species individually from the beginning, makes God less powerful or 'in charge' of creation. Darwin refuted this several times in his book, including his final sentence where he credits 'the Creator' with breathing life into the first form or forms on Earth. He also began his book with three quotes from other authors, including one discussing the need to deeply study both the word of God as well as the works of God together.The final thing that struck me from the book is the great benefit that Darwin's theories have brought to mankind. Before Darwin started delving into the genetic links between all living creatures, including the human body's place in the animal kingdom, medical doctors were still 'blood letting' patients in a vain attempt to heal them. Within a very few years after the 1859 publication of 'On the Origin of Species' medical research started experimentation on animals for things like pharmaceuticals, etc. They started relying on the genetic link that Darwin proposed, to conduct medical research on animals and then apply that medical knowledge to human beings. This began the age of modern medicine. The improvement to human life from that alone is immeasurable.So my 3 star rating isn't because I don't value the book, but more because honestly much of it was dry, with a great deal of scientific language. It was basically like reading a science textbook, in all fairness because that is what it is. I found my mind wandering occasionally and having to start a section over to stay focused.I probably won't read/listen in its entirety again. However I am happy that I did once. I feel much more educated and much more open-minded to Charles Darwin and the value that his work brought to the world."
178,0785819118,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70254786-nate,4,"Chapter 1: This book’s thesis is that all life evolved over time through natural selection and survival of the fittest. Darwin’s speculations were induced due to pressure from colleagues and declining health with age. General, rather than precise conclusions are contained within, rather than facts. Coadaptation and modification lead to the generation of new beings. Natural selection leads to the extinction of species and divergence of character. Geological records are inevitably imperfect. Natural selection is posited as the predominant means of evolution, but not is not the entirely exclusive means. Because of humanity’s significant deviation from the state of nature, it’s difficult to wholly identify evolutionary means and natural selection norms. This is largely due to an excess of food. Natural selection is about a correlation of growths: as a limb or quality is used and valued in a species, that element is further cultivated and thereby evolved into a more suitable and favorable roles as generations progress. Varieties and sub-varieties differ greatly from one another. Likeness does not necessarily beget likenesses in relative offspring. However, inheritance is the norm. Natural selection explains the preservation and/or modifications of any particular trait in a living organism. Darwin does not believe all descents are of any one species, for example, all dogs came from one species of dog. Darwin instead asserts that dogs have descended from a wide range of various other species over time, which is why original variation within a single species is near impossible to accurately and vehemently trace. Darwin claims that because of multiplicity, crossovers, and varieties of genetic inheritance, he intentionally wants to remain vague regarding the topic of genetic origins of species. Within two generations, inheritance is clearly evident, but by adding a third generation of crossover, the tracing process becomes extremely obscure and borderline hopeless. It is very difficult to get an animal to breed under domestication. Half-civilized man may have unintentionally domesticated some animals to certain degrees, creating domestic races of species. This causes adaptation according to humanity’s use and/or fancy. Selection is accumulation in one direction over successive generations. Ancient records in both Europe and Africa demonstrate domestication and categorization of cattle, sheep, and dogs in accordance with various purposes. Thus breeding has been attended to in ancient times by intellectuals, and maybe now by savages. We naturally nurture and preserve the best known varieties of any category. This is performed naturally across all plants and animals. However, *it’s clear the natural well-being of any living species is not improved by selecting and preserving the best of any kind; this has been proven across all the history of time and space. Therefore, this selection process has never improved the nature of any species. Location largely determines the success of a species at given points in time. Domestic characterizations lead to abnormalities in a species’ character. This also leads to significant differences in external appearances, but little difference internally, with regard to organs. It is natural for us to gain intrigue from novelty, thus both large to small differences naturally attract attention and further interest. Darwin asserts that the absolute origin of any given species is ultimately untraceable because of the unrecorded and ongoing external and internal changes of any given species. Natural selection is an unconscious attention. This selection is more rapidly attended to in some periods of time, when compared to others. Darwin explains how the one factor that most influences our understanding of evolution is human attention. Humans must be closely examining a species over long periods of time to form accurate understanding of evolutionary natural selection. The conditions of life are the greatest determinants for variability in any given species. Variability is governed by many unknown natural laws, but especially by the correlation of growth. Chapter 2: Variation & Nature - Species and varieties are difficult to define, but variety implies common descent. However, even in variation, one form of a variety can be ranked as a form of another. This is done through analogy of intermediate and closely connected links, but this opens much doubt and conjecture. This is what causes obscurity among accurately ranking and differentiating species and varieties. This causes different geographical races of the same species. Varieties are most often found within species humans find useful purposes for. Thus, no clear line is drawn between species and subspecies. Darwin determines the term species to be more specifically distinct and distinguished, while variety is that which allows room for flexibility in interpreting. However, more generally Darwin claims the term species is applied arbitrarily for convenience, whereas the term variety is given to less distinct forms. Dominant species in any given area always gain advantages. A species is only a strongly marked and permanent variety. The lesser differences between varieties increases with the greater differences between species. Chapter 3: Struggle for existence, challenges of natural selection - complex relations among all nature. Natural selection is as uncontrollable to humans as nature is to art. Whenever there are large amounts of increases in a species, there must always be a struggle for existence, symmetrical and geometrically. Thus geometrical destruction is necessary for general preservation of life. Plants produce seeds rapidly and there are few species that do not at least annually pair. Climate acts in ways that favor certain species. Chapter 4: Natural Selection - The elimination and preservation of specific variations defines natural selection. There are generally good effects of inter-crossing and ill effects of inter-breeding. There’s an undeniable mutual relation among all organic beings. Sexual selection: peculiarities often occur under domestication, leading to possibly wholly different habits of life, or on functional relationships. Sexual selection is less rigorous than natural selection in nature. Special weapons confined to the male sex creates advantages for breeding. Diversity and variety within a species increases its success among the diverse and various factors in nature’s different environments. Species have large differences and varieties have small differences. Original species are typically eventually eliminated. There’s 11 original species marked on the tree of life. Larger descents typically outlive smaller groups and classes. Over time, larger variations of species tend to survive. There’s infinite diversity among structures, constitutions and habits across all species. Darwin claims that each most distinctive classification of species must’ve been independently created. The processor a tree’s growing is a perfect analogy for how species have grown and deviated: as branches and limbs grow, they break off and distinguish from each other. The great tree of life is how life is formed. Personal note: the trunk of this tree must be humans. Chapter 5: Laws of variation - organized structures and variability. The nature and conditions of life combined with cause and effect create variations. Use and disuse of certain biological features determines their enlargement, reduction and/or elimination. Modifications are not always inherited. All species have descended via a single parental paradox. Darwin believes natural selection and modification will eventually cease over a long enough timeline. Chapter 6: difficulties on the theory - of descent with modification, transitional varieties, organs of extreme perfection and of small importance, law of unity of type. All living species are absolutely interdependent on one another, making all variations across time generally vague, but always interdependent. The larger number of species in a given area causes larger variations within that same species. However, variation is a naturally slow process over time. Natural selection leads species to become the most functional members of their communities possible. Natural selection should however not be confused with natural steps of say, birds developing the ability to fly. There are also many dissimilar habits within the same species. Darwin admits his theory of natural selection is driven by inference beyond specific observations. He says there is a power that determines alternations in organs of species. In the same way two people merge to create new inventions, natural selection works analogically to benefit a race of species. Natural selection works for the good of each being. It doesn’t ever act solely to commit harm to another being. Two factors that determine all existence: unity of type, and conditions of descent. Chapter 7: Instinct - Darwin doesn’t wish to postulate the origin of cognitive faculties, but rather of behaviors common among species. Instinct is that which requires no prior experience to understand. Instincts are separate from habits. The division of labor by means of natural selection is a natural and organic process as observed in other animal species. Variations are numerous, slight, and sometimes accidental.Chapter 8: Hybridization - sterilization of first crosses and of hybrids, varies in degrees, causes, effects and parallelism. Slight changes to conditions of life for any living being is beneficial. There’s a common and unknown bond running parallel to all life. There’s essentially no difference between species and varieties. Chapter 9: The imperfection of the geological record - absence of intermediate varieties, on any one formation. Paleontology, Darwin explains, is an incomplete and heavily broken record of history where various parts of species are placed together mainly through inference. He explains how the number of generations of living species transitioning to and from different areas of land and sea can never truly be traced with the factual evidence provided. Fossil remains are deteriorated, especially at the bottom of the sea regularly throughout all time. Darwin says we’re taking an erroneous view when we tacitly admit that sediment has been deposited over the sea at a rate that’s too fast and long for realistic fossil remains. Darwin says our geological records capture solely the subsidence period of tides, which come to comprise our incomplete and shattered, spotty paleontology and geology records. Darwin says nature has essentially hidden and guarded against the discovery of transitional and interlinking forms. Darwin weaves together a series of arguments and considerations which express how we can have no absolute way of understanding the interrelations between and among different species of animals. There are early primordial periods for which we can have no accurate account of. This is especially apparent via the interconnected shapes of continents at the dawn of life. Chapter 10: On the geological succession of organic beings; the slow and successive appearance of new species; different rates of change. Organisms high on the scale of nature change more rapidly than lower forms. Darwin doesn’t believe there’s a fixed law of modification, only that it occurs over long periods of time. Organisms that don’t change will become extinct. All species evolve gradually over time, then become extinct after reaching a particular population number. The path to extinction is quicker than a species path to evolution. New species are formed out of dominant species. The successions of forms develop in parallel. Forms of life, specifically in the sea, have transformed almost simultaneously across the globe. Naturalists don’t distinguish between high and low forms of life. Six primary species have decent from one primary species. Our geological records are extremely inaccurate and incomplete because of the enormous intervals of time between consecutive formations. Chapter 11 & 12: Geographical distribution - inheritance is the bond between all species, modification is the distinction. The nature of migration determines the nature of modifications through natural selection. The more challenging the migration, the further modifications and improvements. The variability in each species are independent properties. There’s no law of necessary development. Species have most likely arisen from a single birthplace, when all the continents of the world were connected together. The same species must’ve been independently created at several distinct points. Species have gradually migrated from north to south over time. Thus, northern forms of species have advantages over southern due to more time for naturalizations. Before the ice age, a central species was able to be isolated and develop in different directions, Darwin asserts. The alternations of climate have led to the distribution of species. Water birds are most likely responsible for the distribution of seeds across seas. The lower an organism is on the food chain, the more widely it’s relatives vary, with regard to different types of modifications. Chapter 13: Mutual affinities of organic beings - morphology, classifications and groups, natural systems, extinction separates and defines groups. Varieties eventually produce new and distinctive species. There’s a constant tendency in species to diverge. There’s no universally constant character found in all species. The culmination of characteristics are absolutely essential. Changes in language over time is an accurate analogy of how species have stemmed out over time. Extinction has only separated groups, extinction has not made them. The nature of an organism’s nurture, determines the nurture of each organism’s nature. Development through nurture depends on the nature of how an organism relates to one’s parents. Rudimentary organs arise mutually with modifications. Adapted for organs are imperfect and useless. Rudimentary organs point out natural symmetry in nature. Changes in conditions lead to modifications. Rudimentary organs are never wholly lost, even if they’re not used. Rudimentary organs are like letters not pronounced in words, but leave clues regarding a word’s derivation. Chapter 14: Recapitulation and conclusion - our lack of knowledge of climate change throughout the earth’s cumulative history makes it difficult to trace all decent with modification. The transformation of nature over time cannot be captured by the human intellect. Intermediate forms of species are likely to be inaccurate. Geology shows that all species have changed over time. Humans don’t produce variations in organisms, we only do so unintentionally, and from there, nature acts on the organization of the organisms as a whole. We have difficulty accepting changes in which we do not see the intermediate steps. Darwin claims through analogy that all species have decent from a single original prototype. All living things have much in common, and more often more similarities than differences. Darwin hope this to be the ultimate aim of natural history, to trace the common and similar singularity of all species (not a focus on insignificant differences). Darwin predicts that science will increasingly advance more specific terminology for more and more species over time. This, however, also leads to further obscurity and inaccuracies of the term species as it is intended to define. Darwin says the term “species” is ultimately undiscoverable. Every living organism deserves to be looked upon as something utterly beyond all comprehension of human thought and expression. Organic rates of change cannot be solely measured via time, as external conditioning is always in flux. The larger and dominant species will ultimately always be responsible for creating new varieties and in turn species. The incomprehensible complexities of natural laws acting on and reacting to all organic and inorganic life ought to enable us to develop a deep appreciation for all beings and the unfathomable and beautiful mystery of nature.

There are books that are arguably more influential, but they do not, by-and-large, contribute to our understanding of the physical world. There are books with greater factual content which has been less revised in the light of new knowledge, but it is hard to think of one quite as influential. Darwin, after a decades-long process of formulation, research and self-doubt, with this book both established the theoretical framework that turns natural history into a science and identified humanity's place in that framework. The effect has been profound.I must admit, I found Darwin's prose harder to follow than I had expected. Victorian prose tended to circumlocution, and Darwin for this reason was for me less readable than either modern protagonists of scientific theory or the philosophes of the Enlightenment. This was a pity, and detracted somewhat from the pleasure of reading such a profound work. For crystal clarity of explanation I would choose Dawkins. For gravity and historical impact, one has to read Darwin.Stylistic niggle aside, it is striking how much Darwin got right at a time of limited knowledge and means, and sometimes even more illuminating what he got wrong, or did not know. The greatest lacuna in his rather encyclopaedic knowledge of nature concerned the rules of variation and development. These are a continuing triumph in science and their effect has been to confirm and complete Darwin's own triumphs. Darwin was not aware of the rules of Mendelian inheritance. He was, therefore, forced to fish in the dark for an understanding of how variation arises and re-emerges over generations. The synthesis of this understanding, when it was widely realised, reinforce natural selection and turn it into a true, mathematical, science discipline. Darwin believed in the inheritance of acquired characteristics. We now do not, except in the limited technical sense of epigenetics, but this, along with the plasticity provided by the principles of use and disuse, merely strengthens natural selection.When he gets it ""right"", as defined by our present understanding, Darwin is even stronger. On homology and biogeography his case is simply compelling. He backs up his arguments about the movement of species with case after carefully-tested case regarding the survival of seeds in salt-water, the presence off-shore of flying insects, the movement of eggs and earth on birds' feet and so forth. It has been said that Darwin's unique notoriety in a period when evolution was emerging all around him and was formulated independently by another, Wallace, is due to his discipline and patience in gathering and documenting evidence. I have to agree. He is the quintessential scientist.Had Darwin never lived, natural selection would have been known before the end of the Century regardless. We owe to Darwin that it became a true science and that it stood so early on such strong foundations. "
