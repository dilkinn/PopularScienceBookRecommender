0,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6896-peter,0,"I first read Longitude, by Dava Sobel, just after I finished high school, and I devoured it in a sitting or two. It was the first non-fiction book, I think, that I really couldn't put down. The (true) story is great: legendary historical figures like Isaac Newton, Galileo, James Cook, King George III; scientific conundrums; innovative engineering; a ransom of millions at stake; and a humble, lone man competing against oppressive and manipulative big-wigs.Background: Latitude lines are the parallel lines that circle the globe above and below the equator, and any sailor could figure out his latitude by measuring the length of the day or looking at the angle of the sun or the north star. But finding one's longitude, the lines that connected the north and south poles, was much more difficult. Anyone could determine that he was on the tropic of cancer, but determining how far along the tropic of cancer was a different challenge--one that, if solved, would revolutionize navigation and save countless lives. In 1714, Parliament offered a purse worth 20,000 Pounds (millions today) to anyone who could solve the longitude problem. John Harrison was a quiet, hard-working clockmaker who believed he had found the way.Re-reading this now, many of the details and events in the story remain as compelling as they were ten years ago. Longitude is a tremendous tale of battling scientists and the perseverance of hard work, brilliance, and humility through political intrigue and greed.Do I recommend it? Yes, to anyone interested in history, science, engineering, geography, politics, astronomy, navigation, clockmaking...Would I teach it? Not in an English class, but I'd refer to it as a great example of science writing.Lasting Impression: This book keeps a wonderful balance between the personal, scientific, and political elements of the story. It's history you can escape into."

They quickly sank killing 2,000 men. The cause of this catastrophe was the inability to determine longitude, a problem that beset mariners everywhere. In 1714 the British Parliament set a £20,000 reward for whoever could solve the problem. The Board of Longitude, which would be primarily comprised of astronomers, was set up to award the money. To win the full prize, the method or device had to be accurate to within one-half degree on a trip from England to the West Indies.There had been many ideas about how to determine longitude, but none worked reliably. They fell into two basic camps: the astronomical and the clock. The idea behind astronomy was to find a pattern of stars, the track of the moon or even the eclipses of the four known moons of Jupiter that would yield longitude. The clock idea was based on time difference. 15 degrees of longitude equals an hour. So a clock that could keep accurate time set to London time could be compared with a clock set to local time. The local time could be determined by sighting the sun at noon. The time difference would give the degrees of longitude from London. But prior to the eighteenth century clocks didn’t work reliably in the rough environment of ships at sea, so the London clock would be off. In 1727, a self-educated village carpenter and clock maker, John Harrison, heard about the prize. In 1730 he had plans for a chronometer as mariner’s clocks of sufficient accuracy would later be called. He showed his plans to Edmund Halley of comet fame, a board member, who sent him to a prominent clockmaker and fellow Royal Society member who encouraged Harrison to build his clock. Five years later Harrison presented the clock to the board. He had been able to take it on a voyage to Lisbon where it proved its worth. Harrison’s clock was original, intricate and exquisitely crafted. The board was impressed but Harrison himself was not. He felt he could do better and took another five years to build a second chronometer. The Royal Society tested the second clock and gave it accolades but Harrison again decided he could do even better and took twenty years to build a third.In the thirty years Harrison was building his three clocks astronomers were busily cataloging stars and navigational instruments were vastly improving. By 1760 the board was considering a complicated but effective method of calculating a ship’s longitude from the positions of the moon and stars. And since the board was mostly made up of astronomers, they instinctively preferred an astronomical solution to a simply mechanical one.Harrison was awarded the prestigious Copley Gold Medal in 1749 at the recommendation of the Royal Society for the many innovations he had made in his clocks that made them so accurate and reliable. But as usual Harrison himself was the hardest to satisfy. Immediately after completing clock three he built a fourth, a pocket watch that ultimately would win the coveted prize. On a West Indies trip the pocket chronometer worked perfectly, but the astronomers on the board dawdled about awarding the prize since they were now enamored with an astronomical solution. Since presenting his first chronometer, Harrison had been receiving stipends so that his work could continue, but the prize was elusive. Harrison felt his chief nemesis was Astronomer Royal, Nevil Maskelyne, a strong advocate of the astronomical method. Maskelyne took it upon himself to conduct further tests on Harrison’s watch. Finally in 1765 the board awarded Harrison £10,000, half the prize, and ordered him to make two more of the watches to show it could be duplicated. The board also commissioned another clockmaker to build an identical twin of Harrison’s watch. The twin was selected to accompany Captain Cook on his second voyage around the world. The chronometer won high praise from Cook who used it to make accurate maps. Finally through the intervention of King George III, Harrison received a final £8,750 in 1773.One of the biggest problems with Harrison’s chronometer was the cost, at least £400 to duplicate when a sextant and tables cost £20. But fifteen years later the price would drop to £80 and would keep declining. By 1815 over 5,000 chronometers were in service. The problem of longitude had been solved. Sobel’s short history reads quickly. The book contains nice photographs of Harrison’s clocks showing their complex inner workings. The chronometers have been restored and now reside in British museums. Sobel explains some of the principles of clock mechanisms and details some of Harrison’s innovations. She also covers failed as well as successful astronomical approaches to finding longitude. But this is also a human interest story of an odd difficult man, a homespun insular genius, who faces the complex scientific society of eighteenth century England. Recommended for the science buff and general reader alike."
2,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37107782-pramod-nair,4,"Longitude from Dava Sobel is a fascinating account of how a virtually unknown watchmaker named John Harrison conquered one of the oldest and thorniest problems surrounding the ocean voyages - the problem of accurately measuring longitude -, which stumped even the best of scientific minds for centuries. A fascinating problemIt was Ptolemy in ‘Geographia’, written in the 2nd century, who contributed the concept of a co-ordinate system based on the imaginary lines of latitude and longitude, for accurately plotting any spot on the surface of earth. With these imaginary lines he bought a new light in to the maritime explorations and map-making methods of his time. The sailors while at the ocean found it pretty straightforward to find their current latitude - which is drawn parallel to each other while girdling the globe – by measuring the height of the sun or any known celestial bodies. But accurately measuring their current longitude was an entirely different case, as the longitudinal lines loop from the North Pole to the South Pole and back again in great circles, which converge at the ends of the earth. Since it is an angular measurement, which is based on time, the sailors had to have access to two different times - the current time on-board the vessel and the time at a known and pre-selected longitudinal location – at the same instance for calculating the hour differences to work out the geographical separation and the longitude. From a modern viewpoint with our easy-to-carry accurate time-telling devices and instant communication this problem, which a sailor faced in finding the exact time at two different locations, may feel far-fetched. But a sailor in the middle of an ocean pre-dating 18th century only had limited resources in the form of either a pendulum driven clock which was not at all reliable – as the factors like gravity, motion of the vessel, temperature and atmospheric pressure affected the pendulum and there by the time – or by comparing positions of moon or planets like Mars with their anticipatory positions in working out the longitudinal values; both these methods were crude with a high level of inaccuracy.Since the days of Ptolemy, legendary scientific and exploratory minds like Amarigo Vespucci, Sir Issac Newton and Galileo Galilei did a lot of research into this matter but it took sixteen more centuries for mankind to finally invent a reliable solution for this problem.A tragedy & the declaration of a prize moneyIn 1707, a British fleet of vessels under Admiral Sir Clowdesley Shovell met with a tragic disaster as the result of miscalculations in their whereabouts leading to the sinking of four warships with a death toll of more than 1600 mariners. This disaster and huge protest from the merchants and seamen resulted in the formation of a parliamentary committee for finding a practical solution for the longitude problem. This was followed by the 1714 ‘Longitude Act’ by the parliament, which promised a prize money of £ 20,000 for a suitable solution. Dava Sobel covers this formation of the committee and the announcement of the reward in detail.Sir Issac Newton, who was consulted by the committee, at first suggested the idea of a ‘watch’ for tackling the longitude problem.“One method is by a Watch to keep time exactly. But, by reason of the motion of the Ship, the Variation of Heat and Cold, Wet and Dry, and the Difference of Gravity in different Latitudes, such a watch hath not yet been made.”But he believed that such a watch with too many technical challenges was not going to be a reality and was aligned more towards finding a solution for the longitude problem in the realms of astronomy. “A good watch may serve to keep a reckoning at Sea for some days and to know the time of a celestial Observation; and for this end a good Jewel watch may suffice till a better sort of Watch can be found out. But when the Longitude at sea is once lost, it cannot be found again by any watch.”Newton died in 1727, and therefore did not live to see the predecessor of the modern day chronometers become a reality. At the same time another less known figure; a skilled watchmaker from Lincolnshire named John Harrison who was stimulated by the scientific and the monetary factors surrounding this riddle decided to find a solution of his own. Possessed with a brilliant mind he succeeded initially in creating a prototype and then further versions of perfect working models of the world’s first marine-chronometers thereby revolutionizing the ocean travels. His handmade sea-clocks - which are elaborate pieces of engineering marvels and still in display in working condition at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, England - gave the world the first reliable method for measuring the longitude.Dava Sobel records the background and each step of this pioneering invention in an easy to read form, by guiding the reader through a tumultuous story of the sheer determination and relentless pursuit for perfection from a self made man and the obstructions, unkempt promises and villainy he had to face from some of his jealous contemporaries. This concise and engaging chronicle of an innovative engineering deed covers a lot of details on the history, science and politics, which led to this invention and is a recommended read for anyone who is interested in maritime history and science. Since I read an updated fully illustrated edition of ‘Longitude’, which was published later, the book was a treasure trove with a large selection of rare photographs - including Harrison's sea-clocks, documents of declarations, letters, scientific articles, maps and diagrams which added greatly to the value of the volume. The illustrated edition is highly recommended."
3,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79757330-philip-allan,4,"Longitude is a remarkable achievement. The recipe for sales success in international book sales rarely contains such unpromising ingredients as these – an obsessive carpenter’s son from Yorkshire, an intractable navigational problem and a lot of clocks. Yet Longitude succeeds in weaving a narrative full of clashing of ideas, intriguing personalities, bizarre anecdotes and at its heart a tale of the little guy challenging the Establishment.The story is one that has long been familiar to both naval historians and lovers of clocks, two introspective groups who had failed to bring it to a wider public. Enter Dava Sorbel , with a journalist’s nose for a good story, and the flare to tell it well. This is a page turner that makes what could be a mire of mechanical and mathematical detail simple, easy to follow and enjoy by anyone, whether they are confirmed landlubbers or have a previous interest in the sea.From a purest point of view the book does have its faults. Sorbel’s understandable desire to tease a cracking yarn from the history leads her to be partial in choosing her facts. She is unfairly hard on the Halley/Maskylene method of calculating longitude, for example, which worked too, and had the big advantage of only requiring equipment that already exist onboard ships (a good compass, a sextant and a trained navigator). It is small wonder that an unproven machine, full of cogs and springs was viewed with suspicion. It is also only with hindsight that it is clear the marine chronometers was the right solution. The copy of H4 that Cook used on his second voyage cost £450 and took a skilled watch maker several years to make. To give an indication of cost, building a frigate at the time cost about £14K. Given each ship would need several chronometers (to check against each other), at the time of Harrison’s death, it was still not a practical solution for most vessels. It was those that came after Harrison, especially Thomas Earnshaw, who perfected and then mass produced reliable chronometers.But that is the grumpy naval historian part of me speaking. The author of popular naval fiction part can only applaud a wonderful book. "
4,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia,4,"Really lovely and very interesting reading. Everybody knows about longitude but I guess not so many know the struggles and fights behind the tries to 'conquer' it, including myself.John Harrison was a genius of his times; beside the fact that he produced the first accurate marine watches for calculating longitude, his pieces are works of art:H1(http://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/behind-...)H3(http://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/behind-...)And the masterpiece, H4, completed in 1759:(http://prints.rmg.co.uk/art/520153/ma...)The book is written on everyone's understanding, full of new historical facts (for me). It was a pleasure and it takes just a few hours to get it done; totally worthy of your time."
5,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,4,"Non-fiction about the quest to develop a reliable method for measuring longitude. The first several chapters describe the difficulties encountered by ships attempting to navigate solely based on latitude. The focus then shifts to a biography of John Harrison, the 18th century clockmaker who attempted to solve this problem based on timekeeping. It also describes his primary competitor and adversary, Nevil Maskelyne, who was keen on proving that the best approach involved astronomical readings. They and many others vied for the monetary prize offered by the British government. Along the way, the author highlights some of the more outlandish ideas, one of which involves barking dogs!The book is far more than a scientific analysis of the problem of finding longitude. It portrays the intrigue, rivalries, conflicts, and accidental discoveries that make this book a fascinating reading experience. It is a story of the triumph of a perfectionistic genius of humble origins over the well-educated experts of the day. Recommended to those who, like me, enjoy stories related to travel by sea, voyages of exploration and discovery, and maritime adventures in days of yore. "
6,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51291-william-t,2,This book was intended for the general reader. Consequently it did not deal much with the details either of the astronomical or mechanical approaches to solving the problem of finding longitude on the high seas. Instead it focused on description of John Harrison's quest to build an ocean chronometer. The author treats the difficulties Harrison encountered convincing the Board of Longitude of the efficacy of his devices as a matter of petty politics and egotism without offering the reader sufficient detail about the technical disputes to make any judgments about the scientific debate at the center of the controversy.This book was a bit of a disappointment considering the glowing reviews it received.
7,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45287334-john,5,"An amazing book following the attempts to solve the longitudinal navigation problems. The author’s research covered several hundred years of partial success and many failures. Especially interesting was the English contest for solving the problem. An amazing man, John Harrison, worked tirelessly to conquer the problem. The trials of Harrison, and the jealously of others in his attempts made for a good story.. This genius is credited with producing the first marine machine to accurately calculate longitude. Then he reduced his machine to a marine watch. He made numerous chronometers and many of them may be seen in the Royal Observatory and other places in England.Well written and documented with bibliography ."
8,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1627983-mahlon,4,"In Longitude, Dava Sobel chronicles the world's quest to tame time. In 1714, the English Parliament passed the longitude act. It established the Board of Longitude and offered a prize of 20,000 pounds to anyone who could find a simple and practical method for the precise determination of a ship's longitude. In particular Sobel highlights John Harrison's pursuit of the prize. She traces the arc of his career, and details the innovations of each of his subsequent entries (H1-H5) Unfortunately, even though his Chronometers repeatedly proved their worth in Sea trial after sea trial, and the watch quickly gained adherents among sea captains, Harrison was thwarted at every turn in his attempt to claim the prize. Jealous rivals on the board used their influence to change the rules of the contest multiple times. His relations with the board became so acrimonious that eventually his friends went over the board's head and appealed directly to the King himself. George III asked that a special act of Parliament be passed and Harrison finally received his prize.Despite it's brevity, Longitude is an incredibly engaging and educational book. Sobel writes in a way that makes the science and math accessible to the general reader.If you're interested in this subject I'd also recommend the 2000 A&E movie, which was based on this book."

I read it back in the year 2000(+-). I have favorable recollections of the book, and I found it to be in interesting story. The following short review is copied from the calendar.Anyone with an interest in history or things maritime should consider Longitude,"" said USA Today of this bestseller. Sobel describes 18th-century clockmaker John Harrison's struggle to invent an accurate chronometer, which measured time, necessary to calculate longitude while at sea. Requiring decades of painstaking research, Harrison finally accomplished his goal, but then faded into the mists of time until his reputation was revived by Sobel's book, which is full of little-known facts about science, ships, and England in the 1700s.
LONGITUDE, THE TRUE STORY OF A LONE GENIUS WHO SOLVED THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM OF HIS TIME,
 by Dava Sobel (1995; Walker & Company, 2007)The link below is to an excerpt from the book:https://t.co/NB5tdBsnKQ"
10,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13954899-kathleen,4,"""The British Parliament, in its famed Longitude Act of 1714, set the highest bounty of all, naming a prize equal to a king’s ransom (several million dollars in today’s currency) for a “Practicable and Useful” means of determining longitude.” I read this historical and biographical account in one evening. It's not without flaws, but I was fascinated and gave it 5 stars for holding my attention in a topic I rarely read about, where science, math, politics, and culture intersect with astronomical and nautical history. The technical details may be insufficient for some readers, but there was just enough for me. Author Dava Sobel caught my interest and held it. Kudos to her!Anyway....Naval ships were crashing against rocks and smashing to bits, off course because finding longitude was rather a guessing game, even though latitude was fairly straightforward. Skippers didn't know how far north or south of their latitudinal orientation they had sailed. They'd run aground in the dark, the fog, etc. So.... In 1714, King George and Parliament earmarked a HUGE reward (£20,000 pounds!) for whoever was first to come up with a highly reliable way to find longitudinal orientation. Solving the longitude problem became a national pastime, for decades. All kinds of quacks tried all sorts of crackpot methods. Funny funny stuff!! Sensible seamen, scientists, astronomers, and mathematicians also joined the race. However, it was a lowly clockmaker who came up with the best method. An enduring method. It became his life's work.Did John Harrison actually win the prize, or did jealous prigs and political big-wigs cheat him of his due reward? Read it yourself to find out. It's less than 200 pages."
11,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"Interesting story. Reasonably written. Possibly a model for a certain kind of non-fiction book, the type with very long sub-titles that are meant to cast light on a very short main title, the whole presumably being the original elevator pitch that the author made to the publisher. This one is all about the late 18th century watch maker, John Harrison, who builds a series of highly accurate watches in an attempt to win a prize for a device to be able to establish longitude at sea. Nice, does what it says on the tin type book. In the tradition of praising people whose work made it possible to do things a little better - in this case navigate across seas using a map."
12,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1027995-j-aleksandr-wootton,4,"Stellar nonfiction, exceptionally well-written. Technical enough to satisfy those who want the details; lucid enough for the non-technical to comprehend the central problem and its attempted solutions; engaging enough to draw in all kinds of readers. This book could get practically anyone excited about applied science through real-world problem solving."
13,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,5,"I take GPS for granted. I don’t use it that much personally, because I don’t tend to go anywhere, but I’m sure all this technology I love to use makes use of GPS. Thanks to GPS, we can forget that calculating longitude without the help of a network of satellites is difficult and requires great mathematical and engineering expertise. GPS might not be great at giving directions, but that doesn’t mean you’re lost.In the days—centuries—prior to GPS, you could get lost. Really lost. I’m not sure how to describe how lost you could be, out there on the ocean, no longer in sight of shore. Latitude was relatively easy—well, easy enough once you dealt with the pitching deck, the storms, and the scurvy. Latitude corresponds both to the sun’s altitude in the sky (at noon) and to the altitude of certain stars (if you are in the Northern Hemisphere, Polaris is a good choice) at night. So you could figure out how far away from the equator or the poles. But how far away were you from the nearest charted island? And were you to the east of it, or the west?Longitude, or rather the “starting point” for lines of longitude, is entirely arbitrary. The only way to calculate longitude is to measure the difference in time between two points: the reference point (e.g., 0° longitude) and your current location. That sounds easy enough: just take a watch with you that’s set to London time, and at noon at your current location, check what time the watch reports.Much like our skill at flinging sophisticated pieces of technology into orbit has advanced, so too has our ability to construct watches. For the longest time, the solution to calculating longitude eluded mariners because no one could construct a clock that was both accurate enough and durable enough. The constant changes in pressure, humidity, and temperature played havoc with the fine mechanisms that allowed clocks to keep time. Without accuracy, a watch is useless as a method to calculate longitude.This problem consumed great minds for centuries. It eventually came to a head in 1714, when the English Parliament authorized the creation of a Board of Longitude to disperse prizes for new ways of accurately calculating longitude. The grand prize was £20,000—or $12 million in today’s currency. Longitude was a big deal.I knew the gist of the John Harrison story prior to reading Longitude, but Dava Sobel goes beyond the accomplishments of this single man and charts the course of the problem, and all its proposed solutions. She sets up a context against which the true scope and power of Harrison’s achievement might be measured. As I explained above, the general solution to calculating longitude was long in evidence, but no one could think of a way to effect it. Galileo had some good ideas related to his observations of Jupiter’s moon, but they were hardly practical for marine navigation. Later, Newton and other English scientists were convinced that astronomy held the key to calculating longitude—and the king agreed with them, establishing the Royal Observatory for the purpose of cataloguing the stars. More than a simple puzzle that made academics scratch their heads, the problem of longitude affected society and the economy. It drove scientific inquiry and technological innovation. Watching this unfold through Sobel’s storytelling is breathtaking and inspiring.Harrison’s origins read like something out of a fairy tale or a superhero book. His father was a carpenter, and he was trained as a carpenter, not as a watchmaker. Yet this craft fascinated him, so he trained himself to build clocks. In fact, he built a clock entirely out of wood, a clock that required no lubrication owing to the way he had constructed it and the type of wood he had used. John Harrison was not just a tinker or dabbler; he was a creative genius. So he decided to solve the longitude problem. And he did. But when he went to London for his reward, he was met with scepticism, animosity, and belligerence. Thanks to the politics of London, the Board of Longitude was populated by representatives from the astronomy camp, and they were none too keen on Harrison’s mechanical marvel. For the rest of his life, Harrison would improve upon his prototype and receive stipends from the Board, but that recognition and prize money lay beyond his reach.I personally think we tend to put too much stock in the “great individual” approach to history. I can see why it is appealing for stories, and for works of popular history: our ability to turn history into a biography boils away our dislike of dates and dry facts and lets us focus on the relationships and motivations of the characters. The central conflict of Longitude is not the need to calculate longitude but the antagonistic relationship between the Harrisons and the Reverend Maskelyne. Maskelyne championed the “lunar distance” method of calculating longitude. It just so happened, too, that later on in his life he became the Astronomer Royal, and therefore a member of the Board of Longitude. That didn’t go over well for Harrison’s chances at being awarded that prize.Indeed, echoes of the great rivalries across the ages surface in Longitude, reminding us that science is never as simple nor as objective as we like to think. Invention is partly innovation, partly inspiration, and part imitation. Sobel is careful to stress that Maskelyne was not the villain in this piece, merely the antagonist—like the feud between Newton and Hooke, the feud between Harrison and Maskelyne was a dispute between two men who knew their stuff. But where ego is concerned and establishing primacy is often necessary for the money and prestige that follows a discovery, tempers will flare and harsh words will be exchanged.So with this centuries-old problem juxtaposed against a feud between a rural carpenter-turned-watchmaker and the Astronomer Royal, Sobel turns Longitude from a history book into an exciting story. The trick to making any historical account interesting lies in exposing the details and connections that a casual reader, like myself, wouldn’t necessarily know. Sobel does this by charting the connections between Harrison and luminary contemporaries, including Isaac Newton, Edmund Halley, and Christopher Wren. She does this even with the considerable handicap of lacking much evidence about Harrison’s early life.Sobel also goes into the intricate inner workings of Harrison’s successive marine chronometers. The genesis and evolution of the marine chronometer, particularly once it had spread to other watchmakers, gave us not only an accurate way to calculate longitude but other useful horological innovations! As Sobel describes the clever devices he designed to solve the limitations of sea clocks, all I could think was, “I have no idea what she is trying to say. This book could use pictures.” Lo and behold, as I reached the middle of the volume, I stumbled into the glossy inset that includes diagrams of a grasshopper escapement and photos of Harrison’s portrait and the chronometers H–1 through H–4. It’s amazing that these timekeepers (with the exception of H–4) continue to run today.I wish Longitude were longer, but at the same time I love the size of the book as it is. My edition is a nice little paperback copy with a beautiful, high-quality cover. It is compact and deceptively slim for such an interesting history. Yet it is also definitely just a survey. I’m not sure, given the lack of details, how much longer Sobel could have spun it out. But the episodic nature of the chapters, and the abbreviated way she communicates the stories of the testing of H–3, H–4, etc., by Captain Cook and others, seems to indicate that there is more here to tell. Or is that another story?Oh well. I really liked Longitude. It has the perfect mix of narrative, character, and scientific explanation to make it a fascinating work of history of science. Dava Sobel weaves a fascinating tale set against a problem centuries in the solving, one that vexed astronomers, clockmakers, and mariners alike but whose solution led to advances in all three fields. I, personally, rely on my GPS devices to find my longitude. But it’s good to know that if the GPS network ever goes down, there is at least one museum I can rob for some high-quality longitude calculation devices.Now excuse me while I draw up some blueprints….

14,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,5,"Longitude is a sheer delight of a popular history of technology. Up until the 18th century, half of navigation was done by chance. Finding latitude is easy, simply take the angle between the horizon of the sun at noon or Polaris at night, adjust for the date, and you know where you are relative to the equator. But longitude is a different matter. Ships wandered in the great oceans, crews riddled with scurvy, or crashed into rising cliffs. The British government offered a prize of 20,000 Pounds, equivalent to millions of dollars today, for a solution to the longitude problem. Meanwhile, finding longitude was ridiculed as an impossible quest, on par with perpetual motion and squaring the circle. Serious approaches to longitude centered on time. If you knew what time was at some fixed point, a home port, and could compare it to local time, then 1 hour of difference in time corresponded to 15 degrees of longitude. But keeping track of the time simply was not possible with contemporary clocks which gained or lost whole minutes in an hour on land. Shipboard conditions, with constant motion, dampness, and temperatures ranging from sweltering tropics to arctic gales, made the problem seem impossible.Sobel follows the story of the man who cracked it, a self-taught clockmaker from Yorkshire named John Harrison. Harrison developed the first chronometer, a clock which kept accuracy to within seconds under harsh maritime conditions. But Harrison's triumph was bedeviled by official opposition. The men who made up the longitude board were mostly astronomers, and they believed that the problem must be solved by reference to a celestial clock, either eclipses of the moons of Jupiter, or the position of the moon relative to major stars. British astronomer royal Nevil Maskelyne refused to accept a 'mere mechanic' had cracked the problem, instead preferring a method based on the moon. After a decades long struggle, an elderly Harrison was awarded the money by Parliament, though not the prize. Chronometers were very expensive, ten times as expensive as an almanac of lunar ephemera, and navigators used lunar methods for decades. Harrison became the victor in the eyes of history. His chronometers are treasured artifacts. GPS, that omnipresent locator, relies on satellites and ultra-precise clocks. Longitude captures the spirit of the great age of exploration, and the taming of the leviathans in the blue spaces on the maps, in the best possible way."

Various methods were tried, including one that took lunar sightings developed by Nevil Maskelyne.Enter John Harrison. He taught himself to read and write, and was a proficient musician, his real talent was clocks. His first wooden pendulum clock is still in existence, held at The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers. And it was this talent that he put to good use to start to develop the devices that would enable the navy to know their exact longitude. His first attempt at a device was called H-1 and has lots of new technologies including frictionless bearings, the gridiron pendulum and the grasshopper escapment. This clock lost a second a month compared to the best clocks of the day that would loose 1 minute a day. The clock is still working.He presented the drawings to the Longitude board, and they gave permission to make one. The clock passed the tests, but as it improved the board decided to amend the original tests make them tougher. Harrison went on to develop 4 versions to meet these changing requirements, culminating in a 5 inch diameter watch that did the same as the H-1.By this time Nevil Maskelyne was head of the Longitude board. He made it extremely difficult for Harrison as he wanted his preferred lunar method to win. Harrison complied with the demanding requirements, and surrendered his clocks to the board. It was only with the kings intervention that the reward was finally given to Harrison.Sobel has written quite a dry account of this tale of engineering excellence and political manipulation. Whilst it get all the facts across, it doesn't convey the emotions of the men involved."
16,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/579016-reenie,2,"As far as popular science writing, or popular history of science writing (take your pick) goes, I've read better books. This is a book about a self-taught village clock-maker who created a whole new breed of amazingly precise chronometers, which enable the accurate measurement of longitude, and the fight he had with astronomers to get his solution recognised (and rewarded). High stakes (both in terms of the potential benefits to be had from being able to use longitude, and in terms of the reward value placed on finding a solution), but while the author keeps on reminding us that it's very important, and telling us that his struggles with the politics of the board who were supposed to award the reward were very severe, I generally felt underwhelmed by the story, or maybe the way it was being told and structured.After starting off very dramatically, (at one point even blaming the problems of scurvy on the inability to find longitude), the early part of the story of John Harrison (the clock-maker) seemed pretty bland and lacking in tension. When tension did arrive later on (basically after he'd already solved the problem), everything got kind of rushed through - it is a very short book, and it might have been better with a little more time devoted to rounding out some of the ideas, so that diversions into a brief recap of Captain Cook's death, or the voyage of the Beagle actually felt like they belonged, rather than being shoehorned in for some broader appeal. All in all, I ended up feeling like Sobel had manufactured a bunch of tension and drama, but not actually delivered on filling in the colour and texture of it all.It's not a bad book, but it itches for a rewrite for hacking and resorting and building into a better flow.

17,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,3,"Interesting review of the tale toward discovering a correct way to measure longitude for a ship at sea. It's short and informative but actually quite on the dry side. Not told in a fictionalized sense at all, but more a recital of fact, placements, and progression. The clock maker who succeeded with that bio-metal strip that did not alter the time by expansion or shrinking of the components became part of the key. As most innovation of great magnitude, it was a self-appointed task, completely by an individual. John Harrison should get his due. Especially within trade ships of earlier periods his work probably saved countless lives. Unsung hero."

I get that Dava Sobel was writing for a general audience and that I'm a scientist by training, but I would have really appreciated a few more sources or direct quotes from source texts and letters to connect with the historical figures described. As it was it very much felt like a summary or an abstract rather than the meat of a true historical account, with a sense of disconnect from the events described. Which is a shame, as the events are fascinating!"

For the captains of ships to plot their position they needed both latitude and longitude. The issue was that trying to nail down a constant to measure the angle against was proving rather perplexing. Moon? Stars? Eclipses of the moons of Jupiter? None of them worked out.The Longitude Act in 1714 was put forward by parliament with prizemoney for anyone finding the solution. The top prize was £20,000 which is several million in today’s money.Along came a Yorkshire clockmaker who in the 1700s made the most elaborate clocks. Google the John Harrison H1 sea clock. It is a work of art and beauty. He was obsessive about making a sea clock that would assist in the method of pinpointing where a ship is at any given time. I am not giving anything away to say he achieved this. Sobel details the whole story in the first chapter. There are many bumps along the way including the Board of Longitude looking more from an astronomical solution than a mechanical one. It is not a long book at all. Less than 200 pages but a lot is packed into it. I did not get into it straight away. It did take a few chapters. It is worth bearing with as it pays off.

Swiss wrist watch for him. That thing will probably be off only a couple of minutes a year. A few years back, I gave him a different watch, a solar-powered so-called atomic watch which is really a quartz watch that can synchronize to real atomic clocks through broadcast towers on three (or was it 4) continents. Adjusted for inflation, this second watch is probably cheaper. The rate of technological advancement is extraordinary over a long period of time because it's exponential. Backing off to the early part of the exponential function, you'd find glacier speeds of innovations (from today's perspective). But they are every bit as exciting and important. This book tells you the fascinating stories around the end of the 18th century when precision timekeeper was just about to be invented and chronometer was not a word yet. As they say, necessity is the mother of invention. The necessity this time was navigation -- or more specifically, longitudinal navigation. Determining latitude at sea is relatively easily as the season changes rather slowly and thus the sun stays at stable azimuth at noon. But longitude is an entirely different thing. You need to keep time accurately. Your watch and clock do not tell current time in some magical way, they track cumulative passage of time. Therefore, any small error accumulated over a long voyage can be substantial. So much so, back then the Royal Navy essentially was rather clueless as to where they are (longitudinally) at any particular moment. Yet, uncertainty and ignorance undermine authority and are therefore not allowed to be displayed. Thus any personnel keeping his private navigation on board is capital offense! One such officer risked his life to tell his commanding officer that he thought they are in grave danger. He was hanged for mutiny. The rest of the ship drowned (with two exceptions and one of which is an admiral who despited being washed ashore alive, was later murdered for his beautiful emerald ring -- history makes stories that rival Dumas's). That's how bad things were back then. And the great Newton himself told the parliament that it's a difficult problem and no easy path lay ahead. The parliament passed the longitude act and promised a prize ($5 million in today's currency) for the first person to tell longitude within half a degree. Then came the heroic effort of Harrison to make a series of time keepers to eventually beat the goal by a large margin. But there were so much drama and delay to his recognition. He eventually made an appeal to King George III. The much maligned king in Lin-Manuel Miranda's broadway hit ""Hamilton"" turns out to be a very reasonable and scientifically astute monarch. (King George, btw, is my favorite character in the musical. Now, I like him even more.) There are many interesting little stories like that throughout the compact little book. It's well worth a read."

He was barely conscious but alive. He was Sir Clowdisley, the admiral of the tragic fleet, and he had mistakenly steered his ships to disaster. One of his sailors tried to call attention to the upcoming catastrophe...but was immediately hanged. Inferior seamen were not allowed to keep their own calculations of maritime reckoning, not in 1707. Karma had the last laugh, as the Admiral went to his own reckoning. A beachcomber found the bedraggled officer...and immediately murdered him for the ring on his finger.So begins this book's quest to tell the story of the desperate need to solve the problem of finding longitude while at sea. One group of scientists believed the moon and the stars held the secret, while another group focused on clocks. John Harrison was the nondescript genius who found the answer, but then had to spend the rest of his years fighting the establishment to get the recognition and the reward.This book ended much too quickly. It's a bit of a whirlwind through the entire period, and I really wished for more background on each character. But, a good ride is a good ride. Amazingly, Harrison's first three clocks continue to tick centuries later, which is quite an achievement. Were he alive today, he would surely be part of the Google workplace.Book Season = Winter (when the Atlantic is most angry) "
23,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291846-david,4,"I'm not quite sure how to classify this book - history, biography, scientific treatise. But I found it intriguing and educational. It had never occurred to me how different latitude and longitude are. Since ancient times, seafarers had understood how to measure latitude (concentric circles parallel to the equator) based on the angle of the sun and the time of year. But longitude (circles which intersect at each pole - used to measure east/west distance) is much more of a challenge. Determining a position requires much more sophisticated astronomical measurement and calculation. Or, it requires very accurate measurement of time.In 1707, the British Parliament offered a prize equal to several million of today's dollars for an accurate and useful way to determine longitude. A tremendous race began with scientists and inventors determined to claim fame and fortune. Most focused on refining the astronomic method, but some believed the problem would only be solved by developing an extremely accurate timekeeping device. Since clockmaking was in its infancy, this challenge resulted in great innovation, and that's the core of this book's fascinating story. The hero is John Harrison, an English clockmaker, who devoted his life to the quest and eventually won the bulk of the prize."
24,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,5,"Sobel ranks right up there with Mark Kurlansky for writing detailed, fascinating accounts of historical technology. Calculating longitude had bedeviled mariners for centuries. To do so required an extremely accurate timepiece.John Harrison thought he could solve the problem. The book is a nice combination of science and biography. It reminded me of another similar work Noble Obsession Charles Goodyear, Thomas Hancock, and the Race to Unlock the Greatest Industrial Secret of the Nineteenth Century which details Goodyear's lifelong attempts to discover the secrets of vulcanization.The search for an answer was given a push when Parliament offered a huge prize for anyone who could find a way to calculate longitude accurately. A big problem was figuring out a way to overcome errors induced by humidity causing the pendulum to swell or cold making it contract. Both these effects would through off its balance inducing time-keeping errors.I have to admit admiring the tenacity and single-mindedness with which both Goodyear and Harrison attacked innumerable problems, never giving up. It's a shame that both had to overcome non-technical personal, social, and political problems to reap any rewards for their efforts."
25,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76097-emily,4,"To quote an esteemed LC history professor on the technical difficulties of pre-modern navigational technology: ""Nowadays, you'd refer to that as being lost. But they actually thought they could get somewhere."" Shortly after people discovered that the world was round and wanted to sail around it, they realized that they had no way of telling how far they'd gone and how close they were to where they wanted to be, as opposed to how close they were to the Bermuda Triangle, for example, or the giant pointy sneak-attack rocks that were about to sink their ship. The kingdoms of Enlightenment Europe were basically racing against each other to find a way to calculate longitude that worked better than eyeballing the north star with a sextant on a pitching deck, which pretty much didn't work at all. Longitude is the story of John Harrison, the man who invented the first clock accurate enough to keep time at sea, allowing navigators to know exactly where they were on an East-West scale. Harrison, and the reader, get sucked into a whirlpool of royal and scientific politics, which can get very dirty.

So I really have to give this the full 5-stars based on that alone.However, THAT SAID...maybe 180 illustrations (Sobel's total as noted in the introduction; I didn't count them) is a few too many? There are pictures on nearly every page, and while it makes for a much more enjoyable overall experience, one quickly notes that the pictures all fall into one of five categories: old-timey maps; near-identical paintings of 17th-18th century scientists; only-slightly-less identical covers of early scientific pamphlets*; paintings of ships at sea (cool); and finally, drawings and photos of the various clocks and other devices invented along the way (very cool). Of course, I don't know what ELSE you could have pictures of, (although inexcusably, the one thing that isn't shown is Galileo's brilliantly dorky ""celatone!**). My original review covers the text itself - although turns out I had totally forgotten about the delightful ""powder of sympathy,"" a bizarre magical powder that could purportedly heal instantaneously over great distances. Long story short, the plan would ultimately have called for wounded dogs to go out with all ships, who would then yelp at a fixed time every day when someone back in England dipped one of their bandage in the magic powder. Of course, on longer voyages the dogs would have had to be re-injured at regular intervals (remember, this was pre-PETA) - but thankfully, this technique was never tested.Anyway - absolutely great book that is even superior to the wonderful original.

I'm that sort of geek, so this book was just perfect for me.The longitude problem was one of the biggest scientific problems facing humanity in the early 1700s. The British government posted a large reward — the equivalent of millions of dollars. The Longitude prize was a forerunner to modern innovation prizes like the X Prize for launching a manned spacecraft into orbit, and the Orteig prize for a direct flight across the Atlantic (won by Charles Lindbergh).Longitude and latitude are coordinates for naming a location on the globe. Latitude identifies North-South position (for example, Canada and Mexico are at different latitudes) while longitude identifies East-West position (for example, Japan and California are at different longitudes).Ships were traveling all over the globe by the 1600s, but they could only determine their latitude (by observing the stars) while at sea. Longitude was just a guess. So you'd have the clumsy situation of a fleet of ships traveling someplace and sailing back and forth along the latitude trying to find the island they were looking for. Unlucky guesses could result in many deaths.It's hard to imagine this today, but solving the longitude problem would be equivalent in modern times to landing on the moon or curing cancer.This book documents the half century that the one man who eventually solved it, and along the way he made horology (clock engineering) into an important and respected craft. His struggles are not just technical, but also political and personal.I liked the writing style (curt, it lets the drama of the events speak for themselves) and the chapters are a perfect bite-sized length."

It's a surprisingly exciting tale: there was a contest, a rich reward and a deadline for entries. Before this problem was solved, sailors could calculate latitude by the stars but longitude required consistent, reliable timekeeping in all ocean conditions from one fixed point. Even with no penchant for science, I found this fascinating, esp. after visiting Greenwich, England, the museum and the very spot to which world time is related (as in Greenwich Mean Time). The author explains all the challenges involved and has written a suspenseful, interesting book about a subject I took for granted."

Time is to clock as mind is to brain. The clock or watch somehow contains the time. And yet time refuses to be bottled up like a genie stuffed in a lamp. Whether it flows as sand or turns on wheels within wheels, time escapes irretrievably, while we watch.
If you read Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything, and are eager for more, Longitude will be right up your alley. (I've read so many ""history of science"" type books, I'm thinking I should create a GR shelf just for them.) A lot of the stars of History make an appearance, including Galileo, Cassini, Newton, Huygens, Hooke, Halley, and Euler.I read this as a biography of John Harrison, watch-maker and longitude measurer, but that doesn't start until chapter 7, a fulll 33% into the book.The most accurate description is that this is a micro history of the development of time-keeping instruments that allowed seamen to measure longitude accurately. If that sounds kind of dry, well, it is. This is interesting, well-written, readable, and brief, but it's not exactly scintillating. This tale is a fine example of how beauraucratic red tape is no modern invention, if anything it was even worse back in the early 1700s! I learned one shocking factoid: keeping track of your location on the ocean was a hanging offense! 
...on that foggy night of October 22, 1707, the Scillies became unmarked tombstones for almost two thousand of Sir Clowdisley’s troops. The flagship, the Association, struck first. She sank within minutes, drowning all hands. Before the rest of the vessels could react to the obvious danger, two more ships, the Eagle and the Romney, pricked themselves on the rocks and went down like stones. In all, four of the five warships were lost.Only two men washed ashore alive. One of them was Sir Clowdisley himself, who may have watched the fifty-seven years of his life flash before his eyes as the waves carried him home. Certainly he had time to reflect on the events of the previous twenty-four hours, when he made what must have been the worst mistake in judgment of his naval career. He had been approached by a sailor, a member of the Association’s crew, who claimed to have kept his own reckoning of the fleet’s location during the whole cloudy passage. Such subversive navigation by an inferior was forbidden in the Royal Navy, as the unnamed seaman well knew. However, the danger appeared so enormous, by his calculations, that he risked his neck to make his concerns known to the officers. Admiral Shovell had the man hanged for mutiny on the spot.

36,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36199787-jim,4,"This little book is a gem. Less than 200 pages but a fascinating story. It is almost unfathomable in this age when it seems that practically everyone has a GPS device in their car, an iPhone, and a personal computer that there was a time when if you set sail you depended on luck or the grace of God to arrive at your destination once you were out of sight of land. All the explorers of the age, Babloa; Magellan; Drake, ""all got where they were going willy-nilly"". In the 18th century ""the wealth of nations floated upon the oceans"". No ship had a reliable means of establishing her precise location. As a result an unknown number of ships and sailors were lost. It became a great quest to discover a solution to the longitude problem. It would be on par to trying to discover the cure for cancer today. Nations offered huge purses for a solution. Notable among these was the British Parliament's Longitude Act of 1714 naming a prize of several million dollars in today's currency. Such prizes brought out the crackpots but there were basically two different legitimate schools of thought towards a solution. On the one side were the astronomers. On the other side were the horologists. The clockmakers. Among the later was John Harrison. Harrison had no formal education or apprenticeship. There is a story that as a child he came down with smallpox and was given a watch to amuse himself while recovering. There is some dispute on this as at that time a watch was both rare and expensive. None the less Harrison became a self taught clockmaker. He was a craftsman and an innovator. Harrison's efforts in solving the longitude problem gave us the chronometer. He built four different clocks in his quest to solve the longitude problem all the while some of the worlds leading astronomers, including Edmund Halley, were mapping the stars in their effort to solve the problem. I am not sure how many people know about this chapter in our history. It is a story of navigation, astronomy, and clockmaking. "
37,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254805-bob-h,5,"This was the great technology challenge of the 17th and 18th Centuries. Given its importance to commerce, not to mention the lives and fortunes of mariners and the world economy, it was perhaps of greater day-to-day practical importance than the moon shot may have been in our time. The riddle was a precise measure of longitude with which mariners could navigate (and avoid shipwreck); latitude was easy enough to find given the North Star but longitude was the great mystery. Britain would, through the Royal Astronomical Society, declare a reward of £10,000, a princely sum, to the person(s) who could find a method.This book is a concise and compelling story of the search, which would take a century and follow a number of different paths. Newer methods of celestial navigation -- plotting the locations of stars, the sun and moon -- had their champions. There was also the method of timekeeping, clockwork precise enough to be the basis of longitudinal measure, and durable enough to stand up to the rigors of climate, sea air and ship movement, and it was this method championed by John and William Harrison, Yorkshire carpenters and clock-makers. We see how each prototype would take years of careful crafting, and survive years of jealousy and intrigue among other contestants, under successive Astronomers Royal.It's a fascinating story and not just those who have sailed or have visited the observatory at Greenwich and its prime meridian (one outcome of the contest), and this book is a worthy and intriguing account."

39,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38623347-simon-eskildsen,4,"""What are you reading?"" ""A book about marine navigation between the 16th and 18th century!"" The girlfriend was not impressed.. But in all honesty, this is a page-turner. How did sea vessels navigate the great oceans before the modern-day where we simply look at a magical map with a dot showing our current location? Measuring latitude (north-south co-ordinate) is easy and has been well-known since at least the Age of Discovery: measure the angle from the horizon to the North Star, Polaris. The angle is equal to your north-south (latitude) position.Great, now how do we know how far east-west (longitude) we are? You didn't.. until the mid 1700s. The best you could do to figure out roughly where you were was to periodically throw a log in the water to figure out how fast you were going. Then, look at your compass and log both in your logbook. Imagine doing that accurately when waves are 10 meters high and the weather is terrible. If you do something slightly wrong or don't have the ability to do it for a while, you're good old fashioned lost at sea. This primitive navigation meant that the same trade routes were plied, making piracy easy in the Atlantic, and whalers stumbling upon each other. The biggest sea-going nations at the time: the Spanish, Portuguese, British, and the Dutch were all losing ships left and right: shipwrecks, pirating, and others that just never returned. The root cause: the inability to figure out where you were. The inability to determine your longitude. Prizes by the nations mentioned earlier went out at the equivalent of a million dollars today to find a reliable way on ships to measure longitude within half a degree of accuracy. This was one of the greatest scientific problems at the time with Newton, Galileo, and others giving it a shot. The first method that worked was Galileo's method of using Jupiter's moons (this was impossible at sea though, because even your heartbeat would throw the telescope off enough to miss the moons -- meant it was OK at land, but not at sea). When Ole Rømer looked into this method to determine longitude, he discovered discrepancies. He finally explained this by realizing that light did not instantly get from A to B, but that light like sound has a speed. Nifty by-product of solving one of the most important problems of his time.Finally, in the mid 1700s a method was published that relied on moon's movement. You'd measure the angle from the moon to some known celestial body and consult a table published annually to convert the angle into a longitude. This could take up to four hours (!). However, there was another way that no-one thought possible: using time. If you knew the time in, say, Greenwich, England and you knew your time where you are currently -- you could figure out your longitude. Each hour difference is equal to 360/24 = 15 degrees longitude. So, say you're in tumultuous waters off the Azores and would be delighted to know where you are. At high noon you're measuring your latitude, as per usual. Now, imagine you also had a clock synced to Greenwich and you noted the time of the clock at high noon too. The clock shows 14:13:00 when the sun is at the highest altitude where you are. Your longitude then comes out to ((13.00/60) + 2) * 15 = 33.25. To find the latitude, you take out your good ol' sextant and measure the angle to the sun at 37.0 degrees, so your coordinates are (37.0, 33.25). Ta-da! You're now ready to be sent on an Age of Discovery era ship with just a compass, sextant, and pocket watch. Problem was... no-one could create a sea-faring clock that was accurate enough. To measure within a half degree accuracy (~40km), which was required by the prize, you couldn't drift more than 3 seconds a day. Most clocks of the 1700s drifted by 5-15 minutes a day! Factor in the humidity, temperature, and vibrations at sea -- you wouldn't get even close. However, John Harrison persevered for something like 50 years finally creating a clock (through much drama with the longitude prize board) that was accurate enough. For example, one of the big problems was that some metals would shrink and others enlarge based on temperature. He'd find materials that complemented each other to keep time syncing, if one shrank, another would enlarge in harmony. The clock worked, but was only available to few as it was expensive and took years to create each one. James Cook had one, and found it invaluable to chart out the Pacific. Over the next 60 years other clock-makers made it cheaper and cheaper by decade. By the 1850s, almost everyone was using a chronometer derived from Harrison's and lunar tables went into the pages of history.I really enjoyed this book. Great science tale of solving a massive problem, being biased toward a particular type of solution (astronomy), discovering useful other things along the way (speed of light), and perseverance.The book, unfortunately, can't get the 5th star. The reason comes down to how there's not a single picture in the book, which makes the concepts hard to understand. I had to read up on them independently of the book to understand them properly. Dana seems to skate over the significance of the lunar distance tables that predated Harrison's clocks, which is a shame, because they were a revolution themselves despite their complexity."

Likewise, if you're expecting a a blow-by-blow account of his inventions and dealings with the Board of Longitude, you are also going to be disappointed.However, if you are looking for an interesting, fast read about the problems of calculating the longitude of a point on earth and how these were eventually solved, you have come to the right place. This is popular science-history - a tale of people and personalities as well as inventions and discoveries. Sobel's writing is accessible and her verve carries the reader along in the same way as reading a good novel. In just over 200 pages, there isn't much in the way of detail - but the reader does come away with a broad-brush overview of what the problem was, the reasons why it was so intractable, the various methods for solving it, and why the problem was solved in the way it was.I do find it interesting, though, that Sobel didn't comment that one of the early, wacky 'solutions' proposed - that of anchoring ships at strategic points in the oceans and having them fire off flares that passing ships could then use for position fixes - has come full circle. Only now we have satellites and radio signals instead of ships and flares, and Harrison's clocks (and the chronometers that followed) may themselves become obsolete eventually."
41,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20048682-karin,3,"This is the story of how a self-taught watch maker figured out how to make the first extremely accurate clock to allow sailors a reliable way to find longitude, particularly at night when it was cloudy. It's also the story of how others, mainly certain astronomers, didn't want to believe it could be anything other than a method using the sky and how some of them made it ridiculously difficult to win the money for solving this puzzle the most accurately.There isn't much to know about John Harrison's life, but there is some, and then the author digs into some of the other people who either supported or fought against his ideas and work. This is written for the average person who knows nothing about either astronomy or clock and watch making at the time.I am NOT going to tell you what they are, but there are two brilliant things that John Harrison was the first to figure out that are still used in devices, and at least one is something you have probably used, today."
42,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10296924-dee,4,"I learned several interesting facts in this book. Although an historical explanation of an important issue long since resolved, the author narrates the book in a very engaging manner. "
43,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26386317-gautham,3,"The book really made me empathise with the woes that John Harrison was going through in his dealings with the Board of Longitude, especially with Nevil Maskelyne. The history of time keeping in sea as well as the history of the time keeper in land does give a different picture of the 17th and 18th centuries in stark contrast with the 21st century. Yet how far science and technology have took us forward today really made me to contemplate upon the words Newton had once said ""If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of gaints"". This literally stands true here, as if it was not for the dedicated efforts by men like Harrison & his son, George Graham, Kendell, Mudge, Arnold and a lot of others the world may never have seen such wonderful new instruments. 'Chronometer' earlier had ringed in me the memory of an instrument used in ships but now it truly makes me remember a bygone age where the quest for finding the longitude was the passion that kept a generation of men so avid and awake."
44,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6887436-collin-winter,3,"I had gotten glowing recommendations for this book, but it left me disappointed. For a book about the history of technology, there's precious little technology in the book: Harrison's marine chronometers are repeatedly praised, but there's little in the way of description of how they work, or why they represented such an advance in clockmaking. Sobel will frequently describe a piece of clockwork, then say that Harrison didn't or couldn't use it in his marine timepieces, but without ever saying what Harrison did instead. H4 and H5, the miniaturized sea watches, are given particularly short shrift, with almost zero description of how they work. Sobel describes what they look like, their external appearance, but opts not to go deeper, beyond the surface, and explain their workings.My other disappointment is that there are no pictures or illustration of any of the clocks or even clock mechanisms to support the text. Early in the book, Sobel tries in vain to describe what a grasshopper escapement looks like, but it seems like she gives up on this by the end of the book, and simply references clock pieces without attempting any description at all.""Longitude"" is a narrative, not, as Sobel admits/claims in the acknowledgements, ""a scholarly study."" The story is certainly engaging, and well told, but Sobel sometimes lets the narrative arc of the Harrisons' shabby treatment by the Longitude Board overwhelm common sense. Quoting from Chapter 13,""""""Seeking proof positive of H-4's true reproducibility, the board also hired the watchmaker Larcum Kendall to attempt an exact copy. These efforts evince the board's ferocious pursuit of the spirit of the law as they interpreted it, for the original Longitude Act never stipulated that the ""Practicable and Useful"" method must be copied by its inventor or anyone else.""""""A marine chronometer that cannot be reproduced at scale is not ""Practicable and Useful"". Citing this as evidence of John Harrison's misuse by the Board is letting the story get ahead of the facts.Overall, I found ""Longitude"" a good popular overview of this piece history, but it left me wanting more detail about the technology being chronicled. Have Google handy when reading it so you can look up terms like ""backstaff"", ""reflecting quadrant"", ""winding rods"", ""grasshopper escapement"", etc, as you go."
45,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7413069-philip,4,"Longitude is by definition a smaller story than Sobel's equally enjoyable Planets, but contains the same in-depth research, beautiful writing, fascinating historical incidents, memorable (and generally obscure) characters, and incidental humor that made Planets such a pleasure.While focused on the amazing career of John Harrison, Sobel also introduces a solid cast of supporting characters, all of whom are worthy of having their own stories told; and while I thoroughly enjoyed the tale of Sir Cloudesley Shovell for the way his career so quickly and totally crashed and burned - well, crashed and drowned would be more like it - the true second star of this book was Commander Rupert Gould, who suddenly pops up in the last chapter a full century after Harrison's death to almost single-handedly rescue Harrison and his devices from total obscurity. My sole complaint is that the book would have really benefited from illustrations - but excellent pictures of all of Harrison's chronometers can be found on Google images, as well as a dorky-cool photo of Galileo's bizarre celatone.UPDATE, 01/2019: A-ha! So it turns out that there is indeed a sister version of Longitude that does have pictures: The Illustrated Longitude (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1...) which, in her introduction, Sobel explains was the result of so many readers commenting (i.e., complaining) about the lack of maps, photos, drawings and any other illustrations which would have earned her original book that elusive 5th star. And not ONLY that, but turns out there's also a 2000 BBC/A&E miniseries version starring Jeremy Irons and Micheal Gambon, (aka Batman's Alfred and Prof. Dumbledore, although apparently both known for a few other roles as well)! How did I not know that??ANYWAY...have just found both these items in our local library (the book ""Donated By a Patron""); and so while I'm not going to reread the whole book, I'll definitely spend a couple of evenings watching the movie and looking at pictures and just generally revisiting this fascinating and oh-so-well-told story. So thanks, Dava Sobel, William Andrewes (provider of illustrations and captions) , BBC, A&E - and of course you too, generous Loudoun County Library Patron!"
46,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"A friend of mine told me about this book - I never knew that longitude was beyond navigators' collective grasp as late as it was, or that it was monumentally harder to determine than latitude. It's fascinating.Besides the central story of how a self-taught clock-maker, John Harrison, spent his lifetime perfecting a clock accurate and hardy enough to remember Greenwich time on long voyages through various temperatures, the rolling of the sea, and different humidities and barometric pressures, the book explains other ways to determine longitude using the skies (if you can get an accurate reading and the data exists to predict where the moon should be with respect to the sun for 3 hour periods for the length of your voyage, and it's not cloudy).Navigators also were able to determine longitude, theoretically, by observing the moons of Jupiter, whose orbits were easier to predict, but were much harder to see on a rocking boat.So Galileo, who discovered the Jovian moons, gets a couple of cool points here (like he needed any more). In fact, the Jupiter moon method (and every method is about figuring out what time it is in Greenwich right now - if we know when a person in Greenwich would see what we just saw - for example, a moon of Jupiter going behind the planet - we know how far ahead or behind Greenwich we are), while so impractical on ships that navigators on ships had to wait for a good clock (although that took 150 years after the invention of Galileo's method), was great on land, and it's the cause of maps suddenly looking accurate and not grossly distorted east/west-wise just after 1600.Isaac Newton also makes a special appearance (you know, predicting our moon's orbit well).Oh yeah - you also have to see the wonderful clocks this guy made (there are color plates in some editions)- they're steampunk perfection.Anyway, I hope I've conveyed the enthusiasm I feel for this short, but just-right-length, science history."
47,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,4,"Quick, focused history books are underrated, especially when they're as well-written as this one. The subtitle of ""The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time"" sounds hyperbolic, but it's basically true. Sobel's account of how unknown English clockmaker John Harrison solved the longitude problem - how can sailors tell their position at sea in a quick, accurate, and reliable way in order to avoid sinking or mistaking Caribbean islands for India? - takes an underappreciated scientific issue and explains why it's important, why it was so difficult to solve, who the key players were, and why it matters today. While she doesn't wander down every single potential historical avenue or wring all of the scientific/military/political contextual details out, she's able to give the reader plenty of background for further digging, in case you want more details on the vagaries of star-sighting or constructing astronomical tables, the rivalry between Britain and France, or why exactly Nevil Maskelyne was such a jerk to his fellow astronomers and scientists.Plus as a bonus it gives you more to ponder on how best to systematically promote scientific research: the debate over the prize system vs investing more in public universities vs offering R&D tax credits to private companies can seem arcane, but the specific example of a life-and-death situation like the longitude problem makes the tradeoffs of each unusually clear. Scientific research offers a great window into society's priorities, and Sobel's book is an excellent look at an often-overlooked example of progress at its most unexpected. Few of us mostly land-locked folks will ever need to determine the nearest meridian line from a ship at sea in a storm, but it's always worth remembering how we've benefitted from humble experimenters like Harrison, and thinking of ways to encourage his spiritual successors."
48,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21232850-ned,3,"I enjoyed this greatly, and had never quite cogitated on the problems on navigation and how it was done before modern technology. When Great Britain was in the height of its empire, naval navigation depended on rather crude means, where latitude could be measured by the length of days, but longitude was nearly impossible. A prize was offered for a solution to this problem and two competing approaches taken, precise timekeeping and celestial reckoning (i.e. the motions of planets and moon). As a scientist it was fascinating to learn the imperfection of the earth tilting on its axis, and the variations in gravitation pull from the moon - this astronomy was greatly educational to me. Interesting also is the problems of navigation caused horrific ship wrecks and loss of life, as ships foundered on unseen reefs and rocks when they (often) got off course, or the delays caused scurvy and horrible deaths. This was the time when whalers were chasing prey and wars in Europe depended on navigation. Mostly, though, I delighted in the steadfast dedication of a certain carpenter, John Harrison, who spent his life perfecting a timepiece. He competed with the great universities in England, and the attendant politics. Ultimately he was vindicated and his remarkable machines opened the door for where we are today, with atomic clocks, an agreed upon prime meridian, and much of the unseen technology that we take for granted. The author does not seem to be a native English speaker, so perhaps some is lost in translation, but the story is a bit uneven in places. I feel a little guilty giving an average rating, because I learned so much from this book and I appreciate the author for that."
49,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,3,"Old review from 2005.Since my fondest wish is to sail the high seas of the 19th century, I need to learn how to find myself without GPS. I also love this cover: a violent sea dashing ships to splinters, and, from on high, a man, in a wig, with a clock, come to deliver the poor dogs from ignorance. Interesting story, filled with many an odd character. Made me want an olde time pocket watch. I was actually constantly thinking of Hicksville while I was reading this book, and the Captain Cook / Hone Heke scenes in which they are lost at sea on a moving island. It’s strange that the sensation of being lost very often feels like falling out of reality. Even if you don’t know your exact location, you are still at a definable location, but it never seems to feel that way. Imagine a small, ticking watch being your only psychological anchor to the real world. Without it, you become unplottable."
50,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,4,"The key to determining longitude is knowing what time it is compared to a standard time. Not knowing one's longitude was one of the biggest perils to ships for most of history. Astronomers felt that they would have the answer, measuring the orbit of the moon as it traverses the sky. This theory caused the building of observatories and mapping of the stars. However, what do you do when you can't observe the heavens and the seas are choppy.Meausuring time was not considered to be a promising solution. Timepieces of the age were just not that accurate. Plus, metals in the salt air corroded, they needed lubrication, and both the metals and lubricants reacted differently in heat and humidity.Enter one John Harrison, an unschooled woodmaker who invented a clock that used wooden gears and didn't require lubrication. Unfortunately, his ability to express himself was abysmal. That, and the fact that the scientific community of the time favored astronomers caused his theory to languish for decades before being recognized. Fascinating story for the science nerd in me!"
51,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4183137-komet,5,"Dava Sobel ably tells the story of John Harrison's lifelong quest to develop an instrument capable of determining longitude in all climes. In response to a tragic sinking which took place close to the English coast early in the 18th century, owing to the inability of a ship's captain to accurately determine longitude, Parliament offered a monetary prize to anyone who could develop and perfect an instrument to accurately determine longitude. Sobel, in her book, describes the efforts of the scientific community in Britain to develop this instrument and contrasts it with officialdom's long disdain for Harrison's efforts to produce an accurate, all-weather instrument for gauging longitude. This book is a compelling human drama of how a humble person's ingenuity and unwavering dedication to producing the chronometer, ensured a safe and secure way for ships to navigate the seas. Highly recommended. "
52,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1720603-baal-of,4,"A short and entertaining history of the development of a sea-worthy clock which could be used to calculate longitude. Well written, with a story-like narrative, and lots of political intrigue. Yet another book that shows how science can be subverted by ideology, and how wealth and privilege can allow someone to remain in a position of power despite a clear conflict of interest. I would have liked a bit more science, and more detail on the technological innovations that Harrison and other accomplished, but this book was more focused on the history. Still a worthwhile read."

From fixing their location by looking at the stars to finally using a reliable chronometer, sea travel before was an extremely difficult undertaking. The invention of a reliable chronometer enabled world travel and commerce. It, however, also allowed the then Western habit of imperialism and colonialism."

58,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/121987-ainsley,4,It's incredible to think how impossible navigation was before reliable clocks made east-west measurements possible. Great description of one of the most important discoveries of the era.
59,0802714625,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"In the Age of Sail, you went forth backed by the grace of God. With no reliable way to determine your longitude at sea, you were at the mercy of the waves. Rocks and islands could not be accurately found and thousands of sailors both young and old lost their lives. The sea could kill you in dozens of ways, from scuppering on the shore to dying from scurvy. There were ways around that, but they were dangerous themselves. For example, you could take a specific sea lane that always led to the same place, but if pirates took that lane and you were a merchant you could stand to lose all your cargo.Due to the continued problem this presented, the Royal Society or some head of state set forth a prize for anyone able to tackle the longitude problem. Since it was such a massive sum of money, a ton of charlatans came out of the woodwork. For a while it was considered the same sort of problem as Squaring the Circle or developing a Perpetual Motion Machine, even being mentioned as such in Gulliver’s Travels by Johnathan Swift.Longitude by Dava Sobel is the story of how the Longitude Problem was tackled by a self-taught mechanical genius named John Harrison. While the scientific luminaries of the day thought of using the stars or some other astronomical solution, Harrison felt that he could produce a clock capable of meeting the required specifications. He certainly had his work cut out for him though. On a ship, you have to deal with the waves and the rocking of the boat so Pendulum Clocks are out. Along with that issue are the humidity and the heat encountered while sailing. The differences in temperature make it so that ordinary clocks lose accuracy.Harrison’s solution was to make a mechanical watch that he called a Chronometer. He made four of them, with the fourth one eventually winning the prize money. I say eventually because the Astronomers responsible for a different kind of solution didn’t want to admit that a clock won. Even after it won, the Chronometer was eventually neglected so that it had to be cleaned in the 1930s.This book was really well done and interesting. I had heard of part of this story before, but Sobel really goes into what happened with vivid detail. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
