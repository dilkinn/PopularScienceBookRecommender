0,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174974-matt-kosinski,2,"Here's Blink in a nutshell:Split decisions can be good; better than decisions where we take a lot of time to carefully weigh our options and use scientific evidence. Except when they're not.Rapid cognition is an exciting and powerful way to use your brain's quick, intuitive capabilities to make stunningly accurate decisions, and can even lead you to have better success in sports, business and politics. Except when it won't.We should learn to trust our snap judgments, even in seemingly complex situations where we don't have a lot of information.Except not really.Basically the book gives scientific and anecdotal evidence on why rapid cognition can be both a good and bad thing, without offering us much advise on how to tell the difference between situations where we should or shouldn't trust our instincts. There are many times when I felt that Gladwell contradicted himself. To support his ""rapid cognition is good"" section of the book, he uses an example of a psychological test where students were able to tell whether or not a professor was good at their job by simply watching a 5 second clip of them lecturing with the sound turned off. The results basically corresponded with impressions given by other students who spent an entire class with those professors - thus proving that there is some mysterious and powerful part of our subconscious that can make accurate snap judgments.But then later on in the book, in the ""rapid cognition is bad"" section, Gladwell warns us that, in general, people instantly like tall, attractive white people better than short, unattractive minorities.WELL DUH! OBVIOUSLY THE STUDENTS RATING THE PROFESSORS WERE BIASED BY WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE TALL, WHITE, OR ATTRACTIVE! Mystery solved!While Gladwell brings up some interesting concepts, his book never gels into a coherent whole. I read most of it in under a day and already my rapid cognition is telling me it's not worth finishing."

Such is the case for Blink. This is especially annoying to me, because the book describes my area of research specialization. If you're interested in a fun read, Gladwell is certainly an engaging author. If you're looking for something that accurately describes the research, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. For example, Scott Plous's ""the psychology of judgment and decision making"" (which, despite the title, is not textbook like), or the Heath brothers' ""Made to stick"". "

Blink
 is- what all the stories, case studies, and arguments add up to- an attempt to understand the magical and mysterious thing called Judgement. Its basic premise is: split second decisions (snap judgements); how they can be good and bad. Gladwell suggests split-seconds decisions are better than the decisions where we take considerable time to weigh our choices and options. He points out that our mind figure things, people, et al. in a blink of an eye. And it is often that these snap judgements are much more trustworthy than judgements arrived at rationally. But he does not stop here and goes on further: snap judgements can be misleading, too; he termed it Warren Harding error. He suggested that there are some instinctive processes that prevent us to see clearly; and hence cloud our judgements. Blink is an interesting read. It is very well written, and at the same time engages your attention from the start. And writing is reader friendly, perfectly suitable for a layman..................................................I bought this book because I was intrigued by the subtitle of the book: The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking. This subtitle was something Zen like, I felt. And when I read it initially, three years ago, I found it resembling with Zen teachings (and koans). Following are two quotes that mainly convey the spirit: ""They were so focused on the mechanics and the process that they never looked at the problem holistically. In the act of tearing something apart, you lose its meaning.""""When making a decision of minor importance its advantageous to consider all the pros and cons. In vital matters, however, such as the choice of a mate or a profession, the decision should come from the unconscious, from somewhere within ourselves. In the important decisions of personal life , we should be governed by the deep inner needs of our nature."""
3,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/546634-ashley,5,"I would put this book in the category of ""Freakonomics"" and ""The Tipping Point."" By the same author as the latter title, Malcolm Gladwell, the purpose of this book is to weigh the advantages as well as the disadvantages of the power of the mind's ability to unconsciously leap to conclusions based on what is seen in the proverbial blink of an eye. While I have read some negative reviews of Gladwell's book, mostly citing that he fails to inform the reader how to know when to go with your gut and when not to, as well as arguments that he urges readers not to follow their gut when the gut instincts are politically incorrect, I have to disagree with many of them. I think that Gladwell's objective in ""Blink"" is to make the reader simply aware of their gut instincts and to urge them to consider trusting it more frequently than we do. People tend to make decisions that are supported by a litany of rationalizations and explanations, but do we always really have reasons for why we do or think what we do? Gladwell is arguing that we don’t, and that sometimes it takes the unconscious mind to make those decisions for us. On the flip side, he also argues that sometimes we unconsciously make negative decisions based on that same quick judgment and our predetermined stereotypes, such as with people of other sexes or other races than ourselves. “Blink” was a very complicated book with many facets and it’s hard to explain all of them or review them all without writing an essay. In the end, I think the main goal isn’t perfect knowledge of the subject of thinking without thinking, but rather consideration of it and how it can benefit us or hinder us both individually and as a society."
4,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186516-margaret-ross,3,"I think this book wins my prize for Most Easily Misinterpreted to Serve Personal Agendas. Gladwell gets so into the interesting details of the case he's building, he really doesn't emphasize the final conclusions of the book at all, leaving people to think that the interesting details are the whole point, which is unfortunate. But then again, I'm not 100% sure I got the whole point.Most of the folks I know think that this book is about how a person's gut instincts can be a better read of a situation than a read based on thorough study. Which is an idea that most people love, since they don't want to have to do all that boring study anyhow. What's missing from that analysis is that Gladwell later insists (but only at the very end of the book, and almost in passing) that it's the thorough active training and study of a subject that allow a person to have ""true"" or ""correct"" gut reads. The guy who can tell who's getting divorced after 60 seconds of hearing them talk spent years coding verbal and physical cues in couples, studying them intensely for years before he was able to give his 60 second analysis. The art historians were drawing on a vast body of knowledge when they made their judgment about the statue. The cop who read fear instead of aggression and didn't shoot couldn't name what he was seeing, but he'd seen it before. Then he also says that our gut reactions can be easily colored by training we don't even know is there- our prejudices, whether unknown or unacknowledged- influence or reads of a situation as well.Ultimately, I saw this book as a reaction to and analysis of the Amadou Diallo killing in 1999, with some tips for how to avoid such future tragedies. In that light, I thought it was interesting and even constructive, but only if you pay close attention to the last chapter. "

The book begins with the story of the Getty Kouros (Archaic Greek sculptors reduced human anatomy and musculature in these statues to decorative patterning on the surface of the marble.), which was a statue brought to the J. Paul Getty Museum in California. It was thought by many experts to be legitimate, but when others first looked at it, their initial responses were skeptical. For example, George Despinis, head of the Acropolis Museum in Athens, said ""Anyone who has ever seen a sculpture coming out of the ground could tell that thing has never been in the ground"".عنوانها:

عنوانهای دیگر که آن بالا نگاشته ام، عنوانهای برگزیده شده ی مترجمین تنها یک کتاب هستند؛ کتابی درباره ی این‌که، چگونه بدون اندیشیدن میاندیشیم، درباره تصمیم‌هایی ست که در یک لحظه گرفته می‌شوند ــ در یک چشم به‌ هم زدن ــ و همه این‌ها به آن سادگی‌ها که به‌ دیده می‌آیند نیستند؛ چرا برخی از افراد، تصمیم‌ گیرهای والایی هستند، در حالی‌که برخی دیگر ناتوانند؟ چرا برخی پیرو غرایزشان هستند، و برنده می‌شوند، در حالی‌که عده‌ ای دیگر، در اشتباه، دست‌ و پا می‌زنند؟ مغز ما واقعا در اداره، در کلاس، در آشپزخانه، و در خانه، چگونه کار می‌کند؟ و چرا اغلب بهترین تصمیمات، آن‌هایی هستند که توضیحشان برای دیگران، ناممکن است؟ در کتاب «یک نگاه» با روان‌شناسی آشنا می‌شویم، که می‌داند چطور با مشاهده ی چند دقیقه‌ ای صحبت زوج‌ها، طول زندگی زناشویی آن‌ها را، پیش‌بینی کند؛ مربی تنیسی، که می‌داند پیش از اصابت راکت با توپ، آیا بازیکن خطا می‌کند یا خیر؛ متخصصان عتیقه‌ شناسی، که با یک نگاه، اصل یا تقلبی بودن شی‌ء را، تشخیص می‌دهند؛ هم‌چنین شکست‌های بزرگ قضاوت در یک نگاه نیز در این کتاب شرح داده می‌شوند: انتخاب «وارن

بلکه کسانی هستند که هنر تمام عیار «برش نازک» را دارند، یعنی از بین انواع وسژگیهای مربوط به یک مسئله، اصلی‌ترین آن‌ها را جدا می‌کنندنقل نمونه متن: «پیش درآمد: مجسمه ای که اصل نبود؛ در سپتامبر 1983میلادی، یک دلال آثار هنری به نام جیان فرانکو به چینا به موزه پاول گتی کالیفرنیا مراجعه کرد؛ او ادعا میکرد مجسمه مرمرینی در اختیار دارد که متعلق به شش قرن پیش از میلاد است؛ این مجسمه معروف به کورس بود ـ مجسمه ای از یک مرد جوان برهنه ایستاده با دستانی از دوطرف آویخته و پای چپ جلو نهاده؛ تا آن زمان در حدود دویست مجسمه کورسی از حفاریهای باستانشناسی یا گورهای قدیمی به دست آمده بود که اغلب آنها در هنگام اکتشاف یا متلاشی شده بودند و یا بدجوری آسیب دیده بودند، اما این یکی تقریبا سالم مانده بود؛ ارتفاع این مجسمه نزدیک به دومتر و بیست و پنج سانتیمتر بود و شفافیتی داشت که آن را از بقیه مجسمه های اکتشافی متمایز میکرد؛ این یک کشف خارق العاده بود و مبلغ پیشنهادی به چینا زیر ده میلیون دلار بود؛ موزه گتی با احتیاط وارد عمل شد؛ مجسمه کورس را به امانت گرفت و تحقیق دقیقی را شروع کرد؛ آیا مجسمه با بقیه مجسمه های کورسی همخوانی داشت؟ جواب به ظاهر آری بود؛ شیوه ی ساخت آن به نظر مشابه مجسمه کورس آناویسوس در موزه ملی باستان شناسی آتن بود، و معنایش این بود که با زمان و مکان خاصی مطابقت داشت؛ این مجسمه از کجا و چه زمانی پیدا شده بود؟ هیچکس به طور دقیق نمیدانست؛ اما به چینا مدارکی به اداره حقوقی موزه گتی ارائه داد که حاوی تاریخچه اخیر آن بود؛ طبق مدارک موجود، کورس از سال 1930میلادی در کلکسیون خصوصی یک پزشک سوییسی به نام لوفن برگر نگهداری میشد، که خود او نیز آن را از دلال معروف آثار هنری یونانی به نام روسس خریده بود؛ برای بررسیهای دقیق، زمین شناسی به نام استنلی مارگولیس از دانشگاه کالیفرنیا به موزه آمد و به مدت دو روز سطح مجسمه را با یک استریو میکروسکوپ بسیار حساس مورد آزمایش قرار داد و بعد از زیر زانوی راست مجسمه تکه ای به قطر یک سانتیمتر و طول دو سانتیمتر جدا کرد و با استفاده از میکروسکوپ الکترونی، اشعه انکساری ایکس و اشعه فلورسنسی ایکس به تجزیه آن پرداختمارگولیس به این نتیجه رسید که مجسمه از سنگ مرمر دُلومیت معدن قدیمی کیپ وتی در جزیره تاسوس ساخته شده، و سطح مجسمه با لایه نازکی از کربنات آهک پوشیده شده است ــ که به گفته وی از اهمیت خاصی برخوردار بود ــ زیرا دُلومیت تنها در طول قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها میتواند تبدیل به کربنات آهک شود؛ به عبارت دیگر مجسمه شیئی قدیمی بود و تقلبی نبودموزه گتی از این مسئله خشنود بود، و چهارده ماه پس از شروع تحقیقات با خریدن مجسمه موافقت شد؛ در پاییز 1986میلادی مجسمه برای اولین بار به نمایش گذاشته شد؛ نیویورک تایمز حکایت آنرا در صفحه ی اول خود آورد؛ چند ماه بعد متصدی اموال عتیقه ی موزه، ماریون ترو، گزارشی پرشور و بلندبالا از دستیابی موزه به مجسمه، برای مجله برلینگتون نوشت: «اکنون کورس با قامتی برافراشته و دستانی مشت شده حیات مطمئن خویش را که برترین خصلت او و برادرانش است ابراز میکند.» و سپس پیروزمندانه نتیجه گیری کرد: «او چه خدا باشد و چه انسان تجسم کامل نیروی تابناک بلوغ هنری غرب است.»؛ با تمام این احوال مشکلی وجود داشت؛ مجسمه به نظر اصل نمیآمد، اولین کسیکه به این مشکل اشاره کرد، فردی بود به نام فدریکو زِری، مورخ هنرشناس ایتالیایی، که عضو هیئت امنای موزه نیز بود؛ وقتی «زِری» در دسامبر 1983میلادی به محل نگهداری مجسمه رفت، تا آن را ببیند، بی اختیار به ناخنهای آن خیره شد؛ البته نمیخواست توضیحی برای این مسئله بدهد، اما به نظرش یک جای کار ایراد داشت؛ نفر بعدی «اِوِلین هریسون»، یکی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی بود، که هنگام معامله نهایی، در «لس آنجلس» بود؛ او چنین به خاطر میآورد: آن زمان آرتور هافتن متصدی موزه بود، و ما را برای بازدید برد؛ او با یک حرکت پارچه روی مجسمه را پس زد و گفت، «خُب، این هنوز مال ما نیست اما تا چند هفته دیگر خواهد شد.»؛ و من گفتم: «خیلی متاسفم که این را میشنوم.»، هریسون چه دیده بود؟ خودش نمیداند؛ در همان لحظه اول، وقتی «هافتن» پارچه را کنار زده بود، آنچه «هریسون» حس کرده بود، یک الهام بود، یک احساس غریزی از اینکه چیزی آن وسط اشکال داشت؛چند ماه بعد «هافتن»، «تامس هاوینگ» مدیر سابق موزه «متروپولتین» را برای بازدید از مجسمه، به کارگاه مرمّت موزه برد؛ «هاوینگ» همیشه اولین کلمه ای را که با دیدن چیزی از ذهنش میگذرد یادداشت میکند؛ و هرگز فراموش نمیکند اولین کلمه ای که با دیدن «کورس» از ذهنش گذشت چه بود؛هاوینگ میگوید: «آن کلمه «تازه» بود ــ «تازه»، و «تازه» برای مجسمه ای که دوهزار سال قدمت دارد کلمه مناسبی نیست.»؛ «هاوینگ» بعدها که راجع به آن لحظه فکر کرد، فهمید چرا چنین کلمه ای به ذهنش خطور کرده بود: «من در سیسیلی حفاری کرده بودم، جاییکه تکه ها و قطعاتی از این دست پیدا میشوند، اما این یکی به هیچ کدام شبیه نبود؛ به نظر میرسید این مجسمه کورس از توی یکی از همین قوطیهای قهوه مرغوب استارباکس بیرون آمده باشد!» «هاوینگ» رو به «هافتن» پرسید، «آیا برای آن پولی هم پرداخته اید؟» و وقتی با چهره متعجب هافتن مواجه شد، گفت، «اگر پرداخته اید سعی کنید پس بگیرید و معامله را فسخ کنید.»؛ مسئولان موزه «گتی» کم کم داشتند نگران میشدند، بنابراین سمپوزیوم ویژه ای در مورد کورس در یونان برپا کردند؛ مجسمه را بسته بندی کردند و به یونان فرستادند، و از متخصصان ارشد مجسمه شناسی دعوت کردند؛ اینبار زمزمه یاس و دلهره بلندتر به گوش میرسید؛ «هریسون» در کنار مردی ایستاده بود که نامش «جرج دِس پینیس» بود، و رئیس موزه «آرکوپولیس آتن»؛ «جرج دس پینیس» نگاهی به کورس انداخت و رنگش پرید؛ او رو به هریسون گفت: «هر کس یکبار در عمرش مجسمه ای را که از دل خاک بیرون کشیده شده، دیده باشد میتواند تشخیص دهد، این یکی زیرزمین نبوده است.» «جورجیوس دانتاس»، رئیس جمعیت باستانشناسی آتن، به محض اینکه مجسمه را دید تنش یخ کرد؛ او گفت: «وقتی برای اولین بار کورس را دیدم احساس کردم انگار شیشه ای بین من و مجسمه کشیده شده است.»؛در سمپوزیوم، «آنجلوس دِلی وریاس» مدیر موزه «بناکی آتن» نیز گفته های «دانتاس» را تایید کرد؛ او به تفصیل از تناقض بین سبک ساخت مجسمه، و این واقعیت که مرمر آن از معادن تاسوس استخراج شده است، صحبت کرد، و سپس به اصل مطلب رسید؛ چرا او فکر میکرد که مجسمه تقلبی است؟ زیرا وقتی برای اولین بار به آن نگاه انداخته بود موجی از ادراک و دافعه ی حسی در او برانگیخته شده بود؛ زمانیکه سمپوزیوم به پایان رسید در بین اکثر مدعوین این اتفاق نظر وجود داشت، که کورس ابدا آن چیزی نیست که تصور میشدموزه گتی با تمامی متخصصان و وکلای خود و ماهها بررسی دقیق به یک نتیجه رسیده بود، و برخی از برجسته ترین متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی ــ تنها با یک نگاه و احساس دافعه حسی ــ به نتیجه ای دیگر؛ حق با کدام یک بود؟ برای مدتی هیچ چیز مشخص نبود؛ کورس تبدیل به مسئله ای شده بود که متخصصان هنری در کنفرانسهای مختلف بر سر آن بحث و جدل میکردند؛ اما بعد، اندک اندک، ابهامات ماجرای گتی شروع به روشن شدن نمود؛ برای مثال نامه هایی که وکلای گتی به دقت پیگیری کرده بودند و مشخص میکرد که کورس متعلق به یک پزشک سوییسی بوده، جعلی از آب درآمد؛ یکی از نامه هایی که به تاریخ 1952میلادی بود دارای یک کدپستی بود، که تا بیست سال پس از آن تاریخ هنوز وجود خارجی نداشت؛ نامه دیگری که تاریخ 1955میلادی را داشت، به یک حساب بانکی اشاره داشت، که تا تاریخ 1963میلادی هنوز افتتاح نشده بود؛ در اصل نتیجه ی ماهها تحقیق فقط این شد که کورس موزه گتی همان سبک مجسمه آناویسوس را داشت، اما این نتیجه گیری نیز مورد شک بود؛هرچه متخصصان مجسمه های یونانی دقیقتر به آن نگاه میکردند بیشتر به التقاطی بودن آن پی میبردند؛ هر قسمت از اندام مجسمه مربوط به زمان و مکان متفاوتی بود؛ اندام باریک مرد جوان بیشتر شبیه کورس تنه آ بود که در موزه مونیخ نگهداری میشد، و موهای خوش حالتش شبیه کورس موزه متروپولتین نیویورک؛ و در این بین پاهایش چیزی نبودند جز هنر مدرن، از قضا این مجسمه از همه بیشتر شبیه مجسمه شکسته و کوچکتری بود که در سال 1990میلادی، توسط یک هنرشناس بریتانیایی در سوییس پیدا شده بود؛ هر دو مجسمه از یک سنگ مرمر مشابه و با یک سبک تراشیده شده بود؛ اما کورس سوییسی متعلق به گذشته نبود، بلکه در اوایل دهه هشتاد در کارگاهی در رم ساخته شده بود؛ پس تحقیقات علمی که مشخص میکرد سطح مجسمه کورس تنها پس از قرنها و بلکه هزاره ها میتواند به چنین شکلی درآید چه؟ خوب آن نتایج همچندان قطعی نبودند؛ طبق آزمایشها و بررسیهای بعدی زمینشناس دیگری به این نتیجه رسید، که با استفاده از کپک سیب زمینی، میتوان در عرض چند ماه سطح مجسمه مرمر دلومیتی را به شکل کهنه و قدیمی درآورد؛ در کاتالوگ موزه گتی تصویری از مجسمه کورس چاپ شده که زیر آن نوشته شده «حدود ۵۳۰سال قبل از میلاد، یا، مدرن جعلی.»؛ زمانیکه «فدریکو زری» و «اِوِلین هریسون» و «تامس هاوینگ» و «جورجیوس دانتاس» ــ و خیلیهای دیگر ــ با یک نگاه به مجسمه دچار دافعه حسی شدند مطمئنا حق داشتند؛ آنها در همان دو ثانیه اول ـ در یک نگاه ـ به شناختی از ماهیت مجسمه دست یافتند که تیم تخصصی موزه گتی پس از چهارده ماه تحقیق هنوز به آن نرسیده بود؛ یک نگاه کتابی است درباره ی همان دو ثانیه نخست.»؛ پایان نقلا. شربیانی"
6,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"O, to have the writing career of Malcolm Gladwell. The man pulls interesting case studies from academic research and news headlines, spins it into a book under a general theme, and blammo! He has a bestseller. This formula worked for him with The Tipping Point and then Blink. Blink is a compelling read, despite its weak overall theme, which is that sometimes split-second decisions are good and sometimes they're bad, and we need to learn when to trust our first impressions and when to discount them (except there's no real way to make that distinction). The book is a pleasure to read simply because of its case studies. Gladwell throws in so many topics — art, politics, marriage, consumer testing, athletes, war, police shootings, music — that there is bound to be something engaging for everyone. (After reading another one of Gladwell's peppy articles in The New Yorker, my husband joked, ""Gladwell thinks he can make ANYTHING seem interesting."")After finishing Blink, I feel like I've learned something important, but I'm not sure exactly what, other than that Gladwell has a very charmed career.My rating: 3.5 stars rounded up to 4"
7,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,3,"This was a big best-seller for Gladwell. He posits that much of the time we make decisions, reach conclusions in a sort of pre-conscious manner that he calls “thin-slicing.” That means taking a very small sample, a thin slice, and making a decision immediately based on that information. However, it is the case that the ability to evaluate that slice is fed by a lifetime of experience. It is not simply, as some, including President Bush the second, might believe, that using one’s gut, in the absence of years and years of preparation, is as valid a way of reaching decisions as taking the longer route of careful analysis of available data. No, no, no."
8,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,4,"I generally distrust anyone who says that they ‘go-with-their-gut’. But when the company I work for announced a major decision a few years back, I instantly said, “This is going to be a huge mistake.” Smart people had examined the deal backwards and forwards for months and thought it was a great idea. I had a bad feeling about it that I could only later explain, and I was far from the only one. And we were right. The entire thing turned out to be a huge disaster. I kept thinking about that incident when I read Blink. The book has a pretty obvious point. People make snap decisions that they can’t consciously explain. Sometimes these decisions are correct and amazing based on the limited amount of information available. Art experts who instantly know a statue is fake despite scientific tests indicating otherwise. A fireman who appears to be fighting a routine small fire suddenly orders his men out without really knowing why and the floor collapses a second later. And sometimes these decisions can be wrong and have tragic consequences. Four cops think a guy has a gun when he’s pulling his wallet out and shoot him multiple times.We’ve all made quick decisions and later been amazed at how good or bad they turned out, but what makes Blink interesting is that Gladwell does some examination of the science behind how we arrive at these conclusions, and his thoughts on how the data we’re processing can either give us incredible insight or lead us horribly wrong.Thankfully, Gladwell is not making an argument against logical thinking or analyzing a problem. What he is doing is pointing out that instinct or intuition can be a powerful tool IF the people involved have trained themselves to make good decisions, and if we know when to trust it. He’s got a lot of great examples of doctors, military officers and police officers who often have to make life-or-death decisions in a matter of seconds with limited information. They have to trust their instincts, and Gladwell makes some common sense points that the right kind of training and education can make a huge difference. He contrasts the story of the four New York cops who killed the guy with a wallet versus a patrolman who did not fire on someone who actually had a gun but was attempting to surrender it.What made this book fun to read was the variety of examples that Gladwell uses and the scientific research done with them. Art dealers, doctors, marriage counselors, cops, military officers, car salesmen, a tennis coach, and classical musicians are all used as examples of the strengths and weaknesses of snap decisions. There’s also some simple experiments included that let you play along at home. This is a book that will make you think about the way you think."
9,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/344817-mackenzie,2,"so i bought this book in boston's logan airport about 10 minutes before i had to board a flight to seattle. the bookstore was limited; i didn't want to have to work to get interested. and the first 100 pages or so did the trick... until i realized that gladwell wasn't so much building an argument as telling stories about a certain topic. don't get me wrong, i finished the book. later. back in boston, on the T. and it did cover some interesting studies, or i wouldn't have done so. but i suspect the author might've lacked the attention span necessary to lend this book any coherence. meh. it was basically a series of loosely related tidbits about snap-judgments, none of which led me to conclude that instinct or intuition is significantly more or less reliable than rational deliberation. if a point could be gleaned and summarized, i guess it would be that with the right thin-slice of information, under the right conditions, instantaneous judgements can be spot-on. shrug. the best i can say about this book is that there were a couple of well-set-up digs at the bush administration and i discovered the music of kenna, who's pretty cool. i also learned that when my girlfriend's eyes get even a little wider, it means she's angry."
10,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1805180-seak,4,"Much like the reason behind my majoring in Economics, I like Gladwell because he opens my mind to new ideas and new ways to think. Much like Economics, I believe he's far from perfect, but I really enjoy viewing the world through his lens. In just about anything, when people start acting as if there is only one way to do something, I stop listening to them. This goes for many things, but especially politics. If you DO, however, find someone who is omniscient and knows exactly how every policy will turn out in the end, please let me know. I may listen to their one way of seeing the world. Otherwise ...What I got from Blink is that there is a lot to our instant thoughts and feelings and many times much more than we give them credit. The traditional wisdom is to plan and make huge weighty decisions based on every single bit of information that we have at our fingertips (which is just about everything, google!). This is actually a big reason my wife and I get into ... disagreements (we'll go with that). She likes to plan everything down to the last detail and I like to be a bit more relaxed.So it would seem that this book is a big proponent of my way of doing things, but it turns out it's not so much.We should trust our gut-instinct, says Blink, if we have many hours of experience in said realm of understanding because we have developed the skills to make sense of those small details and because we have the ability to ""thin slice."" Gladwell also makes the point that not always can we trust our gut-intinct, however, because our gut-instinct tends to be racist, even when we are not in fact consciously racist. Also, our instincts can get overwhelmed by heightened arousal, such as when people can't even dial 911 in an emergency because their senses are overloaded.But then again, you can practice and have these types of unconscious reactions mitigated.The interesting story-telling style of introducing these topics is, of course, what really gets me. It's the stories that are often unbelievable that have me clamoring for more, just like in Outliers (although I think Outliers was a little better written) and I would assume his other books. He goes into why The Getty art museum spent millions on a fake kouros (Greek statue) and why cops probably aren't racial profiling when they beat people like Rodney King, but because of a few key mistakes such as allowing their unconscious to get overwhelmed and also because they were a group of officers instead of just one.He talks about people who can listen to a couple and tell when they should start talking to their lawyers and people who have developed the actual abilities that are shown in the TV show ""Lie to Me."" How looking at a person's room for 5 minutes may give a complete stranger a better picture of a person than a good friend. I've always loved these types of explanations for things. There's the old wisdom we have and the wisdom we assume when we don't have any other way to describe a particular event and which is completely wrong. I love thinking new ideas, even when it's old news and that's why I'll keep coming back to Gladwell."
11,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"Elsewhere, in one of my other recent reviews, a GoodReads friend (Richard) told me that he had become less infatuated with this book after reading a review by a specialist in the field who gave it a drubbing. I was worried that knowing this might ruin this book for me – but it has not. I really enjoyed this one too. This is the third of Gladwell’s books I’ve read in quick succession and this contained lots of information about things that have made me think and sparked my interest to learn more. It may well be that Gladwell’s style does not appeal to an expert in the field – and that is quite likely to be true, but I’ve found that it is often the case that I’ve been introduced to themes by popularisers and later went on to read more deeply on a subject. I rarely condemn those who introduce me to fascinating topics – and this is a fascinating topic.I’m not going to do a full review, but rather quickly talk about wine. While he was talking about coke and about taste tests I was thinking about wine. He makes the point that when asked to judge jam people do nearly as well as the experts if they are just asked which jam they liked the most, but do much worse than experts if asked to explain why they graded them in the order that they did. That is, if they have to talk about texture and sweetness and citrus flavours – people change how they judge jam and end up picking the worst jam rather than the best. This is because we don’t really know what ‘texture’ is and so trying to slot jams into categories that we don’t really understand means we are most likely to stuff up and confuse ourselves. Now, wine. I wonder if anyone has ever done a test at cellar doors to see what people end up buying and if they pick the nicest wine for the price, or do they buy vinegar instead? I wouldn’t mind betting that there would be something similar happening here – and if you are with someone who says things like, “Oh yes, fruity, but with a back-taste of coal tar” you might end up buying something that is quite disgusting. You know, unless you actually have some idea of what you are talking about, it might be best to shut up and drink the wine.That is the point of this book – learning when to trust your “immediate reactions” and when to question them. I think there is much in this book that is worth knowing and much that is fascinatingly interesting. (The stuff about unconscious racism is so important that everyone should be forced to read this for that alone). But with Richard, I am a little concerned that an expert in the field didn't like this book. All the same, the expert does recommend Made to Stick so I guess that can be the next book I read.There is – as is proven by Dylan Moran – only one way to pick wine:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2gGf..."
12,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49521790-ayse,4,"I reread this after realizing I couldn't remember enough to compare with Kahneman`s book. They are mostly aligning, only Kahneman suggests against making snap judgements and relying more on evidence whereas Gladwell gives views from both sides and stays impartial.Blink is about unconscious decision making. Our unconscious side is fascinating, because it seems to be the one that holds the strings most of the time; making very fast decisions, watching out for any threat to our existence. However when our drives (the motivators of unconscious) are in conflict, ourrational mind is quick to get in. The rational mind is also there to make corrections, and making plans. So it seems that mostly we are on autopilot for unimportant things, and also when we have to do something at lightening speed. But at other times even if there is an urge to act instinctively, one should act relying on data rather than on instinct."

While I enjoyed The Tipping Point more, I have to say that I am happy to have read this after that particular chapter. This is not to say it's the only one I found interesting, because at least one other one was quite fascinating for me.I do plan to read more books by Gladwell in the future."
15,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1090620-ed,2,"I didn't learn much from this book that I did not already know. I am beginning to suspect that Malcolm Gladwell is not writing books that uncover valuable facts that we should know, but rather is writing books that restate facts we already know but in an interesting way.I like his anecdotal stories very much which is why I finished the book - hoping for more stories. When he lays out the facts, though, his writing is no more interesting than any other scientific author. So, in summary, what we have is a talented writer making certain scientific findings available to a much wider audience than usual. Bravo! However if you want to learn something new, this book or his previous effort, The Tipping Point, is not where to go to find it. I imagine, if I read it, I will find The Outliers, his latest effort, to be similarly constructed.Blink's content is easily summarized. First impressions are often more accurate than conclusions arrived at after much study and analysis. Be careful, though, because first impressions can be troublesome because of people's prejudices. Got it in 254 pages. He does come up with an interesting term, ""thin slicing"", to describe the process of taking in a first impression. Maybe learning that term made reading the whole book worthwhile. Maybe."
16,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"A really great study on how important the first few seconds of anything can be, in any particular situation. Be it that you're an art expert who instantly knows an object is fake, or a police man who thinks that the victim is pulling a gun out of their pocket rather than a wallet, it's very clear that human beings do have this constant auto-pilot running, an unconscious ""survival mode"" that gives us most of the clues we might need in the ""blink"" of an eye, and sometimes those clues might be wrong."
17,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,4,"Gladwell continues his exploration of counter-intuitive ideas about decision-making in BLINK! He opens with a 1983 incident at the J. Paul Getty Museum. The Museum acquired a rare statue from the Greek archaic period. To this day, the Museum maintains that the authenticity of the statue is uncertain. At the time, however, the Museum was certain enough to acquire the piece for just under $10 million. Documentation, and scientific analysis had been relied on as support. However, numerous experts including Metropolitan Museum of Art director Thomas Hoving pronounced it a fake. It was an intuitive pronouncement which presaged problems later uncovered with both the documentation and scientific analysis. This is the first of many stories Gladwell uses to illustrate how an intuitive reaction can trump logic and analysis.Among the factors that cloud logic is something he calls the adaptive unconscious. It's an unrecognized emotional bias. In the Getty example, the officials wanted the piece to be authentic. It would have been a spectacular acquisition for a newly established museum. This desire diverted critical scrutiny of the supporting evidence. Such an adaptation need not even be emotion based. In an explanation of priming, Gladwell cites psychological studies that illustrate the subconscious effect of pre-conditioning through word lists. Extrapolating from these examples, one might conclude that the casual reader will be highly influenced when reviewing a book by his mood or even surroundings at the time of reading.Gladwell explores other impediments to logical thinking, logic being a type of perceptual filter. Face recognition, he points out, occurs in a completely different part of the brain, and is an integrated reaction as opposed to the kind of multi-step processing that occurs in dealing with language. Athletic and musical achievement rely on these non-verbal neural processes. His own example cites Paul Van Ripper's success against a team backed by the Pentagon's most sophisticated computers in a war games exercise. The Pentagon team was actually hampered in their decision making by information overload. Initial reaction, Gladwell points out is not always accurate. He tries to explore this downside as well by citing studies on bias. Gladwell is an entertaining storyteller as well as an energetic researcher. He draws examples from market research, Chancellorsville in the Civil War, the assessment of heart attacks at Cook County Hospital, speed dating, fire fighting, the auditioning of professional musicians, and the Diallo Incident in the Bronx to illustrate his points. By drawing from such a wide variety of experience, he insures the interest of a broad audience in this book. NOTE: It's always fun to re-encounter characters from other books. I knew of Thomas Hoving from his book, KING OF THE CONFESSORS. The idea of thin-slice thinking was also explored in HOW WE DECIDE, by Jonah Lehrer. The deconstruction of flavor is discussed from a neurophysiological standpoint in Gordon Shepherd's NEUROGASTRONOMY. "

19,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,2,"I was really expecting more from this book. I've heard mostly good things about Gladwell, and he had a pretty interesting TED talk, and I enjoy almost anything to do with the brain, so...why not?The book certainly brought up a lot of interesting ideas and did a good job of discussing the different elements that go into the snap decisions that we make every day. And it's probably worth a read for many of the stories and experiments related. But for the most part this book really failed to impress. More than that though, it failed at being a coherent analysis of what goes on in the human brain when we make snap judgments. Gladwell alternates between telling us to trust and accept this ""mysterious phenomena"" that allows us to make these unconscious snap judgments and warning us against the use of these snap judgments. One moment he advises against the idea that we need to slowly collect data and weigh options to make the most informed opinion and provides examples where too much thinking and information leads us astray, and in the next moment gives us examples of how snap judgments sometimes go horribly wrong. And he leaves us with no clear sense of how to use this new found information to make better decisions and judgments in our own lives. Do I trust my insights because my rational brain will fool me, or do I mistrust my instincts because of the inherent bias contained within them? If Gladwell knows he sure didn't tell me.One example of somewhere where I think he didn't analyze the situation enough was when he talked about the Wisconsin Card Sorting task (pick cards from one of two decks, one deck tends towards bad and the other towards good outcomes). He focused solely on how the unconscious mind was aware of the pattern (which deck was bad and which was good) long before the conscious mind was aware of it when making decisions. And this was shown by the fact that sweating occurred when choosing from the ""bad"" deck before the subject knew why (or was even aware of it). What he fails to mention about all this is that the reason for this is because we are designed to be ""risk averse"". It is not because we are making brilliant snap judgments, or that our brains have ""learned"" the rules before we are aware of it. From an evolutionary perspective it pays off more to learn from our mistakes than learn from our victories. Mistakes are costly. This is why bad memories are more salient than happy ones. The sweating that occurs is a physiological indicator of and means of prompting the organism to stay away. It's not even that this explanation is in contradiction to Gladwell's; it is that it IS an explanation for the phenomena Gladwell describes, one easily at Gladwells' disposal. Two other aspects of this book stuck out as major frustrations for me:1) Gladwell spends a lot of time early on talking about the mysterious nature of our ability to thin slice (make accurate snap judgments based on very little information) and urges us to accept this. To his credit, he does attempt to demystify this somewhat later on, but not enough in my opinion. His first example is of a museum that purchased an expensive sculpture which all the data and scientists evaluated as legitimate, but which experts in the field immediately saw as a fake without being able to put into words why. It's purposefully misleading to label this as some sort of mysterious phenomena. For instance, it's important to remember that these people were experts. An amateur would not and could not make this same snap judgment because they don't have the training to. This ability didn't magically appear, it came from learning and training and synaptic change. These experts learned over time. They studied types of stone, and different styles, and everything else that goes into understanding their field. And this process created memories...synaptic change within their brains. And there exists a system (or systems) in the brain that can make decisions based on that neuronal structure without conscious awareness. Shortcuts so to speak. But these shortcuts are a product of that neuronal structure, which is a product of that synaptic change, which is a product of the learning the individual did over time. It's misleading to call this mysterious. What's important, and more interesting in my opinion, is figuring out the underlying processes that allow this to happen. 2) Towards the end of the book Gladwell discusses how our stress response leads us to make all sorts of bad decisions. He talks about autism and how autistic people can't mind read (don't have theories of other minds) and how this affects their interpretation of events around them and of the world in general. He compares what happens to people in stressful situations to this, that during these situations, because the fight or flight response has taken over, people have tunnel vision and can no longer ""read minds"" and thus make all sorts of mistakes and bad decisions because they are focusing on the wrong things. My issue is that he, incomprehensibly, makes a literal, as opposed to metaphorical, connection with autism. He argues that during these times we become ""temporarily autistic"". While it's true that one aspect of our behavior becomes similar to an aspect of an autistic individuals behavior during these times, it seems like a pretty ridiculous statement to make as a broad generalization. He spends quite a bit of time talking about this and I don't think it does anyone any good.In the end I think I was most disappointed by the fact that all the elements to create a good book WERE present here, and the failure is due in large part to how he puts it all together and his ability to analyze all the disparate ideas properly (insert irony here). Evolution has built into us shortcuts to react quickly to stimuli in our environment. Our experience, whether broadly cultural or personal, prunes, enhances, changes those built in shortcuts as we go through life. Some develop as unfair biases towards people of different races. Some develop as we become experts in a subject. Thus some can be trusted and some can't. Our brains can't tell the difference between fact and fiction, only between experience and non experience, and so it's important to be aware of what kind of decision making goes on under the surface and what factors are involved in those decisions so we can be more aware of whether to trust them or not. Other factors can affect decision making, such as our emotional state due to the physiological changes that take place during those times, and this too is important to understand because it radically alters our perception during those times. The most important thing to remember is that experience translates into instinct through synaptic change, and through work and training we can increase the effectiveness of our gut reactions and snap decisions, but due to biases and our altered states during emotional situations those instincts should not always be trusted outright. There you go Malcolm Gladwell, please feel free to use this in the next printing. No citation necessary. "
20,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Malcolm Gladwell engagingly writes about how decisions made in a blink--snap judgments--can be very good. A series of entertaining anecdotes and psychological studies show that first impressions can be good in some cases, especially in areas where people have experience. He also writes about experts who analyze facial expressions, and how autistic people have trouble making certain types of judgment calls.But then he goes on to show how our unconscious mind can also be very prejudiced. Tall men are more likely to become CEOs than short men. Using Warren Harding as an example, he shows that people may vote for a political candidate because they look presidential. Women are less likely to be offered positions in some orchestras unless the auditions are held with the competitors behind a screen, so they are just evaluated on their playing ability. He also includes stories about police officers making snap judgments, and the judicial system handing out longer sentences to minorities. There were some examples that supported decisions made quickly by the subconscious level, and other examples that showed certain decisions were better when we slowed down and consciously gave things a little more thought. Experience played a big part in having good judgment making quick decisions. Gladwell does not get into how the brain works in making decisions. The book is interesting and entertaining, but it raises as many questions as it answers. 3.5 stars."

Even as a general reader, I find this book says a lot of things but does not actually tell you what it actually wants to address. But I love this book for totally different reasons. Firstly, I love case studies with interesting results written by someone who can write in a way you will find the whole experience exhilarating. Secondly, this guy deserves a five star because he is making less known but thought-provoking scientific studies to a much wider audience. Thirdly, nowhere it is mentioned in the title it is a book which teaches you how to think without thinking so it is completely understandable why it shows us both the advantages and disadvantages of snap decision making and it completely leaves to the reader to decide when to do what. Finally, I love non-fiction which uses a lot of anecdotes to state a fact rather just directly stating the fact it wants to address. I recommend it to anyone who loves to read about interesting psychological studies. "

23,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/337591-zinta,5,"Where does it all go, after you are done experiencing the experience, thinking the thought, feeling the feeling? Nothing is ever lost. The subconscious is like a vast warehouse, limitless, in fact, and as Malcolm Gladwell illustrates in Blink, we access all that is stored in that warehouse with every blinking and waking moment.Usually, we call this instant access - gut instinct. Or, the inner voice of wisdom. Instinct, however, is nothing magical or mysterious. It is simply our accumulated and stored knowledge over a lifetime. If there was ever an argument for listening to those who have some serious and well-lived years under their belts, this is it. Blink illustrates with numerous and widely varied examples how life experience, the more the better, contributes to our ability to make quick, yet sound decisions. In fact, the quicker, the better.Blink is about what the author calls ""thin slicing."" He defines this process as the moment of time in which we all make snap judgments. Two seconds, two minutes ... and we make an assessment of a situation or a person or a circumstance. The fascinating thing is - these snap judgments are, more often than not, precise ones. It is when we begin to over analyze and rationalize that we tend to go awry. The trick is to allow the accumulated wisdom rise up and do its magic, trust in it.Then again ...Gladwell never does make a concluding statement in his book, and perhaps it is up to the reader to decide (do it quickly?), but his many fascinating examples and his reports on various studies can lead one to think these snap judgments are the way to go - or, then again, thinker beware. For all the many situations in which that moment of initial wisdom is uncannily precise, there are other times that our deeply ingrained biases muck up the clarity of that process. Gladwell cites data to illustrate how stereotypes, for instance, persist - no matter how gallant our conscious efforts to overcome them. Telling yourself you don't really think what you think simply won't work. Only exposure to experiences, or positive visualizations, will change the false ideas and images our subconscious has absorbed over time. All of which is a strong argument for ""garbage in, garbage out."" That is, be careful of what entertainment you choose (e.g. pornographic images, violent movies or games, etc.), because no matter how hard your conscious mind tries to guide you toward decisions and behavior that is more appropriate, your subconscious will always, but always win out.The idea of what you present to your eye is what you will later project out to the world is a convincing one, as the author finds himself unable to beat the test on stereotypes when he has to react quickly. Only exposure to more positive images over time can change his test results and dislodge his prejudices.Gladwell discusses this phenomena of instant response-true response in a manner of ways. How patients respond to their doctors (we sue the physician who has a lousy bedside manner, even if more skilled, but remain loyal to the physician who spends as little as three extra minutes talking with us); how facial expressions, when viewed on slowed down video, will without fail, always reveal deceit (there are facial movements that arise from our subconscious that we cannot control, and no matter how quickly we think we have our facial mask in place, there is always that instant that our faces tell the truth); the intricacies of marketing and advertisement and why the obvious ad, even when based on feedback of focus groups, may not be the effective choice; how military decisions by experienced military leaders are successful, but fail miserably when they are constrained by strategic analysis; how micro-managing in workplaces can only lead to mediocrity while suppressing creativity and innovation; how speed dating may be most effective in finding potential lifelong connections (we read about research that can pick out successful, longterm relationships in observing as little as two minutes of interaction between a couple - and no, it isn't the couple that argues that breaks apart); how our societal subconscious biases for certain physical characteristics, such as height or gender, often mislead us to make dangerously faulty snap judgments (Gladwell observes that most of our leaders are tall and male, and that our corporate world pays tall men higher salaries, factoring dollars down to the inch, regardless of intelligence or ability). On and on, in one fascinating example and study after another, Gladwell intrigues with his findings.And you know he's right. You know it ... in your gut. But if the author doesn't make any overall conclusion from all of this fascinating data, then the reader is left to her own wiles. Experience counts more than credentials. What we expose ourselves to on a regular basis molds who we are, how we view others, what choices we make and how we behave. Biases and prejudices are far stronger than our conscious will to overcome them; we must align our environment to align our subconscious. Our deepest self forgets nothing. All we have ever done and been and seen and observed leads to who we are today and tomorrow.All of which gives one pause. But don't pause too long. It is that initial millisecond that may matter most of all."
24,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/159227-carolyn,3,"Equally as fascinating as Gladwell's other book The Tipping Point. Really makes you think, consider your decisions differently. Quotes:But in the end it comes down to a matter of respect, and the simplest way that respect is communicated is through tone of voice.Of the tens of millions of American men below five foot six, a grand total of ten in my sample have reached the level of CEO, which says that being short is probably as much of a handicap to corporate success as being a woman or an African American.Most of us, in ways that we are not entirely aware of, automatically associate leadership ability with imposing physical stature....when corrected for such variables as age and gender and weight, an inch of height is worth $789 a year in salary. That means that a person who is six feet tall but otherwise identical to someone who is five foot five will make on average $5,525 more per year.Prejudging is the kiss of death...because sometimes the most unlikely person is flush.The truth is that improv isn't random and chaotic at all...it's an art form governed by a series of rules, and they want to make sure that when they're up on stage, everyone abides by those rules. One of the most important of the rules that make improv possible, for examples is the idea of agreement, the notion that a very simple way to create a story—or humor—is to have characters accept everything that happens to them. Good improvisors seem telepathic; everything looks pre-arranged. This is because they accept all offers made—which is something no normal person would do.Neither Masten nor Rhea believes that clever packaging allows a company to put out a bad-tasting product. The taste of the product itself matters a great deal. Their point is simply that when we put something in our mouth and in that blink of an eye decide whether it tastes good or not, we are reacting not only to the evidence from our taste buds and salivary glands but also to the evidence of our eyes and memories and imaginations, and it is foolish of company to service one dimension and ignore the other.Emotion can also start on the face. The face is not a secondary billboard for our internal feelings. It is an equal partner in the emotional process. Silvan Tomkins one began a lecture by bellowing, ""The face is like a penis!"" What he meant was that the face has, to a large extent, a mind of its own.Imagine if there were a switch that all of us had, to turn off the expressions on our face at will. If babies had that switch, we wouldn't know what they were feeling. They'd be in trouble. You could make an argument, if you wanted to, that the system evolved so that parents would be able to take care of kids.People with autism...have difficulty interpreting non-verbal cues, such as gestures and facial expressions...in anything less than a perfectly literal environment, the autistic person is lost.In the interviews with police officers who have been involved with shootings, these same details appear again and again: extreme visual clarity, tunnel vision, diminished sound, and the sense that time is slowing down. This is how the human body reacts to extreme stress, and it makes sense. Our mind, faced with a life-threatening situation, drastically limits the range and amount of information that we have to deal with. Sound and memory and broader social understanding are sacrificed in favor of heightened awareness of the threat directly in front of us."

We make split-second judgements. Some people more accurately than others. This does not always mean what we think it means.Okay....I guess when the subtitle of a book has the words ""power"" and ""thinking"" in it (""The Power of Thinking Without Thinking""), I expect to gain something from it. Instead I feel like the author explains all the reasons why we should not be relying on snap judgements, despite the fact that some of the time, they are right. I don't find ""some"" to be very useful. If a person can't rely on first impressions, or what the author refers to as ""thin slice"" representations of performance or taste, what good is there in talking about it at all?Then I started thinking about why I read this book in the first place. When the new president of the university where I work started, he talked extensively about Malcolm Gladwell. He referenced this book as well as Outliers. I felt like if I read them, I would understand where he was coming from, and some of the changes he has been making. I have to admit that knowing how much of a decision people make in that first moment could have an impact on how a place is marketed. Even if first impressions don't necessarily become our opinions later on, they still have the power to make a decision in a person's mind, for better or for worse. Still, I'm not sure how you can make that work for you. Is it better to be super-sweet Pepsi that people prefer at the first sip, or more popular Coca-Cola which people are more likely to drink an entire bottle/can of, and make a repeat purchase of? I'd rather be Coke. Can you manufacture enough of a Pepsi experience and then also be Coke? That sounds dangerous to me, because I'm not sure you can be both.""People are ignorant of the things that affect their actions, yet they rarely feel ignorant. We need to accept our ignorance and say 'I don't know' more often.""""How good people's decisions are under the fast-moving, high-stress conditions of rapid cognition is a function of training and rules and rehearsal.""Gladwell does seem to be saying that if you understand the limitations of snap-judgments, you can train yourself to try to lessen bias, prejudice, and incorrect assumptions. It seems to me that the bigger trick is understanding when and how you are doing this to begin with. Write me a book about how to do that, Mr. Gladwell."
26,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/622323-snezan,4,"This work is worth a read, if not more than one. I hesitate to say too much, since I believe the conclusions it reaches are explored in the very beginning and will immediately inform the reader of its relevance. I don't know why that came out so long winded, the reader will find out how interested they are by the first or second chapter.I found the book fascinating for its close look into social interactions, particularly between two people, and for explaining why i sometimes I think the way that I do. The intuitive process of understanding is one that has made a lot of sense to me, and I am glad this book takes a microscope to that underpinning of society's operation. The examples in the book are relevant, timely and buttress the argument well. Especially the story about the psychologist that has a 90 percent success rate of whether a relationship would last past 7 years. The author's decision to skip a little exposition on detractors from the intuitive system of problem solving was a little disappointing, although I do understand that Blink is not, nor pretends to be a scholarly work. Instead it purports to be a lighthouse for a part of our decision-making that is often ignored in society and stays hidden from our conscious understanding. We often don't know why we like or dislike someone the way we do, and yet we allow that judgment to affect our interaction extremely or waffle endlessly over trying to deny or prove our first impression. How many times do you remember saying "" really wanted to like that,"" that being a dress or a person or a book and how much time has it wasted. Or why it sometimes take only a moment for a person to decide whether or not an idea has merit. Gladwell explores those snap judgments in details, and writes in a readable, approachable way. He is not afraid to tackle some controversial topics."

My feelings on this book are quite similar to how I felt about The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference (my review) so I'll keep this review short. My first thought after finishing this was: did I really just read 200+ pages on what is essentially the good and bad of gut reactions? There was nothing new for me here and that may not entirely be Gladwell's fault but nevertheless I could not enjoy this book. In addition to my lack of interest in the subject matter, I cannot enjoy the author's writing style. I feel he meanders and that there are so many unfinished thoughts and ideas. It drove me crazy!By the end of the book I was frustrated and upset. I recommend this book to no one. "
28,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15355957-rohit-enghakat,3,"Blink is an interesting read. The book is about making decisions in the blink of an eye, to be precise. The author says that decisions which are made instantly are far more fruitful than those made with long drawn research and logical thinking. He cites many examples which are also interesting to read. For example, the description of the Amadou Diallo incident where police officers shot an unarmed black immigrant in New York with forty-one bullets was stunning. Equally interesting was the last example of Abbie Connant playing the trombone traditionally played by a male in the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra.However, somehow the theory did not appeal to me. It is almost akin to relying on sixth sense, although the author tries to prove this scientifically. The book might appeal more to psychologists or psychiatrists. "

30,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/545336-mike,5,"Blink is an elegant 5 Star piece of science writing, dealing with how we think and chose in an instant. We make snap decisions based on experience or some other basis. Sometimes that is good and sometimes not. There are many good reviews so I am not going to spend more time on a review. What I will point out are two examples of how this book remains relevant today.First example is the recent campaign by Coca-Cola to sell specially colored white/silver cans of Coke over the 2011-2012 winter season to support “the plight of the polar bears.” Now, regardless of what you think about the motivation, the Cokeheads didn’t do their homework very well. In the book, Gladwell gives an example of a time 7-UP changed the shade of their green can and people complained that they had changed the taste. The 7-UP folks had simply changed the outside of the can, not the inside. Well, the very same thing happened to Coke. People started complaining the taste of regular Coke was different and sales started to go down. Well, astute businessmen that they are, the Cokies changed back to the normal red can ahead of schedule and sales went right back up, complaints went away. A simple reading of this book could have avoided this little mixup. (Coke continued the campaign to support the polar bears, or rather, the enviro’s who claim special concern over the bears plight).Another example is when I saw this principle in action. I was in the hospital recovery room after my son had an operation. A older couple was at another station as the wife was also recovering. One of the nurses offered her a soda and she asked for a Diet Coke. Well, the nurse reached into the small refrig and pulled out what looked like a Diet Coke but was really one of the special white/silver regular Coke cans. Only at the very last moment did the wife notice it wasn’t a diet drink. The thing is she is a diabetic and the sugary regular Coke would not have been good for her. Again, a brief glance resulted in a snap decision that could have been a real problem. Had the human factors folks at Coke read this book, maybe they would have noted this.I like Gladwell. He explains science simply and makes me feel smarter than I really am. Thanks dude."
31,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,4,"I've been listening to Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman while reading this book and the two are very closely related. I liked Blink more, so far. (Haven't completely finished the Kahneman one yet.) Gladwell is an excellent storyteller and, though he includes many scientific studies, Blink feels more approachable than Thinking Fast and Slow.The end result of reading back-to-back books on psychology that deal with our decision making processes and the problems/biases that we may have with them is that it has me doubting everything I've thought about or had to make a decision about for the past couple of days. I guess that's the sign of good literature, it makes you think and changes your worldview. While being slightly disturbed by all of this new input, I've also been wondering about how I can apply this new knowledge to its up-most potential.For example, I know within milliseconds of someone coming up to the reference desk, if the interaction I'm about to have with them is going to proceed smoothly or not. It's in their face, their pacing, if they're carrying something in their hands or not- I don't know how I know, I just know. From reading Gladwell's book, I think I do a combination of body language reading and then prime myself for whatever I think I've read in that glance about the person I'm about to deal with. Maybe I could prime myself to expect the best interaction for every experience? Maybe I could slow down the process of the gut check reaction? Anyway, this book taught me that I can do better and that perhaps I shouldn't rely on that immediate first impression to drive the rest of the action. Maybe I could set up a screen in front of my desk and then respond only to people's questions instead of how they're approaching me like how the interviewers removed the initial bias in the blind orchestral auditions... now there's an idea.If you enjoyed Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking then you may like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman (more of a scientific approach to the same topic) or The Truth About Trust: How It Determines Success in Life, Love, Learning, and More by David DeSteno (mind blowing book, at least it was for me, on trust, and how we make our decisions to trust or not)."
32,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30261451-celia,4,"This is a book about intuition: when it is right and when it can be fatally WRONG. I was impressed with all that was said in this book and am still thinking about why!!In the meantime, my husband stole my copy, so before I really get into why, I will have to steal it back!!I did listen to this book as well. It is narrated by the author. Malcolm Gladwell is a great speaker with a properly modulated voice and sympathetic tone. "
33,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65250-sheila,4,"This book was really interesting. It discusses the way in which people can ""thin-slice"" a situation in a matter of seconds and make a judgement. This is where pre-conceived notions such as stereotypes can affect the way we react to something under a time constraint. It's about how our unconscious mind figures things out and affects how we feel or affects our actions before we even realize what is happening. Even if you aren't a racist, you can be programmed to act as a racist by the things you are exposed to in society. Even if you don't think you are sexist, you are more sexist than you think, due to programming. We associate things like home with mother and work with father. Examined in the book are police brutality, predictions of whether a couple will stay together (just by examining 15 min. of conversation), reading facial expressions, how one firefighter was able to thin slice a situation so quickly that he was able to save his men.The study I found most interesting was the analysis of an autistic man. We have a part of our brain we use for facial recognition and another part we use for object recognition. The autistic man used the object part of his brain for both facial recognition and for things like recognizing that an object was a chair. The autistic man would watch a movie and not ""get"" the emotional things happening because he barely paid attention to faces and didn't distinguish meaning from them. A new police officer, for example, in a time of distress where his heart is racing, he just finished chasing a man in his car for an hour, will become ""autistic"" so to speak because he ignores all cues and shoots a man to death. All he perceives is a threat and he forgets the person. A police officer with more experience will be able to ""thin slice"" the situation better in a matter of seconds and avoid an unecessary shooting.In order to be a good ""thin-slicer"", you probably have a lot of experience with what you are examining and it just becomes second nature. Some people are just naturally good at reading faces, predicting outcomes, and making those snap decisions that happen in the blink of an eye. Others, well, not as good! I feel that the book could use more focus, but overall, a good read.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the mysterious ways our minds work. "
34,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,3,"Won't do my typical long review for this book. I'm actually writing something more substantial that deals with these issues, so I'll save some of my energy for that. (And there is quite a bit more that needs reading). The short-short version of my usual long review is that Gladwell has some very good exploratory writing that he has written through anecdotes. This shouldn't surprise Gladwell fans. The problem with this book is that we never know whether he is intervening in the art vs. science debate, the intuitive vs. structured methods debate, or the rationalist vs. heuristic learning debate. If we were to read the book through any of these perspectives, unsurprisingly, the answer would be -- it all depends. Intuition can be the answer -- unless it's the problem. Intuition can be made better, through science. Unless our science is actually the problem, in that case, trust expert judgement (not necessarily the same thing as intuition, right?). The concepts get fuzzy. And actually, it seems like Gladwell is taking liberties with his subject matter to explore a range of things that might only be slightly related. One might take away from this book that we need to be aware of our own cognition, or that we need something called an epistemological frame. How do we know what we know? When is information too much information? When do we need rigor? When do we need to make a decision quickly? In any case, we're not sure what we're supposed to take away because the book hasn't quite settled into a fuller version of itself. That is my intuition as a writer. Gladwell has a second or third draft, but not quite a final draft. And that final draft might be a little beyond his capabilities. He might need a co-author, more time, or expertise to help his cause. There is a deep literature that deals with all of these subjects of epistemology, analytical failure, art vs. science (and so on). But since the book scrapes the surface of applied psychology, we're left with a few good stories and some things to think about. One has to remember that the author is a journalist and kind of intellectual voyeur -- thin-slicing is not only one of the topics of his book, it is also his profession. Not bad for a book written for a popular audience, but not great. "
35,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43449419-rawa-a,3,"This is going to be a very interesting review ..I was introduced to this book through Thinking, Fast And Slow and was very excited to read it; the idea is brilliant, it dwells on one of my favorite topics in psychology, and who doesn't want to have a deeper understanding of their own thought processes?It started with the Kouros story which was a great choice in my opinion to start the book with. In retrospect, it kind of summarized the whole book in a story format. One of my fav. I also really liked the idea of temporary autism and it's safe to say that it got me interested to the extent of wanting to know more about it and I honestly won't mind a book dedicated to it. The book also touched upon Priming in good details compared to other similar books. A huge chunk of the book, and by that I mean >70% of it, were examples to the ""Fast Thinking"" process, or the Blink in this book's terms, and if you've been reading my reviews you should realize by this point that I really love stories as examples as long as I get my share (I go with big portions here) of facts, science, and evidence based info. I was forced to compare the ""Blink"" to ""Fast Thinking"" introduced in Thinking, Fast And Slow, where the author in the later provided a huge deal of facts along with the multiple examples. I didn't find this in blink, in fact, I felt it's a good support for ""System 1"" (a synonym for fast thinking in the book's terms) , read before or after it to provide deeper understanding of it, it that is wanted. It won't have satisfied me at all as a standalone (maybe cuz I read the other book before it?)Another thing, the writer seemed a bit unsure, although he did lean more towards one of the opinions. Apart from repeating himself (and the incidents) a couple of times, he fluctuated between trusting our blink or going with deliberate thinking. Overall, this was a good read and I'll recommend it to others ✨."
36,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1698621-amy,4,"Fascinating book! I would describe Blink as promoting self-awareness more than self-help. It's a captivating exploration of the ability of our unconscious minds to accurately(much of the time)read the world around us. The psychological studies featured offered refreshing evidence that it isn't always in our best interest to slow down and think rationally. I wouldn't base an investment strategy on Gladwell's ""thin-slicing"" methods, but when it comes to matters of life and death, love, trust and marriage, oh, and battle tactics, Blink makes a convincing argument to ""go with our gut."" "
37,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49049055-parth-agrawal,4,"An awesome choice of title first of all as it aptly highlights the direction in which the present day decision making process is going towards. With increasing complexity and requirement of multi tasking, decision making is that one quality that every one yearns for. But the travesty of the truth is that very few are there amongst us who really know the process of decision making. Well I used to think that you sit, process and decide. That's one method ofcourse. The other one that comes to my mind is you run, slip, dash and just pick one from the options available to you with just hope, and logic being the last thing, on your side. ;pAdding to the joy, various experimental findings have been highlighted in the book forming the crux of the fun which I won't disclose here as it'll rob you off the fun in it. IN the book, author explicitly says that decision making process actually has two approaches. The first one that i mentioned above involves comprehension, cognition and lot of data crunching leading to the conclusion. But the underlying assumption in this process is that you have an unlimited supply of time (which is hardly ever the case). The second one that i mentioned above is called rapid cognition and in a cursory glance it would seem to you as a random act. We pick an option under such circumstance only when we know that picking is compulsory and we would be better off with a wrong choice rather than with no choice at all. If someone picks the right one, losers instantaneously brand it as luck by chance. What if i told you that even behind your rapid cognition, there is a basis. There's reason that you chose a particular option and only that option amongst all the options. It has a direct relation with the memories and experiences that have created your subconscious since you have stepped foot on this planet.The best example of this can be seen in our own society. If some guy is seen with a tattoo, long hair, ostentatious clothes, our mind immediately forms an image of him as someone who's born with a silverspoon or has no regards for the life he is living, he must be arrogant, impertinent etc etc. Where do all these ideas come from? They are nothing more than what we have been fed into our minds repeatedly and on a daily basis. In India, the organisational hierarchy of the family leaves little room for individual thought process and as an aftermath, the habit of questioning and curiosity goes down the drain. Cultural practices as such, leads to the creation of these kind of biases and prejudices which in turn has brewed a great deal of hypocrisy in our generation as the same characteristics that I mentioned above becomes desirable to an individual and even after he/she attains it, he/she remains contemptuous of the practice as a whole because that's what he/she has been fed with. How often have we seen that a guy in public transport even if mistakenly outrages the modesty of a female passenger, the crowd goes berserk and thrash the guy presuming that he must have had bad intentions. His pleas and requests fall upon deaf ears as people have already taken a snap judgement and no amount of explanation can convince them otherwise. Talking about all this brings us to a very important question. Are we slaves to our snap judgments? Can't we break free the shackles of biases and prejudices? To answer this, it is important to know that there is one big similarity between our conscious and subconscious thinking process. Both of them can be trained and taught through repetitive exercises only. It might be possible for some of you to think that since subconscious decision making is a quick process, training it will also be likewise but it isn't. Author substantiates this claim by quoting instances in the book in which body guards, police officers are provided training of this sort in which they control their adrenaline rush by repeatedly practicing in high-stress situations in which they learn to control their heart-rates, resisting their brains to keep the amount of input from dropping which ultimately helps them to take judicious action in such situations. Thomas Hoving, a curator, says that:"" I try my best to create best first impressions of the people, activity or an object during my first interaction as I believe that our subconscious is an untapped source of abilities and possibilities and it can be educated and trained in a manner such that we harness it for the greater good and for all this to happen, I need to have a positive frame of mind for every new experience of life."" Do you agree? I most certainly do;);).   "
38,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28613204-sara,5,From page 265: “The key to good decision making is not knowledge. It is understanding. We are swimming in the former. We are desperately lacking in the latter.” (So true! What good is all the world’s info at our fingertips if we don’t have the wisdom necessary to properly execute it?)
39,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1627983-mahlon,4,"Malcolm Gladwell has written yet another thought-provoking book. In Blink he postulates that often our first impressions or gut instincts are more likely to lead us to the the correct decision than if we spent a long time gathering information and weighing out the pros and cons of the particular situation. In other words, you should ""trust your gut"" In trademark Gladwell fashion he uses many entertaining stories and case studies to illustrate his points, while at the same time cautioning against trusting your first impressions too much. I don't think his arguments are as well articulated as those in The Tipping Point, but I'll leave that up to the individual reader to decide for themselves.My previous complaints about Gladwell's organization, and the repetition of his writing are still valid. I find reading the beginning of one of his chapters to be a very enjoyable experience, but by mid-chapter I usually find the going excruciatingly slow, and by the end I feel as if I've been wandering around the desert for days, and have finally found my way back to civilization. Despite these minor flaws, at the end of his books I always find myself excited as to what his next project might be, and eager to share his insights with others. "

The short subject studies that the author uses are interesting, easy to follow, and compelling evidence of his ""theory"" or study in first impressions. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sociology, psychology, or who spends a lot of time interacting with people. You will learn how and when to trust your ""gut feeling"" or first impressions of people, situations, and products. A great read!"

I love his writing and they way he can relate two things (or more) in such an intimate manner when at first they appear as just random events. That is a gift. This book is the 6th one that I've read by this author. I didn't like it as much as some of his other books. It didn't have the same edge as the others. It did however have some of the same entertainment appeal, so 3 stars."

46,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,4,"In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell explores the phenomenon he calls 'thin slicing'; the human ability to winnow out, in fractions of a second, salient facts from a mass of information and make a decision based on them. Something most of us do all the time without giving it much conscious thought – reading the facial expressions and body language of the people with whom we interact, walking down a busy street (or a quiet street late at night), our subconscious minds processing hundreds or even thousands of bits of information, deciding which few are important and making a judgement based on them.Gladwell illustrates his thesis using several extended examples. The first is relatively straight forward. In 1983 California's Getty museum was offered a 2500 year old Greek statue, a kouros, for $10 million. All the tests said it was genuine but several art experts, at first glance and without being able to say precisely why, knew it was a fake. He also tells the stories of how an ugly chair conquered the offices of the world, how we are all effected by racial conditioning, how Chicago's Cook County hospital improved diagnosis of heart attacks by removing a physician's knowledge from the process, how a commander using WWII technology defeated the combined might of the the US armed forces in the largest ever war game, and more.The author uses two main studies to demonstrate how this process of instant assessment works. John Gottman's 'love lab', where he gets couples to talk about a subject tangentially connected with their relationship and videos the exchange to bring out the non-verbal cues, and Paul Ekman, who is an expert of facial micro-expressions that last microseconds and over which we have no control (this latter also being the model for the excellent TV show Lie To Me with Tim Roth). Gladwell builds his argument convincingly and refers back to his examples frequently for both illustration and dramatic effect. Each example he uses shows a different facet of the Blink effect but also, and this is vital, how it can go wrong in certain circumstances.While it is quick, this subconscious ability does require a moment to work, and can be short circuited by rushing or by an overload of adrenaline. Another case study chillingly shows what can happen when our subconscious is not given the opportunity to work properly. In 1999 an unarmed, innocent man, Amadou Diallo, was shot 41 times in the entryway of his own New York apartment building, by four policemen. He shows how a lack of experience, over-hasty action and perhaps even the over-confidence of numbers allowed these policemen to fall back on crude stereotypes and allow an initial poor assessment to lead them down a tragic course of events.While Gladwell lauds the benefits of both listening to this subconscious supercomputer and developing the skills, in backing up the studies he constantly refers to the fact that this understanding has often been achieved by the exact opposite type of mentation – deliberate, analytical evaluation of evidence. This, along with the examples given, should show the reader that there are appropriate and inappropriate areas for this sort of thinking, although I can imagine some of the readership taking away only the face-value lesson of relying on first instincts and gut feelings. I would have liked to see a chapter on the abuse of these impressions, which is after all how con artists and frauds such as psychics operate. This could have been perhaps added into the chapter on Warren G. Harding, who was elected as US president because he was tall, handsome, masculine, dignified – and is considered by historians to be one of the worst presidents in US history. I want to take nothing away from this excellent book, however. It is superbly written, making excellent use of pacing and the storylines of the examples he uses to give the book structure. Malcolm Gladwell has a great style, authoritative and engaging, and he packs a great deal of both information and analysis into what is a quick, easy and enjoyable read."
47,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6738834-fay-al,4,"Most of us don't know how our decision making / thinking process works. Turns out we're on auto pilot more often than not. Imagine if you had to think routine tasks everyday: walking, manipulating basic objects, recognizing faces, language...etc that would be exhausting and would consume much needed energy.“The mind operates most efficiently by relegating a good deal of high-level, sophisticated thinking to the unconscious, just as a modern jetliner is able to fly on automatic pilot with little or no input from the human, ‘conscious’ pilot. The adaptive unconscious does an excellent job of sizing up the world, warning people of danger, setting goals, and initiating action in a sophisticated and efficient manner.”We think we fully control every decision, but that's only what your mind is leading you to believe..... what we think of as free will is largely an illusion: much of the time, we are simply operating on automatic pilot, and the way we think and act — and how well we think and act on the spur of the moment — are a lot more susceptible to outside influences than we realize.Well it turns out, it's not that straightforward or under our conscious control as much as we'd like it to be:Reading Blink enables one to have a better idea of how it all works and become aware of the biases/influences that cloud our judgment. And there's plenty of examples & experiments in the book that highlights our ""flawed judgment"". And I think what all of this also means is that we're vulnerable to anyone wishing to manipulate us given that they know how our minds work better than we do.One experiment mentioned in the book about facial expressions struck me as very interesting. The face is not just a projection of what we think and feel, it also works the other way around.They gathered a group of volunteers and hooked them up to monitors measuring their heart rate and body temperature — the physiological signals of such emotions as anger, sadness, and fear. Half of the volunteers were told to try to remember and relive a particularly stressful experience. The other half were simply shown how to create, on their faces, the expressions that corresponded to stressful emotions, such as anger, sadness, and fear. The second group, the people who were acting, showed the same physiological responses, the same heightened heart rate and body temperature, as the first group.A few years later, a German team of psychologists conducted a similar study. They had a group of subjects look at cartoons, either while holding a pen between their lips — an action that made it impossible to contract either of the two major smiling muscles, the risorius and the zygomatic major — or while holding a pen clenched between their teeth, which had the opposite effect and forced them to smile. The people with the pen between their teeth found the cartoons much funnier. These findings may be hard to believe, because we take it as a given that first we experience an emotion, and then we may — or may not — express that emotion on our face. We think of the face as the residue of emotion. What this research showed, though, is that the process works in the opposite direction as well. Emotion can also start on the face. The face is not a secondary billboard for our internal feelings. It is an equal partner in the emotional process."
48,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1028530-caron,4,"Malcolm Gladwell has written a book about the power of first impressions (aka intuition/ your gut feeling). He provides a series of anecdotes about the process of first reactions including a tale about a forged ancient Greek statue at the Getty that some experts deemed as authentic and others classified as a fake upon sight. In another anecdote, he scrutinizes a ""couples lab"" where psychologist John Gottman determines if a matched pair will last the test of time by studying their conversation for 15 minutes - -he accurately predicts their fate about 90% of the time.Gladwell coins the term ""thin-slicing"" to capture these small snippets in time when a human judges a situation in an instant like a first date, hiring an employee, or meeting a new colleague. Human beings tend to take a first glance and ""thin-slice"" what they perceive through sight or interactions with the situation or individual. Rapid fire cognition is scary to many individuals and Gladwell believes that if ""we paid more attention to those fleeting moments...it would change the way wars are fought, the kinds of products we see on the shelves, the kinds of movies that get made, the way police officers are trained, the way couples are counseled...If you combine all those little changes together, you end up with a different and happier world."" How profound! He is attempting to bring psychology to the masses and does so artfully, choosing his words and sharping his ideas with high-interest examples to engage the reader. Gladwell further discusses ""priming,"" a term used to refer to subtle triggers that influence human behavior without any awareness of such changes (ex. Spain played classical music on subways and littering and vandalism decreased).The book incited much discussion with my book club membership- - thought provoking questions and topics selected from the Blink Reading Group Guide, but membership barely scratched the surface in their debate. This book caused the group to make many connections to their own lives and world. Conversation often digressed into self-reflective wondering or observations.Gladwell wants all readers to believe that intuition is often more reliable that reasoning and a series of data. But is that really the case? One criticism - he never addresses the brain in a scientific manner. In my own experience, I have learned (and am still learning) that I need to pay more attention to my intuition, my first gut instinct. I do not always think that ""thin-slicing"" is as reliable as collecting data and observations in many instances, but there is something to say about my first impressions of situations or people. I need to have more confidence about my ""gut impressions"" and have more faith in ME. Gladwell's book Blink substantiated that there is a certain degree of accuracy in my intuition. "
49,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5564285-sara-j-kefuwa,5,"This was the first Gladwell book I read. I read and finished it during my backpacking trip across Cambodia. I read it amongst the ruins of ancient temples, on bumpy dusty tuk-tuk rides, I held on to it while on the boat waiting for the freshwater dolphins to crest the surface of the mighty Mekong, I read it while sitting cross legged on the floor of the aisle of a public bus on the 2-hour ride back to Siem Reap.But even without all that hazy semi-sense-of-adventure-backpacking state of mind... I would still recommend this book to anyone. Or any of Mssr Gladwell's books honestly speaking (up to the date of this review I have read them all except for 'Tipping Point' and 'David & Goliath', ironically -or maybe rather quite properly Gladwellian- the first & latest of his books). In a nutshell, this book is about how intrinsically we know things. But how all that is usually drowned out or pushed to the corner of ones mind by a lot of good old crusty 'preconception', 'social upbringing' and 'societal brainwashing'. But maybe it's not something that comes when we think about it. Anyhow the main concept/theory in this book is not bedrock to be sure, but somewhat elastic. Something to be taken with a grain of salt.

50,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38240230-dawn,4,"Audiobook read by the author. I'm going to keep this review short but I'm going to say it is an easy read and definitely worth reading. Basically, it is about the information our brains and subconscious process in the 'blink' of an eye. It's surprising how our subconscious knows what is happening in a scenario before we do. Gladwell provided many different scenarios and anecdotal stories throughout the book that were fascinating and eye-opening. It's sad to learn that we all are quick to judge and have many different stereotypes imbedded in our subconscious and conscious. The author's own anecdotal story of when he grew his hair out and the things that happened to him as a result is crazy. And he just had longer hair. So imagine all the other factors that play into someone's appearance and the quick judgements our subconscious starts to make. But this book isn't just about stereotypes. I also found the section on analyzing married couples fascinating. An expert (I forget his name) is able to 'thin slice' a couple's interaction with each other and can tell with 90% accuracy if they will stay married or not. Maybe this would be a good tool for counselors and therapists to learn before couples get married? Definitely recommend. 4 stars."

Perhaps I am just in a reading funk, but this book, too, left me a bit unsatisfied. I'm not quite sure what I expected, but the book was essentially a series of anecdotes about instinct. Gladwell may call it ""thin-slicing"" but the book is really about making snap judgments, stereotyping, if you will. It's the judgment that we make in the first few seconds of an interaction, a judgment made in the ""blink"" of an eye. Often, if not always, these judgments are more true than the ones made with greater reflection and we ignore these ""thin-slices"" at our peril. That, in a nutshell (or a thin-slice), is the thesis of this book. It is an interesting theory and one that I find amicable. My personal experience seems to confirm it. Still, I would have liked to see the whole thing fleshed out just a bit more. It just seemed a bit lightweight overall, but interesting as pop science. "

I have to admit, in the first chapter I had a little knee-jerk reaction when I thought he was saying that our intuitive reactions are invariably correct. As I continued to read I appreciated his skill in outlining the complexity of his theory, and the fact that only one who is trained in a particular field can really articulate what is happening in his or her unconscious decision-making process. He also explained how that unconscious reaction can be skewed by unrelated factors, thus completely disproving my knee-jerk disagreement."

56,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178887-max-stone,3,"The general topic was how powerful our initial impressions are because we can process stuff really quick at a subconscious level in some cases. Blink was well written and pretty entertaining. I thought the author did a good job of coming up with interesting examples of good or bad information processing and I enjoyed reading those. However, aside from writing style and some fun examples, I thought the content was quite neatly separable into two parts:  (a) stuff that was interesting and seemed true and which I knew already, and  (b) stuff that seemed untrue or at least incoherant and that I hadn't previously heard before. but maybe that was just my closed mind at work. Examples of (a) were how you one's initial impression (lke in the first 5 seconds) of a teacher or an interviewee are pretty highly correlated with your opinion after an hour.There were lots of examples of (b). Like it was weird that one of his first and favorite examples was this guy who had studied videos of couples interacting in intense detail for decades, and had created a list for how someone could score such videos to predict odds that the marriage would last. It was supposed to be an example of ""blink"" processing because the expert could recognize it quickly, but to me it seemed more like the opposite since (1) non-experts (including the author) all had inaccurate instinctive reactions to watching the videos, and (2) the best way to get the right answer was a mechanical scorecard -- kind of the opposite of blink.And in general, there were examples of when you should trust your blink instinct and when that was wrong, but all the examples of when it was right or wrong seemed very post hoc (e.g. if your heart rate is over some threshold you shouldn't, but I don't think that would have come up unless he needed some explanation for why accidental police shootings occured), and he didn't really have a consistent framework for when it would be right or wrong, which made it kinda useless. and some seemed random, like the part about some musicians that musical experts liked but that did poorly in the musical equivalent of blind taste tests -- seemed likely that it was a friend of the author or some musician he liked (it was clear in the book that we should take as a given that it was a good musician and that the taste tests were wrong -- I was never quite clear why) and he was just trying to think of some way that might connect to his thesis.I liked the description of how orchestras started doing blind auditions to avoid discrimination against women. wasn't sure that it supported his thesis, but it was interesting. that was more or less my reaction to the whole book."

It has to do with trends: what makes something popular and who is involved in that process and why it works. This isn't a look at advertising or corporate businesses (although the does look at those, too) but rather a journey into the dynamics and parts of these trends. It's an intriguing and well written book, ideal for anyone who wants to know how social trends work. It has pracitcal applications as well, if you have any desire to make social changes yourself.""Blink"" is more on a personal level, and looks at how our subconcious works and how important it is in our daily life and daily choices. This book is amazing, and I highly recommend it for everyone. ""Tipping"" is really interesting and carries some amazing social insights, but only applies directly to those who wish to institute change, ""Blink"" on the other hand is a must-read for anyone who has ever wondered why they make the split-second decisions they make and whether they're good or bad. Which I hope is everyone. Malcolm Gladwell has an amazing way of writing as though he was chatting over a cup of coffee. His books are full of amazing insight, research, and profound ideas that revolutionize the world we live it, but there is never a point that you feel lost, like these ideas are only something the smart kids can truly understand. Another thing I truly enjoy is his absolute lack of preachieness. His opinions are strongly stated, but never forced on you."

But be careful, though, because: When we make a second split decision, we are also very vulnerable to being guided by our stereotypes and prejudices, even ones we may not necessarily endorse or believe.So what is the practical solution to make a split second decision? This ability improves with practice.

This unconscious decision making that the author calls ‘thin slicing’ is something we all partake in day to day.These snap decisions, the author warns can be harmful because of the biases and prejudice we carry with us, citing the shooting of Amadou Diallo, the election of Warren Harding, the New Coke and research that I have come to associate with Gladwell. .Blink isn’t perfect, kinda difficult to review but I love how it made me see certain things differently, how we should trust our gut even though we cannot explain it but should use this power judiciously as there are a lot of factors to consider when to give that good old gut feeling a miss.Pick this book for something quintessentially Malcolm Gladwell and I loved every bit of it!

On the other hand, you might enjoy the irony of reading a book about how 'you can trust your gut instinct' all the way to the end even though your gut kept shouting at you that it wasn't worth your time to read this book.

68,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70078-chloe,3,"With his study of how ideas spread in The Tipping Point and then with his explanation of how humans rely on intuition here in Blink, Malcolm Gladwell has carved a comfortable niche for himself among the pop-science authors of today. With his eye for patterns and a knack for putting into words many of the quirks of humankind that we take for granted, Gladwell has made a science out of common sense.In this, his second book, Gladwell looks at our ability to subconsciously process information in a far faster and more detailed way than our conscious minds are typically capable of. This is hardly new ground- the Beats intoned “First thought, best thought.” Obi-Wan Kenobi told Luke to “trust your instincts” and Luke managed to blow up the Death Star without aid from his targeting computer. Examples abound. Gladwell, as all social scientists must, puts his own stamp on it by renaming it ""thin slicing"" (the knack we have for deriving often correct solutions/ideas from a small sampling of information).There's not much that is new or ground-breaking within these pages. Gladwell builds his case for thin slicing with many vastly different examples, from studies performed to read the micro-expressions in people's faces which betray their mood and thoughts (I think someone at Fox must have read this book before developing ""Lie To Me"") to the way in which people may be ""primed"" to be more cooperative or smart simply by being exposed to a series of terms or thinking about the traits of a good professor (the most disturbing example of this is when Gladwell cites a study in which a group of African-American students attending an Ivy League school take a test in which they are asked their racial information at either the beginning of the test or at the end. Those who fill in the racial info before taking the test performed far worse due to being primed to think of all the stories about black students' inability to perform well on standardized testing.)The latter half of the book is spent analyzing those events in which our intuition leads us astray, the most glaring example of which is the 1999 shooting of the unarmed Amadou Diallo by a group of four police officers. While interesting and definitely a good check on those who read the first half of the book and want to go out and only trust their instincts, I felt that Gladwell never really made clear the instances in which we should rely on our gut or when we should proceed in a thorough and detailed manner. Still, this was an incredibly interesting read that provided much fodder for both thought and discussion around the supper table. I'd recommend it for those in search of a quick non-fiction read or who enjoy the slow accumulation of trivia."
69,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,3,"Gladwell shares intriguing examples of the role of the unconscious in making decisions. He tells of the surprising accuracy of snap judgments, and how people’s experiences greatly influence their decisions, despite their unawareness. Many of his stories are fascinating, but his slow, winding way of telling them is frustrating. I wanted to shout, “I get the point! Move on!” I didn’t like this book as much as Outliers (read my review), but I wasn’t as interested in this topic as the subject of Outliers (achieving success).I really liked the investigation into how ignorant people are of the factors that affect their decisions. One of my favorite sections was about how people perceive food to taste better or worse based on the food’s branding and packaging. Gladwell also shows that, counter-intuitively, too much information or too many choices inhibit judgements, because they become distracting. This idea is also explored in Nudge (read my review), which I highly recommend.I had heard of this book before, but finally decided to read it after Brendon Sinclair recommended it in the The Web Design Business Kit 2.0 from SitePoint. In the kit, Brendon explains that web designers need to design websites that make great first impressions and are simple enough to facilitate quick, unconscious decisions. I’ll try to keep these lessons in mind for my web design company, OptimWise.Gladwell shows that snap judgments can be quite accurate because of thin slicing; the brain is able to get a “read” on a person or object based on a very short exposure to them. Of first impressions, he says that “sometimes we can know more about someone or something in the blink of an eye than after months of study.”We make judgments based on our experiences and situations, so prejudice and stereotypes can lead us astray. To minimize their effects, Gladwell suggests that we change our experiences. For example, by spending more time with the people against whom we’re prejudiced, we can retrain our brains to overcome the prejudice."

I have yet to read The Tipping Point by the same author, but now, I am not sure that I will.The problem with any book is its reputation - especially if there is a lot of it. For some reason - it kept reminding me of Freakonomics - only this was esoteric on the dull side.There is a trend (I am not sure who started it) of looking at the world as if suddenly we are finding new things. These books go on with examples and experiences - and it just seems never ending. Some examples are interesting - but then it does get boring after a while. India Unbound, The World is Flat (left it halfway), and now Blink. I am given to believe that the Tipping Point is similar. I call these, the “books that tell us what we know”. And I may add, “that we choose not to know”. Possibly we are bang in between a revolution of how we see our world - and these are the small changes that we dont notice. Hmm. Need to read Tipping Point.Freakonomics stands out - because the relationships that it talks of - are curious, to say the least.Blink is a good book, mind you, nothing wrong with it - but it failed to impress. At least as much as the promise that people said it held. The theory that the book talks about is absolutely bang on! And I should have known. I don’t pick up books recommended by some people. Then many people talk about it - I know all the more I shouldn’t pick it up. But then you feel left out - because everyone is talking about it. That is not the Blink moment. The moment I choose not to pick it up is the Blink moment.Recommended only if you want to be told, with never ending examples of, what you possibly already know.

While the author spends the first half of the book nearly pounding you into the ground with story after story and account after account of the power of unconscious snap decisions, I could appreciate the number of studies cited in the research. (He had me convinced in half of the time he actually took to do so; that's all I'm saying.) Gladwell balances an admiration for people who've developed savant-like capacities in their fields of expertise, while pointing out instances where such experts can actually handicap themselves by becoming too bogged down in details.The second half of the book would appeal to anyone concerned with reading the complex and minute expressions in the human face. For those who may have enjoyed the television series ""Lie To Me,"" this reads as the real-life basis behind the art of micro-expressions and deception detection.I deeply appreciated the author's brief but penetrating look into the differing processes of a mind with Autism. He presents the concept that any overly-stimulated ""normal"" person can essentially exhibit autism-like perceptions, leading to a domino effect of misjudgements and faulty resulting actions. In that same vein, he also sheds light on an array of controversial topics--particularly related to human biases and police-chases. I found myself with a new way of looking at errors made by over-stressed police officers and, consequently, a new respect for them."

Gladwell did some sort of research, but research in relation to psychology implies a thesis tested against authoritative sources. Assembling a series of cool stories and presenting them as case studies seems a little disingenuous. The conclusion I reach is that OK we might benefit from viewing social prejudice as a scientific fact. We might benefit by becoming aware of situations where ""rapid cognition"" can improve our on the job perfomance. However, I think the reason this book is a bestseller is that people (myself included) tend to wander around Borders bookstore looking for some sort of shortcut to social insight.

The case studies are what lift the book and act as the glue holding together Gladwell's thoughts on the subject.I myself make a lot of snap decisions. In this I am aided by my husband. Together we decided on a car in two days. We knew the house we wanted the first time we saw it. These were classic snap decisions (without the benefit of anything but what felt right). I liked Gladwell's conclusion that context and prior expertise in a subject are what are really needed to be able to trust a lot of one's quick decisions. The car and house were truly snap. When someone brings up food oriented issues, my knee jerk reactions are more trustworthy because I have decades of experience in food reading and cooking.This was an enjoyable, enlightening look at something we all think we already understand."

He already started his characteristic style of telling his thesis through case studies, but this time the selection isn‘t great and instead of making several points, this book only evolves around one thesis, which is also contradicted in ""Range"" by David Epstein, which is a book I can really recommend btw.This time his linear argumentation style also really started to bother me. In my opinion there were several ways to interpret the studies which he simply ignored...Writing takes practice and experience and it‘s nice to see how Gladwell developed, looking at previous work!

Blink was somewhat interesting. I was hoping for more though.

The main issue is one that someone wrote about before and I could not help but notice it now. Gladwell is excellent in showing the reader studies and real events that only support his ideas or claims but does very little in discussing any studies or conflicting ideas with the ones he is writing about. however, I think it is more on the reader rather than the author to look for any ideas that may contradict those of the author."

The unconscious response of the players to red cards could cased because it's easy to understand the higher risk associated with each red card, but it could goes two way. It doesn't mean they understood blue cards win more, they simply reacted more to the red cards.

85,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11620590-harsh-kumar,3,"For the facebook update viewers: if you are at IITK campus you can pick up the (shitty but entirely readable) copy of the book from me by 15th May.Preview to the review: I am back to rating books harshly :P Before I start criticizing this book let me say this: Blink is a good book by an excellent author which I liked and if you were thinking of reading this book, you probably should.Now the major problem with this book and indeed with most non-fiction I have read is that they seem like a short story collection with no overall narrative structure, but about characters in the same general universe. The characters of one story might show up in another and provide you a sense of familiarity, but they don't bring anything else from the earlier story with them. For all purposes you could start at the second story and nothing would change. This book is a collection of research and anecdotes (the stories) from the world of rapid cognition but it lacks a general structure to bring the whole thing together. Mind you the short stories in and of themselves are excellent. Malcolm Gladwell is an extraordinary storyteller. (Watch this In Conversation with Tyler Cowen to see for yourself)One really good thing about this book is that it does not pretend to ignore research/anecdotes going against the validity of decisions made in a blink. In fact a substantial portion of the book is dedicated to precisely how our snap (often unconscious) judgement affect our actions (yeah, it is a lot about racism and sexism). BTW, if you think you are not even unconsciously racist or sexist do read this book.Finally, I should point out that this book has the best discussion about police violence I have ever encountered. (Can you apply it to Kashmir? I think so.)"
86,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70642519-jacey-crayton,2,"""Blink"" is, overall, a very intriguing book about the mind. There were many points in the book that I thought were extremely fascinating. However, I would personally only give it about 2 stars. The book contains a lot of content that can only really be understood by someone that understands subjects like science and psychology really, really well. Although I get the basics, I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of the specifics just because there is so much terminology & abstract ideas that are hard for me to grasp. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a challenging, thought-provoking read, but it may not be enjoyable to people like me that struggle with more advanced texts. I also felt like the book itself didn't have a clear point. Gladwell began the book with a strong ""thesis"" so to speak. The point for a while was that not all decisions need to be made over long periods of time, & that sometimes decisions can be made within the blink of an eye and still be just as reliable & accurate. However, the book shifted tones several times as Gladwell started giving examples of the opposite. I felt like he would basically say ""snap judgments can be accurately made, except when they can't."" To me, the book felt relatively pointless at times because of the contradictions. However, I still believe that, as stated earlier, there are a few good qualities of this book. It's very thought-provoking & it draws attention to the different parts of the mind, why people do what they do, & how sometimes we know something without knowing that we know it. Gladwell is an outstanding author, but I think this specific novel doesn't quite show his full potential. I would highly recommend another one of his books, ""The Outliers"", which plays with the idea that success is determined by several unexpected factors. "
87,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85808493-ishi-time,4,"I had the opportunity to attend one of Malcolm Gladwell's talks when I was in high school, and the way he talked about things shifted the world into a new perspective for me. Ever since then, I've wanted to read more of his books so I'm very happy to have finally gotten around to this one. I listened to the audiobook (which he narrates himself) and I finished it in one go. I'm not exactly sure how to rate and review nonfiction yet, so here are some topics that I found fascinating:- an excess of information is more likely to be overwhelming rather than helpful - people were shown silent 2-5 second clips of a professor and asked whether they think that professor is good or not. Their conclusions based on the short clips were consistent with feedback from students who have taken classes with those professors. - a group of people (different genders and different races) were sent to a car dealership and asked to negotiate for a car. They were all given the same backstory. They all came across different results. - people can't actually control their expressions as well as they think they can. I loved listening to this book. It brought to my attention many things that I have never considered before, and I'm looking forward to reading Gladwell's other books as well. "
88,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16870554-janelle,5,"Malcolm Gladwell has a fascinating way of sorting out interesting phenomena in our world, and once again I feel I've learned a lot reading this over the last few weeks. I also enjoyed it because he writes like he talks, and I know that because I've enjoyed many of his podcasts (Revisionist History). This book was written in 2005, and since then many of the things he discusses are still relevant, in particular how we can influence our response to race by being exposed to the good in that race, e.g. pictures of Rev Martin Luther King (and how we can't otherwise easily change that snap /subconscious impression...even African Americans have negative responses to people in their race on certain tests...). And the most fascinating chapter to me, ""Seven Seconds in the Bronx""...wow, learning how to read faces, (we all do as we age with experience, but some people are masters of it...), and that we need TIME to read faces, so police officers should not have partners, as it makes them much quicker to respond without fully analyzing situations *and shooting or antagonizing innocent people! (I'm going to pay attention going forward how often innocent people are shot in these race-motivated shootings when there are 2 police officers...) . Fascinating book in other ways, too. "
89,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2764185-chris-shank,4,"First of all, the subtitle. “The power of thinking without thinking.” Not a very honest beginning. It felt very sophomoric, almost slimy, like a ‘get smart quick’ kind of sell. And that completely asinine phrase inside the front flap, “Don’t think—blink!” What do we have here? A ‘28th habit’ to seduce the bourgeois into thinking he can make his enterprise—be it a career, business, or relationship—soar beyond his philistine peers? In other words, yet another leadership book?Well, I was wrong…or the Little Brown marketing team is a bunch of leadership junkies. The basic principle of Blink is that ‘decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.’ If this sounds like a truism, that’s because it is; but in this our Age of Information, where developed intellectual prowess and academic pursuits are touted as the key to success, influence, and even happiness, the reminder and thorough illustration of the power of raw, instinctual ability that each individual is born with is much needed. Opportunity for cultured talent is available to anybody, in any situation, because each of us is born with a power of mind/body that in some unique way is unparalleled even by the most gifted minds. In the words of Carl Jung, (who used the terms ‘unconscious’ and ‘conscious’ in place of ‘instinct’ and ‘intellect’, respectively) we are each born with a field of unconscious experience and skill that is infinite and unfathomed in our singular and relatively short-lived lives. Gladwell, I think, is really pushing Blink as an egalitarian value and leveler across pedigrees and social privilege. “The power of knowing, in that first two seconds, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few. It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves…Thin-slicing is not an exotic gift. It is a central part of what it means to be human.”I learned so much from Gladwell’s breakdown of ‘thin-slicing’, the ability to take a small sample of experience and interpret accurately the meaning of a moment or future results in a few milliseconds of instinctual reflex. It’s actually a fun experiment to think of all the incredible thin-slicers we know that are experts in one form or another—be it the social, mechanical, philosophical, athletic, scientific or artistic realms. Snap-judgment had a bad connotation in my mind before reading this, but now I can dub this reflex ‘thin-slicing’ and embrace the sheer genius of it all. That’s how I roll.The idea of psychological priming was also so intriguing to me. To think that a mere image or suggestive thought can do so much to determine our reflexive, unconscious responses! This can work in our favor, or against us. Gladwell cites several studies in which the unconscious attitudes of the subjects were incompatible with their stated conscious values. An opportunity to take a quick test in the book confirmed the fear that we are all operating on some measure of sickeningly deficient stereotypes that we fall back on in alarm or haste. However, there is hope. We can’t help it in the moment, but we can help it before the moment by preparation and intentional priming. A simple primed image or word may be enough to condition the brain to be better managed in unplanned moments. “Our first impressions are generated by our experiences and our environment, which means that we can change our first impressions—we can alter the way we thin-slice—by changing the experiences that comprise those impressions.” Even something as seemingly insignificant as voluntary facial expressions can prime our thoughts to become more positive.This leads to Gladwell’s assertion that spontaneity isn’t random. There are truly times in our lives and endeavors when time is severely limited, and the best decision has to be a quick decision, or opportunities go up in flame. The best choices can be instantaneous, but the difference between a good blink and a bad blink is literally in the past. The present ‘you’ is almost literally the autopilot of the past ‘you’. Don’t over-think that. If the heart rate is over 145 beats per minute, motor skills begin to lock up; and after 175 there is absolute breakdown of mental functioning. What keeps the heart rate down in moments of crisis? Familiarity, vitality, and structure; and all these are fostered before moments of crisis.The author made a good case against over-verbalizing our thoughts, presuming to be able to explain all of our motives or foreign situations we find ourselves in. Doing so can badly misconstrue what has happened in moments that are incomprehensible to the conscious mind. It is called “verbal overshadowing”, and the only people who are able to successfully describe their motives or ‘blinks’ are the experts that have thoroughly familiarized themselves with a pscho-somatic activity or an experience. Even then the caution stands.The last half of the book felt repetitive, maybe because I was ‘blinking’ to conclusions, or maybe because it really was repetitive. After all that talk about priming and avoiding creating premature interpretations, surely we wouldn’t expect Gladwell to miss an opportunity to prime us with as many illustrations—‘pictures’—and expert interpretation as he could with the remaining pages! I was a little disappointed that he didn’t lean away from illustration to more strategic instruction in the last half, but I suppose I can personalize it for myself. Overall a really neat book, and inspiring to focus on ways that I can prime and support better reflexive decisions—blinks—in the future."
90,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1136632-britt-brooke,3,"After recently hearing the insanely intelligent and likable Gladwell on Armchair Expert (Dax Shepard’s podcast), I immediately listened to his latest book: “Talking to Strangers.” Now, I’m shuffling through his backlist. He brings forth such interesting topics and insights. This focuses on the power of rapid cognition, “thin slicing” inside and outside of context, and manipulating first impressions. "
91,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10507936-fares,4,"I understand the frustration with some of the reviews posted about this book; mainly of inconsistencies and for Gladwell not making a clear recommendation or even acknowledging that inconsistency. It is true. However, in the paper copy that I have, Gladwell added an afterward where he did just that (in response to his critics? idk). And it was honestly my favorite part of the book. It put things together and linked the many examples that had been discussed earlier in the book. Overall, it was a really nice read. I would still have preferred a more in-depth evaluation and discussion, but I still recommend this book nevertheless."

If you've read the former, I think there's nothing wrong with reading the latter, too - the stories are different, the tone is different, and Blink will only take you a day to get through, so why not? Of course, this book's been huge since 2007 and I'm only getting around to reading it now, so this advice is probably not going to apply to too many people."
93,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5663125-anna,5,"I listened to this on audio book and it's possible that the enchanting tone of Gladwell's voice pushed this from a 4 to a 5 star read. I love the stories that bring various studies and facts to the real world. Learning more about how the brain makes choices and judgments is almost like lifting a screen to reveal what is happening behind the curtain. Even though it was written in 2005, it is very relevant today and the interest in bias."

96,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1887894-margo,5,"This is my penultimate (That is until he writes a new one) Gladwell book to read. Like all of his books, I found this one to be incredible. It caused me to think about what snap judgment decisions I make and have the ability to make accurately. I also found the section on the height of men and the challenges of excelling in the business world hilarious, as this is something I have spoken about with several friends. It was nice to have the evidence to support my speculations about the challenges for shorter men. I found the section about the challenges and ramifications of forcing someone to describe things in words rather than go off their gut instinct (ex. identifying someone in a police line-up) extremely interesting. I wonder if there are applications for this principle in teaching when we force students to describe things excessively or how they made a decision to a point of spoiling or tampering with the actual reality of the snap judgment. Definitely several things to think about with the book. Off to my last of Gladwell's books to finally have read all his published works!"

So,i can say that it is very easy to read this book.The more you flip the pages,the better will know about the instinctive nature of human being,often identified as the unconscious mind which plays its game at the other side of the door of our conscious mind;while sometimes it bubbles up at the surface of our conciousness instantly so that our organism react so fast that we get utterly shocked by the act we have done.And that's why it is necessary for us to analyse and observe our every day action with great subtlety"
100,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28599334-kasinath,5,"This book gives a description of all the miracles the unconscious part of the human brain can do which we are not aware of. Our life could take different paths depending upon the judgements we take in our lifetime right from our childhood. Blink is an attempt to understand this magical and mysterious thing called judgement through all the stories and studies. The first lesson of Blink is to make us convince the fact that the decisions made quickly can be as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately. These are the decisions that are made by our subconscious mind and these could be trusted. Our unconscious is a powerful weapon in our arsenal but is fallible, as the judgements taken by it is influenced by the surroundings and hence could be distracted. So the second lesson of this book is to make us understand when we should trust our instincts. The third lesson is to make us understand that the snap judgements can be educated and developed. There can be as much value in the blink of an eye as in months of rational analysis. The instances quoted by the author make us feel amazed, as we come to know how our brain functions. Our unconscious has the ability to find patterns in the situations and behaviour based on the slices of experience and this is what makes it exceptional. Being successful in any task doesn’t depend on the quantum of knowledge we have, it all depends on the understanding we have of that knowledge. A large amount of information is not necessary to crack a case, all that is required in the equal number of equations as those of the variables. When we have a large amount of information with us, then we tend to miss the small information which has to be in our mind, we get lost in the mire. For example in the attack on the pearl harbour by Japan, the US army had each and every information of the Japanese army, they were able to crack their signals and interpret the information, they were able to read the confidential mails etc. Even with this enormous amount of information they weren’t able to predict the attack. Not always does our subconscious provide correct judgements. For example can we judge the cold drink by tasting one sip of each Pepsi and Cola? This was the main mistake done by Pepsi when New Cola was launched. But when can our subconscious be trusted? Considering our previous example of determining the cold drinks…there are two persons named Civille and Heylmun, who taste food for living. When this test (Cold drink) was done on them, they were successful because they have a clear understanding of all the tastes and they are the best in that field. So now we know when to trust our own subconscious. For instance we could consider the example of our Captain Dhoni … how can he keep his cool and think in the difficult situations unlike other players? How did he build up the confidence that he can pull out the match in the last over? This comes from the experience and understanding.The next learning of Blink is to make us convince that by changing the facial expressions we could change the mood. By observing the facial expressions we could actually read the minds of the people, know whether the person is telling the truth or misleading us. But to develop this ability it takes a lot of effort, Paul Ekman has worked for around 7 years and came up with some 10000 facial expressions which could be noticed by the movement of the facial muscles. He could read the facial expressions of the people without much effort unlike us.This book makes us think of all the decisions we had taken in the past whether it may be conscious or unconscious and help us understand our abilities. The key learning of this book is that the unconscious mind cannot function at its best when we are under stress and when there is a time constraint. All the learning from this book is easier said than done but here Malcolm Gladwell had provided various instances where actually people have developed these skills and this boosts our confidence that we also could do train our unconscious."
101,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92134013-katelyn,4,"I really enjoyed this book and traversing the positives and negatives of ""thin-slicing."" This book took quite a while to read and digest, so I wish the ending had been a tad different."
102,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi,4,"Malcolm Gladwell's Blink makes a great first impression. Which is fitting, because that's what it's all about.The New Yorker mag staffer and author of acclaimed The Tipping Point focuses on people's snap judgments.How can an art expert tell - all scientific evidence aside - that a statue is a fake?How can a man watch a couple talk for 15 minutes and predict with 95 per cent accuracy whether they'll be together in 15 years?How can a bunch of police in the Bronx shoot and kill an innocent black man?Through stories within stories and lots of scientific examples, Gladwell demonstrates the power of the unconscious, or as he calls it in his book's subtitle, ""the power of thinking without thinking.""Gladwell's stories can seem initially trivial. In a look at Madison Avenue's failure with New Coke, he shows us why, for instance, we might choose one brand of cola over another, even though our taste buds tell us otherwise. Obvious, no?But Gladwell uses this story about the power of branding and image-making to illustrate a more fascinating one about the marketing of a rock singer named Kenna. All music industry experts feel he's the next big thing, even though radio stations and test groups don't like him. Sometimes, especially with something cutting-edge, our first impressions might be wrong. We don't understand the new. Leave it to the experts.Yet often the so-called experts can do too much thinking. One of Gladwell's most telling stories concerns an upstart doctor who worked at Chicago's Cook County Hospital's trauma centre, the inspiration for the TV show ER.Faced with limited resources, he found a way - using only a handful of data - to predict with 95 per cent accuracy whether incoming patients were suffering from heart attacks. His technique proved cheaper, less time-consuming and more accurate than the previous method, which required a battery of tests. Too much information can mislead you.The practical applications of the book are immense, as the sections about malpractice suits, police violence and blind musical auditions illustrate. When an expert points out the four subtle communication patterns that show if a relationship is in trouble, it forces you to look at yourself.Sure, Gladwell often wraps up his arguments too tidily, and his storytelling style can become formulaic, but he's writing a book for a general audience. If you're looking for more depth, consult the bibliography.The only element that gives pause is the price tag. Thirty-eight dollars for a slim book with big type and no glossy illustrations? Now, that makes you blink. Originally published in NOW Magazine: https://nowtoronto.com/art-and-books/..."
103,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5860412-joseph,3,"3.5 *This is Malcolm Gladwell's second book after The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference and the second book of his I read in the space of a couple of weeks. Unsurprisingly, there are similarities in Gladwell's approach to his themes. He starts with an arresting anecdote, which he uses to introduce his subject. Then, after setting out the elements of his thesis, he addresses them one by one in the ensuing chapters, illustrating his points with intriguing examples, stories and references to psychological experiments.In many ways, Gladwell's second book is even more ambitious than ""The Tipping-Point"". In the latter work, he sought to explain ""cultural/social epidemics"" or what makes a particular idea or product suddenly popular. In this book, he not only tries to explain what goes on in our minds when we make ""snap judgments"", but, as declared in the introduction ""the third and most important task of this book is to convince you that our snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled"". After reading the introduction, one would surely be forgiven for expecting this to be a ""self-help book"", a guide to harnessing the power of ""thin slicing"" or ""making a little knowledge going a long way"". The problem is that the book is nothing of the sort. Its initial message seems to be that ""snap judgments"" are great: art experts recognise forgeries when all evidence points to the contrary, a particular psychologist is able to predict the longevity of a marriage just by watching moments of a conversation between a couple - the list of such amazing examples just goes on. However, most of the book is then spent describing what can go wrong with snap judgments. And an awful lot can go wrong, apparently. Unconscious bias affects even the fairest of subjects, stress can turn us momentarily ""autistic"", some matters just cannot be assessed through ""first impressions"". The conclusion seems to be that there are no magic solutions to these shortcomings - except becoming experts in our respective fields, being conscious of our unconscious bias (and consciously trying to overcome it) and training to either avoid or get used to stressful situations. There's no denying Gladwell's flowing and entertaining style and I will treasure some of the insights contained in the book (I was particularly struck by the evidence for ""unconscious bias""). However, at the end of this read I felt somewhat let down. Thinking without thinking? Think again..."
104,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,5,"After finishing The Tipping Point, I remember thinking that if I were a more intelligent person or a better critical thinker, I could probably poke major holes in this theory. But I loved Gladwell’s fascinating illustrative examples, and his writing was so engaging and enjoyable to read that I didn’t much care. I felt the same way about Blink, to an extent, although I somehow felt that the points made in Blink were more sound.What The Tipping Point was to viral marketing, Blink is to snap judgments. Gladwell’s thesis in Blink is that we are often more successful when we rely on our spontaneous bursts of intuition than when we make careful, well-informed decisions. He supports his thesis with wide-ranging examples, from speed dating to improv comedy to the Vietnam battlefield to the emergency room. He brings counter-examples as well, making it clear that while relying on intuition is superior to planned decision-making in some cases, it can also lead you astray. He describes misleading cola taste tests, police shootings gone wrong, and automatic decisions affected by unwitting racism or sexism from people who might profess to be entirely open-minded and objective on a conscious level. As someone who often struggles with the need to trust my instincts and make decisions quickly vs. my preference for the illusion of control that comes with a well-researched decision, the two sides of this issue resonated with me. At the end of the book, in a section which was unfortunately brief compared with the foregoing more developed sections, Gladwell describes a few possibilities for training our intuition and/or channeling it so as to minimize its flaws and maximize its utility.Overall, Blink combined several qualities I appreciate in a book and don’t often find together. It was a quick and easy read, but thought-provoking and intelligent at the same time. The writing was clear and accessible, evocative, and often humorous. I highly recommend Blink to someone who’s seeking a provocative and stimulating read that’s worthwhile but not overly challenging."
105,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/584195-natali,3,"This book perplexed me. While I enjoyed the anecdotes about how most people are naturally intuitive about most situations, I did not really understand the way Gladwell discussed the inverse of his theory. He takes great pains to illustrate that ""decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately."" But then he throws in a chapter about how dangerous it can be to act on an impulse for people in sales or law enforcement. In the case of the policemen who shot an innocent man in the Bronx, his point is that they acted too quickly and instinctually. So is thin-slicing a situation good or bad? It is not until the Afterword, published after the first edition of Blink, that Gladwell really articulates his call to action: ""The key to good decision making is not knowledge. It is understanding. We are swimming in the former. We are desperately lacking in the latter."" This reminds me of a quote by T.S. Eliot: ""Where is all the knowledge we lost with information?"" We live in a world where we can have the answers to any question without serious research or discussion. A simple Google search will produce a perfunctory knowledge of almost anything, but not necessarily understanding. I think what Gladwell means to say is that there are things in life that we learn to understand based on our life experience, and when it comes to those things, we should trust our gut. On the flipside, there are things in life that we rush to judge based on outside influences such as race, class, and gender, and those judgments are neither valid nor reliable. I'm not sure I would have been able to understand that message from Blink had I not been familiar with Gladwell's theories, having just read Outliers. Nevertheless, it was a meaningful message and I am glad that he took the time to disseminate it, however incompletely. Oh, and the part about taste testing mayonnaise made me nearly gag on an airplane. "
106,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/901342-jacob,3,"GLADWELL MALCOM gets a bad rap in reviews of this book for having little practical advice. I'm not particularly surprised, since I thought that was also a problem in Outliers: The Story of Success. Here, it's even worse since Gladwell expressly promises some practical advice towards the beginning and then admits he doesn't have much in the afterward. The few bits that are around may be useful, though.Gladwell grabs interesting subjects and tells interesting stories, much like Michael Lewis. Lewis does well because his aim is to help you understand the subject; Gladwell does less well because he writes portentiously but there's not much of an actual dire outcome. The stories are still interesting and engaging, though.I suspect the limit of practical advice from this book is that good judgment transcends information, can be made well on the spur of the moment (especially if you are an expert on the topic or have prepared beforehand), and is subject to subconscious biases (particularly of a visual nature). Thus we need to be willing to trust our instinctive judgment, avoid grasping for ever larger amounts of information, and figure out what factors really matter. And possibly that you can learn why you make the decisions you do if you pay a lot of attention to your experiences and think about it.While the author's consistent marveling at interesting people and situations may not reach a practical theory, it's still an engaging read."
107,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19804695-maheen-akter,2,"RATING:  1.5  I don't know what I was expecting going into this book. Maybe I wanted a load of overbearingly factual information, numbers covering every page - and in between some fancy-shmancy neuroscience jargon. Maybe I wanted just some indication that this book would turn out to change my entire perspective on life and make me a million times more scientific somehow. Well, it turns out this book was rather different. Most of it was anecdotes and little stories of sometimes isolated incidents that just-barely related to the content being presented. I mean, don't get me wrong, the instances given were certainly interesting ... but more often than not, they were unconvincing and generally weak when trying to reinforce the point at hand. One of my especially favourite chapters was chapter 4, in which Gladwell spends all of 50 pages describing three stories in which absolutely nothing relevant or important or ground-breaking happens. Chapter 5 is even worse.The book talked about a few concepts relating to the idea of our unconscious (which works in mysterious ways!!!1!!), specifically ""thin-slicing"". Thin-slicing is essentially making decisions on something based on a short amount of time to see it. Other concepts included snap judgements, mind-reading and something called the Warren Harding error (because we never expected snap judgements to go wrong!!!1!!!!!1!).Overall, I can't say I didn't find the book interesting, but I can say that it was unsatisfying and didn't live up to the hype. I recommend it only to the people who want a quick read that will not fulfill them in any way."
108,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/590650-sarah,4,"I really enjoyed this book - an interesting perspective on how we process informationa and what our ""unconscious"" tells us. My sister, the scientists, tried to read it but could not finish it, and I think the reasons for that are interesting. As a scientists, she thought the conslusions were not very startling and she wanted to know what what going on in the brian (i.e. what procees were firing) when the snap judgments were made. Since that type of information would have made me gouge my eyes out, I was greatful it wasn't included. I'll take my pop science without the background and beleive that the author's studies are accurate (I am sure I would have heard the backlash if there were problems with the science). Also, I liked that he used the studies as a jumping off point -- ""okay, this is what we know about how we process information, how does that affect our society, what should we do about it."" The section on the shooting of Amadou Diallo was facinating: it wasn't about a tragedy of a mistake or bigoted cops, it was about how additional training about finding cover when approaching a suspect could have prevented the incident. Another reason my sister did not like the book is that the book was not really linear, stories were started at the end of chapters and not finished. I found the layering of the story a very interesting devise and found myself wishing it had been employed by Thomas Friedman in ""The World is Flat"" so that I might actually be able to finish his work. "
109,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,4,"Very stimulating and edifying set of analyses about how the mind makes judgments in a short time (a blink of an eye). Gladwell provides numerous fascinating examples of how brief subconscious perceptions can often lead to effective decisions that are better than those informed with elaborate information gathering. For example, that is why �speed dating� has developed as a substitute for tedious rounds of trial dates in mate selection. Certainly there are many cases where �judging a book by its cover� can lead you astray, or where unconscious biases do not lead to the most meritorious choices. And product development decisions based on immediate consumer responses can fail in the case of new products. Yet detailed examples reveal how a brief sample of a person�s behavior (�thin slicing�) can be enough to make a good choice. For example, choices based on a brief examination of students� dorm rooms did as well as intensive interviews in predicting success of job placement. A 30 second silent clip of a teacher or processed recording of the cadences of a doctor talking to a patient can predict performance based on more rigorous objective analyses, such as extensive student ratings over a year or rate of malpractice suits. The book is a fun read as it works its theme from wide ranging spheres and does well in making you think about contra-intuitive ways of looking at effective human behavior."
110,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103544-sammy,4,"I'm reading Gladwell's books out of order. I first read Outliers (his 3rd book), now I've read Blink (his 2nd), next I'm going to try and get my hands on The Tipping Point and then finally his latest- What the Dog Saw: And Other Adventures. But let's focus on Blink now, shall we?I've never really thought about our unconscious thinking process before reading Blink. I always knew it existed, but I never knew it went as far as Gladwell was able to explore in this book. Now I'm going to be constantly aware of my involuntary choices and judgements. The explanations about our subconscious choices and subliminal messages are going to be everywhere to me now. There's no way I'm going to be able to walk down a supermarket aisle and look at everything the same way again. This isn't one of those life-changing books, it's more of a life-awareness book.The one thing that disappointed me about Blink vs. Outliers was that when Gladwell veered into fact-heavy portions, the book lost steam and my attention started to lag. The fact portions tended to be lengthy and drawn out, taking slightly from the overall flow of the book. Really, though, the book was extremely informative and engaging. I'd challenge anyone to read this book and not see the world even a little bit differently."
111,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27375066-alina-colleen,2,"A few remarks: -This is a largely pointless book-The conclusions Gladwell posits are not supported by the evidence he supplies-I'm pretty sure Gladwell had lunch with a bunch of prominent psychologists and other people he found vaguely interesting and was like, ""Wow, I ought to put all this stuff in a book!""-some of Gladwell's observations about race in America are interesting; I would argue that this is the only portion of the book really worth reading-However, those with a genuine interest in psychology would be better off reading the original studies as Gladwell does a poor job of summarizing them-In the conclusion, Gladwell cannot decide when it's better to trust our ""rapid cognition"" and when it's not, which has me wondering if there's any point to the book at all (there isn't)-Developing accurate snap judgements and the ability to make precise, rapid assessments is dependent on the building of a large pool of knowledge-At one point Gladwell claims that only experts can make accurate snap judgements, in which case, why did he write a book aimed at the general public? -Rapid cognition and careful, considered thought are two aspects of the same process, not opposites as Gladwell would have us believe -Accumulation of experience & expertise enables the development of instincts, not reading ""Blink"" I feel less intelligent for having read this book. "
112,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8743445-michelle-only-wants-to-read,3,"Very informative and full of thought-provoking ideas. When I first read it (a million years ago) way before my GR years, I thought of it as a 5-star book. My reduction in stars is due to technology aging. His thin-slicing concept is still accurate (and well supported by research), but some of the information and examples provided feel outdated. I also have since then gained professional education and training in many of the subjects he discusses, giving me a different perspective. I would love a revised version though. To see how social media interactions may or may have not changed (especially youth's) people's ability to ""mind read,"" etc. Bottom line, this is a good book about trusting your gut and becoming more aware of what you see. If something feels funny or weird, your instincts are probably correct. Also, if you are interested in the subject of learning how to ""better read"" people, become familiar with the books of Paul Ekman. Gladwell devotes an entire section of this book to Ekman's work. Ekman is a genius. His work is worth your time. "
113,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,4,"Listened to an excellent reading of the book by the author himself. Took special note of the part at the end where he describes how our eyes change what we (think we) hear, and how women musicians started getting hired by major orchestras as soon as they used a screen during auditions to hide how the performer looked. Many years earlier a Japanese musician was also judged best by the conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic in this way - to the judge's shock once he could see the performer and his nationality was revealed. Reminds me of the McGurk Effect in phonetics: if the *mouth movements* of a person saying ""ba ba ba"" in a video are for ""da da da"" or ""ga ga ga"", we will actually hear ""da da da"", ""tha tha tha"" or ""va va va"". The eyes can override the ears when there is conflicting input.Gladwell's a great writer, and I picked up a lot of interesting things from this book. He carefully lays out and builds up his arguments long before the dénouement of his main point, so you may at times wonder if he's strayed from his topic. But then he ties it all up neatly together. Worth reading."
114,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3939607-reham-almutairi,4,"The book revolves around one main idea: “thin-slicing.” In other words, it means our ability to use limited information to come to a final decision. This suggests hence that our spontaneous decisions are as good as our planned ones. The author brings many examples from different fields to reinforce his idea. Having presented this idea, the author further explains how such ability could be distorted by our prejudices, stereotypes, etc. And how too much information can lead to misjudgment.The book is very interesting, and the way the author presented his ideas then supported them with examples is what makes it accessible to the layman. Also the author did not bring his example from only one field, but rather brought examples from archeology, advertisement, medicine, etc. This variety of examples reinforces his idea of thin slicing and how it functions in the real world. I found myself doing the exercises he referred to and I was amazed of how accurate his analysis is.Apart of some repetition in the ideas, the book is brilliant and is worth reading"
115,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4146153-halik,3,"Blink basically talks about an everyday occurrence common to all of us. We all do it without thinking; exercising instinct.What he does is simple, he first shows us how often we 'thin slice' or make split second decisions based on limited information, then shows us how accurate these decisions can be. He then also shows us the downside of completely trusting your instincts because without expertise and knowledge, we are not capable of making GOOD split decisions. The last part of the book talks about what can be done to control the way we make spit decisions and gives some general awareness of how quick judgments can be improved.Gladwell backs up all his statements with experiments and detailed studies that have been carried out over the years by experts in the field. The most outstanding for me was the section on 'mind reading' and the detailing of the work of Paul Ekman. http://www.google.lk/search?sourceid=...  "
116,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14497757-sneha,5,"Right at the start, I stumbled upon this paragraph - ""We live in a world that assumes that the quality of a decision is directly related to the time and effort that went into making it. We believe that we are always better off gathering as much information as possible an depending as much time as possible in deliberation. We really only trust conscious decision making. But there are moments, particularly in times of stress, when haste does not make waste, when our snap judgments and first impressions can offer a much better means of making sense of the world."" This book convinces you exactly of that - decisions made very quickly can be just as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately. One of the interesting reads in a long time."

The author cites numerous examples to demonstrate how our unconscious decision making works,how connections are made and how such decisions can be improvised by long continual training and developing a sense of intuition that allows us to thin-slice i.e. cutting through difficult situations.Gladwell also shows how such rapid decisions can sometimes be harmful and how people tend to make mistakes by over-relying on their wrong senses of such rapid cognition, all in all not a bad book and most readers wont be disappointed if they give it a try."
118,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"One of my patients loaned this to me after we had a discussion about a similar book I was reading.The central theme explored in Blink is the fact that many of the decisions we make are made subconsciously and rather quickly and sometimes to our advantage. He describes something referred to as ""thin slicing,"" the ability to make accurate judgments based on small but surprisingly representative samples. He admits that thin slicing is most effective when we've been trained or hold an area of expertise.This was a nice complement to Subliminal, the book I had recently finished, that looks at the how our unconscious influences our decisions. Subliminal tend to focus more on the drawbacks of being influenced by our unconscious, whereas Blink tends to emphasize the positive aspects."
119,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49658540-mojo-shivers,4,"What a fascinating subject to write a book about from Mr. Gladwell. Not only is the subject of intuition something that fascinates but the anecdotes he chooses to illustrate his points are right on the novel. The salient points of his argument that people should rely on intuition more than they do are logical and are all well thought out. His impression is that some activities do not benefit from more time to study the facts and doing so can weigh the decision making down.It’s some better to make a leap than spend ages planning the perfect approach. I don’t know if the lessons in the book will be something I’ll keep in mind in the long run, but for now I’m just scrambling remembering all the times I second-guessed myself and were the worse for it."

138,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102473902-anny,1,"I will be reviewing Blink (2005) by Malcolm Gladwell. In this book, it shows how Malcolm Gladwell give claim and evidence of How people make decisions. Is the decision true or false. What is going to effect the decision. Some time Malcolm Gladwell will tell some events and uses a lot of psychology skills to analyze it. And he also use psychology skill to analyze other evidence too.The central idea of the book is that the decision made in a second maybe is more professional then the decision that made in a long time. Some time you think again and again but the decision you made is still the first one that you think. Malcolm Gladwell always use an experiment to start the chapter, and in each chapter there are a lot of small experiment. Those experiment will connect with each other to build up a hug experiment. Some time Malcolm Gladwell like to give some little psychology quiz to the readers to do, then he will explain why he do that, and give the answer to show how it works. At the end of each chapter Malcolm Gladwell will write a result for those experiment. The result is always surprising me. In the first evidence of chapter six which named “Three Fatal Mistakes”. in this event Malcolm Gladwell thinks that the fastest opinion will be form when you make a true or false on some one. As long as we are awake and there are people around us, we always and never stop to producing opinion and prediction about other people. we give opinion by looking at other people’s face movement and the face movement is controlling by people’s emotion. “Perhaps the most common—and the most important—forms of rapid cognition are the judgments we make and the impressions we form of other people. Every waking minute that we are in the presence of someone, we come up with a constant stream of predictions and inferences about what that person is thinking and feeling. When someone says, “I love you,” we look into that person’s eyes to judge his or her sincerity. When we meet someone new, we often pick up on subtle signals, so that afterward, even though he or she may have talked in a normal and friendly manner, we may say, “I don’t think he liked me,” or “I don’t think she’s very happy.” We easily parse complex distinctions in facial expression. If you were to see me grinning, for example, with my eyes twinkling, you’d say I was amused. But if you were to see me nod and smile exaggeratedly, with the corners of my lips tightened, you would take it that I had been teased and was responding sarcastically. If I were to make eye contact with someone, give a small smile, and then look down and avert my gaze, you would think I was flirting. If I were to follow a remark with a quick smile and then nod or tilt my head sideways, you might conclude that I had just said something a little harsh and wanted to take the edge off it. You wouldn’t need to hear anything I was saying in order to reach these conclusions. They would just come to you, blink. If you were to approach a one-year-old child who sits playing on the floor and do something a little bit puzzling, such as cupping your hands over hers, the child would immediately look up into your eyes. Why? Because what you have done requires explanation, and the child knows that she can find an answer on your face. This practice of inferring the motivations and intentions of others is classic thin-slicing. It is picking up on subtle, fleeting cues in order to read someone’s mind—and there is almost no other impulse so basic and so automatic and at which, most of the time, we so effortlessly excel.” (Gladwell193)Actually I do not have that much emotion about this book, because this book is literary non-fiction, and I do not like literary non-fiction. But this book is better than other literary non-fiction. There are a lot of stories and experiment in the book. Some of them are very interesting. I do not recommend it to other readers, but if you like psychology you can try. Gladwell, Malcolm. Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. UK: Penguin Random House, 2006. eBook. "
139,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,4,"The part of our brain that leaps into 2 second quick conclusions is called the adaptive unconscious, and the study of this kind of decision making is one of the most important new fields in psychology.The adaptive unconscious is not to be confused with the unconscious described by Sigmund Freud, which was a dark and murky place filled with desires and memories and fantasies that were too disturbing for us to think about consciously. This new notion of the adaptive unconscious is thought of, instead, as a kind of giant computer that quickly and quietly processes a lot of the data we need in order to keep functioning as human beings. The only way that human beings could ever have survived as a species for as long as we have is that we’ve developed another kind of decision-making apparatus that’s capable of making very quick judgments based on very little information. The power of knowing, in the first two seconds, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few. It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves.''Thin-slicing'' refers to the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very quick and narrow slices of experience. John Gottman is a professor emeritus in psychology known for his work on marriage stability and relationship. ''In one study, we were watching newlyweds, and what often happened with the couples who ended up in divorce is that when one partner would ask for credit, the other spouse wouldn’t give it. And with the happier couples, the spouse would hear it and say, 'You’re right.' That stood out. When you nod and say 'uh-huh' or 'yeah,' you are doing that as a sign of support.''One of Gottman’s findings is that for a marriage to survive, the ratio of positive to negative emotion in a given encounter has to be at least five to one; and all marriages have a distinctive pattern, a kind of marital DNA, that surfaces in any kind of meaningful interaction. Gottman asks couples to tell the story of how they met, because he has found that when a husband and wife recount the most important episode in their relationship, that pattern shows up right away.What Gottman is saying is that a relationship between two people has a fist as well: a distinctive signature that arises naturally and automatically. That is why a marriage can be read and decoded so easily, because some key part of human activity — whether it is something as simple as pounding out a Morse code message or as complex as being married to someone — has an identifiable and stable pattern. Predicting divorce, like tracking Morse Code operators, is pattern recognition.''People are in one of two states in a relationship,'' Gottman went on. ''The first is what I call positive sentiment override, where positive emotion overrides irritability. It’s like a buffer. Their spouse will do something bad, and they’ll say, ‘Oh, he’s just in a crummy mood.’ Or they can be in negative sentiment override, so that even a relatively neutral thing that a partner says gets perceived as negative. In the negative sentiment override state, people draw lasting conclusions about each other. If their spouse does something positive, it’s a selfish person doing a positive thing. It’s really hard to change those states, and those states determine whether when one party tries to repair things, the other party sees that as repair or hostile manipulation. For example, I’m talking with my wife, and she says, 'Will you shut up and let me finish?' In positive sentiment override, I say, 'Sorry, go ahead.' I’m not very happy, but I recognize the repair. In negative sentiment override, I say, 'To hell with you, I’m not getting a chance to finish either. You’re such a bitch, you remind me of your mother.''Gottman has found that he can find out much of what he needs to know just by focusing on what he calls the Four Horsemen: defensiveness, stonewalling, criticism, and contempt. Even within the Four Horsemen, in fact, there is one emotion that he considers the most important of all: contempt. If Gottman observes one or both partners in a marriage showing contempt toward the other, he considers it the single most important sign that the marriage is in trouble.''You would think that criticism would be the worst,'' Gottman says, ''because criticism is a global condemnation of a person’s character. Yet contempt is qualitatively different from criticism. With criticism I might say to my wife, 'You never listen, you are really selfish and insensitive.' Well, she’s going to respond defensively to that. That’s not very good for our problem solving and interaction. But if I speak from a superior plane, that’s far more damaging, and contempt is any statement made from a higher level. A lot of the time it’s an insult: 'You are a bitch. You’re scum.' It’s trying to put that person on a lower plane than you. It’s hierarchical.''Gottman has found, in fact, that the presence of contempt in a marriage can even predict such things as how many colds a husband or a wife gets; in other words, having someone you love express contempt toward you is so stressful that it begins to affect the functioning of your immune system. ''Contempt is closely related to disgust, and what disgust and contempt are about is completely rejecting and excluding someone from the community. The big gender difference with negative emotions is that women are more critical, and men are more likely to stonewall. We find that women start talking about a problem, the men get irritated and turn away, and the women get more critical, and it becomes a circle. But there isn’t any gender difference when it comes to contempt. Not at all.'' Contempt is special. If you can measure contempt, then all of a sudden you don’t need to know every detail of the couple’s relationship.Snap judgments are enormously quick: they rely on the thinnest slices of experience and rapid cognition which takes place behind a locked door of our unconsciouss brain. If we are to learn to improve he quality of the decisions we make, we need to accept the mysterious nature of our snap judgments. When you write down your thoughts, your chances of having the flash of insight you need in order to come up with a solution are significantly lessened or lowered down. When you start becoming reflective about the process, it undermines your ability. You lose the flow. ''There are certain kinds of fluid, intuitive, nonverbal kinds of experience that are vulnerable to this verbal process. As human beings, we are capable of extraordinary leaps of insight and instinct. We can hold a face in memory, and we can solve a puzzle in a flash. All these quick abilities are incredibly fragile. Insight is not a lightbulb that goes off inside our heads. It is a flickering candle that can easily be snuffed out.''Our unconscious reactions come out of a locked room, and we can’t look inside that room. But with experience we become expert at using our behavior and our training to interpret — and decode — what lies behind our snap judgments and first impressions. It’s a lot like what people do when they are in psychoanalysis: they spend years analyzing their unconscious with the help of a trained therapist until they begin to get a sense of how their mind works."

The author's focus in this book is to convince the reader that some decisions made quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made deliberately. It also focuses on when we should trust such instincts and ultimately how they can be educated and controlled. ""We need to respect the fact that it is possible to know without knowing why we know and accept that--sometimes--we're better off that way."" Interesting.4. I found that many of the examples of this book are more memorable than other books of this ilk. For some reason I've been able to retain a lot more from this book. The author did a wonderful job of selecting cases that are bound to resonate with most readers.5. Defining the term ""thin-slicing"" and applying it generously throughout the book. The notion that our brains have the innate ability to recognize patterns based on a very narrow slice of experience.6. Free will...what the science says.7. The Warren Harding error stands out as a classic example of what happens when our rapid cognition betrays us.8. A look at ingenious experiments that reveal secrets from our unconscious. The Implicit Association Test (IAT) revealed, ""The disturbing thing about the test is that it shows that our unconscious attitudes may be utterly incompatible with our stated conscious values."" Fascinating findings.9. The structure of spontaneity...great examples including life-saving tactics as in running an ER more efficiently by making better snap judgments. Ironically, some of the findings are counterintuitive, ""This is the same thing that happens with doctors in the ER. They gather and consider far more information than is truly necessary because it makes them feel more confident--and with someone's life in the balance, they need to feel more confident. The irony, though, is that that very desire for confidence is precisely what ends up undermining the accuracy of their decision.""10. Lessons of good decision making. ""I wanted to create an environment where rapid cognition was possible. We talk about analytic versus intuitive decision making, neither is good or bad. What is bad is if you use either of them in an inappropriate circumstance."" One of the great contributions of this book.11. The Pepsi Challenge in a whole new light. ""Sometimes a sip tastes good and a whole bottle doesn't. That's why home-use tests give you the best information""12. The theory of mind reading. ""In fact, he makes an even bolder claim--one central to understanding how mind reading works--and that is that the information on our face is not just a signal of what is going on inside our mind. In a certain sense, it is what is going on inside our mind""13. We hear a lot about autism but this book provides a practical example of what happens in the mind of an autistic person.14. What happens to our minds under extreme stress. ""Our mind, faced with a life-threatening situation, drastically limits the range and amount of information that we have to deal with. Sound and memory and broader social understanding are sacrificed in favor of heightened awareness of the threat directly in front of us.""15. An excellent conclusion with one of the best examples in the book, the story of the musician Abbie Conant.16. The one thing that stood out to me...making justice truly blind from prejudice. ""Sometimes we can make better judgments with less information. I think that the accused in a criminal trial shouldn't be in the courtroom. He or she should be in another room entirely, answering questions by e-mail or through the use of an intermediary. And I think that all evidence and testimony in a trial that tips the jury off to the age or race or gender of the defendant ought to be edited out.""17. Love reading group guides!18. An insightful conversation with the author, Malcolm Gladwell.Negatives:1. The stories are much more interesting than the conclusion. This is a book of style over substance.2. Very little on evolutionary psychology. Very light on neuroscience. In other words, light on the brain science, at least Damasio was mentioned.3. There are better more substantive books that cover similar topics. Please look at my further suggestions.In summary, this was a fun shallow read. It's the perfect book to read at the beach where even the biggest distractions won't derail you from the main conclusions of the book. Gladwell chose fascinating stories but the science is honestly lacking. I came out of this book with one great concept, the concept of a justice that is blind from prejudice. The book also suffers from comparison and it's not all the fault of the author. Neuroscience is a very young evolving field and many more recent books have taken advantage of new scientific findings to add substance to their narratives. Had I read this book when it was originally released (8 years ago) my final rating would have been higher. In short, you will have fun reading this book but it lacks scientific punch.Further suggestions: ""Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior (Vintage)"" by Leonard Mlodinow, ""The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business"" by Charles Duhigg, ""Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us"" by Daniel H.

142,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32793196-ivan-herrejon,1,"6 reasons why you should not buy ""Blink: The power of thinking without thinking.""According to Malcolm Gladwell, Blink is ""a book about rapid cognition, about the kind of thinking that happens in the blink of an eye."" The idea for this book is interesting, however, blink fails to become a relevant book, or even an engaging one for six reasons:No ThesisThe book is a series of anecdotes about unconscious decision-making. That's it, nothing else. At the beginning of the book, Gladwell narrates short stories to prove that we should trust our snap judgments. However, by the middle of it, the anecdotes are used as evidence that unconscious  decisions are not good.  In addition, the book fails to explain how this process works psychologically or neurologically, as well as explaining which decision-making procedure works best, the unconscious or the conscious one, and it does not give strategies of how to improve our decision making. This fails to provide a thesis and direction for the book, and ultimately, it is just random stories trying to prove that there are snap judgments, something that is considered common knowledge.EthosWhat is ethos you might ask? Well, this refers to the credibility of the writer. In other words, why should I believe what you are telling me? In this case, who is Malcolm Gladwell and why should we believe what he is saying? Malcolm Gladwell majored in history, however, because of his poor grades he could not enter into graduate school. He then tried to pursue a career in advertising, but he was not accepted into any agency, he finally pursued a career in journalism. This means he has no insight on the process of decision-making from a psychological or neurological point of view. So what would be the result of someone who is writing about something that is not their area of expertise? In this case is ""Blink,"" a collection of stories in which the author tries to fit in with the theme of snap decisions; decisions that do not necessarily prove that snap judgment is good, even when that is the intention of the author. An example of this would be an experiment, in which, a video of a teacher is shown to students. The student had to rate the professor by seeing a two second clip of him/her teaching. The student that saw the video gave the professors almost the same rating as the student that had the teacher for a whole semester. However, several other hypothesis arise, such as this could have meant that people give good attributes to attractive people, and that the students who had the teacher for a semester were biased and saw evidence that supported their first thoughts and dismissed those that contradicted it. Or anyone could make any type of hypothesis, the point is that it should be tested again with the independent variable changed. Did Gladwell thought about this? No. Why? Because he doesn't know how to use the scientific method. Why? Because he is not a psychologist, but rather a journalist.Old or CommonWell, if Blink is a series of anecdotes they must be interesting or the experiments must be new, right? Nope. They are old or common. The book was published in 2005 and there are experiments in the book that were done in the 1980's. That is more than 20 years and psychology is a field that is constantly evolving in a short time period. In the 1950's behaviorism was the dominant school of thought in the U.S. but 20 years later, it was overshadowed by the cognitive revolution of 1960. In addition, one of the stories Gladwell narrates is where a police officer shot a civilian that was innocent. Is this story interesting enough that it should be included into a book? Maybe, if it was used to explain a psychological process or serve as evidence for a theory. But in blink it is evidence that humans use snap decisions. In my opinion, there are far more interesting stories that could have made a greater impact on the readers.ExplanationsIt has already been stated that Gladwell does not explain the process of unconscious decision-making, how to improve them, when should we choose the snap judgments or the conscious ones, how we developed an unconscious instant judgment or where does decision-making lie in the brain. It is only anecdotes that are written in a way as to fill in pages. The book is more than 250 pages and instead this could have been a magazine article with a few examples that relate to the theme.Interesting parts are not original; original parts are not interestingMalcolm Gladwell did not bring anything original to the book, not a new theory, not a new point of view, not new evidence. The best thing about the book are the outdated stories, and he did not do the experiments but rather look them up, the same thing you and I could do. When someone else produced the best thing in your book, it is a sign that you should not publish it or at least write about something else.No conclusionWith no thesis, what is the conclusion? Well, I do not think Gladwell knows. When he was asked what is Blink about he finished his answer by saying that in Blink he is ""trying to understand (not explain) those two seconds"" of rapid cognition. Then he continues by asking questions: ""What is going inside our heads when we engage in rapid cognition? When are snap judgments good and when are they not? What kinds of things can we do to make our powers of rapid cognition better? In my opinion, you write a book to explain to your audience, not to understand them yourself. In addition, these questions are the one that he should have answered in the book, instead of asking them to himself.My conclusion is that Blink is a book with a lot of filler, random anecdotes, no new perspective, evidence or theory, no thesis and no reason to believe him. If you want Blink summarized in one sentence, it would be: Trust you gut except when it is wrong. There, I just saved you time and money.Feel free to leave a comment, questions, concerns, or suggestions.For more reviews go to hbookreviews.blogspot.com"
143,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2173246-rishi-prakash,4,"This is a very different take on ""decision making"" in our life which is very interesting to read and understand. Malcom Gladwell wrote an intriguing account, analyzing how people think and act. This book sights several examples and studies conducted by reputable universities and doctors in respective fields. The novel is centered around the ideas that fast decision making can be equal to cautious thinking, when to trust our instincts, and knowing that first impressions can be educated impressions. It is an excellent example of how people effect one another without so much as even consciously knowing it. For me, one paragraph of the book summarised it all:""We live in a world saturated with information. We have virtually unlimited amount of data at our fingertips at all times, and we're well versed in the arguments about the dangers of not knowing enough and not doing our home work. But what i have sensed is an enormous frustration with the unexpected costs of knowing too much, of being inundated with information. We have come to confuse information with understanding"" . "
144,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8024216-samridhi-khurana,4,"Blink is an attempt to understand the mysterious and magical thing called judgement, and spontaneity of our reactions. The underlying idea is to recognise the signs of judgement's fragility, and accept the fact that we end up making snap judgements all of the time. Although intuitive judgements are very valuable in high-stress real world situations, it is important to be aware of our own limitations. We are not aware of so many things, and yet we don't feel ignorant! Another perspective that Gladwell presents is that sitting on lot of information doesn't always help us make the right decision. When we look at a chess board there isn't anything that we don't know! But we aren't guaranteed to win as we can't see what the other guy is thinking. The idea being - we can never know everything. "
145,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48753803-aaron-moss,5,"4.5 Stars. Such a great, quick, easy read. Gladwell’s books always leave me feeling positive and eager to better myself.Loved the opening anecdote about the kouros as well as learning about Paul Van Riper and the Blue Team and Abbie Conant’s confrontation with the Munich Philharmonic. Gladwell’s idea that criminals shouldn’t actually be in the courtroom is interesting and worth us investigating further. Trials where race, gender and age are not presented to the jury may go a along way in fixing some of the pitfalls and discrepancies of the modern justice system. Because as this book shows, our snap decisions and instinctive judgements can harbour discriminations and biases we don’t even realise we have. If that’s the case, justice isn’t blind. Which is a problem. A book about our instincts and our ability to understand how we make judgements. Sometimes less information is more. Practical problem solving for the win. "
146,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7632116-melissa-kiley-memoirs-of-a-booknerd,5,"Blink by Malcolm Gladwell draws upon neuroscience and psychology to tackle a critical part of rapid cognition known as “thin slicing” – the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behaviour based on very narrow slices of experience. Gladwell covers the advantages and pitfalls of this type of processing and offers some solutions as to how we can become better decision makers.⁣ ⁣I found this book fascinating, but full disclaimer, I'm obsessed with all things brain related as it's what I do for a living! The topics turned out to be highly relevant to today’s conversations. Even my 100% non-reading fiancé read some of it and found it really interesting! ⁣Some of the research was completely HORRIFYING. It paints a picture that suggests even with awareness and instruction to actively attempt to curb implicit bias, people are unable to do so and that when under duress they are physiologically unable to process information accurately and fall back on these implicit biases. If these are the facts, then this begs the question – are people being tested for these implicit biases and banned from the profession of policework if they hold them? If training exists to lower stress response to violent encounters to allow for more rational processing (e.g. getting shot at/getting attacked by dogs), is this a standard part of police training? If one man police cars result in less injury to both parties, why are there any two man cars left?⁣ ⁣Gladwell also noted that to turn education/awareness into “doing” to combat implicit bias requires more than a simple commitment to equality. We can alter the way we “thin- slice” by changing the experiences that comprise those impressions. This echoes the sentiment that we are seeing everyday - the work that we are doing on educating ourselves with books is only a starting point.⁣ ⁣Random Fact learned from this book: facial expression can trigger your physiological experience of the emotion tied to that facial expression. Sorry all you RBF girls out there 🤣⁣"
147,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90539195-isaac-bouyack,4,"(Audiobook) More interesting than anything else. That being said there is some useful information in here and it never hurts to consider how thoughts are processed, especially when they happen in such a short amount of time. To remain ignorant to one's own unconcious bias, brain patterns, and how they are affected by the overwhelming complexity of any given situation leaves one with little hope of addressing understated faults and progressing to better manners of thinking. Although, the book does make it seem like these type of improvements would be quite difficult. Still, if one has knowledge then one can at least attempt to address. At least, that is what I took out of it.. that.. and it is just really interesting."
148,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60352592-brad-lockey,5,"Loved it.Look, you've likely read some positive and some negative reviews for this book.As with any title, read it and be your own critic or praise an enjoyable read.Don't ""not"" read the book.Thin slicing is a term that Gladwell brings about that suggests the old adage about judging a book by it's cover. Although the term is ""don't just a book by it's cover"" sadly, most of us do.The interesting thing is that some times we're right, and some times we're completely wrong.There is so much going on in the world of psychology and more specifically, human interaction.What I found interesting is how little effort goes into our minds making a first impression ... it literally happens in the blink of an eye, and it's tough to undo that first impression in its entirety.Again, read the book, because reading is cool."

Throughout the book I felt myself having a conversation with Gladwell about the various topics. Blink provides a number of lessons in thoughtfulness, awareness, and understanding. In my professional life, I am a Software Engineer. While some of my colleagues love data and information, I am more interested in the human element of the applications that we build. From my experience, in the two or so years I have been working as an Engineer, there has been distrust between business stakeholders and the development team. It's been my goal over the last year to get a better understanding for our end users, in order to provide the most valuable product possible. I believe the distrust between the ""business"" and ""IT"" stems from the lack of understanding of the end user. Blink points out that ""they key to god decision making is not knowledge... it is understanding."" Often times we find ourselves bogged down with data and information, but it is understanding that will allow us to rebuild trust and deliver a product that is most valuable. "

But still an interesting look at psychology, and very affirming for someone who believes strongly in intuition and ""gut"" feelings. I did not like how Gladwell referred to mind-blindness as ""temporary autism."" I am not sure that that is an entirely appropriate representation of the multitude of strengths and weaknesses of the autistic mind. I most enjoyed the section at the end, which dissects the way in which discrimination prevented women from playing in classical orchestras until auditions were held with a screen. I will try to see how that is useful in my teaching. "
151,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61789690-haley-corkery,4,"A compelling book with engaging case studies. My only problem was the overall theme. Split-second decisions can be good yet sometimes they can be bad. We need to learn when we should trust our first impressions and when we shouldn’t. Yet the book doesn’t offer a distinct way to do so. Overall though, impactful read. “We have, as human beings, a storytelling problem. We're a bit too quick to come up with explanations for things we don't really have an explanation for.”"
152,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49696258-wpschrec,3,"The premise is that we can and should trust our gut reaction in most situations. If our gut reaction is wrong we should consider why it's wrong so that we can adjust the way we react in an instant. Also you should not trust your gut reaction when in a situation related to race or sex, because you shouldn't let your ""prejudices"" control you. Talks about how to fix your inherent racism and sexism.I didn't care much for this book. The premise I thought was a self-evident truth and the parts on fixing your racist and sexist thoughts were just unnecessary."

This book has arguments and themes that are a bit more scattered than Outliers - and left me a little skeptical when I reached the end of certain chapters.

The case studies through which these points are made are quite interesting. The major takeaway from this book: A lot of times when we have to make a choice in life, we get this advice of keeping the bigger picture in mind, but the author here asks us to thin slice a moment, look for intricate details and then make decisions.

That said, if you've not read anything in this genre before, definitely worth reading.As far as providing a compelling perspective on what we call 'instinct' or 'judgement', this book does a fabulous job - hence the five star.However, it fares badly on three counts (hence the two). One, most of the examples in the book are written with the benefit of hindsight. Some examples show the benefits, some show shortcomings, but none of them give insight into how to possibly identify traps in the moment. Two, to the end, there is nothing (not even a nudge in any direction) talking about how to train your mind to make better snap decisions. Perhaps the book never intended to convey it, but felt like a gap to me. Third, the repetition is annoying!"
177,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3472382-ulzii,5,"This book is all about snap judgment. Sometimes thin slicing can be more accurate than one that took more time. It's also about understanding how our unconscious mind works. The book has provided plenty of examples and researches. In conclusion, we need to believe our instinct as well as we have to careful to make decisions so quickly, kind of finding a balance in terms of making decisions. "
178,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7302640-joel-bastos,4,"Blink, from the same author of Outliers which I read some time ago, does an outstanding job of making you reflect on how you decide. Decisions, in the broader sense, always depend on high volumes of data, information derived from that data and finally knowledge gathered from that information. What I took from this book is that we might cut some corners using data and experience to speed things up in a ""Blink"" of an eye. The case is made that relying on inherent cognitive functions which provide snap judgments could improve and significantly ensure correct decisions, going so far as stating this approach is the only viable option on time sensitive and highly complex scenários, the so-called Thin Slicing.Several stories are shared to illustrate situations where Thin Slicing was vital to achieve a positive outcome, but unfortunately, no definitive guide or mental process is provided to improve such use.Some mention worthy quotes:“The key to good decision making is not knowledge. It is understanding. We are swimming in the former. We are desperately lacking in the latter.” “In the act of tearing something apart, you lose its meaning.” “When we become expert in something, our tastes grow more esoteric and complex.” "
179,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"A toss between 3 and 4 stars, Gladwell's ""Blink"" is a fascinating book with one big flaw - it doesn't add up to much - that it takes some good faith to forgive. First the good news. Gladwell's legendary style is unique, engaging, compelling. He connects the dots, paints a vivid picture, and takes the reader on a narrative journey across seemingly disjointed areas of human experience: love and family troubles, racist and sexist discrimination, gun safety in crime fighting, appraising antique statues, facial recognition, dealing with autism, and blind-screen orchestra auditions. It feels like it's all there - life in all its dimensions!Then the bad news: the richness is a bit too much, at points. Like I said, the disjointed picture doesn't necessarily add up to a definite thesis. It's a collage of crystal-clear anecdotes, newspaper stories, personal portraits, moments in time, flashes of family life, war memories, market research, etc... all mashed together with scattered bits of titillating empirical research.The big problem is that the title, and the opening chapters, are somewhat misleading. This book is NOT really about some singular gift of intuition. It's about many kinds of things. The book approaches the question of rapid and unconscious decision making from a multitude of different angles, sometimes mutually contradictory. It seems that Gladwell wants to have his cake and eat it too: he wants to attempt to say AS IF there is some singular force in operation, while simultaneously attempting to show that the phenomenon is actually much more complex than that. In the beginning, Gladwell spends considerable time explaining how rapid cognition allows us to appraise people very accurately, for our benefit, at a blink. In the later chapters, however, he spends time explaining how rapid cognition makes us appraise people in a prejudiced manner at a blink. So, what does this tell us? Is blink judgment to be trusted or not? How do we best train ourselves? Is ""the power of thinking without thinking"" a curse or a boon? The book wavers on the issue. This would not be an issue had the early parts of the book promised something a bit more substantial. We are given many stories towards a cohesive narrative that never quite materializes. THAT SAID, the extreme richness of the anecdotes, and the wonderful empirical data and groundbreaking research the book relies on, are more than enough to compensate for the book's weaknesses. Here are a few things that I learned from the book. The book is VERY compelling.1) Some people are naturally better at blink judgment than others.2) Experience and training matter at improving your blink judgment (of people and events).3) Blink judgment can often lead us astray - without us knowing about it. Hence prejudice.4) Taking account of those fleeting moment decisions can save lives and improve human society.5) Advertising, coupling, leadership, expertise, hiring practice... all of these involve and benefit from incorporating, and cultivating, a space of ""thinking without thinking""; but simultaneously the danger of misapplication means that we also need conscious ""thinking WITH thinking"" to challenge the dangers of falling into error and prejudice. Blink is a two-sided coin.From this perspective, it is clear that the book is greater than the sum of its parts. It actually delivers the complex picture by showing it rather than explicitly, logically, postulating it. It is more impressionistic and visionary than logical and analytical.I would have wished for a more coherent narrative, and a more substantial thesis, to gather all the bits of evidence and information together. But that's not Gladwell's style. We are left with a fascinating and illuminating series of anecdotal flashes. The book is like a long ""blog"" post with hyperlinks to various news stories tagged as ""blink-related."" Rather than any unified narrative, it consists of illuminating windows into the lives of various people using, being used by, or trying to improve - some more successfully than others - their subtle powers of cognition, thus integrating their conscious with their unconscious mind.There is a lot of groundbreaking stuff here, even if none of it is Gladwell's own making. But we also need great storytellers and popularizers. Slightly ADHD, but at least it never gets boring!"
180,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8495887-cassie,4,Another fascinating read by Gladwell. The concept of quick decision making and the case studies he used were so interesting I had a hard time putting the book down.

It started with 50 psychology classics, continued with Victor Frankl’s Man’s search for Meaning and now with Blink.This is an extraordinary book, which explains how many facts our mind can process in the Blink of an eye. We are taken from the Getty Museum to the shooting of Diallo, from the election of Harding to the discovery of Tom Hanks.In the Blink of an eye, experts were able to tell that a statue was false. -	In a test, based on Thin Slicing, participants were able to evaluate teachers in Seconds, with the same ratings given to them by those who took classes for a semester. -	The reader finds out about an expert who can tell if couples will divorce, with a 90% accuracy rate, after listening to their conversation for a few minutes! -	Based on such elements as contempt, stonewalling, defensiveness…-	There is the case of the fireman who took his team out of a death trap, after another BLINK decision. -	Then studies refer to the basketball players who take decisions in a fraction of a second.There is the dark side of decisions taken in seconds, on the basis of appearance. -	William Harding was elected as president of The US, based on his very handsome looks, tall figure and very pleasant voice. -	He turned out to be one of the worst presidents and now there is talk of the “Harding effect”.Malcolm Gladwell researched the Fortune 500 companies and found the Harding Effect there:-	 Most of the CEOs of these top companies are not only male and white, but tall. -	Way above the average height.Studies show that an inch of height is worth $789 a year in salary.Here is a passage from the site-	 http://gladwell.com/blink/why-do-we-l... :  “This excerpt is from the part of Blink where I talk about the things that throw off our powers of rapid cognition. I’ve just been talking about a test–called the IAT–which measures your level of “unconscious prejudice.” That’s the kind of prejudice that you have that you aren’t aware of, that affects the kinds of impressions and conclusions that you reach automatically, without thinking.Or what if the person you are interviewing is tall? On a conscious level, I’m sure that all of us don’t think that we treat tall people any differently from short people. But there’s plenty of evidence to suggest that height–particularly in men–does trigger a certain set of very positive, unconscious associations. I polled about half of the companies on the Fortune 500 list–the largest corporations in the United States–asking each company questions about its CEO. The heads of big companies are, as I’m sure comes as no surprise to anyone, overwhelmingly white men, which undoubtedly reflects some kind of implicit bias. But they are also virtually all tall: In my sample, I found that on average CEOs were just a shade under six feet. Given that the average American male is 5’9″ that means that CEOs, as a group, have about three inches on the rest of their sex. But this statistic actually understates matters. In the U.S. population, about 14.5 percent of all men are six feet or over. Among CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, that number is 58 percent. Even more strikingly, in the general American population, 3.9 percent of adult men are 6’2″ or taller. Among my CEO sample, 30 percent were 6’2″ or taller…”"
184,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"This book is one among a number of recent volumes which speak to quirks in human decision-making. Each emphasizes that our brains are not ideally constructed to make rational decisions; some of these argue that rational decision-making may not be as effective as many think; some argue that the use of quick and frugal ""rules of thumb"" are (or are not) pretty effective. Works addressing such issues include: Tavris and Aronson, Mistakes Were Made (But not by Me); Gilovich et al., Heuristics and Biases; Fine, A Mind of Its Own; Gigerenzer, Gut Feelings; Linden, The Accidental Mind. And now ""Blink,"" by Malcolm Gladwell (author of the best seller ""The Tipping Point""). The book begins with a vignette, focusing on the Getty Museum being offered the chance to purchase a particular work. The Museum used scientific methods to try to determine if the object was legit--or a phony. They decided that it was good and purchased it. However, a handful of experts, after just a quick glance at the object, concluded that it was a fraud. Later research agreed with those snap decisions. This illustrates a key point made by Gladwell: Sometimes quick and dirty decision making is actually better in terms of outcomes than agonizing efforts at rational analysis. He points out that this is what evolutionary cognitive expert Gerd Gigerenzer calls ""fast and frugal"" decision making. A number of examples are used to illustrate how well ""thin slice"" decision-making can work. In a war game, one side (the Red Team) used ""out of the box"" thinking against the other side (The Blue Team), which represented the United States. The latter team used rational decision making efforts, did after action analysis at each step, and tried, in short, to use ""best practices."" The leader of the Red Team worked more by ""feel,"" allowing his subordinates to take initiative on their own. End result? The United States was defeated! Gladwell's conclusion is that thin slice, fast and frugal decision making was more effective. He adduces any number of examples as to why quick decision making works better than rational analysis. This is firmly in the tradition of Gigerenzer and his collaborators, extolling the virtues of fast and frugal heuristics (decision making shortcuts). However, Gladwell understands that there is also a darker side to this thin slice decision making. Stereotypes can end up guiding decision making. He wonders if this explains the disproportionate number of African-Americans who are imprisoned, if this explains why some people get better deals in negotiation with auto dealers than others, if this is why Amadou Diallo dies in a hail of gunfire from police in the Bronx. And this is the side of decision making shortcuts that Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, and their colleagues address (see the volume earlier mentioned edited by Gilovich et al). The final chapter is Gladwell's effort to somehow encourage the positive payoffs of the use of these quick and dirty decision making processes while minimizing the negative consequences. Convincing? I'm not so sure, but the author surely makes us think about these issues. A very well done book. "
185,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59173391-ari-q,4,"I think this is the second nonfiction book I have ever read after ""Unbroken"", and I'm glad it was, because it's definitely a life changer. I think the funniest thing about the book is how the book in itself is an example of the message it is trying to send. At the very beginning it talks about how even by the act of choosing this book you are making small decisions. The cover, the authors name, anything you'd previously known about the book or the subject affect what expectations you have for the book, and therefore, how you experience it. I, personally, had read reviews, I'd asked people about the book, and I was ready for a relatively boring, psychological thesis about making decisions. But it's so much more. Gladwell starts slow. Here is a statue, and here are people forming an opinion on it based on their first, very limited reaction. This opinion was more reliable than this other one. He gives various examples to explain one idea, while tying it to many other smaller ideas, and slowly exploring and expanding on that original idea. The examples are relatively small at first. A statue's legitimacy, speed dating, salesmanship. And then it picks up. How do certain aspects of the atmosphere we surround ourselves affect the way we act in those small moments. In that blink, what makes us think a certain way? How is racism represented in our everyday? How are we racist and sexist without knowing or meaning to? He talks about the way that professionals make decisions in time of stress. How do the people who make important decisions for us, such as doctors or soldiers, make decisions and how does the amount of information processed hurt or aid those decisions? And then, he talks about expertise. How does knowing more about something help someone separate themselves from those inherent prejudices and preconceptions in making a decision.Finally, he ties in to the big problems. The way we make decisions, in time of stress, and in situations that can greatly affect others, is crucial. And I have learned, while reading this book, that we need to think more about why and how we make decisions. Why we act the way we do in that blink of an eye, and how we can make that reaction better and more educated and more prepared. And we can also understand why those around us, and those we blame for their mistakes, make the types of snap judgements that are wrong and harmful, without consciously making that decision. This book teaches a lot about our inner thinking, and how things happen ""behind the closed door"" of our mind. It's a very detailed, source based and fascinating description of the mind in action, but what most fascinated me was the way that understanding this process can help us understand the people around us and the relationships we have with them. Malcolm Gladwell surprised me and unpacked any thin-slicing I had gathered on him. This book is relevant and interesting and connected in a way that constantly reminds you what's going on without overwhelming you. It teaches you without being boring and tells a million stories in a very short amount of time while changing the way you think about life. I loved it. "

However, it also get into how intuition can lead a person astray. (because of the prejudices based on stereotypes.)The book goes into marketing success & failures. Finally on page 179 he gets into something different, something that explains an essential feature: ""The first impression of experts are different. ... it is really only experts who are reliably able to account for their reactions."" (p 179)""Our unconscious reactions come out of a locked room, and we can't look inside that room. But with experience we become expert at using our behavior and our training to interpret -- and decode -- what lies behind our snap judgments and first impressions. It's a lot like what people do when they are in psychoanalysis: they spend years analyzing their unconscious with the help of a trained therapist until they begin to the a sense of how their mind works."" (p 183)""Much of our understanding of mind reading comes from two remarkable scientists, a teacher and his pupil: Silvan Tomkins and Paul Ekman. Tomkins was the teacher. ... and was the author of Affect Imagery, consciousness, a four-volume work so den`se that its readers were evenly divided between those who understood it and thought it was brilliant and those who did not understand it and thought it was brilliant."" (p197-198)""Ekman and Friesen decided, then and there, to create a taxonomy of facial expressions."" (p 201)""Ekman and Friesen ultimately assembled all these combinations and the rules for Reading and interpreting them -- into the Facial Action Coding System, of FACS, and wrote them up in a five- hundred page document. It is a strangely riveting work..."" (p 204)Section ""3. The Naked Face"" in chapter 6 ""... he makes an even bolder claim... and that is that the information on our face is not just a signal of what is going on inside our mind. In a certain sense, it is what is going on inside our mind."" (p 206)""What we discovered is that expression alone is sufficient to create marked change in the autonomic nervous system."" (p 206)I expected the book to end with a few chapters on actions that a person can take to improve their use of intuitive (subconscious) decision making, but it didn't. The closest it came was to say that recognition of facial emotional expression was greatly improved by watching a (half hour?) video training course.It did have a chapter about policemen making errors of judgement that are cured by slowing down, and claming that we are more likely to make such errors when adrenalin speeds up the HR to 170, and when we only have an extremely short time to make a judgement. As I recall, he put the optimal HR somewhere around 140 or perhaps a bit lower."
188,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/667234-james,5,"Thoughtful and more nuanced than the title suggests. Gladwell does not, contrary to what some have said about this book, advocate against analytical, critical thinking. He is saying, here, that while critical thinking has its place in many situations, so does fast intuitive decision-making in other situations where there isn't time to analyze. He further argues that intuition can't always be trusted, and that the more experience and expertise one has in the analytical study of a subject, the better one's intuition is likely to be in that area.This resonates for me. I am a strong believer in critical thinking; I spent three years teaching systems theory to local health councils as a program manager for the state health department. However, I'm also a veteran and I know that in tactical situations the worst thing you can do is sometimes to stop and say, ""Okay, let's analyze this situation."" Gladwell makes this point with a story about a top-level military exercise that pitted a systematic, data-driven, analytical approach to a military campaign against a much smaller and less well-resourced ""enemy"" force led by a retired Marine general, Paul Van Riper, who espoused a much faster-paced approach in which he didn't try to know everything or micromanage his subordinates. To sum it up, Van Riper ran rings around his ""network-centric"" opponent (General Van Riper was nicknamed ""the Warrior Monk"" in the Marine Corps years before General James Mattis also earned that nickname. General Van Riper spoke at my commissioning ceremony and made quite an impression on me.)It goes back to another argument that was raging when I retired - the current leadership fad then was ""Total Quality Leadership"", i.e. what the business world called ""Total Quality Management"" at the time (the USMC had to file off the last word from the name, ""management"" being a dirty word in the service at that time.) TQL was analytical in depth, based on studying an organization's processes to find improvements and eliminate places where mistakes, accidents, and inefficiencies crept in. It worked great in some fields - I was working in data systems by then, and that was one of those fields - where you tend to do the same things again and again with limited variables, like a factory. It didn't work at all in a more chaotic environment, like a firefight, or for firefighters running into a blazing building, or for ER staff facing countless kinds of time-critical medical emergencies.Those are the kinds of situations where the ""Blink"" approach works well, and we should be cultivating that skill as well as critical thinking in our educational systems. Unfortunately, right now we don't teach either very well. Reading this book and thinking about examples in one's own experience is a good place to start."

Although compelled by the curious caption and induced by the intriguing info, I still wasn't positive about picking this publication. Without blinking I bought. Or so I believed...In general, decisions and conclusions big and small are blithely reached in blissful ignorance throughout each day creating unhappiness ad infinitum by the lack of any genuinely insightful thought or serious analytic input. While that 'gut feeling' may be felt to be certain as well as sometimes actually being spot-on it is untrustworthy for use as a deciding mechanism particularly in critical split-second situations involving other living beings (e.g. policing) or where obscenely large potential sums of money are at stake (e.g. pop music star promotion). This is mainly because I'm so unconsciously biased beyond what I consciously think I am that even a confidently-made spontaneous decision can cause a great deal of dissatisfaction or misery, and for many more than merely me. On the other hand, basing a choice on a ton of peer-reviewed research can mislead in equalling appalling ways. So I particularly enjoyed the section about the symphony, and how its method for selecting a new orchestra member came to be radically feminized (pardon my paraphrasing preferences) against even its own best intentions. The observations of this approach applied ubiquitously and universally towards improving equality on all fronts would lead my to-read list. Based on my feelings and backed by the evidence presented in this book and elsewhere however I remain doubtful. Sadly.Enjoyment was diminished by the author's tendency to use two sentences at the end of a paragraph to say exactly the same thing and repeating throughout what was already stated. Interest too was affected by too common a complaint: too long to the point, and thus the perception of a longer, drier read than necessary. (With apologies to the publisher, I have no solution either.)Learned: how it's entirely possible to instantly know something and why internally felt knowledge may dominate decision-making even when confronted with mountains of evidence to the contrary. And vice-versa.Conclusion respective to personal decision-making: Independently arising instincts or feelings may be trustworthy but if a satisfying outcome is considered significant then researching the details is necessary for sure. Except when blinking is the only option. So what's for lunch?"

It presents in popular science format research from psychology and behavioral economics on the adaptive unconscious: mental processes that work rapidly and automatically from relatively little information. It considers both the strengths of the adaptive unconscious, for example in expert judgment, and its pitfalls, such as stereotypes.Blink: The Power of Thinking Without ThinkingPaperback editionAuthorThe author describes the main subject of his book as ""thin-slicing"": our ability to use limited information from a very narrow period of experience to come to a conclusion. This idea suggests that spontaneous decisions are often as good as—or even better than—carefully planned and considered ones. To reinforce his ideas, Gladwell draws from a wide range of examples from science and medicine (including malpractice suits), sales and advertising, gambling, speed dating (and predicting divorce), tennis, military war games, and the movies and popular music. Gladwell also uses many examples of regular people's experiences with ""thin-slicing,"" including our instinctive ability to mind-read, which is how we can get to know a person's emotions just by looking at his or her face.Gladwell explains how an expert's ability to ""thin slice"" can be corrupted by their likes and dislikes, prejudices, and stereotypes (even unconscious ones). Two particular forms of unconscious bias Gladwell discusses are implicit association tests[1] and psychological priming.Gladwell also mentions that sometimes having too much information can interfere with the accuracy of a judgment, or a doctor's diagnosis. In what Gladwell contends is an age of information overload, he finds that experts often make better decisions with snap judgments than they do with volumes of analysis. This is commonly called ""Analysis paralysis."" The challenge is to sift through and focus on only the most critical information. The other information may be irrelevant and confusing. Collecting more information, in most cases, may reinforce our judgment but does not help make it more accurate. Gladwell explains that better judgments can be executed from simplicity and frugality of information. If the big picture is clear enough to decide, then decide from this without using a magnifying glass.The book argues that intuitive judgment is developed by experience, training, and knowledge."
193,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/668121-richard,3,"Generally speaking people like to have as much information as possible before making big decisions. Malcolm Gladwell's book takes a close look at the split-second decisions we make over and over without conscious knowledge. This may be called intuition, a flash of insight, or, as described in his book, ""thin-slicing."" But they have in common those impressions and judgements that come without the large amount of data and time that we often think as necessary to make informed decision.In general, this is a well-written book about a fascinating topic. Gladwell discusses several ideas, such as how (and how often) our unconscious mind ""thin-slices"" a moment to gather and sift through lots of information very quickly. The middle part describes when and why such impressions can go wrong. Last he covers how we can train and improve our ability to gain credible moments of insight.Arcane medical and psychological terms are kept to a minumum. Rather, Gladwell uses dozens of short anecdotes and experiments to illustrate his ideas. Because of this the book reads easily while the author's points remain clear. His points are clear and well laid out. There are ideas in this book and are thought provoking and, in some cases, could alter how some people approach their own minds and lives.Unfortunately, the book also bogs down in places. In the first chapter, Gladwell discusses several stories to which he then refers over, and over, and over. Before reaching the middle of the book I was already tired of recalling details of kouroi, marriage relations and gamblers. Additionally, there are occasions where Gladwell gets a little too involved in making braod generalizatoins about topics which don't seem related to his main points at all. Additionally, some examples he gives of when thin-slicing breaks down have the feel of being tossed in as self-explanatory but on close examination lose impact. There isn't much discussion on recognizing when you are getting a good thin-slice and a reading is merely interference.If you've ever wanted to understand why your brain sometimes says one thing while your ""gut"" says another, or why some people can size up some situations so quickly, read this book. If not, reading this book may make you wonder why you weren't interested. Overall, Blink was an enjoyable and insightful read and one that I recommend. I would read another book by Gladwell."

He was waiting for his wife to get in. I saw her climb in. Before she could even swing her legs inside the car, let alone close her car door and fasten her seat belt, he speedily drove off. Because he did that, I think he is a jerk.Not only that, I think she is a jerk, too, to put up with such nonsense. In my two second knee ""jerk"" observation, I decided he is a sexist pig who cares more about his car than people and is probably abusive as well. I also figured her to be uneducated and someone who is not close with her own family. Does my decision sound unfair? It is. It totally is. I'm not proud of my decision, either and feel like a jerk for admitting how judgmental I am. But most people at one time or another make strange, strong decisions in very short amounts of time. Blink analyzes all the knowledge and experience that go into forming those short amounts of time. Blink is a book that encourages me to think more, judge less and strive to understand the particulars of the very broad concept of history.Gladwell explores a wonderful, wide variety of situations that are subject to quick decisions including the music industry, the reasons behind screened (orchestral) auditions, the theories of malpractice, ER procedures, jam, marriage, tall people, Warren Harding and much, much more. The way Gladwell analyzes the smallest things to provide insight into our biggest issues is smart and provocative. I have enjoyed becoming familiar with his work. Next, I will be reading The Tipping Point, which I believe is his first book. By the way, the other day, Jesse had pulled the station wagon around to the front. The car was idling. He and the kids were waiting for me to get in. When I was climbing in, I noticed that my car door had opened up so far, that it was wedged into the grass and the only way to close my door without creating a huge divot was to pull forward. Jesse pulled forward and as the car was moving, I shut the door. It didn't really make sense to stop the car so Jesse did not bother to stop the car and wait for me to buckle up. Isn't it funny to think that if my neighbor observed this they could just as easily and correctly (!)conclude that we are jerks, too, just for different reasons. "

I know I read everything now through the lens of school reform, and the battle for teachers' and students' rights. And this book delivered. Not sure Gladwell intended me to read that into the book, but it's there. Gladwell has collected stories and examples that support his theory that we know more than we think we know, we see more than we think we see, and we hear more than....you get the idea.He shows how professionals can train themselves to work on less information, less useless stuff. We can learn to trust ourselves and our instincts. He hates the work 'intuition' and so do I. But with training and experience, we can make decisions intuitively, instinctively, and be correct more often than not. So, that reform lens? I was fascinated by the story of Paul Van Riper, a Viet Nam Marine vet who has been trained to wage war. I collected several pages of quotes, and found myself substituting the word 'teaching' or 'education' for the word 'war' and applying his theories to education. ""War is inherently unpredictable and messy and non-linear...the uncertainties of war and the pressures of time make in important to compare options carefully and calmly...allowing people ot operate without having to explain themselves constantly turns out to be like the rule of agreement in improvization; it enables rapid cognition...explaining why interrupts the flow...in the act of tearing something apart you lose the meaning..."" And I have pages of them! ""The process draws you in. You disaggregate everything and tear it apart, but you are never able to synthesize the whole...we have come to confuse information with understanding.""Several important concepts frame the book: thin-slicing (making correct decisions with tiny clues that are easily missed),mindreading (using body language clues to help communicate), conscious and unconscious thinking...my favorite is the 'Warren Harding Error,' assuming because someone looks like a leader, he must be a leader...This is one I'll need to revisit, after the initial excitement has cooled. After I've researched and thought about my connections...after I've practiced.IMPORTANT BOOK if you work with people and want to be fair and professional."

Malcom Gladwell explains the power of snap judgment and it's powerful effect in our world on how we interpret things in an unconscious way even in time we don't know. What I liked the most in this book is the story of : "" The Tragedy on the wheeler Avenue "". The story about "" Autism "" and how people who have autism see the world. is how they have a basic example of mind reading failures . We mostly do mind reading in times of using gestures, symbols and signs and people who have autism are diagnosed with the ""mind blindness"" syndrome . Additionally, the ""Pepsi challenge "" , "" the locked door of unconsciousness"" and the sensation transference. After reading this book, it really becomes very confusing when you wish to understand the judgments you take in your life and the basis on which you make your best decisions. This book was entertaining but Malcom is contradicting himself in the beginning, he states the examples of powerful snap judgments but in the end of this book, he states the dark side of first impressions and bad first impressions. this book is not going to give you a full explained prescription of how you should think or how to make faster decisions in your life. yet, it's an insight on how your mind works in times of pressure, stress that it's forced to flourish and make a decision with the very least of information given. this book is going to make you think "

The book introduces us to the power of our sub conscious thinking and how it can push us to make vital decisions, even without our own knowledge. It is dangerous, by the mere fact that, the mind can weave out perfectly plausible conclusions (be it right or wrong) in the snap of a finger and we choose to believe it. This book, alongside 'Thinking Fast and Slow' by Daniel Kahnemann, if religiously read and followed, should definitely keep any unwanted biases on check, and make the world, a little less ""judgmental"" and thus more beautiful."

Most of these books could (and should) be reduced to a 3X5 index card or a 1,500 word essay at most. I defy anyone to fill more than a post-it on what they take away from these books. For example, you read a diet book and a week later all that you can remember from the 400 pages is “Stop fucking eating, for the love of God!” From an exercise manifesto you learn that going for a walk is healthier than sitting on the sofa eating a bucket of chicken while watching a Stephen Seagal movie marathon. As we say in Spanish, “Mucho hueso y poca carne” (a lot of bone and little meat). Let’s write one ourselves. First we need a snappy subject/title. Just about any modern expression will do. For our book we’ll use “Don’t shit where you eat.” We state our case against crapping in the general vicinity of our dining area and then we cherry-pick examples in nature that corroborate our thesis. Next we invent some “real world” cases in which some people have defecated near where they have lunch and bad things happen to them with another set of stories fawning over folks who separate their dining and bowel movement areas. Sprinkle the tome with words from a few “authorities” on the subject and lace it in overly-academic jargon, make sure the author is photo and TV-genic, and you are on your way to a bestseller.Gladwell is a much better writer than most of this ilk and spins more interesting stories in his helper to the hamburger of the original weak concept."

[see ‘Tragedy on Wheeler Avenue.’ page 168]What I most learned from reading ‘Blink: The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking,’ by Malcolm Gladwell, is that for some people (more often well trained and well experienced people), sometimes, and in some situations, intuitive thinking, i.e. snap-judgments, thin-slicing and/or rapid cognition might yield better results than would careful deliberation. So what? That’s not a big whoop. And it’s certainly no reason to think, or intuit, that you can survive very well, or for very long, ""without thinking.""

I found this insightful, helpful, and thought provoking.I smiled a lot as I listened to this book. It’s about a dozen different stories illustrating how people think, feel, judge, and decide. Some show us that our first intuitive impression is better than lots of detailed technical analysis. Some show us how we do better by not listening to that first impression. We see examples of people who think they feel one thing, but the truth is different.Some of his examples and conclusions might not stand up to scrutiny by psychology/sociology experts. I could see a psychology student bringing up one of these examples in class, and the professor would debate and quote some research for and against. The debate would be fascinating and fun. Just know this is not textbook stuff. This is dinner topic fun. I love nonfiction that is fun. And this author has the talent to bring it to us.The author has a very good writing style. I enjoyed his use of clever phrases such as “thin sliced” (looking as a small amount of data), “drink it in” (when looking at someone’s room), your unconscious was acting like a “mental valet.”NARRATOR:The author narrated his own book.

Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?""I don't know! The psychologist predicts whether a marriage will last has been scientifically studying it for years. The tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault was an expert but just magically started seeing it without knowing why. The antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance had expertise but did so contrary to the science.But even if you're an expert- don't trust your immediate reaction! All the politicians thought Warren Harding would be a great president and he was terrible. And there is the example of when police make huge instinct-based mistakes that result in them shooting unarmed, innocent civilians. We respond differently if we are subconsciously primed, a thing we fail to notice so we probably can't protect ourselves against.The whole section on Coke and Pepsi seemed especially irrelevant and boring."
202,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020983-benjamin,3,"Blink is a quick, easy, and fun read about how people unconsciously and near-instantaneously analyze things, in some cases with surprising accuracy and detail. The myriad real-life examples explored in the book are fascinating, and readers are bound to find themselves eager to share these interesting stories with those who have not had the privilege of reading the book for themselves. Still, the book is little more than a collection of these stories, and those looking for a meatier treatise will walk away disappointed. This would not speak ill of Blink itself if not for Malcolm Gladwell's introductory chapter, wherein the author implies that such meat is forthcoming. For example, Gladwell states that one primary objective of his writing Blink is to convince readers that ""snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled."" Reading this, one expects something more on the idea of honing our instantaneous judgments than Gladwell actually provides, which is a single chapter that, more than anything else, tells a story about how musical orchestras have largely eliminated sexual bias from the audition process by making auditions anonymous.While I only give Blink three stars, I heartily recommend it. It seems an ideal read for an airplane ride, the morning train commute, and the like."
203,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30274173-colleen,4,"I first read Blink as a Junior in college. This book came highly recommended by almost all of my marketing professors even though it is not strictly a marketing book. However, the concepts in it do apply in many ways to business settings ranging from marketing to job interviews. But they also apply to every day situations from taste testing to reacting in life-threatening situations. This book was referenced in another book that I read recently, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, so I decided to reread it.The subject of Blink is the adaptive unconscious. Whether we call it thin-slicing, gut feelings, or snap judgements, we do it every day. Gladwell explains what the adaptive unconscious is, when we should trust it, when we shouldn't, and how to improve our instincts. He explains his theory in the introduction and then proceeds to build his case through scientific studies and stories. The examples he used were all very interesting and well presented. Gladwell as talent for storytelling (even though it is nonfiction), and the book is easy to read and easy to relate to regardless of your background. "
204,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6246788-linda,5,Intriguing insight into the way we think. I enjoyed his research that supported his theory. Very helpful when you choose to self evaluate your motives and biases. 
205,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18180582-sahar-pirmoradian,3,"Blink is about how your unconsciousness plays a major role in the feeling you have in the first moments of encountering a new person or a situation. When an artist looks at a sculpture claimed to be original, he may “feel” it’s not original but she doesn’t know what the basis of her feeling is. And it takes months of examining the sculpture to validate what she felt at the moment of seeing the art piece. Or, a fireman may “feel” his crew must immediately evacuate a building, without being conscious of what observations exactly led to that feeling. Not all our immediate thoughts or feelings reflect the reality though. We look at the resume of a very accomplished engineer and we assume to meet a man instead of a woman during the interview. We hear of a criminal activity in the news, we expect to see the face of a black male on the screen not a white male. Gladwell gives various examples to show we cannot trust surveys because when we ask people to describe their perception using words, we activate the rational part of their brain, which is not necessarily consistent with what they feel. It was interesting to read so many real-life examples on how much our first impressions are affected by unconsciousness. However, the details of these stories were too much that made me impatiently skip many pages. "
206,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/582776-kristine,4,"This book is about the differences between our conscious and our subconscious decision making. And Gladwell is fascinating, as always. He has a very particular style of writing the weaves narratives back and forth together in an effort to present an ""aha"" moment when he ties them all together. It can be taxing at times. The ""thin slicing"" of our subconscious sometimes works really well for us, if we're experts in the subject area (in art, food science, marriage counseling, politics, or war) and sometimes we have to trust and rely on thin slicing because too much info can be really damaging.I'd had friends in the counseling field recommend Gottman's work to me before, but hearing the backstory to Gottman and the development of his work/expertise makes me trust his work even more. Now I'd like to get that book, next.It's also interesting to read it now since in one part he highlighted how bias can play into decision making of law enforcement with deadly consequences, and how our bias can be un-learned.....but only if we consciously try to re-educate ourselves, slow down, and de-escalate. I wonder what MG thinks about #BlackLivesMatter. We probably wouldn't need it if everyone had listened to him when the book came out 11 years ago."

That quote, which I learned from a source other than this book, is what prompted me to read it. I hoped to reach that space, which happens in a flash or a blink, so that I could learn to control my reactions. Specifically, I wanted to learn to catch myself in the first moment of anger so I could rise above my impulse to lash out. Blink didn't help me with anger. But it's an absolutely fascinating read which has shown me that I can reach my goal. What happens in the blink of sensory input of any kind IS possible to catch. Blink is my kind of psychology book; it cites studies, but it's not at all dry. It portrays real people in real life circumstances, with plenty of variety to boot. Topics covered include speed dating, Coke vs. Pepsi, underlying messages in facial expressions, a car salesman's success secrets, gender discrimination in classical music, and the Amadu Diallo shooting. Ultimately, it's about knowing when to follow your gut instinct, and when to recognize that your prejudices are getting in the way."
208,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3962628-sarah,5,"Another great book by Gladwell, who manages to find weird, fascinating sociology topics and make them easy to understand. I listened to the audio book for this one, but I want to buy a copy to lend out, because I know I'll be recommending it.In Blink, Gladwell talks about how split second decisions are made by our unconscious without our even knowing it. This is essentially what some people would call instinct and others might call ESP. We can get a pretty good impression of most situations through ""microslicing"", a quick glimpse of the situation.For example, one marriage researcher can predict with more than 90% accuracy if a couple will divorce in the next few years simply by watching a short clip of the couple interacting, even if their conversation seems friendly.Gladwell also talks about emergency situations where our fight or flight mechanism takes over and microslicing can sometimes backfire because we fixate on the wrong aspect of the situation--our past experience--instead of 'microreading' the intentions of the other person. He relates this as a plausible explanation for some forms of police brutality, and points out ways to prevent it."

He makes you think about thinking, judgement, action and reaction, and the importance of impressions. This is not a book about the scientific inner-working of the human brain. Gladwell writes very effectively and successfully about how important it is to listen to our gut.As humans we are blessed and cursed with the ability to make snap decisions. Gladwell uses many different examples to prove this point. At times, he makes the reader believe that these snap judgements are bad, other times your faith is restored. All in all, he makes you think about your ability to ""size things up"", and make informed decisions. He also is a strong believer in the idea that you can train your judgments and first impressions-give yourself a bit of wait time, and even then, your ability to ""thin-slice"" and size up a situation, will only improve. This is not something I would normally read, but I am very glad I did. I saw on the back it is classified as ""self-help"". I don't know that I would classify it as that particularly. I see it as more of a study of our human condition, and how we can help ourselves change the way we see the things around us."
210,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2205083-bryce,3,"While Gladwell delivers another book filled with interesting observations and anecdotes, for me Blink was not nearly as successful as The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference. In Blink, Gladwell talks about the power of the first impression, in making decisions with good understanding if not complete information and the effectiveness of ""small slicing."" But he also talks about the dangers of all those things and lists many, many situations where first impressions go terribly awry. In The Tipping Point, there was a clear action item: Here are the personalities that make an idea/movement/product ""tip"" and here are steps you can take to capitalize on those personalities. I think it's the immediate workability that makes The Tipping Point the stronger book. In the wrong hands, Blink can be used to wave away every mistake and bad judgement a person makes. "

To be fair, this is the only book that I've read of Malcolm Gladwell and as result I must say he reads more in the realm of columnist rather than scientists. Mr. Gladwell writes in a style that interweaves anecdotes with open ended implications- sans reductions. He, of course, ends his book in a rather cliché manner that we must learn to be less bias in blink judgments- see no evil. It seems that Mr Gladwell is a advent reader of newspapers, magazines, and events (past and present) and its also obvious he has interviewed some extraordinary people as a columnist for the New Yorker and other publications but as a disclaimer one must take his connections with a grain of salt. I look forward in reading Daniel Kahneman's ""Thinking, Fast and Slow,"" as a scientific counterpoint reference to ""Blink.""  "

Someone who can write beautifully about complex subjects and be hugely entertaining and thought provoking.I have read four of his (I believe) five books now. Blink is perhaps my least favourite but still warrants 5 stars as it is endlessly interesting although a tad repetitive.Just a taster: Gladwell mentions how classical orchestras used to choose new members by the conductor auditioning performers. In the early 80's orchestras in the USA managed to secure greater job security and as a by product of this the way auditions were conducted was changed so that a performer played 'blind' in that they could not be seen when auditioning. This led immediately to many more women being employed as previously certain instruments were considered solely for men. Gladwell wonders if the legal system should work the same way so that the jury is not prejudiced by how the defendant or witness looks or sounds...

I couldn't believe the stories the author used...they were quite detailed and easy to understand.I'm excited about the adventure this book will no doubt take me through now that I've learned a new way to look at things. Learning to follow your gut and/or knowing when to follow your gut and when to learn more knowledge before making a decision is an invaluable skill.I'd like to say that this book is a classic and will be appreciated by all who read it....(-:"

But Gladwell's writing is too story-based for me to really enjoy reading it.His idea is compelling and valid:""I think that the task of figuring out how to combine the best of conscious deliberation and instinctive judgment is one of the great challenges of our time.""But the execution is flawed. He spends his chapters recounting details from various stories to prove his point, but he could have explained his own ideas in about 50 pages. These stories should have been abbreviated and really honed for their full potential (instead of just entertainment). Gladwell's ideas are promising, but underdeveloped and over-inflated, which is disappointing considering the size of the book."

I felt the formatting was odd, though I see the decisions on formatting likely benefited the flow. Such a wealth of information, abstraction, and conceptual relevance in pursuit of understanding could only have been broken down in so many ways. With that said, it wasn't overly distracting. I, too, have been judged based on the styling of my hair. That being the last point made, and during the acknowledgements no less, sold me. I was going for three stars until that point.

The writing is light and engaging, the way he weaves a story from a particular topic is delightful. But it's also become predictable and has mostly lost it's novelty for me. Blink is about the phenomenon of split second decisions and 'thin-slicing' information instead of just hoarding it, and it's advantages and disadvantages. As a topic, I don't think it warranted an entire book. The examples he applied the phenomenon to (racism, marriage analysis, politics, the music industry, etc.) were very interesting, and raises a lot of points on the underlying reasons a lot of social problems come from. It's definitely worth a read, although if you're used to Gladwell, it's not as good as his other books. "

How do people assess a situation within a blink of an eye, and make a correct decision? An athlete is a perfect example of making decisions without thinking. How do you perfect this skill? Malcolm Gladwell says through experience and education. The unconscious is a reflection of what we think over time, combined with stimulus from our environment - so, to perfect your judgment, continue to learn. This book offers many examples of people making good and bad decisions quickly, and how we can learn from them. I love Gladwell and recommend this book as well as The Tipping Point by him. "

My take away from this book was that whether we are conscious of it or not our split second decisions are often based on what we have programmed ourselves, or more disconcertingly have been programmed into us, before hand. What might seem spontaneous is actually what we have been trained or have trained ourselves for.This book is a nice conversation partner for the book The Power of Habit."

Blink describes how thin-slicing works. The great thing about thin-slicing, according to Gladwell, is that we can all do it, especially when it comes to thin-slicing each other. We can read humans accurately based on their first impression. a quick look on someone's bedroom is enough to guess their key personality traits. this book also explains how marketers harness the power of thin-slicing and make smart decisions."

You have to think carefully as you read, for it is easy to get lost in the plethora of studies and details . . . when is rapid cognition (thin slicing as MG calls it) reliable, what conditions cultivate it or derail it, and most important of all . . . can rapid cognition be improved upon or trained? The chapter on Amidou Diallo, for example, is as PERTINENT as ever given the too often recurrence of accidental, seemingly racially motivated police shootings. Read this to find out why it happens. I can't imagine not being enriched by this book, though I'm a sucker for psychological inquiry."
228,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/875001-corinne-edwards,4,"This book read as easily as a novel. A very interesting look at the power of first impressions and split second decisions. I liked the way it made me look at my own subconscious impressions of things - I especially enjoyed reading the sections on food preferences. I never would have thought someone could have enough information about the subject to write a whole book, but all the research studies citied have taught me that this is a subject that scientists have studied for years. Who knew? Great read."
229,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2133111-jacqie,3,"Blink is a look at our intuitive perceptions and whether they are better or worse than our logical, thought-out perceptions. Spoiler: conclusion: sometimes yes, sometimes no. Hope that was helpful!But seriously, lots of interesting little vignettes in the book that are used for examples of both types of analysis, but the overall POV of the book was a little weak. I can see why book clubs would like it: lots of interesting examples to talk about. But as far as actual sociological/psychological analysis of thinking patterns go, it was a bit weak."
230,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30020229-seth-benzell,2,"The first Gladwell book I read. To be honest, I'm not sure why I hate Gladwell so much. Maybe it is for the same reason I am attracted to economics. But fucking Gladwell - LISTING A BUNCH OF ANECDOTES DOESN'T MEAN YOU PROVED ANYTHING. I am not opposed to intuitive understanding of a subject perhaps gleaned from anecdotes, but don't insist that what you are doing is science. That being said, the distinction between instant and considered reactions is an important one, and if someone were so stupid that they hadn't noticed that yet, then I suppose this book might be a good resource."
231,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4630466-ali-juma,3,"A decent, fairly informative book about 'subconscious' thinking such as split-second decisions, judgement of other people, what makes ""intuition"", well, intuition and so on.It's pretty standard Malcom Gladwell fare: easy to read, interesting topic, plenty of examples, and presented in an organized and neat package. However, I only give it 3 stars because it eventually rambles on about the same things once the the core topics are laid out and explained, making reading it to the end a chore. Not a waste of time by any means though."
232,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21610643-anastasia,3,"When it comes to Malcom Gladwell, I do have certain expectations. This book failed too reach those expectations. Blink isn't a bad book, I think the topic is highly interesting but book itself was less so. Problem here is that most of the stories he uses to explain how we make fast decisions are a bit boring and halfway through I was starting to suspect if there would be anything new to learn from reading it. I recommend this book to hardcore Gladwell fans, however if it's your first Gladwell I'd recommend something else from him."
233,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7668412-andrea,3,"An entertaining, quick read but pretty light on the science and lacking any substantial conclusion; this seemed more like a series of (well-written) pop science articles strung together under a catchy title. OK, I liked it well enough (except for the silly ""Warden Harding Error"" chapter) but I guess I know now why I've never jumped on any of his books as they came out: I had the feeling they would be trendy and clever 'fun fact' books with a dash of science and maybe some self-improvement tips...and I was right!

I was surprised to find Gladwell's writing to be accessible and easy to read. I do wish there were more of a take-away, though -- is the conclusion to trust your gut because it's founded in conclusions drawn from data? Or not to trust your gut, because it can be wrong? Or only trust your gut if you're an expert? Not sure. But I'll trust my gut and recommend this book."

As with his previous book, The Tipping Point, Gladwell presents us with a set of rules to how our unconscious brain works, and how we leap to results seemingly without thinking. Backed up with tons of statistic data, this guy is set out to convince you that sometimes you should keep it real and stick to your gut. And my gut says you'll be convinced."

Amazed me. "
244,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15368210-joey,3,This is probably the weakest book I have read of Malcolm Gladwell's. This is an interesting idea that was beaten into the reader repeatedly. Nor did I care for the direction book took. It started as a discussion of how our unconscious can make quick decisions before our conscious realizes it but it evolved into how this works in marketing products. To me this decision of Gladwell's reduced the significance of his earlier claims and just made the book a little less interesting.

I know I'm very bad at reading people, and it's scary to realize how good some people are at it. I feel very exposed and vulnerable and may start wearing a burka. The thoughts on bias were sobering, especially where it contributed to tragedy.Speaking of impressions, Gladwell's voice (he narrated the book) make me think he must be a very warm and easygoing person as well as smart and interesting."

It has made me slow down in how I decide to react to situations, or at least try to slow down!

But sometimes, we need to make conscious adjustments to those processes. Fascinating stuff!"

The concept of the book would not have you jump out of a seat like tipping point or give you a path or the understanding to success (outliers).

283,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7831861-ben,1,"Aimless, simplistic and borderline fraudulent, Blink is such a disaster that a just world would have seen Malcolm Gladwell thrown out his publishing house like DJ Jazzy Jeff. The earliest and by far most serious transgression comes in Chapter 2, when he discusses the lab of John Gottman. Gladwell (whose bio boasts of being a science writer for The Washington Post) uncritically accepts the notion that this lab “can predict with 95 percent accuracy whether that couple will still be married 15 years later,” a claim so outrageous that my brain (now eight years removed from a much less distinguished journalism career) immediately triggered a warning siren. As it turns out, even the briefest research reveals that what Gottman’s lab actually does is collect behavioral data from a pool of couples, wait to see which ones divorce, and then mine that data for a model that would have predicted the divorces. To borrow from a 2010 article in Slate: ""[Gottman] knew the marital status of his subjects at six years, and he fed that information into a computer along with the communication patterns turned up on the videos. Then he asked the computer, in effect: Create an equation that maximizes the ability of my chosen variables to distinguish among the divorced, happy, and unhappy. The upshot? What Gottman did wasn't really a prediction of the future but a formula built after the couples' outcomes were already known."" Gladwell, whether through troubling intellectual dishonesty or abject ignorance, does not note the obvious, cavernous, gap between what Gottman is doing and being able to “predict with 95 percent accuracy.” There is an entire second part of the scientific process that needs to happen before one can make that claim! The seriousness of this error is hard to overstate – it is a fundamental building block of predictive science and one that many students learn in high school. It is an error that someone of Gladwell’s stature should not only not make, but should never even get close to making. I do not know whether this is more or less exonerating for Gladwell than dishonesty or dimwittedness but I think laziness is the most likely explanation; the notes in the back of the book do not mention any sources for the Gottman chapter except Gottman’s own website.Although Blink mercifully does not sink to the depths of the Gottman chapter again, it never actually becomes good. This is because it often feels unfocused. Ostensibly, Blink is about the effectiveness of instantaneous, unconscious cognition. But the Gottman chapter and a later one set in a Chicago hospital seem to tell the opposite story: that information can be parsed best though rigorous, deliberate analysis. A further chapter, focusing on John Bargh's research on psychological “priming,” seems not to be on topic at all. This priming chapter, and another one like it, both draw on social psychology findings that likely seemed revolutionary in 2005 but have since been discredited because other researchers cannot replicate the results. Is Gladwell to blame for psychology’s replication crisis? No. It does, however, have the effect of further reducing the value of Blink, a book that already had very few reasons to ever be read."
284,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/903066-johnny,4,"While The Tipping Point was fascinating, Outliers was (in spite of controversial interpretation of Canadian hockey players) inspiring, and David versus Goliath was intensely valuable, blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinkng (hereinafter blink) is thought-provoking. blink is thought-provoking because it deals with what some call instinct, intuition, or sudden inspiration. blink is about the adaptive unconscious. As usual, Malcolm Gladwell elaborates upon his thesis by means of stories, case studies which often call into question our previous assumptions.Of course, one of the main assumptions of modern society is that science is always right. Of course, there are multiple variables in every experiment or test, so methodology and control is very important, as well as assumptions and biases before the test begins. As a result, Gladwell can point to the failure of a scientific approach to art curation which backfired as his first illustration: “’I always considered scientific opinion more objective than esthetic judgments,’ the Getty’s curator of antiquities Marion True said when the truth about the kouros finally emerged. ‘Now I realize I was wrong.’” (p. 17)A friend of mine believes that blink is not helpful. He summarizes the book as, “You should go with your gut sometimes, but you should depend on expertise sometimes. And it never really answers when you should do either.” I disagree. Perhaps, my friend read blink before Gladwell penned a new afterword which clarified things (In fact, I don’t believe the afterward was in the library copy I read some years ago, so I’m glad I bought this copy.). In short, Gladwell’s apparent “cognitive dissonance” in the two messages can be mitigated when he writes, “…instinctive judgments rely on experience.” (p 271) He cites a common example from economists stressing the difference between Hall of Famer Ty Cobb and recent Hall of Famer Tony Gwinn. Cobb’s lifetime batting average of .366 seems significant when compared to Gwinn’s lifetime batting average of .338. When we quote a batting average as we often do, we say, “Cobb’s average is three-sixty-six.” We don’t usually think of it as 37%. We think of the comparison as 28 points difference, not just a little over 2%. Or as the illustration notes, that means Cobb would average two-to-three more hits per hundred at bats than Gwynn. [p. 271] With an average of 700 at bats per season for a major leaguer, that’s only 21 hits per year difference. Think you could see that by watching one game with each player? Many MLB scouts perceive that difference based on their experience.Gladwell’s best advice is in the Afterward. “On straightforward choices, deliberate analysis is best. When questions of analysis and personal choice start to get complicated—when we have to juggle many different variables—then our unconscious thought processes seem to be superior.” (p. 267) Or, as the original body of the book quoted psychologist Jonathan W. Schooler, “It’s the same kind of paralysis through analysis in sports contexts. When you start becoming reflective about the process, it undermines the ability. You lose the flow. There are certain kinds of fluid, intuitive, nonverbal kinds of experience that are vulnerable to this process.” (pp. 121-122)I had mixed feelings on the original reading of blink, but this second reading has been more positive—especially as I look back at all my margin markings and my personalized index at the front of the book."
285,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15762704-nadezhda,4,"Soooo the book. I started reading the book for the book club at work. I could not get through it for so long. That is when I decided to read and audiobook, while I am stuck on my bike ride to work.:)The intro immediately made me disagree. The author says that first instinct is the one true we should follow. The author asks – that is why you go attracted to this book? You liked the into, the title, the cover? Truth is – I did not like the book at first, and was not liking it still;)So, at first author talks how we have to trust first instincts and gives cool examples. But then the author says that first impressions may fool us. Thus, we are naturally prejudiced to women, to people of colour. Bosses naturally do not promote you just because you are lady but not a strong-looking guy. Okaaaaay.You read further thinking, so what is the solution?But after the author talks about many other different types of research. I liked many research ideas, it was fun to listen.In the end, the book left me wonder. What did I learn? So, do I trust my first instinct or not? -	Sometimes first instinct are good. Especially if you are good at something, at some point you have enough experience not to need to over thing anymore. Example: scientist could “ feel’ that art is fake.-	Sometimes we need to Learn to slow down and gather more information. In situations of lack of time we tend to see what we want to see but not what we need to see, and we may act super dumb. Example: when cops shoot innocent people, because in this split of a second they do not notice other signs – fear on face, or that gun is a not a gun.-	Sometimes thinking is not even needed. Just follow the procedure and all will be good.Example: how police HAS to approach a person who sits in a car (from back, with light), but that procedure is written in a way that it gives an officer to chance to see a gun, if any-	sometimes we buy stuff based just on the wrapper. Same as we assume that white male are better managers. So, sometimes our inner gut should not be trusted!-	Sometimes market research shows that new product will suck. But you should feel that people are just scared of your product and you SHOULD TRUST YOUR GUT! (office chair inventor example)-	At some point knowing even more details is harmful – kudos to people who hate Dutch healthcare system ;) at some point you do not need to do all possible medical exams, since every additional exam will not help to give the result anymore. (if you are an old woman who walks a lot and now your legs hurt – why not let legs rest for 1-2 days? Maybe it’ s indeed just sore legs, and you are not dying?)I recommend this book as a fun read, especially to people who introduce new product, or who communicate with people a lot. Well, I guess everyone makes decisions in life,. So everyone will find it interesting. do not expect a lot of tips on how to act. Great research that gives a lot of room for discussion and debate. Language is still kinda boring, I feel less text could be used – audiobook was easier! "
286,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10447384,0,"What if I told you that you could make some serious life decisions based on a few initial impressions or a 3-minute conversation? What if I claimed that some endeavors of yours have a better chance of success if you listened to the voice within you, instead of following a consciously constructed thought process? Well, you'd probably think I'm one of those mindfulness gurus trying to promote a new book titled ""How to Clear Your Mind and Stop Thinking Once and For All"", with a free 3-week detox diet program on the side, and then you'd very politely -or less than politely- ask me to get a grip and go find a real job.Perhaps this could give you a glimpse of my mindset as I started reading Malcold Gladwell's Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. I started to have my doubts with the first few pages. Thankfully though the book consisted of a myriad of stories and examples to get its points across that I found it interesting enough not to toss it away after the first chapter.The book starts with a story about a museum that was meaning to buy a supposedly ancient statue. The museum had conducted thorough examinations of the statue to determine whether it was authentic and the results came back that it was, and hence they acquired it for a huge sum of money. However, when experts came to take a look at the statue, several of them decided by just looking at it that it was a fake. And guess what? They were right.So the question was: How did they know? And the basic answer was simply: Intuition. That was where I started to have doubts about what I was reading, because I had my own doubts about intuition, a word so elastic it could be used in a countless number of contexts. Who's to say what is intuition and what is not? But above all, my distrust of is based on the fact that you cannot explain it or prove it, unlike informed and thoughtfully studied decisions.However, it turned out there was more to intuition than I thought. The author got my undivided attention with 2 major points: 1- Intuition isn't just that vague feeling you cannot explain, it's actually the sum of your own experiences stored in your ""adaptive unconscious"", telling you what you know before realizing that you know it. 2- Our instincts can betray us sometimes. The book argues that sometimes less is more, meaning that the less information you have the more you are likely to make the right decision or to judge a situation correctly, because you are giving way to your adaptive unconscious to act using all the past experience of yours, and forcing too much information on it could confuse your mind and lead you to wrong decisions. One example was diagnosing heart attacks in people who complain of chest pain. ER doctors struggled with this for years, sending home people who turned out later on to be at risk of heart attacks and wasting valuable resources taking care of people who turned out to be at no risk at all. That was until a doctor called Lee Goldman developed the Goldman Algorithm which could recognize people with risk of heart attacks by using only 3 major risk factors. At first the doctors rejected it, thinking it was preposterous to depend on such little information to decide whether a person was having a heart attack as opposed to a thorough cross examination by a real doctor. However, the algorithm was tested for two years and it turned out that it guessed right 95% of the time, while the doctors guessed right between 75% and 89% of the time, hence it was adopted in ER's, saving time and money as well as lives.Be that as it may, Gladwell makes it clear that some matters require long and hard conscious thinking, but the value of rapid cognition is most vital in situations where time is a luxury you don't have, and a snap judgment - based on enough training on rapid cognition - can save the day. But is that always the case?Unfortunately, sometimes this very intuition could lead us astray. The thing is it often happens that our own fears or desires could disguise as intuition. I suppose we've all been there, being so afraid of doing something new that we almost quit, or when something was so unfamiliar that we it took us some time to accept. Take fashion for example. Let's say there's a new trend and some people are brave enough to try it, but everyone else thinks it’s ugly. A few weeks later, everyone thinks it looks good and you see people everywhere dressed in that particular fashion trend. It might seem that people are following an ugly trend just because it's in fashion, but the truth is that it was never ugly, it was just weird and unfamiliar, and part of our brain defense-mechanisms is to resist the unfamiliar.But there's something else that's equally if not more serious than that: Our unconscious biases. As you know, we are the products of our environment and experiences, and no matter how much we resist being influenced by society or the media, it all seeps into our unconscious mind one way or another and we end up with biases we are unaware of, associating certain things with negative or positive attributes. Let me give you a personal experience as a case in point.There was that one time when I was walking down the street alone and I saw a black guy coming from the opposite direction, and I automatically felt afraid for a moment because I could put myself in check. I was ashamed of myself, and surprised too. I never thought of myself as a racist person and I despised racism more than anything else, but what was that? Does that mean I'm a racist?Now, years after that incident I found the answer within the pages of this book. All those years of watching black people depicted as delinquents on TV and movies and living in a fundamentally racist world must have their toll.Now, does that mean we should just accept those biases and live with them? Not at all, for as Gladwell puts it: ""Just because something is outside of awareness does not mean it's outside of control"". Actually, identifying those unconscious biases is the first step towards putting them to rest.Another important thing the book discussed is the Warren Harding Error. It was called that in reference to Warren Harding, one of the worst presidents in the history of the United States, who was elected mainly because of his physically imposing looks and strong rumbling voice which made him look like he would make a great leader, which proved to be a bar too high for him during his short presidency. It's simply the act of judging people based on outer appearance, and as you probably know we have no shortage of that in our society or any society for that matter. I remember reading once that men act nicer to women who look beautiful, and I don't think it's always done consciously. Moreover, in my opinion, I think many cases of ""love at the first sight"" could be actually big fat Warren Harding errors.This is a book about basic human psychology. From relationships to wars, it sheds light on why we do what we do and how, and why sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Actually, it made me think how much time and effort and even lives could be saved if psychologists were given a bigger part in law enforcement or airport security for example. As I mentioned earlier, the book keeps you interested through a story after another to get the point across instead of long, rigid lectures, all the while introducing you to famous figures in the world of psychology whose work and effort were the building blocks for this book. "
287,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1358609-elizabeth,4,"Gladwell argues that our gut reactions or subconscious can both help and hinder us, and that by learning more about the incorrect subconscious bias we can better help society.The pinnacle of the book came at the end when he described the 1999 Police murder of West African immigrant Amadou Diallo. It was the middle of the night in a high crime neighborhood. Diallo was outside, the 4 police were driving looking for a rapist. They think Diallo was sketchy and in going to investigate, Diallo begins to retreat. Thinking he is pulling out a gun, the cops open fire. 19 bullets to the body later, looking for the gun, the cops realize there was no gun. Diallo had been pulling out his wallet: he thought they were going to mug him. An innocent man murdered for an incorrect subconscious reaction. Accusations of ""racist"" I don't believe go very far. I am not referring to anyone openly racist- I think Gladwell's goal was to point out the unintentional racism that most white America has and how identifying this subconscious thought can help progress in anything from police brutality to inner city schools and poverty. An example of successful change in a field riddled with subconscious bias was in my own field: Music. All the major orchestras across the globe were a majority white male. A few females in the string sections. Very little racial diversity. In the 1970's/80's there began to be blind auditions held. And guess what changed: women and people of color began to be hired. Some implicit bias that existed? Women don't have the same lung capacity as men/not as strong. Women/people of color: more difficult to work with. Carol Jantsch, principal tuba player in the Philadelphia Orchestra is an example that gender has nothing to do with quality musicianship. This change has altered the look of the Major Symphony Orchestras. Representation matters. My hope, before and after finishing this book, is that there can be more positive policy and change regarding racial implicit bias. There are solutions. More than pointing fingers and yelling ""racist"". Concrete policy for corporations and action individuals can take to acknowledge they have implicit racial bias, correction, then progression. "
288,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1147843-jamil,3,"This is my first Gladwell read. I get why he is so popular. He is clearly talented at telling a story that everyone can relate to and his use of anecdotes/ the odd study to illustrate his points are well integrated for a pretty seamless reading experience. His argument on thin slicing and those insights or ""gut feelings"" can and do carry a lot of weight. It's amazing what we as humans can recognize/act/think in such a short period of time, often better than when there is a lot more information presented. And we can't really explain why we feel/think in such ways when asked. It just happens. That's the first part of the book. Essentially, the moral is: ""trust your gut"". But wait a second. People are biased. Many/most people are influenced/trained/raised etc in such ways so that many associate negative feelings or attributes with certain races or genders, for example. This, of course, is going to affect people's abilities to accurately ""thin slice"" and make proper judgements/actions, especially when under pressure, as he goes to great lengths to demonstrate when discussing the tragic shooting of Amadou Diallo by members of the NYPD (sound familar?). Or the case of women musicians who were chosen as the most qualified in their respective fields, but only when they played behind a curtain such that no one could see them (ie. they would never have been chosen if they had been seen by judges since those musical roles have long been a man's world) Then the argument appears to be ""Well don't trust your gut because it has been influenced/biased and we need to make some changes to reduce that bias""Of course the book doesn't really provide much in the way of actual data aside from nice anecdotes based on the odd study or scenario, but maybe that's the point. Perhaps when the book was written those studies didn't exist. Or did they? I don't know. Maybe the point was to get us thinking and debate at dinner parties or something. If so, Gladwell has done a great job. Overall, I was left wanting more or some kind of solid thesis or opinion, rather than a muddled point with little data to really support whatever said point may be (trust your gut, or don't trust it, whatever). But, like I said, maybe the whole purpose was to get people to debate this stuff and think, or just shoot from the hip."
289,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86352022-syd-lewis,4," Blink shows us how we make decisions in the blink of an eye, and the great significance that those decisions have in our lives. The book prompts us to improve our means of decision-making and to value evidence, science and common sense in the process of analyzing information and making judgements. Blink outlines how humans make decisions- good and bad, and how we use rapid cognition in our everyday lives. If you wonder what rapid cognition is, I refer to quick decision-making, the instance that we initially comprehend critical information to make judgement upon a situation. Gladwell teaches us that rapid cognition is important, even necessary for us to find success in our careers, education and interpersonal relationships. He makes the point that although some of us can make better quick decisions than others, we can all work to improve our decision-making skills.  I really did enjoy the book. I have read other Malcolm Gladwell books (Outliers, The Tipping Point), and although this is my least favourite of his books so far, I still really enjoyed it. I find his writing to be essay- like; insightful, coherent and organized. Gladwell’s writing is reliable and consistent, interesting and relevant.  His main points, although very theoretical, and some lacking evidence, were clearly established and relevant. I found it to be more informing than motivating, which is defiantly okay, but I can admit it got a bit boring at times. Personally, I found Gladwell didn’t establish his main points as well as he did with Outliers or The Tipping Point, as his writing was less organized than those two books and at times, it was a bit all over the place, even redundant. I found at times, he would make a really great point...and then he’d be like, but not really...cause it’s all theoretical and all humans are different...By this, I mean that although it WAS coherent and organized, it wasn’t written AS WELL as some of his other books, and although it WAS relevant, it was less relevant than his other books. I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in business, neurology or psychology, and , of course, anyone that likes Malcolm Gladwell’s writing. Out of 5 stars, I have the novel 4 stars, but out of 10, I would give it this book a 7, as it is a great book; very coherent and insightful. But lacks in relation to Gladwell’s other novels and has some redundancy in it’s main points. "
290,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39182188-cat,3,"Would maybe round up to 3.5. Blink is interesting, because it’s trying to get us to rethink our unconscious biases, to understand rather than just gather information, and ultimately to take action against bias. But here’s my trouble with it: it’s easy enough to take a scenario and to see the issues of it, the breakdown, the confusion, but it’s another to examine the long-term effects and to truly understand. For instance, one of the examples used from the beginning and throughout the book, all the way to the end, is the Millennium War Game, run as a simulation for real war for the US against an unpredictable dictator. One of the things that Malcom Gladwell discusses is that the Blue Team (the US government) is unable to act decisively because they had too much information, and that’s why the Red Team (Van Rip) has the advantage/was able to undermine the US and take them by surprise with a smaller force. Despite the military win for the enemy, I feel like this retelling doesn’t examine what this means for the US, and why the Blue Team was right in trying to run analytics during the simulation; besides military prowess and a simple win/lose situation, there’s other effects, like foreign diplomacy, economic impact, etc. Moreover, it feels a little frustrating; ultimately, the best people at slowing down situations or picking out the exact emotions in a face are people who have studied these things their whole lives and have been able to develop an understanding, not just a knowledge. And while people (maybe particularly law enforcement, as police brutality and response was a big topic in the book) should learn more, it’s not a guarantee that it’ll still sway them towards more logical action. Overall, I think the idea that we can have more control over our rapid cognition and “thin-slicing” is a good one, and the book definitely helped me reflect on how I develop my “read” of people and how I see the world. But it feels like a lot of stories to support a claim, but not necessarily a way to actually use the information; ironically, this is where we have to figure it out ourselves whether we’re understanding or just hoarding information. "

“The key to good decision making is not knowledge. It is understanding. We are swimming in the former. We are desperately lacking in the latter.”
Gladwell picks some really interesting and obscure topics and finds ways to make them incredibly interesting. I'm pretty sure that I've said exactly that in reviews of some of his other books and it's certainly still true. This is a hard subject to wrap your head around. I think that we're taught from such an early age that knowledge is literally power that we can't fathom there being such a thing as too much information. There certainly is though. 
“Gottman has proven something remarkable. If he analyzes an hour of a husband and wife talking, he can predict with 95 percent accuracy whether that couple will still be married fifteen years later. If he watches a couple for fifteen minutes, his success rate is around 90 percent.”“Gottman has found, in fact, that the presence of contempt in a marriage can even predict such things as how many colds a husband or a wife gets; in other words, having someone you love express contempt toward you is so stressful that it begins to affect the functioning of your immune system.” 
 In particular, the chapters about MDMP, or the Military Decision Making Process, for civilians, was interesting to me as a reader with a military background. The gentleman that Gladwell quoted talking about military commanders need the weather forecast, not the barometric pressure and other useless trivial crap that gets reported to them daily was more dead on than most readers will ever realize. This book has so much food for thought in it that I think there is something in here for everyone in every job. It will have you guessing and second guessing your own reactions to things in a way that you might find uncomfortable and have never done before.
 “Anyone who has ever scanned the bookshelves of a new girlfriend or boyfriend- or peeked inside his or her medicine cabinet- understands this implicitly; you can learn as much - or more - from one glance at a private space as you can from hours of exposure to a public face.”

292,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62662754-laura,4,"It took me two attempts to get though this book. The first attempt was perhaps in 2007 on the recommendation of my boss and a coworker. I was very interested in the topic of decision-making based on intuition vs analysis and I loved reading the first example regarding the authentication of an ancient Greek statue for purchase by the Getty Museum. However, I got turned off after reading about the second example describing a method used by a psychologist to predict whether a couple would divorce within 15 years based on close analysis of one conversation. I found the story of the couple headed for divorce depressing although it illustrated the point about being able to identify a troubled relationship based on subtle signs. Although I am not qualified to question the results, I felt as though the psychologist was playing God and had a difficult time accepting that someone’s fate could be predetermined from a single conversation. At this point, I stopped reading.More recently, while on vacation, I took another attempt. This time, it was much easier for me to get through the book because I had more background information after reading The Undoing Project, the story of two Israeli psychologists (Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky) who studied problems with risk assessment and decision-making by humans. Gladwell does not cite them but I suspect that he was influenced at least indirectly by their work. Although I still don’t have a good reaction to the example with the troubled couple, I appreciate Gladwell’s discussion and examples of successful and unsuccessful “snap decision-making” and, in my opinion, Blink makes a good contribution to the discussion or risk analysis and decision-making. I especially appreciate Gladwell’s points that 1) the best intuitive or “snap” decision-making is based on knowledge distilled from extensive study, practice and experience and 2) the worst decision-making is made under conditions of extreme stress and bias. "
293,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31695593-ritesh-joharapurkar,4,"Gladwell does it once again - He tells us something which we feel that we know already. That the gut-feel works and that the thin-slicing (as Gladwell refers in his book) & snap judgements or only a little information work much better than the in-depth analysis or a lot of information. And also that the first impressions are not always true and we need to be careful while using them. In a nutshell, it's really an art to use our gut feel and it really depends. But to me, it wasn't so clear before reading this book that probably our subconscious can also be trained in some way and how important it becomes to avoid priming effect on our decision in certain cases. Gladwell again doesn't make any concluding statement for us in this book about the thin-slicing. What he does is that he presents his interesting research on this topic through several anecdotes. Lot of interesting stories about the Getty museum korous incident, the Love lab test on the strength of marital relations, doctor patient conversation to find out probability of malpractice suits, priming effect on students for their own race, the Pepsi challenge and mistake Coke made, jam taste test experiment, black and white test, gamblers test, Warren Harding error, use of thin slicing in the diagnosis of heart patients, case study of shooting Diallo in the US and so on. I liked the most the case studies of the Pepsi challenge and the shooting of Diallo in the US.It would be a mistake to write this book off as a non-conclusive anecdotal story telling book. It is an interesting read and left me richer with the knowledge of many interesting case studies. This was my third book of Gladwell after 'The Tipping Point' and 'Outliers' and would definitely read the remaining two..."
294,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40693376-anna-hendrickson,3,"First Malcolm Gladwell book I've read! I'm a big fan of him and his podcast ""Revisionist History"" so I was looking forward to reading this book gifted to me by my roommate for Christmas. Blink is an engaging book. Gladwell navigates through a wide array of topics such as facial recognition, police activity, sports, art, politics, war strategy, the orchestra, and many others. I loved learning about the differing ways unconscious thinking and bias affects our everyday lives as well as in extraordinary situations with extraordinary people.One of my favorite quotes from the book: ""We live in a world saturated with information. We have virtually unlimited amounts of data at our fingertips at all times, and we're well versed in the arguments about the dangers of not knowing enough and not doing our homework. But what I have sensed is an enormous frustration with the unexpected costs of knowing too much, of being inundated with information. We have come to confuse information with understanding."" HOWEVER... I do think that there is a displacement of an overall theme that sometimes thin-splicing works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes split-second decisions are good, and sometimes they're not. Gladwell seems to go back and forth on these themes throughout its entirety and has left me feeling as though I don't know when my unconscious is taking over and when it's not. There is a certain displacement or disconnection I feel after reading about the diverse case studies that I wish Gladwell had done more to connect us with the inner thought processes of the individuals he touched on. I am planning on and looking forward to reading more of him though :)3.5 stars!"
295,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70298156-dhruv-sharma,3,"Written in a forthright and conversational style, Malcom ranges through art museums, emergency rooms, police cars, and psychology laboratories following a skill he terms 'rapid cognition.' Rapid cognition is the sort of snap decision-making performed without thinking about how one is thinking, faster and often more correctly than the local thinking.Gladwell explains how many factors like race, gender, religion physical appearance etc affects our understanding and decision making subconsciously without even our realising that it is happening. And there are many exercises and questions he has given to help understand this for example A man and his son are in a serious car accident the father is killed and the son is rushed to the emergency room. upon arrival the attending doctor looks at the child and gasps “this child is my son” who is the doctor?Malcom further explained that our brain is like a computer which processes all the knowledge instantly to give the first impression. “Thin-slicing” allows us to make decisions quickly that can as good as those made cautiously and deliberately. This technique can be learned through practice and controlled to the point when you know you can trust your instincts or not. The secret is knowing which information to discard and which to keep. Our brains are able to perform that work unconsciously; when rapid cognition breaks down, the brain has seized upon a more obvious but less correct predictor. This is very knowledgeable and interesting read, you will surely enjoy it however there are few repeated examples and also I disagree with author on certain approaches he has mentioned."
296,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7787544-taylor,3,"Malcolm Gladwell's  Blink  has been sitting on my book shelf since it first was released in 2005(?). Gladwell seems to be one of those writers where I have almost everything he has ever written (in book form) and yet haven't completed a whole edition, nor cracked the spine on others. A few weeks ago now, I decided to change that; I would finally read  Blink ! The idea of ""Thinking Without Thinking"" -- what I perceive to be mainly learning to trust and understand one's intuition-- is very appealing to me. I've always been one to have intuitive inklings about events, people, ""things"", etc., and yet am still easily persuaded away from my initial inclinations. I was hoping that Gladwell's book might provide some insight and lessons as to how one could harness their inner guide and trust it. However, I feel that this is exactly what the book does  not  do (if it did, perhaps it would fall more into the ""self help category""). Instead, Gladwell's  Blink  is a collection of case studies/examples that detail successful and failed applications of ""Thinking without thinking""; trusting one's intuition. If there is a lesson to be learned from reading this book, it is one that the reader must infer for themselves from the examples given, and apply whatever logic/lesson is individually revealed to them. Knock one star off as this book is not what I was expecting -- I was expecting LESSONS; yes, a self-help book to teach me the art of intuition. I then knocked a second star off of this read because I felt that the case studies went on, and on, and on... the examples were repetitious and some even felt that they were a bit capricious, and counter-to the argument Gladwell was trying to make; I think sometimes this is called a ""Straw man argument"", or a ""straw man theory""? Where Gladwell keeps the remaining stars: his writing is (as always) impeccably accessible for all types and styles of readers, as well as the book is still very relevant (especially socio-politically) to the culture and issues of 2018: some of the case studies deal with issues of prejudice and racism, they deal with relationships, and popular culture. Overall, an enjoyable read. Something I may recommend to others if I felt they could infer for themselves, but maybe not the most recommended of Malcolm Gladwell's reads (for me, at least)."
297,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51074761-kate,2,"There are some things I really didn’t like about this book. Broadly speaking, it is not particularly scientific. The pop science formula of anecdote, then studies to back it up was not there. Mostly it was anecdotes, and I couldn’t help thinking over and over again - one person’s story is not statistically significant. I also took major issue with Gladwell describing the police who shot Amadou Diallo 41 times as not racist, but somehow only biased (while still mentioning it was his being black they were biased about). Later, Gladwell talks about one person who is Autistic, then describes how it may be beneficial in terms of snap judgement to be “temporarily Autistic” - as if that one individual’s Autism can be reduced and used to other’s advantages. The quotes on “temporary Autism” are mine. Gladwell never seems to find his own terminology unique (or idiotic) enough to single out, but he clearly made it up. And finally, in the newer afterword, Gladwell recommends that juries not be able to see those on trial so that they cannot use racial bias (this time, it’s racist) against black defendants, and this will somehow magically reduce bias and white and black defendants will receive equal treatment in the judicial system. Absurdly reductionist, and in no way addresses whatever racist systems the defendant has encountered on their way to being on trial in the first place. Cherry-picky, anecdotal, non-scientific, inconsistent and offensive on race and really weird about Autism. This book kinda sucks. "
298,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111967812-ian-estevez,2,"I started my Gladwell journey with Outliers, which I thought was a fantastic book. Gladwell made reasonably logical arguments for the reasons why certain people succeed or outperform. Although his examples are cherry picked (as most authors do to support their thesis), I still walked away feeling that the arguments presented were common sense enough, with sprinkles of personal experience that drew me to generally agree with him. So I was excited to read another of Gladwell’s books.This brings me to Blink. Unfortunately, I felt this book cherry picked almost arbitrary stories to get a roughly thrown together thesis - that your first impression of “something” is usually right. Without getting too much into the nitty gritty of it, I felt really what Gladwell was trying to argue was that the subconscious is an important survival technique that humans have. I don’t think anyone is arguing against this fact, but it also couldn’t possibly be the driving force of every single decision one makes. Just because there are some points in life where the subconscious makes accurate decisions (i.e. us deciding whether to speed up or slow down when a light is yellow - the many different calculations our mind makes subconsciously usually lead us to a correct decision), I would think many others would argue with different story examples that thinking through situations is the better way to make smarter decisions Overall I came away with some interesting studies and stories referenced in the book, but no “new” knowledge in terms of the importance of your “blink” decision making skills.

299,0316010669,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46820306-mario-russo,5,"This is a great book. Read the exerpt below and behold what a great writing is.""When Julie Landsman auditioned for the role of principal French horn at the Met, the screens had just goneup in the practice hall. At the time, there were no women in the brass section of the orchestra, because everyone “knew” that women could not play the horn as well as men. But Landsman came and sat down and played—and she played well. “I knew in my last round that I had won before they told me,” she says. “It was because of the way I performed the last piece. I held on to the last high C for a very long time, just to leave no doubt in their minds. And they started to laugh, because it was above and beyond the call of duty.” But when they declared her the winner and she stepped out from behind the screen, there was a gasp. It wasn’t just that she was a woman, and female horn players were rare, as had been the case with Conant.
