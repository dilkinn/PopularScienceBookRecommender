0,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1381799-sleeps9hours,2,"I just read Kelly McGonigal's ""The Willpower Instinct"", so I can't help but compare the two.Duhigg is an investigative reporter for the NY Times, while McGonigal is a research psychologist, and the differences come across in the writing. McGonigal has a much better grasp on the research and how to apply it, while Duhigg brings in stories that are entertaining but stretch his powers of interpretation. His most annoying stylistic problem is that he breaks his stories up, stopping one to start another and then coming back to it later. I assume he's trying to add a sense of anticipation and drama to what should otherwise be a straightforward nonfiction book, but I found it frustrating for him to be jumping back and forth for no good reason.I did enjoy many of his stories though. The most interesting was in the section about social habits where he explains why the arrest of Rosa Parks was so influential while other black women at the same time had also refused to give up their seats but didn't spark much interest (Parks had social ties across dozens of groups, black and white, and knew some people of influence). The entire story of how Martin Luther King, Jr. became involved, and all the people who got the bus boycott rolling is so fascinating to hear in detail. "
1,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/373260-k,3,"Read this because of fascinating NYT magazine excerpt on how Target tracks our buying habits. The rest of the book is not as compelling -- anecdotes sometimes don't support particular arguments he's attempting to illustrate (the Hey-Ya examples being the most egregious), and his section on how social movements occur is weak and unconvincing, and not really about habits, per se. Style and structure were often clunky, and the book seems a bit muddled as its ultimate purpose. I dunno, I guess I was expecting slightly more substantial psychology or social science and instead got more of a book solidly for businesses/manager types and people on the beginning of their self-help journeys. But I fall into the latter category, so why am I pooh pooh-ing this book so much? I dunno. Maybe I am just jealous of how $$$ money this dude's gonna make at corporate speaking gigs. Anyway, lessons I'll take away -- *making your bed every morning and committing to regular exercise are two habits that can transform your entire goddamn life*Diagram about mouse brain activity spike post-reward eventually arriving prior to reward (the origin of cravings)*Changing habits requires identifying the cues and rewards that trigger and support the habit behavior, then trying out various substitutes for the behavior that might achieve the same reward*deliberate advance plans for responding to challenging situations can be extremely helpful (ex Scottish knee/hip replacement patients, Michael Phelps, Starbucks)*With more challenging habits like alcoholism or stuff related to football, true belief and submission to some higher purpose is necessary*in general, it's more effective to change others' habits if you make them believe they have some power or authority over their decision than if you coerce them with force *casinos are super evil"
2,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12827408-robert-chapman,5,"This is great book, and you need to read it. How is that for a definitive opening line? The reason it’s such a good book is because it uses research to explain how habits are formed and changed. Everyone knows someone who was out of shape, or was a smoker, and then in what appeared as if almost overnight, changed themselves in a short period of time. How did they do that? They formed new habits and changed old ones, that’s how.Do something enough and it becomes a habit, good or bad. This is explained in the book by research on memory loss. For example, the research found that patients suffering from memory loss could not show someone where the kitchen is when asked, but once they got hungry the would get up and go to the kitchen automatically.This is made possible by the habit loop of cue, routine, and reward. The cue makes the brain find the routine as it anticipates the reward. A classic example is stress and smoking, the cue is stress, the routine is smoking, the reward is the feeling the cigarette brings.I was most interested in how the book described changing a habit. Let’s face it, we all have habits we want to change. To accomplish this we need to keep the cue and reward, but change the routine. I’ll use an example from my own life to illustrate. I love chocolate, and to make it worse I love to eat at it night. Well I love to eat at night because that is how I formed the habit some time ago. I used the guidance from this book to change that habit. I kept the cue and reward, but I changed the routine to use apples instead of chocolate.This logic flows into much larger problem sets such as organizations and communities. Focus on changing one thing, the keystone habit from which a cascade of other habits will form. The author illustrates this example by discussing how the company Alcoa was transformed by the keystone habit of a singular focus on safety.The book flows really well and uses research throughout to substantiate the concepts presented. The audience who can benefit from this book is vast, from individuals to corporates to governments."
3,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,2,"I was looking forward to a substantial, science and evidence based, compelling read, but just found many mixed up ego and self finding trips, business manager motivation yada, and some good points accidentally mixed in. Read Clear James` Atomic habits instead, it´s much better. What is really strange is that the chapters seem to follow a logical approach, if one orients her/himself as always first by the titles of the index, and it looks like they are dealing with the meta or concrete context, but are in reality just anecdotes, except of some technobabble about Target´s use of pattern recognition, AI, and behavioral science; I mean, why? Was it too difficult to pimp the already written material with the help of some experts to combine both nonfiction and autobiographical elements instead of this? It seems as if many people are getting their swift kick out of procrastination by material available in any newspaper column, youtube guru channel, or whatever, but I just don´t get the hype around it. Worst of it, with this social science mixup and freely interpretation of the stories in a highly subjective style he is entering the realm of, don´t be scared or stop reading and forget liking my review, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replica...You see, it´s sweet if some unique people with subjective mindsets and different characters deal with difficult situations in a positive way, but I don´t get the picture of how Duhigg can extrapolate this to universal ideas as if he would have used real scientific evidence of, let´s say, long term studies going over decades with millions of participants, or brain chemistry, neurology, or anything substantial instead of person XY had results YZ. This has absolutely no worth for the reader. There are a handful of useful tips one can take away, most of them available in shorter, better, free, and easier form available in many wikis (see end of the review) if one just searches for motivation, positive psychology, meditation, self reflection, behavior, etc. that don´t just repeat commonplaces. How he is trying to deal with addiction is pop psychology at it´s worst and that the book doesn´t really offer solutions, plans, or at least good sources for more research is the kicker, as it´s what the title and marketing are implying and promising. It´s not totally bad, but very, very overhyped and the sad thing is that people mind find it great to read this motivating stories, but without a concrete plan to self development and improvement, the motivation fades away as quickly as the memory of the redundant, convertible tiny tales. Oh, did I mention that reading the book has the lovely extra element of being belittled by a condescending, narcissistic writing style? A completely failed approach that depreciates the few, good elements in it and insults the reader. Ok, one more, it stigmatizes the victims of gambling, addictions, or shopaholics instead of just moving a centimeter (review written in Europe, sorry) towards asking why such unregulated industries can easily hunt down already weakened human game. Shame on you, gambler! Evil shopaholic! How dare you having an alcohol problem! That´s a wise, mature, and productive way of dealing with serious topics. Without this, I would have given 3 stars, but including own, restricted bias and agenda disguised as facts downed it to 2. Funny, just now that I am thinking about it, how each hard earned everyman bill has to be tracked down and taxed, while letting people lose everything within hours, the reasons for addictions, or brainwashing for consumerism is absolutely no problem and Duhigg is completely ignoring the structures producing the problems because he is so busy with victim blaming and shaming. Other authors stay objective or avoid such topics instead of superficially dealing with it to boost sales. I am pretty sure that some of the concepts and ideas won´t stand the test of time, as real science, medicine, and screening technology improve, and as they appear like very soft humanities stuff. A final subjective list of elements a good nonfiction book should at least have, that are quite missing in this one:A detailed plan how to DIY.Own theories that are defined as subjective opinions in the case of humanities or, and in natural sciences, proofed by many hard facts.New combinations of existing theories and ideas.Entertaining, very well written anecdotes. There is not much new under the sun and most fictional and nonfiction works are remixes and new interpretations of facts and tropes, but that doesn´t mean that it have to be loveless, average, wrong, and presumptuous concoctions. But thanks for extra training to deal with anger through cognitive techniques and quick meditations, at least it´s good for that.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positiv...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivationhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavio...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindful..."
4,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1242918-rhianna,2," This may be a crappy review since its going up via iPhone. Sorry. First caveat: I work in research. A big part of my job is creating these habit loops and seeing if they can be altered or enhanced via medication. Second caveat: I'm a nerd and love journal articles, scientific writing, and technical reading, even off the job.Third caveat: I only got to chapter eight. I honestly don't know what I was expecting. By far and large, when there's big buzz about a book I inevitably dislike it with very few exceptions. I was hoping for something smart and eye opening; a different, more personal take on habits and addiction (which is really what a habit is if you think about it), and I was let down mostly by the writing and anecdotes. I realize this book isn't intended for scientific review, but when there were so many teasing moments of talking about the research going on, I guess I just expected a little more substance in laymans terms. The biggest problem I had with the book was that I probably could have only read the first few chapters and have a total grasp of the theory. While some stories were interesting, they reminded me of Grandpa Simpson's storytelling. I don't think we needed so many examples that all said the same thing. Think of all the trees that could have been saved if a few were omitted. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad read. People with a non-neuroscience background can enjoy it and will learn something from it. Although how to apply it to your life is pretty much missing from the book (unless it was in the chapters I didn't get to yet). Yeah, find a new reward to break bad habits, but how? It would have been interesting to see those suggestions. Overall, not horrible. Had it not been a book club read I wouldn't have picked it up of my own volition, but I'm not upset that I read most of it. I am upset that I kept reading hoping to get something different in the next chapter, which didn't happen. Just save the time and money and read his NY Times article (at least I think it was there) instead. "
5,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"I need to start with the obvious – this guy is one of those writers. One of those writers that make you want to track him down and hurt him. And not just him, maybe even his pets too. He assumes you are as thick as dog-shit and that you won’t get what it is he is talking about unless he makes it painfully (PAINFULLY) clear. He has missed his calling. He really should have gone into the self-help book market – let’s face it, assuming your readers are dumb in that market is just ‘responding to reality’. You might be wondering why I gave this book three stars, given I wanted to find ways to hurt the author. Well, the problem is that some of the ideas here are not insane, in fact, some are really well worth thinking about. It’s just that someone (someone who also needs hunted down, now that I think about it) has told this guy you need to ‘tell a story’. And while this is often excellent advice – you also need to remember that people are reading your book for a reason and that reason isn’t to cry over the last moments of a drug addict’s life or to find out how the skunk lady got laid. No, it is to find out about the affect of habits and what we can do to change the habits of a life time that are stuffing up our lives.I’ve been reading lots of Bourdieu lately. He talks of Habitus – what he calls the ‘feel for the game’, but basically the habits we have that are so unconscious we don't even know they are habits and so, therefore, have no idea what a huge part they play in shaping the kinds of people we are. So we tend to think that because we wouldn’t do something someone else clearly has done that automatically qualifies us for the golden stamp of merit. Whereas, so much of what we do in life is either non-rational or automatic – having those automatic structures implanted in us from no age is more a matter of luck than of rational deliberation.This guy stuffs up his argument at the end by not having the conviction of what his view on habits was telling him. He tells a long, long, long story of a woman that lost everything through gambling. Terribly sad and all that. But obviously this book is written in America and so nothing can come between the rights of rich people to take money from poor people. So, the fact that casinos do everything to manipulate you so that you end up with nothing is YOUR fault, not theirs – have you no self control? Have you no free will? I think this guy should read Sam Harris’s new book. Either that or he needs to also argue that it should be ok for drug dealers to offer kids drugs at schools and in the streets – if one is wrong it isn’t at all obvious why the other is right. And if not drugs to kids, then drugs to adults – unless I’m missing something the same argument applies.This book is quite chilling in that it explains – in very long and all too often boring detail, in fact endless bloody detail, just how companies like Target are targeting you and manipulating you to buy and buy and buy. Yet again this is presented as if it was nothing to be concerned about – but I struggled to read it as something I should just shrug and get over. When I first learned about data warehousing it sent a cold shiver down my spine – I have never had ‘Fly Buys’ or any other of those ‘loyalty’ programs that give those arseholes all of my details so they can work out how to better market to people like me. I’m manipulated enough in life without needing to provide billionaires with better weapons to trip me up.The information in this book is very worthwhile. But if you ever needed proof that Gladwell has lots to answer for, this book is Item A on the case for the prosecution. And what the hell is it about American Football? I hope to God it isn’t nearly as uninteresting to watch as it is to read about. No wonder Americans invade countries at the drop of a hat – anything to get away from two down on the thirty-first yard line with a wingback on a hiding to nowhere blah, blah AHHHHH!!!! "
6,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,3,"Nothing Succeeds Like Success: A Case StudyHey. Have you heard of Thomas Baker? How about Carol Wright? Chris Cameron? Vineet Shaw? Let us discuss Baker.Thomas Baker was an average joe, but not without ambitions. A few years ago, acting on a tip, Tom, a competitive enough guy, decided to take his life into his own hands. What’s more, he decided to pick up one more Self-help book and this time follow up thoroughly on it. No holds barred. He asked around, looked in that wonderful site and finally decided on what seemed to him like the best out there right now. The ratings seemed to be out of the world too. The author, in the intro, even tries to reassure him against feeling overwhelmed by the excess of research in the book. This is exactly the sort of help that Tom needed. Tom read the book with great diligence. He made notes and he made placards and he even bought magnets for his fridge and special sticky tapes for his mirrors. He knew this could work. He only had to believe.He changed his routines, identified and included habit-forming cues. He created them, he played around with them, he even had some fun. He was very inventive and imaginative. The author would have commended the effort if he knew. Tom decide that he would write to Duhigg about his success once it pays off. A month passed. Tom had made slight improvements but no major pay-off seemed to be in the offing. He chided himself for expecting windfalls. He reminded himself that these things take time. He kept at it.6 months now. Even the minor gains he had made originally have fallen by the wayside now. He had read the book thrice in this time, trying to reaffirm his faith. He was discouraged now but he kept at it.2 years. The book is long forgotten. But Tom had taken the trouble to document his experiences and had sent a detailed case study to the author. He had requested that it be included in the next edition of the book. He wanted the author to include a chapter on failures - on how it might not work for everyone. He wanted a caveat, a mild statement of warning that just because a book worth of case studies of success is presented, there is no reason to expect that any approach (no matter how good) might work for everyone. Humans would be fulfilling Asimovesque dreams if that were the case. He thought this would add depth and realism to an otherwise fine book.He did not even get an auto-generated acknowledgment slip. But that was ok, he had discovered a new Gladwell book on another airport aisle. Apparently, it is not just habits that doesn’t stick, lessons don’t either. "
7,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,4,"I remember reading a story by the famous Malayalam writer Padmarajan called Oru Sameepakala Durantham (""A Tragedy of Recent Times""). It tells of a housing colony in Kerala, bitten by the exercise bug in the early eighties. Someone gets up before sunrise and starts jogging. Soon, he is joined by more and more people until the whole colony is out running, every day. This leaves the houses unattended which comes to the notice of a group of thieves: and they conduct a spate of early morning robberies. The people of the colony, even after a couple of houses are robbed, continue their morning ritual - they can't stop, even after they know that their houses may be invaded any time.Padmarajan ostensibly wrote this seemingly absurd and Kafkaesque story to make fun of the urban animal, blindly following the latest fad. But he may have more true to life than he thought.Such is the power of habit.------------------------------This book by Duhigg, if you can get past the unnecessarily prolix prose, says a very simple but significant thing: habit is what drives you. From picking your nose to gambling away your life's savings, ingrained habits hard-coded into your brain makes you tick. It follows the ""cue-routine-reward"" loop as illustrated below:(Cue = a certain time; routine = eat a cookie; reward = diversion from work)Habits are not endemic to people alone - organisations and societies also have habits, which why they are so resistant to change.The key to getting rid of a destructive habit is to replace it with a constructive one. In the loop illustrated above, the cue and the reward would remain the same, but a different routine can be substituted. See below:(Here the routine of ""have a drink"" is replaced with ""have a chat"")This is easier said than done, however: it requires real effort to identify a habit, and great will power (which can be cultivated, according to Duhigg) to change it. But it can be done. Successful individuals have changed their lives by changing destructive habits: successful executives have turned around companies by changing corporate habits: and leaders have transformed societies. Examples abound in this book.And please note: supermarket chains and gambling dens monitor our habits and feed those which will drain our pockets and maximise their profits.------------------------------This book is well worth a read. I only wish that the author had cut the fluff and trimmed it down to a slimmer volume. But then, the HABIT of writing needlessly long books among American journalists is one that dies hard."
8,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,1,"This long-winded book explains how habits form in individuals, organizations, and social groups. Despite the intriguing premise, the verbose anecdotes left me screaming, “I get the point already!” A better book (or article) would have resulted from taking the appendix (a short, practical guide to changing a habit) and adding some of the psychological research and a few brief examples. (After I wrote this review, I discovered Charles Duhigg's New York Times article, which is basically what I described). The book’s moral is a respectable one: once you’re aware of a bad habit, it’s your responsibility to change it.My favorite case study was the one about Target using predictive analytics and behavioral research to personalize its marketing to each shopper’s habits.• A habit is a cue that triggers a routine that results in a reward.• Habits can’t be eradicated; they can only be replaced.• The Golden Rule of Habit Change: to replace a habit, keep the cue and reward but replace the routine.• “For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.”• Studies show that willpower is a finite resource; it's like a muscle that tires with use. Willpower can be increased by exercising self-discipline. Increasing self-discipline in one area of life increases it in other areas.• To introduce new habits, “sandwich” them between existing ones so they feel familiar.• Habits are most susceptible to being altered when your life changes. Having a baby is the event that produces the most habit changes."
9,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/903066-johnny,5,"Judging from the prologue of The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business, the first thing necessary in modifying one’s behavior is to note the actual components of that behavior. The author cites a visit with a military officer in charge of normalizing a village (Kufa) in Iraq. The officer started by observing video of how riots began and noticed that the trouble usually broke out after people had milled around for a while and food trucks and spectators arrived. He changed the behavior by asking the mayor not to allow food trucks into the areas where people were demonstrating (p. 13 on Sony eReader, as will be all pagination in the remainder of this review). Something as simple as the presence of food trucks threw off a habit of violence and allowed some normalization. This seemed amazing, but something resonated strongly with this truth.The Power of Habits begins with anecdotal accounts of people who changed destructive habits in their lives and one account of a man who had absolutely no short term memory but was able to function as a result of habits already ingrained within him. The latter case demonstrated that there was something distinctive between one part of our brain and another. So, the author takes the reader on a tour of a lab at M.I.T. where scientists have been researching a golf ball-sized lump in the brain called the basal ganglia since 1990 (p. 25). Apparently, the basal ganglia stores habits while the rest of the brain works less and less because the “chunks” of actions stored in that section of the brain takes over (p. 26). Arriving at this understanding, researchers were able to use different experiments to ascertain a “habit loop.” They noticed that a certain cue triggers a set of automatic reactions such that the being feels rewarded. As a result of being rewarded, there is an even stronger response to the same cue on the next occasion (p. 29) Of course, if reward can reinforce the habit whenever one senses that cue, changing the reward can eventually extinguish that habit (p. 30) as the researchers discovered by moving the chocolate around the maze to mess up the behaviors.So, what kinds of “cues” work? The Power of Habits tells the story of Claude Hopkins, an advertising legend who “created” the demand for toothpaste by creating a “craving.” Hopkins noticed in dental research that there is a film that forms on our teeth. He decided to get people to “feel” the mucin plaques on their teeth by calling them “the film” and suggesting that “beauty” comes from eliminating the film (p. 40). By identifying a “cue” (the film that is almost always there) and suggesting a “reward” (getting rid of that film), he established a multi-million dollar product. Sounds simple, doesn’t it? Yet, the book goes on to tell the story of Febreze, the air freshener that started out as a failure. Even though it was extremely effective in getting rid of odors, it wasn’t selling because people in odiferous situations became used to the odors. They weren’t getting the cue. So, there had to be a better way to cue the reward and that came to be with pleasant fragrances and the idea of “finishing” a task with beautiful smelling Febreze (a tactic that is still being used in dozens of new products in this product line to the present day (p. 56). The “habit loop” works even better when a “craving” is attached to it. It turns out that Pepsodent already had the craving element built in with the citric acid or mint taste that rewarded users with a tingling sense of feeling clean. It’s pretty masterful the way this author closes the loop in each chapter.Then, a chapter introduces the “Golden Rule” of habit change. It notes that you can never quite remove a bad habit, but you need to substitute a new routine between the cue and the reward (p. 61). In this chapter, Tony Dungy’s coaching philosophy of substituting a simpler playbook with more repetition for the old routine of over-thinking what one might be trying to do. In this way, the new routine would reside between the cue (hiking the ball?) and the reward (scoring a touchdown? Making a sack of the QB?) and more success would result (p. 62). Naturally, this chapter wraps Dungy’s experiences with turning around the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Indianapolis Colts football teams around the history of Alcoholics Anonymous. Both Dungy as a coach and Bill Wilson who founded A.A. teach people to substitute new routines for the old ones (p. 68), bad football in the former and alcohol abuse in the latter.One of the keys to Dungy’s eventual success and one of the core tenets of A.A. (or any 12-step) program is that one must believe in something. Dungy complained early on that practice was going well and everything was coming together, but the training would disappear during the big games. When he heard the players saying that they went back to what they knew during critical games, Dungy said, “What they were really saying was that they trusted our system most of the time, but when everything was on the line, that belief broken down.” (p. 75) And, as one researching from the University of New Mexico noted, belief is critical in order for change to work in the long run (p. 78). The section on “habits” in business wasn’t as interesting to me, but even there I found some intriguing aspects. It was fascinating to read about how “keystone habits encourage widespread change: by creating cultures where new values become ingrained.” (p. 109) This section told the story of former U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O’ Neill’s success at Alcoa. O’ Neill’s emphasis was safety. By placing the emphasis on safety, he gave the corporation something around which management (because of reducing lost work days) and unions (because of emphasizing the safety of the workers) could both agree upon. There was also an insight with regard to the gay liberation movement. Duhigg suggests that when the Library of Congress re-categorized books on homosexuality as its own subject matter rather than under mental illness, it provided a paradigm shift that fueled the movement (p. 100). It just shows how little shifts can have seismic effects, not only on individuals, but on society.Another corporate chapter used an experiment on willpower where half of the group was allowed to eat fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies while another group was forced to eat radishes. Sounds like the latter would have a healthy advantage when the group was asked to perform a complex problem which had no real solution! Sounds like they would be more mentally fresh! Wrong! Those who had eaten the radishes were most likely to quit after only a few minutes while the cookie eaters kept on for half an hour or so. Why? Researchers concluded that the first portion of the experiment had used up much of the finite willpower in the radish eaters (p. 119). A later study showed that using kindness to set up the willpower goals as opposed to ordering willpower allowed those who experienced kindness to concentrate longer (p. 130).Building on that idea, Duhigg recounted a Scottish rehabilitation study where the elderly patients who were most successful in learning to walk again in spite of excruciating pain had identified potential obstacles in advance and created their own ways of dealing with them. “Put another way, the patients’ plans were built around inflection points when they knew their pain—and thus the temptation to quit—would be the strongest.” (p. 124) Starbucks put this to work in what they called the LATTE method (Listen to the customer, Acknowledge their complaint, Take action by solving the problem, Thank them, and then, Explain why the problem occurred.) in dealing with irate customers (p. 126).Another chapter deals with destructive institutional habits: “There are no organizations without institutional habits. There are only places where they are deliberately designed, and places where they are created without forethought, so they often grow from rivalries or fear.” (p. 137) “Companies aren’t families. They’re battlefields in a civil war.” (p. 139) I was also fascinated with the chapter on consumer behavior. Did you know that almost everyone turns right after entering a retail establishment and that retailers stock their most profitable items on the right side of the store? (p. 157) Did you know that people’s buying habits change when they go through a major life event (marriage, having a child, divorce, moving)? (p. 162) And, in the facts are stranger than fiction department, Duhigg cites a company named Polyphonic HMI that statistically analyzes the mathematical characters of a song and predicts its popularity. (p. 167) Why is that strange? It’s because Norman Spinrad, a terrific science-fiction author, “predicts” it in his novel in the 1980s--Little Heroes. Sorry, Duhigg doesn’t cite Spinrad; that’s me. I was happy that Duhigg recounted a huge Polyphonic miscalculation. It also explained why I don’t listen to music on the radio very much: “Our brains crave familiarity in music because familiarity is how we manage to hear without becoming distracted by all the sound.” (p. 171) I actually listen to the radio for stimuli.The section on the habits of societies was particularly relevant to me because the first chapter dealt with churches, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Montgomery church and Rick Warren’s Saddleback Community Church. Starting with the idea of a social network of friendships and growing through informal ties (Duhigg calls them “weak ties”) and changing community habits, social habits turn on personal integrity and relationships. Duhigg pointed out how Rosa Park’s ties that transcended the social stratifications of the black community through her volunteer involvement with many groups on many levels enabled her to become the catalyst that she was (p. 184) The important insight that was new to me was: “The habits of peer pressure … often spread through weak ties. And they gain their authority through communal expectations. If you ignore the social obligations of your neighborhood, if you shrug off the expected patterns of your community, you risk losing your social standing.” (p. 189) Sadly, I was disappointed in the section on Rick Warren. The book makes it sound like Warren selected Saddleback Community from a long way away by citing Warren’s seminary education in Texas and work as a volunteer missionary in Japan. Strangely, it doesn’t mention the fact that Saddleback was only a little more 30 minutes drive from where Warren attended college in Riverside or that Warren’s father had been a professional minister in California prior to his retirement. I did like the emphasis on small groups as the key to creating a “sticky” environment that “…drew on already-existing social urges and patterns.” (p. 198) One significant section of the book was dedicated to the idea of whether we are responsible for our habits. By juxtaposing the tale of a gambler (if you listen to This American Life on public radio, you probably heard this story) who went to court with a major casino chain by insisting that the casino operators were responsible for her problem alongside that of a British subject who killed his wife during sleep terrors, Duhigg raises the issue but concludes by stating that he believes it is possible to change habits—any habits. The gambler protested that she just wanted to feel good at something (p. 208) and the killer protested that he honestly thought his wife was a male intruder assaulting his wife (p. 209).This section pointed out that, for example, sleepwalking is a reminder that sleep and wakefulness aren't that separate so that the brain can accomplish complex activities and nothing is guiding the brain except patterns. (pp. 210-211) Even more powerful are the behaviors described as “sleep terrors.” Sleep terrors are primitive neurological patterns (p.212). It even points out that a 2010 MRI study of gamblers discovered that, to pathological gamblers, brain activity was so high that it treated near misses as wins (p.220) when, in fact, they were losses. So, can such ingrained perceptions be changed? Duhigg cites William James’ decision to believe in free will as opposed to surrendering to suicide (p. 226). As James tried his 12 month long experiment, he discovered that habits were based upon exercising them (pp. 226-227) much like a well-folded paper or an old pair of well-creased slacks. And all of these great narratives point the reader toward the most useful part of the book, learning to change behavior by identifying the routine, figuring out the cue that triggers the routine and the craving underlying that cue by experimenting with different rewards (p. 230). If you can figure out what you really want and substitute a better routine to satisfy that craving, you will be well on your way toward changing that habit. That doesn’t mean you won’t fall off the wagon, but it means you will be on your way to shaping your actions by your will as opposed to ingrained behaviors."
10,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,4,Our local book club read this a few years ago. I thought I had a review....perhaps it disappeared? Maybe it's still here? I saw a friend currently reading it. I thought this book explained some useful information: Talked about success through good habits - organizational skills ----addictions- habits hard to break and how to create new ones --lots of repetition. ( some basic common sense - but also good tidbits and even validation in some areas) The personal stories of people's lives were interesting.... and my favorite part about reading this book was the book discussion with the people in my book club group after.

The Habit loop is a neurological pattern that governs any habit. It consists of three elements: a cue, a routine, and a reward. Understanding these components can help in understanding how to change bad habits or form good ones. The habit loop is always started with a cue, a trigger that transfers the brain into a mode that automatically determines which habit to use. The heart of the habit is a mental, emotional, or physical routine. عنوانها: نقش و قدرت عادت‌ها در زندگی؛ نیروی عادت: علت آنچه در زندگی و کارمان انجام می‌دهیم چیست؟ قدرت عادت؛ قدرت عادت : چرا ما در زندگی و کار اینگونه عمل می‌کنیم؟ قدرت عادت: علت کارهای که در کسب‌وکار و زندگی انجام می‌دهیم؛ قدرت عادت: دلیل هر آن چه در زندگی و کسب و کار انجام می‌دهیم؛ قدرت عادت: چرایی کارهایی که انجام می‌دهیم و چگونگی تغییر دادن آن‌ها؛ قدرت عادت: قدرت عادتهای اثرگذار در چرخه‌ی زندگی؛ ‬قدرت عادت: چرایی کارهایی که انجام می دهیم، در زندگی و کسب و کار؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دهم ماه سپتامبر سال 2014 میلادیعنوان: قدرت عادت؛ نویسنده: چالز دوهینگ ؛ مترجم: پروین بیات؛ تهران: هورمزد، ‏‫1392؛ در 335 ص؛ شابک: 9786006958118؛ چاپ دوم 1393؛ چاپ چهارم تا هشتم 1393؛ 352 ص؛ چاپ دهم 1394؛ در 352 ص؛ چاپ چهاردهم 1396؛ چاپ پانزدهم و شانزدهم 1397؛عنوان: قدرت عادت: چرا کارهایی را در زندگی و کسب و کار انجام می‌دهیم؟ نویسنده: چارلز دوهیگ؛ مترجم: سکینه تقی زاده؛ اصفهان، گاهداد، 1394؛ در 340 ص؛ شابک: 9786009382125؛عنوان: نقش و قدرت عادت‌ها در زندگی؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجمها: ندا نایب‌پور، محمدرضا مینایی؛ اصفهان: آمیس، 1395؛ در 207 ص؛ شابک: 9786005419795؛ موضوع: جنبه های اجتماعی عادت از نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 21 م‬عنوان: نیروی عادت: علت آنچه در زندگی و کارمان انجام می‌دهیم چیست؟ نویسنده: چالرز دیوهیگ؛ مترجم: علی هداوند؛ تهران: پندار‌تابان‏‫، 1395؛ در 328 ص؛ شابک: 9786006895598؛ چاپ دوم 1396؛ چاپ سوم 1397؛ چاپ چهارم 1398؛عنوان: ‬قدرت عادت: چرایی کارهایی که انجام می دهیم، در زندگی و کسب و کار؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجمها: مصطفی طرسکی، معصومه ثابت‌قدم؛ ویراستار: طاهره خیرآبادی؛ تهران: نوین توسعه‏‫، ‏‫‏‏‏‏1395؛ ‬327 ص؛ شابک: 9786008738091؛ چاپ دوم و سوم 1396؛ چاپ هفتم 1397؛عنوان: قدرت عادت : چرا ما در زندگی و کار اینگونه عمل می‌کنیم؟ نویسنده: چارلز دوهیگ ؛ مترجم: شهرزاد حکیم‌مختار؛ تهران: معیار اندیشه، ‏‫1398؛ در 288 ص؛ شابک: 9786005462746؛‬عنوان: قدرت عادت: دلیل هر آن چه در زندگی و کسب و کار انجام می‌دهیم؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجم: الهام شریف؛ تهران : نسل نواندیش‏‫‬، 1396؛ در 344 ص؛ شابک: 9789642369119؛ ‬عنوان: قدرت عادت: چرایی کارهایی که انجام می‌دهیم و چگونگی تغییر دادن آن‌ها؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجم: اصغر اندرودی؛ کرج: در دانش بهمن‏‫٬ 1395؛ در 342 ص؛ شابک: 9789641741794؛ چاپ دوم 1396؛ چاپ سوم و چهارم 1397؛عنوان: قدرت عادت؛ نویسنده: چارلز دوهیگ؛ مترجم: فروزنده دولتیاری؛ تهران: چابک اندیش، ‏‫‏‏‏‏1397؛ در 352 ص؛ شابک: 9786005861259؛‬‬‬عنوان: قدرت عادت؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجم: طیبه شیخی؛ قم: دارالفنون بوریا، ‏‫1398؛ در 270 ص؛ شابک: 97862295661؛عنوان: قدرت عادت: علت کارهای که در کسب‌وکار و زندگی انجام می‌دهیم؛ نویسنده: چارلز دوهینگ ؛ مترجم: زهرا شاه‌قلعه؛ قم: آوای بیصدا، ‏‫1398؛ در 368 ص؛ شابک: 9786009926459؛عنوان: قدرت عادت: قدرت عادتهای اثرگذار در چرخه‌ی زندگی؛ نویسنده: کارلس (چارلز) دوهیگ ؛ مترجم: مرجان فرجی؛ تهران : رشد، ‏‫1398؛ در 440 ص؛ شابک: 9786003511248؛ کتاب قدرت عادت یکی از کتابهای موفق روانشناسی است که نخستین بار در سال 2013 میلادی توسط چارلز دوهینگ نوشته شد، و به سرعت جزو پرفروش‌ترین کتابهای نیویورک شد. «دوهینگ» در این کتاب بیان می‌کند، که این عادت‌های ما هستند، که زندگی ما را شکل می‌دهند، و قدرت عادت و تأثیر آن در زندگی انسان را توضیح می‌دهد. در ادامه این موضوع را بیان می‌کند، که اگر انسان بتواند عادت‌های خود را تغییر بدهد، می‌تواند رفتار و زندگانی خود را نیز تغییر دهد، و در نهایت نیز الگوهایی برای تغییر عادت‌ها ارائه می‌دهد. ا. شربیانی"
12,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4810137-arda,4,"Enjoyable. The book presents a framework of understanding how habits work, and serves as a guide to show how to change habits.  “Once you choose who you want to be, believe you want to change, and it becomes real.” “Visualize the kind of person you would like to become, focus on one habit you would potentially develop, and transform that into what would become natural; requiring no effort or thinking.” “To modify a habit, you must decide to change it. You must consciously accept the hard work of identifying the cues and rewards that drive the habit’s routines and find alternatives. You must know you have control, and be self conscious enough to use it.” And hence, the  power of habit. So far so good. At this point I’m thinking “which one, which one!” I have a big list of those things I’d be more than happy to trash, and a bigger list of habits I’d like to build. According to Duhigg, the habit loop is made up of: cue → routine → reward. 

Let’s assume  I have a habit of reviewing books on goodreads. This habit of reviewing would be a cue, which makes up the routine: logging into my account, adding books and reviewing them. Apparently, habits (cue and routine) often require a reward. What would my reward in this scenario possibly be? A like? A comment? I hardly get any of those. Perhaps the reward comes from the deeper  craving  I have to read more books. Craving apparently is what drives the habit loop. Hence: Cue → Routine → Reward. The driver is the craving. And the extra spices are belief, and will-power. (Self-discipline increases will-power.)The beauty of realizing this power is that “at first, the change comes with difficulty, then it is done more easily, then semi-mechanically or with hardly any consciousness.” Our actions are developed into habits when we stop thinking about them consciously. We just do them. Hence, we rebuild and transform them. Changing a keystone habit, like say, working out, can transform a person’s life, because with the habit of working out, one is going to simultaneously eat in a healthier way, possibly quit smoking, and live a better lifestyle which in turn could turn to a happier life.  EUREKA!  As based on the above, it would be fair to presume that due to my habit of writing reviews on goodreads, I will start to read more books, thanks to my craving, and this will in turn increase my reviews. I would have no idea what to do with those reviews, and so I might have a chance of reaching success and becoming famous by turning into a fraud replica of  Manny  who published a book about his reviews of books. And, to take it a little further, according to the habit loop, I may just as well meet the love of my life as a result of all this success, which would in turn stop me from eating so much ice cream.

On a serious note, Duhigg generously provides diverse examples to explain the habit loop. The examples range from personal experiences, such as depression/addiction (alcohol, gambling, overeating, etc) and memory-loss. And yet, some of the success stories got on my nerves at a certain point. I was a tad annoyed, early in the book, that he draws inspiration from the US Military and the ways through which habits are instilled in soldiers. Moreover, he includes a section on radio/music, concluding that the reason Outkast’s “Hey Ya” turned out to be such a hit despite the public’s initial disdain is because “the unfamiliar was made to seem familiar” through playing it with familiar songs. “If you dress a new something in an old habit,"" he explains, ""it is easier for the public to accept it.” (Which public?)He brings examples from sports games, shopping malls (like target) and coffee chains (like Starbucks) and others markets like Alcoa and Febreeze to display how the habit loop works. He mentions that ""companies predict and manipulate habits” and briefly remarks on how some customers do not like to be spied on for marketing purposes, yet it still seems as though Duhigg uses his examples as success stories. He does not seem to mind the data-mining and tracking of records or ethical standards so much, and focuses instead on how to make success out of this “secret”. [Speaking of which, did you know pregnant women are the biggest shoppers?] I was a little taken-aback by his corporate-success-mindedness and the ways in which he measures success. This would be a little too similar to the mind-set one finds in other self-help books, although I was hoping this one would be different. Unfortunately, most of these types of books seem to promote the sensation of becoming a driven, ambitious, goal-oriented, go-get-‘em tiger. I couldn’t help escape the idea that this man partly measures success by a person’s pay-check and exercise regimen.

That said, the book does have interesting viewpoints, particularly those related to how habits shape up societies. His take on habits within communities was eye-opening: He defines community as a giant collection of habits occurring among thousands of people that, depending on how they’re influenced, could result in violence or peace. He takes the example of Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott in Alabama in 1955, and states that it was not just an act of defiance that sparked the boycott, but that the successful boycott was also due to her varying and influential social circles. In this section, as in other sections, attention is given to the importance of social standing, which comes with obligations. Apparently, it is not just our friends who strengthen our social networks, but the friends of our friends [“weak ties”] too have a role in improving our chances for finding employment and improve our social standing. One of the integral points that will stand out for me from this book is that our actions are developed into habits when we stop thinking about them consciously. We just do them. Hence, we rebuild and transform them. Changing, or building, the most simple habit could have a direct impact on our mortal life. “However,"" Duhigg warns, ""there isn’t one formula. Individuals are different, habits are different, and cravings are different. What this book aspires to do is create a framework of understanding how a habit works, and serve as a guide to show how to change it.”"
13,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"This was an interesting collection of research about habits and routines. The book felt Gladwellian in that it combined a variety of case studies while arguing a central theme, just as Malcolm Gladwell tends to do in his books. I think my favorite sections were the ones on Starbucks' training programs, Procter & Gamble's attempts to market Febreze, the safety record at Alcoa, the applications of Hit Song Science, and the historic Montgomery bus boycott of 1955. The overall theme is about how habits shape our lives, and it is possible to change bad habits for positive routines. The trick is in identifying what is cueing you to the bad habit, to experiment with positive rewards, and then make a plan for how to adjust your routine. This material was also explored in Gretchen Rubin's charming book, Better Than Before, and I enjoyed revisiting the topic. Recommended for those interested in human behavior and popular psychology/sociology."

And, although he was talking more about religious rituals, I think they apply to most other kinds of rituals in our lives too. And, I think that if our everyday rituals include these 4 dimensions in the right proportions, they can allow us pay more attention to what we’re doing and give us the space to be more creative. Note that I'm not suggesting that rituals, in themselves, can make anyone more creative - rather that they enable some of the right conditions for creativity."

I finished a non-fiction book!So, I started this climbing excursion because I have bad habits. We all do most of the time. My bad habits are eating unhealthy food, drinking too much wine, not getting enough exercise or procrastinating at work. My hubby and I thought, let’s figure out WHY since we both have bad habits we want to stop. We started this buddy read in February. February?! And you're just finishing it? Now don’t let that sway you that it took over two months to finish this book. It’s not a bad read, I just took my time with it, it's non-fiction and of course, I read books in between. ;) hahahaSo, did it answer some of my questions? Will I put down the bag of Cheetos next time I drink too much wine?! Yeah, I think it did.The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business helped me understand that stopping a bad habit isn’t the easiest thing to do. Don't beat yourself up about it. They become routine, habitual and ingrained in your life. They are caused by stress, emotions and going back to creature comforts. The book addresses that one of the ways to break a bad habit is to replace it with a substitute. It’s one of the ways to make a lasting change.Technically, this book isn’t bad. The author jumps around a bit with stories, starting one narrative and then going to another. Depending on the subject matter, I was okay with this. When I was really into the subject matter, it annoyed the hell out of me.This book is also a good analysis about why people like what they do, buy from a certain store or buy merchandise. The businesses that are smart, they have tapped into the emotion of advertising and habits. This part of the book was fascinating and was interesting material to read. And it confirmed that a lot of our bad habits are subliminal because of ads, commercials and radio.Why 4 stars? I didn’t really need that much business data and could have used a bit more personal.We are creatures of habit and it’s really on to you and whether you can make the change or not. Belief plays a big role in our daily success. I hope that I can use some of the tips in this book to finally implement some changes."

Why do people brush their teeth every day while never remembering to wear sunscreen? Charles Duhigg answers these questions and more in The Power of Habit, a well-researched book on what motivates us to make the decisions we do in everyday life and in business.Duhigg's background as a reporter shows in this book. He does a good job of stringing together a wide variety of topics to fit his thesis that revolves around habit, and for the most part he writes about the cue-routine-reward cycle. To illustrate how that pattern works and what we can do to change it, Duhigg explores ideas like smoking addiction, sleepwalking, Target tracking down pregnant women, and more. His writing shines when he compares the man who murdered his wife while asleep to the women who lost an enormous sum of money to compulsive gambling: I still find myself thinking about the neurological and moral implications of the distinction he presents.However, the writing in this book faltered at times. In certain sections Duhigg would break up anecdotes and combine them in odd, confusing ways. Sometimes he selected scenarios that did not align too well with his arguments, like his exploration of how ""Hey-Ya"" became popular. The book as a whole veered more toward reporting than research, so bear that in mind if you decide to pick it up.Overall, a decent read I wanted a little more from when I finished. Recommended to those who want to get their feet wet when it comes to habit formation or psychology that deals with motivation. I will end with a quote from The Power of Habit that stood out to me in a good way:That, in some ways, is the point of this book. Perhaps a sleepwalking murderer can plausibly argue that he wasn't aware of his habit, and so he doesn't bear responsibility for his crime. But almost all the other patterns that exist in most people's lives - how we eat and sleep and talk to our kids, how we unthinkingly spend our time, attention, and money - those are habits that we know exist. And once you understand that habits can change, you have the freedom - and the responsibility - to remake them. Once you understand that habits can be rebuilt, the power of habit becomes easier to grasp, and the only option left is to get to work."

If we are more aware of why and how habits are formed, then we'll be able to control them. That's exactly what ""The Power of Habit"" tries to accomplish!This well-researched book consults academic studies, interviews with many scientists and executives, and research conducted at various companies. I had heard some lessons from this book by watching a few YouTube videos, but reading it was such a fun experience!One of the most useful takeaways from this book is that habits are powerful but also delicate. They can be formed outside our consciousness or with our intention. They can form without our permission but can be reshaped by us. Old habits never disappear, but we can change them by altering the cues and rewards.The book is split into three parts. The first part focuses on the habits of individuals, second on habits of successful organizations, and third on habits of societies. It was interesting to read about the research and real-life examples of how habits work on three levels.This book isn't a detailed guide on how to form habits but focuses more on the research aspects and the nitty-gritty of habits, right from how to form them and factors that influence them. I highly enjoyed reading about the habits of organization and societies as it was something new to me. I learned some useful information on habits I'll summarize in another post!All in all, it's a book worth reading!INSTAGRAM"

Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often."" pgs 17-18Duhigg describes how the brain creates a ""habit loop"" through cues, routines and rewards. These three elements feed on themselves until an ingrained habit is made. And, once it is there, it takes very little to upkeep.That's good news and bad news, because it works the same way for healthy and unhealthy habits.""But the reason the discovery of the habit loop is so important is that it reveals a basic truth: When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making."" pg 20The ""golden rule"" for changing a habit, Duhigg says, is to keep the same cues and rewards, but change the routine that leads to them. It sounds simple, but everyone is different with different motivations. So, it takes a bit of self awareness to discover what those unique cues and rewards are for you. But, once you know your triggers and motivations, that's when the fun begins of crafting a new routine.I found this book to be absolutely fascinating. It's also making me question the habits I've picked up in my own life. Am I certain that they are ones I want to continue? I can think of a few that could use a bit of tweaking. And now I know how.""This is the real power of habit: the insight that your habits are what you choose them to be."" pg 271Let's cultivate the good ones then."
20,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7236889-scott,4,"Duhigg's Power of Habit offered a staggering statistic about our lives: 40% of what we do is habitual. 40 percent! That means that a huge majority of what we do in our lives is practically unconscious and habitually helping us progress or digress. The major takeaways for me include two main insights. First, identifying your habit's cues and rewards gives one understanding of why we do what we do. For example, when analyzing my habit of running, there are specific cues and rewards that both initiate and reward my exercising. My cues revolve around clearing my head and feeling accomplishment. I run either in the morning (after I wake up) or after work (after a long day at school/work) to clear my head. Also, I desire to accomplish something everyday, and running fulfills that craving. If I run in the morning, then I feel that I've already accomplished something that day. The second takeaway from this book is the principle of small victories. When you have a series of small victories, then your days can't help but to be filled with successful habits. For example, I feel accomplishment with a morning run. After a great start to the day, other small victories come more easily. I'm more positive,I want to eat healthy, I have more patience, and I work more efficiently. It's just a balanced way to live life. Identifying Cues/Rewards and earning Small victories changes habits and subsequently 40% of your life. "
21,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,1,"This book claims to explain how new science can help us stop bad habits. The advice on habit change ultimately comes down to the appendix with the author's personal anecdote about trying to lose weight. The conclusion is obvious and it's not science; it's just some dude's story. People looking for books on using increased awareness of thought loops to change habits would be better served reading something about cognitive therapy or meditation. 

 

Much of what he is talking about with automatic responses to external cues goes back to century-old findings about Pavlov's dogs, and one of the people interviewed even describes what they're doing as ""Pavlovian"" so that's not new. The actual new science is the fashionable brain biology stuff, which is still not very practical. It's like taking apart your GPS after a road trip to see if you had a good vacation. Brainwashed: The Seductive Appeal of Mindless NeuroscienceOne of the most basic concepts in science is to compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges, but the author mixes things up so much that it's like a fruit salad. Sleepwalking is a habit? Murder is a habit? Does ""habit"" mean anything??? Useful scientific advice on behavior change would tell us about controlled experiments of things that helped people. This book instead gives us lots of theories with a ""loop"" diagram that doesn't even make sense. According to the loop, you need an immediate reward to establish a long-term habit. But, for example, in the chapter about the Superbowl coach, nowhere is it explained what the immediate reward is for performing the correct behaviors thousands of times. Winning the game is the reward, but a losing team doesn't get that for years, if ever. "

The author analyzes habits on different levels such as in individuals, organizations, businesses and societies. He uses real-life examples and historic events to describe behavioral habits. Since the book was not what I expected I started getting distracted 20% in but pulled through to the end. About half-way of listening to the audiobook I started to do the review of the book I was expecting but did not get. I apologize in advance for the rambling. I read this book looking for tips on improving my personal habits, mainly eat healthier & exercise more. These two are very common goals for a lot of people but even though I understand intellectually what needs to be done, the plan is hard to execute on a daily basis. Mainly, I lack motivation to exercise because...As I was reading the book I was looking for a structured plan about habit modification but it was mostly about understanding habits and willpower. However, I believe that just the fact that there is the intention of improving behavior sets the wheels in motion and makes it easier to start the process and continue it.At least I have a better idea of how to manage cravings and keep in track."

My favorite parts were the various stories and anecdotes the author provided for each lesson about habits. The book is fairly cohesive and my only complaint is that the 'how to use this book' section at the end is a bit too simple and doesn't encompass the ideas in every chapter (such as incorporating keystone habits, etc.). Nonetheless, definitely worth a read. I didn't get this book to try and change any of my habits, but still learned a ton. Here's what you need to know:1. Habits are controlled in your brain by the basal ganglia and happen subconsciously.2. The habit loop has 3 components: the cue, the action, the reward.3. To change a habit, you cannot change the cue or the reward, just substitute a different action for that cue that produces a similar reward.4. Things we do out of habit we are better at and do more dutifully than those we must think about.5. To get people to use your product, establish a habit loop."

About once a year I try and reinvent myself, and it'll work for a few days and then fail. Still, I have done quite a bit of research into habits and how to change them, and I've collected a lot of tidbits of information that float around in my brain.This book doesn't really impart any new information. If you're like me, however, it will give you what you know in a different way. This is not a self-help book. It will not give you platitudes or a list of steps on how to change or any promises of any kind. It does deliver a fascinating narrative on how our brains process habits and give context to the million bits of advice that can be picked up anywhere. It helps you understand the mechanics of what's going on, through case studies and vignettes, and brings it all together into a cohesive whole.I loved this book. It is probably the first thing I've picked up that has made me take an honest, detailed look at my life and make a plan on how to change it. I have no idea if I'll succeed or fail, as I have so many times before, but this is the first time I feel like I have more behind me than just some dottering, inexact advice.On a technical level, this is a moderately good book. The author does tend to mix his stories, starting one narrative and then leaving it hanging while he starts another, only to come back and finish the first. I'm annoyed by this style of writing, but the bits were still engaging enough that I kept through it. Then again, I was emotionally invested after the first chapter, so those that are reading for curiosity's sake may be more annoyed by it. Honestly, though? That's the only complaint I have with this book. It's a fast, entertaining, and fascinating read."
28,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1242165-schmacko,3,"Charles Duhigg has three fascinating half-books here. They’re all joined by the theme of habits. He speaks of habits from a personal perspective. Then he talks about business habits, switching from cognitive psychology to organizational psychology. And finally, he talks about sociology. What unifying pattern do these three have? That same old model I learned back in college in 1991… The idea of cues, actions, and rewards is throughout this book. It’s not very new nor very strong; in fact, Duhigg mentions that Claude Hopkins in his My Life in Advertising book first discussed this old, flimsy dusty model in 1927. So why does this book get 3 stars? Because Duhigg does find several fascinating stories about each section. He uses examples from AA attendees to overeaters to Target figuring out which person is pregnant and sending out the right kind of advertising without offending the person. This is some cool stuff, great fodder for cocktail conversations – scary in sort of a Big Brother way. (“We do not control ourselves!”)Duhigg could’ve made this book better, though. He says there isn’t enough research to say why some habits prevail and others are changeable. Why write a book then? Is this only a compendium of the most recent research? If it is, it misses some significant stuff. There are plenty of other sources he could’ve used as possible models. Malcolm Gladwell talks about how sociological influences because ubiquitous - social habit - in The Tipping Point (2000). Chip and Dan Heath talk about how to change when change is difficult in Switch (2007). I can also think of several other authors who’ve given more succinct processes to take the models and attempt to make them more useable. Duhigg seemed too scared to commit to some possibilities, some clear ways to influence the change of habit. He skirts it, and then he excuses himself, saying that habits are too multifaceted to offer possible models in detail.So his models are vague or old. He also doesn’t credit or discredit Gladwell or the Heaths or others who have had recent bestsellers talking about the same ideas. Then he writes three half-books that are barely bridged to each other. Still, his examples are good, and his style is infinitely readable. I would’ve liked to have him commit to some postulation that is more recent than Hopkins’ 1927 model. I also wish his bridge between the personal, organizational, and social was stronger."

31,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110812-kinga,4,"As far as self-help books go, this was surprisingly helpful and insightful. I read it in January, as you should, so perhaps this is why I’m still sticking to my NY resolutions. It inspired me to observe myself carefully and notice some of the things I do without realising. We learn that 40% of what we do every day follows established habitual patterns, which is a good thing because we can retrain ourselves to follow different patterns and make changes in our lives that don’t feel like they need insane amounts of self-discipline. On the other hand, this revelation made feel a little like I’m just a sophisticated automaton.My praise for this book isn’t unqualified. It does of course simplify things like most pop-psychology books do. While the concept of a habit loop – cue, routine, reward is a very useful way of thinking of our habits, it does gloss over a multitude of nuances that surround everything that we do as individuals, and as a society. I found that to be the case especially when the author gave examples of ‘keystone habits’ that cause domino effect – some of them just seemed far-fetched and could very well be the case of correlation, rather than causation. It was all just a little too neat at places. Of course Duhigg had to boil down an extensive area of study into easily digested soundbytes, which I am now boiling down further for the purposes of this review, so how am I to judge?This book was also full of repetitions, but one could argue that it just practices what it preaches. Only through repetitions we can retrain ourselves. Additionally, I listened to this on audiobook and I often zone out when listening to audiobooks, so the repetitions were most welcome. All in all, the ultimate message of this book is that of optimism. Even if you tried changing many times before and failed, the lasting success is still within your reach. I did cringe at some of the corporate case studies, especially the Starbucks puff piece. Seriously, if I read one more piece about how amazing Starbucks is to its baristas, I will conclude that their employees should actually be paying Starbucks for the privilege of working there. However, I did like the Febreze story because it’s just so ironic. They had a product which was great – it actually eliminated odours but they couldn’t sell it because smelly people with smelly houses generally didn’t realise they were smelly. So ironically, they had to invent a previously non-existent need for non-smelly people to use it. You gotta love capitalism. Also, I found the story behind Hey Ya! by Outkast fascinating. I hated that song and couldn’t understand why I was being hounded by it so relentlessly. I am happy to report that I still don’t like it, so whatever nonsense the record label tried to get me to like it, failed. And now, I decided, no company will ever trick me again! (ha, lol)."
32,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4442364-franz,5,"If you are looking for a how-to book, in the strict sense this isn't it. But if you want to change your habits you can glean how to do so from the main text, and Duhigg provides specific hints in an appendix. Duhigg does tell us how habits form without our awareness (every habit follows the pattern of cue-response-reward loops with cravings--expectations of the reward--thrown into the mix) and why they form (the brain's method of saving effort by turning any routine into an unthought habit) and where in the brain (the basal ganglia) they are stored. Simply put, changing habits begins with recognizing the pattern of a particular loop and then changing the response to the cue.In this well-researched and well-written book Duhigg talks to scientists about how rats memorize a maze. He describes how a man with extensive brain damage but whose basal ganglia is intact can still form new habits without recalling anything he does. He shows how real people with bad habits such as alcoholism can overcome them by changing the cue-response-reward loop; this is essentially how Alcoholics Anonymous works. Therapists train elderly patients to exercise after hip surgeries by manipulating the loop in such a way that the patients persist in exercising despite the pain instead of giving, greatly improving the quality of their lives. Duhigg describes Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps habitual routines that enabled him to win a race at the Chinese Olympics with his goggles filled with water, swimming virtually blind. He also explains how a social movement such as the civil rights movement depends on the same cue-response-reward loop.Corporation such as Target and the gambling industry exploit the loop to bring customers through the door and spend money without realizing that they are being manipulated.Fascinating and fun to read. The only caveat is that in the last chapter when Duhigg discusses the implications of habits on the issue of free will. There he too quickly judges that that we cannot be absolved from bad behavior due to irresistible habits in some cases while we are absolved of responsibility for our behavior in others. He may be right, but I wasn't convinced. "
33,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,3,"ReviewThe “Power of Habit” is a frustrating book to review. At its core, it presents ideas that are both interesting and practical: this book will - or at least might – change the way you think about, form, and conquer habits. At the same time, it’s flooded with same fuzzy and irrelevant “case studies” that pollute your average pop psychology book. The first part of this book nicely summarizes recent findings in the field of psychology concerning habits – how they form, how they function, and how they can – or can’t - be changed. This part of the book is, for the most part, rich in content and worthwhile. Duhigg summarizes legitimate findings, and there's more or less no bullshit.If only that could be said about the second part of the book, where fluff is piled high and irrelevance abounds. “The Power of Habit” is a prime example of an unfortunate recent trend in pop psych literature, where the author brings in “case studies” from business, history, and personal life to try and engage the reader and ostensibly make for more ‘interesting’ reading. Bullshit, I say: don’t waste my time.Duhigg’s “sample size of one” anecdotes are unconvincing and unnecessary. A CEO creates a “habit” of worker safety and increases revenue by X percent. So? How do we know there isn’t a CEO next door who tried to create similar habits, thereby driving his company into the ground? And what evidence is there that the proposed habit played any causal role whatsoever in our company’s eventual success, in light of the multitude of other changes that undoubtedly occurred at the same time? Correlation isn’t causation, Duhigg, and appealing to the evidence provided by a sample size of one, where the sample is obtained after the fact, no less (selection bias, anyone?), is dumb.To summarize: the first part of this book was fascinating – even if not exactly concise – and gets a solid 4 starts. The second part, on the other hand, is irrelevant and entirely unnecessary, and deserves no more than 2 stars. Thus, I’ll grudgingly average out my impression and give “The Power of Habit” a weak 3 stars. Maybe I’ve just read one too many pop psychology books. You might very well enjoy Duhigg’s long, detailed, and humanized case studies, but I came here to learn, and as far as content is concerned, “The Power of Habit” is a light contender indeed. SummaryDuhigg’s thesis is that habits function in a self-reinforcing, circular manner. He calls this cycle “the habit loop”: first, there’s a cue that tells your brain to go into “habit mode”; then, there’s a routine, which can by physical, mental, or emotional; and finally, there’s a reward , which tells your brain this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.The Role of CravingDuhigg explains that craving plays a central role in the habit loop. In essence, the brain responds to a cue by creating a craving for the expected reward, which prompts you to begin the intermediate routine. In one study, researchers sat a monkey in front of a monitor and taught it to pull a lever whenever a certain symbol flashed on a screen. If the monkey pulled the lever at the appropriate time, it was rewarded with a shot of blackberry juice from a nearby tube. The researchers monitored the monkey’s brain patterns throughout the experiment.At first, brain activity spiked in response to the reward: the monkey saw the symbol, pulled the lever, got the juice, and – wham! The brain monitor registered a rush of endorphins. Also, at this stage, if the researchers opened the door to the experimental room, the monkey decided it had had enough and immediately left to play.Soon, the action became a habit, and the researchers started to notice something interesting. While the actions of the monkey didn’t change, its brain activity did: as soon as the monkey saw the symbol – wham! The brain monitor registered a rush of endorphins. Only then would the monkey pull the lever and get the juice. In other words, the flashing shapes became a cue to pull the level, and this cue created a powerful craving for the presumed reward.And when the reward didn’t come –when the researchers withheld the blackberry juice or watered it down – the monkey became increasingly agitated and “frustration erupted inside its skull.” At this point, if the researchers opened the door from the room, the money no longer ran out to play. It stayed, glued to the monitor, waiting for its next hit of blackberry juice. Duhigg explains that this is why habits are so powerful: “they create neurological cravings.”Overcoming Existing HabitsFirst off, Duhigg explains that it’s incredibly difficult to overcome a habit – for all intents and purposes, we’ll call it impossible. Instead of trying to get ‘rid’ of a habit, aim to alter it slightly. Keep the old cue and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine. Of course, to do this, you first need to identify the cue and isolate the reward.First, find out what cues the craving. Why do you habitually eat cookies at work? Does it happen when you’re bored? Does it occur at a certain time of day? This process of discovery is sometimes called “awareness training,” and it’s is the first step towards habit change.Once you’ve discovered the cue, isolate the reward. This can be tricky. For instance, in our cookie example, it might seem that the cookie itself is the reward. Duhigg disagrees: the cookie is the routine. The reward is the reason you eat the cookie. Perhaps you’re bored at work, and the cookie gives you something to do, as well as a pleasant energy boost; or maybe the cookie is a routine that allows you to socialize with your coworkers in the cafeteria; or maybe you’re just hungry. In any event, try to figure out why you eat the cookie.Once you’ve exposed the habit loop, insert a new routine. Do you eat the cookie out of boredom? Go on a walk instead. Do you really just want to socialize? Walk over to a co-workers desk instead. Are you just hungry? Grab an apple, then. The point is, cues don’t disappear, and cravings won’t just go away. “Habits are most malleable when the golden rule of habit change is applied: if we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted.” Creating New HabitsFinally, how does one go about creating new, “good” habit? This time, we need to create a habit loop. To form a new habit, you have to first find a simple and obvious cue. Then, make to clearly define a definite reward. Finally, insert the desired routine. Before long, your brain will be ‘trained to crave’. For instance, studies show that people are “more likely to stick to a new workout plan if they choose a specific cue, such as running as soon as they get home from work, and a clear reward, such as a beer, or an evening of guilt-free television.”It also helps to envision and focus on your reward: the ""most successful dieters... envisioned a specific reward for sticking with their diet - a bikini they wanted to wear or the sense of pride they felt when they stepped on the scale - something they chose carefully and really wanted. They focused on the craving for that reward when temptations arose, cultivated the craving into a mild obsession. And their cravings for that reward.. crowded out the temptation.""Finally, examples of using rewards being to foster the formation of habits abound in the world of advertising. For instance, modern toothpaste includes mint oils that induce a cool, tingling sensation in your mouth, which you soon start to crave (try brushing your teeth with Toms ‘natural’ toothpaste, which doesn’t include the oils. It's... unsatisfying). Similarly, shampoo doesn’t have to foam, but the makers explicitly add foaming chemicals as a reward. Says one executive: “once the customer starts expecting the foam, the habit starts growing.”Forming “good” habits is hard, and altering existing “bad” ones is even harder. It's all easier said then done. But now you know – and in the words of the immortal G.I. Joes – knowing is half the battle."

It would be easy to think you’d found a self-help book. Okay, maybe it could help a reader break an unwanted habit. Duhigg does try to analyze those behaviors. There are a few good stories of people who quit smoking or started exercising. But it is more accurately about patterns of behavior in groups as well as individuals: in corporations, the military, and the marketplace. I had never thought of corporations instilling habits, but we hear all the time about corporate culture, and that is an amalgam of habitual behaviors. This book is broadly organized around the concept of habits (with a number of fun stories) and around the endlessly entertaining custom (habit?) of observing human nature.Duhigg told the following story, which he claims hooked him on the subject of habits. An army officer in Iraq observed that violence in the small town where he was stationed occurred in a particular plaza. People gathered, food vendors arrived, then someone would throw a rock or bottle. He asked the town’s mayor one evening to keep the food vendors away. The crowd showed up, got restless and hungry, and eventually left – defused – because the street vendors were absent. Duhigg, then a reporter in Baghdad, asked the officer how he had analyzed this situation. The US military, the officer said, is an experiment in habit formation. “Understanding habits is the most important thing I’ve learned in the army.” This story did not initially meet my usual understanding of what constitutes a habit. But the habit of a kebab dinner supported the assembling of a large and restless crowd. At least for the duration of this book, I broadened my definition of a habit.But in case you really crave the self-help part of this book, here is Duhigg’s description of personal habit formation: A cue triggers a routine, which is the behavior you may want to change. There’s a reward inherent in that routine. Figure out what reward you really want, then change the routine to get it. The cue (an emotion, a time of day) will still be present, but you’ll respond with a different routine.Corporations make appearances in a couple of ways. The story of Paul O’Neill at Alcoa is one in which he sought to transform a poorly performing company by instilling a culture of safety. Employees were led to respond to dangerous situations with ingrained safety procedures. In other words, they learned new habits of response. Altering one important habit of all employees, in a highly disciplined manner, changed the culture of the corporation.But corporations also want to know about customer habits. If you shop at Target, consider yourself warned. The store knows more about you than you can possibly imagine. Uncomfortable territory. Your habits are known!"
35,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol,3,"A new year always seems like a good time to think about the things we'd like to change about ourselves. Just how we're going to do this is not always clear. My goal at the beginning of 2014 was to change some eating habits that were once again getting away from me. After listening to Michael Kindness interview with Charles Duhigg on Books On The Nightstand I decided it might just be the right time to pick this up.In the beginning pages Duhigg explains just what habit is. ""Scientists say they emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort. Left it its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a have, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often.""The author admits right up front that there is no manual for all and that it isn't always easy to change a habit. Duhigg does not at anytime condone breaking a bad habit, he suggests that habits can be reshaped. If you take a simple message from this book it is that a habit is ""a loop that consists of three parts: a cue, a routine and a reward"". Duhigg maintains the reformation of the habit requires you to change the routine. Routines that feel good are hard to change. ""Tomorrow, you'' muster the willpower to resist. Tomorrow will be different. But tomorrow the habit takes hold again."" You need to examine this habit loop and the behavior you want to change. The subtitle of The Power of Habit"" Why we do what we do in Life and Business alludes to this being not only a personal look at habit but how habit can be changed in business. Much of the book deals with this aspect but the principles explained can easily be applied to changing habits in everyday life. If the business model of habit or the habits of societies do not interest you, this may not be the right book but if you can see how the mindset is changed, I think you'll find value here.Did I reform my eating habits? Not quite but I am at least empowered to examine them and have done some tweaking of routine and will seek new rewards. It can't hurt to have more understanding in a look at oneself. "
36,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9281934-louise,2,"Charles Duhigg's premise is that habits are formed when behaviors are rewarded. Because the brain is wired to anticipate a reward it directs behavior towards getting the reward. The author presents some studies that show brain activity in the anticipation and reward cycles. He poses a ""golden Rule"" of habit change which is to identify the cue that anticipates the reward and find an alternative route to that reward. He cites AA, group/team and religious experiences to show that for habits to stick, belief is needed.After describing the thesis the author elaborates on it drawing rather narrow conclusions from research and case studies.Habit is the only explanation given for a study showing the later success of young kids who could wait for two cookies rather than eat one right away. It would seem that perception of time or visions of the future should be factors. Regarding the ""cookie"" and ""radish"" groups in another experiment, can habit really developed in such a short period of time, or was the result about cynicism or a merely an energy rush from sugar? ... and so it goes.While breaking habits is undoubtedly part of change, Duhigg sees his theory everywhere. He writes as though breaking habits is the only cause of complex organizational change at Alcoa. He attributes marketing success (Pepsodent, Target and creating hit records) to catering to habits, sports victories (the Buccaneers) to ignoring plays and building physical habits and the civil rights movement (the Selma bus boycott) to the habits of association. Each of these cases is comprised of many factors and teasing out the influence of habit would be a difficult to impossible task.Other sections cover memory loss, gambling habits, the Saddleback Church. While the descriptive writing easy to read, each has many issues embedded besides ""habit"".The value of the book is in the first part where the thesis is described and in the Appendix where how to use the thesis is clearly written."
37,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,3,"I first heard about this book during a Ted Talk or some other podcast and was immediately interested.The book is split in 3 sections. Personal habits, corporate habits and societal habits.Everything was presented in easy to digest segments, anecdotes and examples but I have to say after the first few times showing the “habit loop” to readers it started grating on my nerves. Yes, I got ittttt the first 10 times no need to bash me over the head with the slightly amateurish graphics.The chapters I found most interesting focused on corporate habits or changes in how they do business. Examples included Target’s algorithms to predict what people want before they even know they want it. The Starbucks turnaround and how song hits are predicted and presented by DJ’s.I also found the chapter on court cases involving compulsive gambling and murders under the influence of sleep walking interesting. And of course the section on Rosa Parks and why her act of defiance was the tipping point in civil rights in 1955.So overall this was a fairly interesting in-between read when you only have a few minutes here and there."
38,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9653496-hanne,3,"This is a well researched, well written book about habits and the psychology behind it. And yet, it was far from a home run. What I want most of all from reading non-fiction popular psychology books is for them to have an impact on me. The very basic requirement is to learn something new, but I also want them to make me think about my actions and behaviours and those from people around me, and preferably also to have a changing impact on me, which can be small or large, but has to be meaningful in some ways.This book achieved the interesting learning part, perhaps a bit of understanding behaviours, but definitely not the third. He does attempt to explain how to change behaviours and some people might find it useful. But I wanted more.The scope of the book is good though, starting from individual habits, how companies can change your habits, to organizational and cultural habits. Maybe because of this larger scope, it became more a show-and-tell about how others have done it, but it doesn’t really give you the ammunition to do it yourself. "

Mungkin hal ini akan berbeda-beda untuk tiap orang tapi buku ini mengajarkan saya untuk lebih banyak menganalisis diri saya sendiri, bahkan diakhir buku penulis menyimpulkan kembali dan memberikan langkah-langkah yang jelas.  “to change a habit you must keep the old cue and deliver the old reward but insert the new reward”Bagian kedua buku akan lebih membahas pengaruh habit dalam lingkungan yang lebih besar, Paul O’Neill melakukannya dalam bidang industri aluminium hanya dengan mengubah habit dari hal yang mendasar yaitu masalah safety, Rhode Island Hospital memelihara habit dimana dokter dan perawat yang tidak akur pada akhirnya membawa dampak mengerikan: Salah bor, ya sang Dokter melubangi kepala pasien disisi yang salah jadi sisi dimana penyakitnya berada harus dilubangi lagi -___-Bagian ketiga buku lebih membahas Habit dalam lingkup sosial, bagaimana Marthen Luther King Jr. memperoleh kebebasan masyarakat kulit hitam, juga bagaimana Rick Warren membangun anggota gerejanya. Hal lain yang juga menarik yaitu kasus seorang ibu (Angie Bachman) yang bangkrut dan terlilit utang karena gila judi dinyatakan bersalah di pengadilan sementara seorang suami (Thomas) yang membunuh istrinya saat sleepwalking dinyatakan tidak bersalah, padahal keduanya memiliki kesamaan yaitu mereka tidak bisa mengendalikan habit buruk mereka.Simple:Kata-kata yang digunakan mudah dimengerti. Penulis meyakinkan kita pada hal yang ia tulis dengan menceritakan kisah tokoh disertai dengan penelitian yang dilakukan yang secara mengejutkan tidak berat. Jika punya uang lebih sebaiknya baca yang versi asli. Berguna:Saya terprovokasi untuk mencoba menerapkan pada proyek Bad Habit saya, beberapa diantaranya:1. Tidak fokus, hal ini sering terjadi pada saya jika ada hal yang lebih menarik buat saya maka saya seakan lupa pelajaran dan kuliah saya. 2. Menghabiskan waktu dengan TV series (Suits, Scream Queen, Bones, Sleepy Hollow, fargo) wah rasanya liburan saya sangat tidak produktif wkwk3. melewatkan Sarapan Pagi, hmm sepertinya sarapan itu penting..Buku ini saya rekomendasikan buat teman teman yang punya kebiasaan-kebiasaan buruk atau ingin menerapkan kebiasaan-kebiasaan yang baik. “Changing Some Habit can be more difficult. Sometimes Change takes a long time. Sometimes it requires repeated experiments and failures. But once you understand how a habit operates- once you diagnose the cue, the routine ant the reward – you gain power over it” – Charles Duhigg. "

Of course there are lot many great books on human psychology of habits but this one states it in simple words through various case studies and proven experiments. I particularly liked Walmart and data scientist, the odor free solution of P&G case study, the case of compulsive gambler and of sentries at Iraq, and Starbucks to name a few. (Did I just cover a half book in them? Lol) But it's wonderful read. Besides it has take away lessons you can apply directly. Ever since I read that a trivial routine change like making your bed can be pivotal I keep things changing and it works every time! Finding the cues and changing the routine to get rewarded - a single topic has been experimented in worldwide renowned labs depicts the importance of issue (if you thinking it's not worthy to read about it.) 5 stars for this one. 5th star for covering the complex topic in simple words so it'd not stuck to few brilliant minds but penetrate to the masses n convey the message.

Charles Duhigg's Power of Habit is a must read for those who have either tried to cultivate good habits or transform organisations or puzzled over inexplicable happenings in the newspaper. I am an inside out person and I was able to apply most of what I was reading to my day to day life and what I see in the organizations that I work with. It even explained to me some of the puzzling outcomes such as the Marina protest for Jallikattu or why Harris Jayaraj songs are more catchy than AR Rahman's. Narrated only in anecdotes and case-lets, the book is a surprisingly easy read. Starting with the basic Habit loop, the books goes onto explore keystone habits, organizational transformation, social movements, the power of crises, gambling and the other side of habits. After all the fun stuff is a handbook on how to use the learning from the book.On introspection, there were so many reflections from your day to day life, that it seized to be a simple book. I personally loved the chapters on P&G Febreze case, the Alcoa transformation, Radio station habit manipulation, Starbucks customer service and the African American movement in America. If you notice a wide variety of things in the book, they are brought together almost seamlessly that your learning happens before you realize it.A definite recommended read in non-fiction, if ever there was one!

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE EVIDENCE BASED FACTS, but I expected MORE facts and science, answers to the why not examples to the what. • ... that being said, I enjoyed most of the examples and they did add a lot to my knowledge • random but I wish more chapters were like chapter 9 (more of neuro and facts) • the appendix is an overly simplified, repeated summary"

I’ve been avoiding self-help books for some time, probably because I’m at a point where I find them annoying and a bit boring. I’d rather escape into some good fiction any day! I thought that this book would be yet another self-help book and so I’d been reluctant to read it for a while. I was wrong. It’s not a self-help book and it doesn’t tell you how to change your habits. In other words, it lacks solid advice. Rather, it presents real stories and anecdotes of how others have changed their habits. The overall approach of this book is one of: “Habits can be changed, if we understand how they work."" If you’re looking for some informative and intelligent non-fiction to read, I recommend this.Some interesting quotes: “How do habits change? There is, unfortunately, no specific set of steps guaranteed to work for every person. We know that a habit cannot be eradicated—it must, instead, be replaced.” ""Willpower isn't just a skill. It's a muscle, like the muscle in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there's less power left over for other things."""

So unless you deliberately fight a habit, unless you find new routines the pattern will unfold automatically.While reading this book, I was socked realizing how many times I acted just by habit. Times when I didn’t think at all, just did what habit part of my brain told me to. This process within our brains is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future: THE HABIT LOOPThis book talks about habits and the psychology behind them.It’s well written and well researched; however I didn’t exactly liked full detailed case studies. It’s like the author thinks you don’t really understood what he said in early chapters and wants to explain it again and again in different case studies."

Duhigg discusses the science of habits and provides excellent anecdotes to support his theories. The chapters cover various topics, all seen through the prism of people's habits: exercise and diet, Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, shoppers at Target, the birth of the civil rights movement, and more. I'm a big fan of Malcolm Gladwell and there are parts of this book that read like something from him. Like Gladwell, Duhigg takes the science and applies it to areas that might not be typically associated with such (for example, the civil rights movement). Most importantly, he makes it easy for the layperson to understand. "

Or perhaps it was the cigarette. Or the drink.Habit.Did you know that the genius behind the methods of Tom Dungy–the only coach in the NFL history to reach the play-offs ten years in a row and the one who turned a troubled Colts team around and three years later took them to win the Super Bowl in 2007–was to teach his players to be faster than everyone else. But they wouldn’t be faster because they would focus on increasing their physical speed. They would be faster because they would learn habits that would make their moves instinct. When his strategy worked, Dungy’s players could move with a speed that was impossible to overcome.According to some research, more than 40% of the actions we perform each day are not actual decisions, but habits. And habits that we didn’t always consciously choose to start. We have sleeping habits, shopping habits, exercise habits, eating habits. Habits at work, at home, at school. Habits of the mind.Companies have a huge interest in changing our shopping habits. Coaches have an interest in changing the habits we use when we play. Teachers have an interest in the habits of their classroom. Families and communities have habitual ways of interacting. We all have personal habits we’d like to adopt and others we’d like to give away. But unless you know what you’re doing, habits can be extremely intransigent and slippery things.The good news is that a lot of research has been done in the last few decades, and we now know how habits work. When we arm ourselves with this knowledge, we’ll have a much better chance of changing. Luckily for us, we don’t have to track all that information down. In The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do In Life and Business, Charles Duhigg draws on hundreds of academic studies, interviews with more than three hundred scientists and executives, and research conducted at dozens of companies in his book and distills all this knowledge to its essence.The title might sound boring, but Duhigg follows the style of Malcom Gladwell (Outliers, Blink, The Tipping Point), and the Heath brothers (Made to Stick), and has written a book that I couldn’t put down. For example, I couldn’t stop reading about coach Tom Dungy, or Target as it predicts who is pregnant and how far along they are, or the scientists who couldn’t figure out why Alcoholics Anonymous works, or how bad organizational habits led to thirty-one people being burned alive in London’s King’s Cross subway stop. I couldn’t stop reading about why Rosa Parks, not the first African American to refuse to give up her bus seat, could pivot the civil rights movement. I couldn’t stop reading the stories of individuals losing bad habits, others picking up good ones, and others who lost their minds but not their habits. Duhigg uses these and many other examples and studies to illustrate the key principles underlying how habits work. In the appendix, he gives us a guide for examining and forming our own habits.I personally know the power of changing habits of the mind (which I’ve already written about). And teeth. A few years ago, I flossed once a week. It was such a pain. Now it’s a habit that I almost crave each night. I look back at how I made those changes and see it all laid out in Duhigg’s book. Can I actually change my habit of going to bed late? Stay tuned.If you’re interested in forming the habits of a class, team, company, or family; if you want to change some of your own habits; if you’re interested in knowing why we do what we do and enjoy the style of Malcom Gladwell and Dan and Chip Heath, then I think you’ll love this book.

This is the central theme of this book and this book goes in great detail about what are habits, scientifically, physiologically and how we can make Habit has the central focus of the activities around us, the events that we subject ourself to and the way we respond to every day seemingly insignificant events. This is a great book to understand human factors and mechanisms of our behavior, our friends behavior and behavior of people we see around us. This book is full of interesting anecdotes from different fields ranging from medicine, fields like mental health, hospital's organizational behaviors to the behavior of large organizations like Starbucks and Target. The book goes de-route into some recent advances in data-science as how organizations collect data to predict the ""Habits"" of it's customers and once it understand's the Habits, they know that they are not dealing with the rational self-controlled individual, but with more primitive part of the brain so they can easily have their way with them. There is a whole organization effort put into this and huge lot of science and tools built on top of this theory, namely to make customers purchase the product even when they dont need it, but their habit will make them buy it. Organizations are earning scores of the profit in this way.There is also good analysis of how leaders operate in mobilizing the masses, They give them a habit and people see the reward in following that habit. The reward in these cases are non materialist, but they equally valuable. Great leaders like Martin Luther King, gave his folks a sense of identity and community, encouraged the Habit of refusing to board the bus when there was in-equality. I can say the same for Mahatma Gandhi, who encouraged Indians to spin wheel to make their own clothes to ""obtain freedom"", his idea was this habit will make Indians disciplined and give them a concept of self identify. Both these strategies worked out and this book says that there science behind those plans that is basis of huge organizational change.Author presents with numerous case studies of people and their behaviors to elucidate the concept of habits and try to convince to you look actions and behavior in this angle. And if you want to change a particular habit, which I believe many are interested in, he gives definite direction as how one should approach. Simply stated, it involves identifying the cue or carving that is responsible for the habit and identifying the reward, and experimenting with different rewards when you want to change and the working on the change the habit loop and having plan for the cue. Don't get misled that now you know this idea, you can skip this book. This book will drill down into your head this formula and you will imbibe some ideas suitable for yourself as you read this book. Plus it is extremely entertaining to know how we have been led by some parts of our brain to do many of our actions. It is presented very well as illustrates with an example of himself changing a habit, eating a cookie in the afternoon, following those simple rules. Great read. Why 4 stars out of 5. I felt the sometimes the book deviated a bit too much into business and interesting data-science things and presented them in more detail, which of course holds on to the reader for entertainment than focusing on the topic in every page."

Fortunately, my concerns vanished away with the very first pages.This book guided me to understand thoroughly the meaning of a habit cycle, and instead of asking to break it, Charles Duhigg pointed out how to modify it into my benefit, aided with many studies and historic examples of real people who applied the change. Not only it focuses on habits from a personal view, but also it illustrates how big companies and influencers used the power of habit to their profit, how it affects society, and, last but not least, the neurology behind it. Ending with a reader’s guide to use the ideas by providing a frame work of steps towards habits modification. I immensely enjoyed reading this book for what I gained from it regarding habits and another aspects of our daily lives. "
55,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1280565-rob,3,"It's a fascinating read, combining some very accessible medical science with insights into human behaviour. Duhigg's an entertaining writer as well as an extensively-researched one; he uses suspense to superb effect at several points, and his revelations on the predictive power of Big Data in identifying our habits are startling. The first half and concluding sections are especially compelling, particularly with his recipe for changing old habits into new ones.I'm less convinced by his look at organizations and societies. It's always dangerous to argue from analogy, and by considering such forces as racism and organizational culture as habits, he downplays important factors — for example, the vested interest that some people have in maintaining the status quo, and their active efforts to thwart change. That doesn't mean the insights he offers aren't useful, especially when they target individual behaviour, but there comes a point where you wonder if there's any organizational behaviour pattern that Duhigg wouldn't consider to be a habit. (I started to hear his voice in my head saying that gravity is one of matter's habits.)Maybe the best measure of its immediate impact is how many of my own habits I'm suddenly identifying - which is lots. As for the longer-run impact, lets see how many of them I end up changing."

This book is incredible. It changed my view on how propensities formed my life. It is in not a manual or far reaching study, still it is very well investigated and tastefully composed.""The Power of Habit"" showed me an incredible reality about myself and other individuals. It clarifies why propensities are difficult to change; how to transform them; and why it can be anything but difficult to slip again into negative behavior patterns. It clarifies why it might take numerous actions to change a propensity. This book as helps anybody to figure out how to help others with and comprehend their own propensities. It utilizes anecdotes of individuals to help arrive point over. No big surprise it was a success on Amazon.com  http://amzn.to/2GY61b1  and will enable anybody to distinguish how their propensities are made. Essentially, you search for the prompts/triggers that are opening the normal/propensity that you are not content with and can't appear to stop. Once you figure out what is the reward you are getting you modify your craving for that reward. Is it true that you are eating the treat due to low glucose or claiming you are anxious, and it quiets you, and so on? While pouring through this book I got the chance to know the propensity circle and how to not really stop a propensity but rather to change it and to enable the person to have control, nixing the propensities power over me supplanting it with a new, healthier one. The stories in this book are wonderful and educate not just about propensities but additionaly a wide range of subjects of life. The best part about this book, it never went into some irrational tangent where you couldn’t comprehend what it was stating. Nonetheless, finding the triggers and rewards requires some serious energy and thoughtfulness - all dependent upon you. The book can't help you there. If you are looking for more “active” material, reads that give actual how-to steps here are some other reads that are in the same genre and which might be more beneficial to the reader depending upon your objectives:•	 “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life”  http://amzn.to/2Bgn9IU This book is a consistent bestseller on Amazon.com which makes it acceptable to change the “habit” of giving into other’s complaints, to treat demands for what they are. . . other peoples’ problems. •	 “The 2 Week Diet”  https://tinyurl.com/y8tva8xy A great program designed to re-design your eating habits for better health•	 “Old School New Body”  https://tinyurl.com/y8rcefrg This is a way to change the habits of poor health to those that lead to a better physique. •	 “The Big Diabetes Lie”  https://tinyurl.com/y794lh3q Have your habits lead you to be a diabetic, or pre-diabetic? Mine had, that is why I benefitted from this book and now no longer am a diabetic. I highly recommend this habit changing program. In any case, per the book, once you do identify triggers, you change the normal/propensity by power of will each time you experience the signal/trigger, ensuring that the reward is the same. Along these lines, rather than eating sweets, you simply run talk with companions intentionally, or whatever. I got this book supposing it was a self-improvement write for those needing to get out from under negative behavior patterns however that was not the situation; This book really clarifies the mechanics of how propensities are made and why they are so imbued into our frameworks. For instance, a man who lost all working memory in a mischance still held his propensity for taking strolls in his neighborhood. It expressly demonstrates how propensities are framed at a more fundamental and primal zone of our cerebrum which makes it so hard to change. Troublesome, yet not feasible.  “The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business”  http://amzn.to/2GY61b1  isn't a program that is laid out or unmistakable advances that one must take, however it gives you enough learning that you could work out your own framework for changing a propensity you never again need to have. When you have a craving for taking part in the ""terrible"" propensity supplant that propensity with another one you want to do that gives you a similar sort of reward/result/feeling. Do this again and again until the point when it progresses toward becoming . . . a propensity. The book causes us to see how propensities function and its effect in our lives. Seeing how propensities function could really make it simpler to grow great propensities and quit terrible ones. I truly delighted in the primary portion of the book more as it was centered around people and associations. The later 50% of the book was about propensities for social orders and it could have had a superior consummation by bringing it through and through. It was extremely intriguing to know how organizations focus on our propensities to advertise their items. In the wake of reading ""The Power of Habit,"" I felt incredibly enabled. I suddenly comprehended why it appears that I have no self-discipline. I could stop thrashing myself for my past disappointments and begin rolling out positive improvements. Regardless of whether you're hoping to change your life or not, it's an extremely intriguing read that will give you incredible understanding into how intense little propensities are in deciding how we carry on. General it was a decent book and I profoundly prescribe it to individuals hoping to make great propensities and surrender unfortunate propensities. "

58,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660033-aaron-thibeault,4,"A full executive-style summary of this book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/03/18...It is often said that we are creatures of habit, in that many of our daily activities end up being a matter of routine rather than direct deliberation (just think of your morning run-through). While this is no doubt true, author Charles Duhigg insists that this is but the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the impact that habits have on our daily lives. Indeed, in his new book `The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business' Duhigg argues that habits not only pervade our personal lives, but that they have an integral role to play in the businesses and other organizations of which we are a part, and that they are also at the heart of social movements and societies at large.The first part of the book focuses on the role that habits play in our personal lives. Here we learn about the habit loop consisting of cue, routine, and reward, and how the elements in this loop can be manipulated to help modify our habits (say from crashing on the couch with a bag of chips, to heading out for a run). We also learn about the power of particular habits called keystone habits (which include exercise, as well as eating together as a family) that help initiate a domino effect that touches all of the other aspects of our lives. Also, we learn about the power of belief--and the importance of social groups in helping create this belief--that stands behind successful habit transformation programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous.The second part of the book concentrates on how habits help shape businesses and organizations. Here we learn that the formation of habits and routines within organizations is unavoidable; what's more, that it is always best for the leadership of a group to make a deliberate effort to shape the habits of their organizations, and in a way that ensures a high degree of equality and fairness for its various members, while nonetheless making it clear who is ultimately in charge of each particular aspect of the operation. Second, we learn that keystone habits--which are at the center of our personal lives--are also pivotal when it comes to larger organizations (and how a particular keystone habit was applied to resurrect the once great but flailing American aluminum company Alcoa). We also learn about the greatest keystone habit of all: willpower, and how this habit can best be cultivated (and how companies such as Starbucks are employing these lessons to help train employees successfully). Finally, we learn about how companies such as Proctor & Gamble and Target instill habits in their customers.The third and final part of the book examines the importance of habits in social movements, such as the civil rights movement of the 1960's. Here we learn that movements tend to follow a three-part process. To start with, a movement tends to begin with a group of close acquaintances and friends. The movement tends to grow when these people spread it to the broader communities of which they are a part. Finally, in order to really take hold and spread, the movement must be guided forward by an effective leader who lays down new habits for the movement's adherents in a way that allows them to gain a sense of identity.On the negative side, the organization of the book is somewhat muddled, as there is significant overlap in the parts on individuals and organizations. Also, the section on social movements rests on a precious few examples, and therefore, the theory seems less convincing than it might otherwise be. Still, though, there are many things to be learned here and the book is well worth the read. A full executive summary of the book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/03/18...A podcast discussion of the book is also available."

Hopkins.I found this type of casual enlightenment awesome:""For most people who overhaul their lives, there are no seminal moments or life-altering disasters. There are simply communities— sometimes of just one other person— who make change believable. One woman told researchers her life transformed after a day spent cleaning toilets— and after weeks of discussing with the rest of the cleaning crew whether she should leave her husband.""This is very powerful knowledge: “When people are asked to do something that takes self-control, if they think they are doing it for personal reasons – if they feel like it’s a choice or something they enjoy because it helps someone else – it’s much less taxing. If they feel like they have no autonomy, if they are just following orders, their willpower muscles get tired much faster… But when the students were treated like cogs, rather than people, it took a lot more willpower.”Students who had been treated kindly did well on the computer test. Whenever a “6” flashed and a “4” followed, they pounced on the space bar. They were able to maintain their focus for the entire twelve minutes. Despite ignoring the cookies, they had willpower to spare. [The contention being that willpower is a finite resource].Students who had been treated rudely, on the other hand, did terribly. They kept forgetting to hit the space bar. They said they were tired and couldn’t focus. Their willpower muscle, researchers determined, had been fatigued by the brusque instructions."""
60,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65764-lana,4,"I read this book after reading its overall message in article form. Duhigg makes the claim that habits are everything, and then offers ways to change them in order to improve your life. This is not schlocky self-help- the tone is a little more subdued and a little more academic than most books of that nature. He can make habit-changing seem facile at times, which is eyebrow-raising when he's talking about addiction and addictive behavior, but he does come back at the end to point out that while understanding how to change habits is easy, changing them does require hard work, dedication, and time. Less easy. This is shown when the author attempts to change a simple habit- eating a cookie every day- and has to go through over a week of experimentation to identify the cue and reward, and then switch the habit. One point that I did not expect to see is about the power of belief- new habits only stick through times of stress and pressure if the person believes- in the reason for change or in the fact that that change is possible. Old habits *do* die hard- in fact, they never die at all. The patterns your brain learns are always going to be in there. Another useful piece of information was about cues- it may sound easy, but identifying the cues that your brain uses to decide when to go into autopilot can be very challenging. It is really interesting to pay attention to your own habits and see what cues you can identify, though. As a side note, the last non-fiction book I read also made a case of the Saddleback Church. (That book was Quiet, The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.)"
61,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5031502-dani-shuping,4,"“The Power of Habit” is one of those rare books that I started recommending before I even finished it. Charles Duhigg writes a practical book that pulls from multiple sources to explain how habits work, how they’re developed, how they’re formed in the brain, and how we might go about transforming them. Written in the style of Malcolm Gladwell’s books, Charles translates scientific language into clear, concise, and easy to understand for the average reader. He breaks the book down into three main sections--”The Habits of Individuals,” “The Habits of Successful Organizations,” and “The Habits of Societies”--and provides clear examples to back up what he’s written and his examples cover a wide range. For example, he writes about how Tony Dungy changed habits of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to mold them into a winning football team. And he talks about how the former CEO of ALECO championed safety in order to increase company profits. This is a book that anyone, anywhere can get something out of. While Duhigg doesn’t provide specifics of how to change habits in my ARC, (there will be an appendix in the final addition that may do so) there is still ample evidence in the examples of things that you can do and think about as ways to change/modify the habits you’ve built over a lifetime. Overall this is a fascinating book that made me think more about why I do what I do and how I might be able to change it."
62,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217216-allan-elder,3,"The basics of this book are fascinating. The Habit Loop consists of a cue, which calls a routine, which seeks a reward. That is whole book. There is little reason to read the rest of it unless you like a lot examples of this loop. Unfortunately, the book does not really explore the science of habits and absolutely, completely, ignores the research on behaviorism which explains the entire premise of the book. The science of behaviorism, while not popular, covers this material in a way that is actionable. Look at the ""amazing"" discovery of cue, routine, and reward and compare it the decades old behavioral idea of Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequence (the ABCs). Duhigg, identifies the habits as ""That psychology was grounded in two basic rules: First, find a simple and obvious cue. Second, clearly define the rewards."" He then spends the next dozen pages with examples from commercials. If you understand the ""ABCs"" then the book holds little value (unless you like stories). Jump to the Appendix ""A Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas"" and read it only. It covers everything discussed in the book but at least gives a hint about using the habit concept for change. The advice? Identify the routine, experiment with satisfying rewards, isolate the cue, and have a plan. That's it. If it matters, my review is based on the Kindle edition."
63,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118210-sarah,4,"Very interesting. Duhigg’s breakdown of the habit cycle ( Cue —> Routine —> Reward) is simple but it doesn’t follow that it’s easy just to change the routine. Sadly (for me) there is no magical formula to stop wasting time/exercise more/take vitamins/eat better, but it did confirm that breaking bad habits and forming better ones is really hard to do, so hooray for validation. Personally I found the section on the habits of successful organizations the most interesting. Duhigg cites research showing that an organization's routines function as habits, and these can either create success or result in thoughtless risk, waste and danger (depending on the industry). Similar to French pop culture child-raising notions (where parents must enforce a non-negotiable cadre within which a child has vast freedom), successful employees have considerable choice within their daily work lives (choice about shifts, uniforms, etc. lead to far greater productivity), but only so long as there is a clear ultimate decision maker. A “keystone” organizational habit (e.g., Alcoa’s prioritizing workplace safety above all else) can lead to higher quality and output by fostering subsequent habits of ownership and accountability. "
64,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63015728-ian-d,2,"Though the central idea is not uninteresting (quite the contrary), the writing leaves a lot to be desired: too many anecdotal facts, presented in a non-linear, incohesive way. All in all, the book could have easily been 200 pages shorter and that would have made it a more enjoyable read.Still, a lot of things to consider about building and reprogramming our daily routine. Unfortunately, being concise was not one of the writer's main habits. Neither was the editor's.If I could summarise it in one phrase, that would be it:""Water is the most apt analogy for how a habit works. Water hollows out for itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after having ceased to flow, it resumes, when it flows again, the path traced by itself before.You now know how to redirect that path. You now have the power to swim."""

70,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38970458-willian-molinari,5,"Read this book for the first time in 2016 and re-read it now (2019). The first time I read it, I did not take notes, so I decided to ""properly read/listen"" now.I like the number of studies this book shows and how much we understand about our habits by looking at its results. Some of these studies are already debunked by science (like the marshmallow study), but it's still a great book.At the end of the book, the author provides some examples of how you can use the content of the book to apply to your habits. The goal of this book is not to give you a step-by-step guide on how to change your habits, but to show you how they work. Your cues and rewards are unique, and you have to understand yourself to deal with them.I will keep this piece of the review here. I wrote it in 2016 right after adopting my dog:I'm training a little dog now, and it's really impressive to see how we made some habits for him. It became natural for the dog pee on a specific place, for example. The important part is to keep the same cue, routine, and reward. :)My dog is three years old now. :)Here are my notes for this book:More than 40% of actions people perform every day are not actual decisions but habits according to paper by Duke University in 2006Removing food from the plaza where a group unites was a good way of not keeping them there. When people start to get hungry, they go somewhere elseThe research was done with Eugene, known as EP in the medical literatureThe basal ganglia stores habits in the brainThe brain is continually looking for ways to reduce effort -- it seems to be the same idea exposed by thinking fast and slow :)Patients with basal ganglia damage can't get basic feelings because they don't understand simple face recognitions (they don't know where to focus)Whin cues come out of order or in a different shape, they are not recognized, and the habit is not started. The cue starts the need for a reward and the craving for the routine to achieve it. That's one of the reasons why cellphone notifications are so difficult to resistSome people say they like to workout because of the feeling of endorphins, others because of the sense of accomplishment when tracking their results -- I'm at the gym now, and I'm not sure what motivates me. Maybe keeping my routine? (PS. I'm not too fond of the gym environment, but it's ok now)... oooh... Got it, it's the audiobooks! :)The breeze by P&G was created as a great product to remove odor. In the end, they found out that no one wants to admit that their house stinks, so there's no cue. They transformed the product into something else that smells good and created another cue at the end of cleaning. Tne product got millions of revenue. -- yeah... In the end, it's all about money.The cravings drive the habit loop. You need to feel the need for something to power the habitA football trainer (buccaneers) applied a habit-changing routine to his players for years. This training made players not think in certain situations, but apply habits instead, which is faster. -- it reminds me about playing drums. Sometimes I don't know how I'm playing, I just start, and the rhythm takes care of itselfBelief is important. It doesn't have to be God, but you have to believe that you will get through stressful moments when your routine is not working""Some football teams are not teams; they are just guys who work together"" -- saw that more than once but with developersChanging one habit may chain many other reactions and enhancements. Like changing safety may increase profits and communication.

We're in the people business serving coffee"", Starbucks former presidentWhen people are doing things that require willpower, and they feel doing it for themselves or helping someone else, it is less taxing on their willpower. If they feel they are just following orders, it will require a lot more willpower to get the job doneIf a company doesn't cultivate habits to build a good culture, it will still emerge but in a disorganized way.You usually turn right when you enter the supermarketOur brain likes to listen to songs that seem familiar, and this is what makes a big hit.If you dress a new something into an old habit, it's easier for people to accept it (hey ya example)Martin Luther King Jr movement was also based on social habits, strong and weak connections, and peer pressure. It was created in a way where many people agreed, and others will feel bad or ""against it"" if they did not participate (after all, they support it, but some were just not committed enough and could drop it without peer pressure)To political movements to succeed, people have to change their habits. Their identities have to change.Near misses in a slot machine (and possibly other places) are very addictive for the brain, especially for those sensitive to gamblingOnce you know a bad habit exists, you have the freedom and responsibility to change it. You will be held accountable for it.This book provides a framework to understand how habits work and a guide on how they can be changedTo change a habit, find the cue reward, and routine, and then change the routine. Try some alternate routines keeping the same cue and reward. Take notes of your feelings right after the routine and reward. After 15 minutes, are you still craving for this habit? Example: buy a cookie every day. Try to buy different things or buy in different places to find the exact reward you want to have, and then keep the new routineTake notes of your cravings and what's the situation that triggered it: time, action, where, mood, etc. It will help you to identify the pattern"
71,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645496-wai-yip-tung,1,"The Power of Habit is a plainly bad book. So bad that in half of the book, the author just don't know what he is talking about.By now I have identified this genre of non-fiction book I would call Malcolm Gladwell-esque, journalists packaged popular science or popular psychology books. They would write about a topic with some scientific basis, but often spiced up to look very much like they have discovered some secret formula of success. Unfortunately their literary skill gets far ahead of their analytic skill. The result is an illusion that dazzle people at the beginning. But ultimately turn out to have little substance.The thesis and the secret formula to success in this book is habit. Had Duhigg concentrate on the finding in science and neurological underpinning of personal habits, it would have been a mildly interesting book. Once he takes this thesis and apply it to organization and social level, it falls apart quickly.He write at length about how new habit introduced to corporation like Aloca is a huge success story that turned the company around. Mind you what he call organization's habit we usually refer as ""corporate culture"". If you have never suspected ""corporate culture"" could have effect on its performance then Duhigg's book would be a revelation for you. But to most people who have some business sense, Duhigg has add nothing to add to the familiar topic of corporate culture other than his spiced up anecdotes.The book reach its low point when he try to explain Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott incident. To drive the habit theme he use the term liberally in the passages, results in curious phrases like the habit of friendship? the habit of peer pressure? and the social habit of weak ties? 'Habit' has become an entirely meaningless buzzword. Had he dropped the term from the sentences, they would at least be understandable vocabularies like ""friendship"", ""peer pressure"" and ""weak ties"". ""Weak ties"", being a well known concept of social and network science, further expose Duhigg's weakness as he wrote about it at length and it shows he has a lot of misconception about the idea.Ultimately he story about the power of habit really have little predictive and discriminatory power. If the social structure of the black community (I can't bring myself to say social habit) of the Montgomery explains the Rosa Parks incident, then why is it such one-off event? Since the social structure is well established why isn't it deliver forceful activism all the time? And what about all other communities that have similar social structure to Montgomery? What evidence can you find that demonstrate the power of so call ""xxx"" habit in these other communities?(Review is base on reading of selected chapters)."
72,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,3,"In this book, Charles Duhigg takes a look at habits from a number of different perspectives - individual habits, like exercising or drinking, organizational habits, like how departments within corporations communicate with one another, and societal habits, such as those that can motivate individuals to undertake certain actions as a group. His thesis is that habits control a large part of behavior on all these levels. Habits can't be eliminated, he says, but by becoming conscious of them and taking certain steps, we can replace undesirable habits with more productive ones.It's an interesting theory, and he fleshes it out with a number of intriguing anecdotes. While the stories he tells are all quite fascinating in their own light, however, I don't feel they illustrated his points quite as successfully as he thinks they do. Take, for example, Alcoholics Anonymous. He highlights the group as an example of a system that creates habit change. And while it certainly has been successful for some members, its high failure rates undermine Duhigg's thesis even as he presents it. Duhigg amends his thesis to account for this failure with the idea that those engaging in habit change need to believe in what they are doing in order for it to work long term. Yet I don't think it would be too hard to find people who have fallen off the wagon despite their belief in the program.Throughout numerous other examples, Duhigg continually assumes correlation equals causation and gives credit in places I don't believe is necessarily due. For this reason, the book isn't as solid as it could be. That said, however, the stories he tells about how change was facilitated by individuals and organizations are very thought-provoking and I definitely learned some things by reading them; the story of how a new CEO transformed the giant corporation Alcoa by focusing on worker safety was particularly interesting. In the appendix, Duhigg does acknowledge that there really isn't one specific way to create habit change, and doing it effectively is going to depend on the habit and the person or system involved. If one can accept that changing habits isn't as simple as he tries to make it sound earlier in the book, there may be useful information here."

It was a pretty long book, definitely a re-read.Notes:- If you remove certain arts of the brain it can effect memory, and tasks, habits don't rely on memory parts of the brain which is interesting - the brains basal ganglia basically is the habit forming/storing area- habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort - it's like a computer cache system, if it loads a page it remembers the page so it doesn't have to load it from scratch again - we can devote mental energy to new ideas and concepts etc- Habits are formed by cravings, there's a cue, a routine, and a reward- People crave the tingly feeling of minty toothpaste because it makes them think the product has done something, that it has had an effect. Fabreeze has the fresh smell at the end of your cleaning which creates a craving for that scent and that feeling of accomplishment - “It seems ridiculously simple, but once you’re aware of how your habit works, once you recognize the cues and rewards, you’re halfway to changing it”- “We know that a habit cannot be eradicated—it must, instead, be replaced. And we know that habits are most malleable when the Golden Rule of habit change is applied: If we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted. But that’s not enough. For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.”- Willpower is a muscle, you can use it all up for the day and it will become exhausted- Starbucks allowed autonomy among their employee's and this increased morale"

Why and how we do things by force of habit was interesting enough, but being tracked by retailers to determine buying habits so they can target your needs and cravings was a real eye-opener! Target is the retailer exampled in this book, which makes you wonder why they chose that name. And apparently even gambling casinos can keep track of habitual gamblers and use their addiction to keep them coming back for more. The author takes a complicated subject with a lot of scientific study available, and makes it simple and entertaining enough for any reader. The 4 star rating is for the things I learned through reading this book that I never knew before. The social habits that fed the Montgomery bus boycotts after Rosa Parks arrest in 1955 were mind blowing. This is quite a read."

I got tired of that so I picked up a used copy at Powell's Books in Portland last month when I was there. That being said, I really liked this book. I wanted to read it because I thought it might help me change some of my bad habits into good ones. However, I found the part about businesses, especially retail, and how they look at consumer buying habits to be quite interesting. I also thought the part about music and how music companies determine what will be a hit and what won't to be of even more interest. I will be wondering about it the next time my favorite song comes on the radio!There is a section on social movements.

76,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,3,"The problem with this ""genre"" of books is that they leave 90% of the writing up to anecdotes and authors in this instance rarely have much that they are really trying to convey. I felt this strongly with the power of habit. The anecdotes were good but they did not flesh out the premise of book nor did it appear that the author made enough ""statements"" to provide any substance here. The thing that this book has going for it is that most of us don't really think about our habits and how they affect business or ourselves. This book gave an excuse for the reader to mentally explore their own habits and those that govern larger organizations to which they might belong, but reading the book may not have been necessary to get there. Probably could have done it after a 3-4page convincing article. Just saying. "

What could have been a very dry topic on our scientific responses and why we implement good/bad habits in our life, ended up being an absolutely fascinating piece. The book tackles everything from how DJ's get us to listen to certain music, to how businesses use surveys to control our habits (again, both good and bad), and even how brands target consumers to make their products a part of our routines when they had never existed before. The end of the book offers valuable advice on how to break bad habits by identifying your habit loop and how to get the good stuff back in your life.

If you want to change a habit, lose weight, quit smoking, change drinking habits, read this book. It describes patterns and habits that shape our lives, and, if we can learn to recognize the cues, it's the first step toward shaping those patterns into the habits of a life we want to live.In addition to personal habits, the book delves into social group habits--what shapes the habits of people who act as a group.

You can't skim this book.As always many concepts in this book aren't new but it is the context, the examination of success and failure - and the solutions applied - make up the core value to this book.Leaders in the time management, diet industry and money management sectors always tell us to ""write down how we spend our time, what we eat and how we spend money every single day"" and by analyzing that, then using the knowledge we can make change. They've been saying that for a long time and for many it works but it's only half the solution. We all have triggers in our life, negative and positive. We react to those daily triggers with responses that have become habit because the result is positive and pleasing. Adults don't change habits easily, many won't be able to at all because the triggers never go away and we need our positive pleasure at the end of the habit. This book teaches the reader how to understand the trigger, change the response to get the same reward. A tricky thing but there are dozens of story from live, business and history that vividly tell this tale of cause and effect.The stories make for a fascinating and practical read, it actually forces you to slow down and ingest the story and the lessons. Many of the stories really move the reader, more importantly this is a BUSINESS book that tells you why that humanity, emotion and desire for dignity is a business revenue advantage. I love that this book is free. ""Companies aren't families, they're battlefields in a civil war"". Worked at a company like that once? Me too. We needs solutions, not coping mechanisms. This book continues the focus on where neuroscience and the brain meets business strategy and marketing. I am the grocery shopping for my family - the book's tale of how we are controlled by supermarkets like rats in a capitalistic maze read like my weekly routine. It offends and impresses me how hard they are working to make me break the list I bring each week. When the author does interviews he often talks about a case study in the book where a department store did such deep data analysis they captured part of the massive baby market because they could tell a woman was pregnant before she had told ANYONE, spouse/family included. You'll leave this story realizing how much better you can serve your clients/donors if you apply this ""life cycle"" observation approach.The book's many valuable touch points on networking include a great chapter on the power of weak ties, that LinkedIn allows us to find ""people like us"" quickly in the business world is powerful. Discussing how to harness the power of peer pressure and how to make it work for you was brilliant and again, really down to earth.What you will remember about this book are the many lessons you learn from the stories...-About how the music industry uses the power of the familiar- About how athletes use the power of training to get instant response from their minds/bodies to WIN- About how businesses capture the power of keystone habits ( one small thing that affects every part of the business ) to positivity influenceIt's a fabulous read that will no doubt spark your creative mind to take a lot of notes for today and turn them into business improvement and revenue tomorrow."

I didn't really like this section for a reason that is pretty unfair to the book itself, which is that I felt like it was Behaviorism 101 with Habit graffiti all over it. I totally get that this guy had to sell this book, and it's very nice, but a cue is a discriminative stimulus, and a habit is a behavior, and a reward is a reinforcer. And I'm sad, because there would be nothing better on Earth than more people understanding contingency management! And now more people do, but less rigorously and with some fuzzy generalizations. (Also, I was like, did these animal behaviorists really say things like, ""extinguishing habits""? I would have a hard time saying that.)Re: part, the second. I think I could read a whole book about Paul O'Neill!! I found everything else to be kind of boring.Re: part, the third. What was this?? Each story in this section appeared to be completely unrelated to its stated theme, the book's topic, and/or each other. I'm never going to be annoyed to read a story about the Civil Rights Movement, but the relevance to habit formation was very weak (basically, because, similar to the first section, there is a strong literature base in this area, it's just called something completely different... because it kind of is something completely different). And then how did the gambling relate to the habits of societies?Re: the whole. I just kind of hate how these lay psychology/neuroscience books are written. I don't want to read forty long and detailed anecdotes about the same concept. I don't want descriptions of the voices and gestures of random people who are soundbited for the book. I want the whole story at once, not X, Y, X+, where X is the application of the concept, Y is another application, and X+ is what realllly was going on during X. I don't want very obvious first line hooks and last line closers. I don't want touching personal stories that cloud the science. Basically, I want to read a journal article. So yeah, not really the book's fault that I'm not the intended audience in any way. "
92,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16897950-tiffany,1,"As the first book of the year it was supposed to start off 2015 with a bang. Annoyingly it fizzled fast. Habits? Changing habits? Giving up the bad ones?!?!?! Fabulous idea.This book? Not so much.Here's why: 1) There is no explanation of how one goes about changing habits, or if there are they aren't necessarily in this book. There's not even any explanation about the Premarck Principle. How did this guy write a book about habits and omit that?!?!?! As a how-to manual this failed;2) Despite the claims the author made about speaking with 100's of scientists there was no real discussion of how psychology works. You can protest this, but frankly the tiny and frail explanation that did appear was back of cereal box worthy. As a scientific exploration of the psychology of habits, this book failed;3) All of the case studies were dull dull dull (football, fires in the London underground, ...) God gad! how can one make a fatal fire in the London underground dull? By the time I got towards the end of the book and Mr. Duhigg FINALLY gave an example that I should have been interested in--the successful sea change in the life of the American philosopher/psychologist William James--all of my attention and goodwill had trickled away. As a page-turner, this failed; 4) Annoyingly edited so that case studies, when begun, are interspersed with other stories. This would've been fine if Mr. Duhigg were a more skilled writer. As a book designed to edify and raise the human soul it failed; 5) After Mr. Duhigg blathered on about football for 100 ... 100, nay, a thousand ... interminable pages, I realized he was writing for people who gamble on televised sports. Hah! A business book! How did I miss this? But frankly, considering there was never anything FRESH about advertising, creating consumer habits, being a great leader (apart from rewarmed leftovers from Napolean Hill, Claude Hopkins, and Warren Buffet) as a business book it supremely failed. Couldn't even finish. An unmitigated wall banger."

After I'm done with it, I'm here to go on the record to recommend this book. I have to admit that big part of it for me that it's the right book at the right time. Reading a book about how habits work while in the middle of trying to be more active, lose some weight and other personal projects is just a great fit.However, I still think that this is a great read and the book makes a great case about how and why do most of the things we do on daily basis. Gaining self-awareness about your good habits can make them better and more sustainable, and understanding your bad habits is the start of how you can get rid of them.The book isn't one of those books about self improvement or how to be a better person. It's just a collection of stories of people, organizations, communities applying science or just good sense to make their lives better. Even though the book contains a chapter at the very end about how to take advantage of all these stories and apply them to your life, it doesn't do that in a form of a plan or ""10-steps to better habits"". This is a big relieve for me.Sometimes the author gets a little carried away with the theory of how habits is the base of all behavior. That still doesn't take away from the book being a great read. The author is able to move easily from one story to another, give the right amount of details and keep you interested.This book doesn't really fall within my genre of books that I usually read, but I really really enjoyed it."

I heartily recommend this book to anyone who likes Malcolm Gladwell's writing. Like a Gladwell's book it's a mix of brain science, self help, business marketing,social science and business management. Filled with fresh findings and examples,I'm finding this book to be consistently interesting. An extensive footnote section show the fact checking behind the book.I'm compelled to add this snarky comment..... Febreeze's current tv advertising is not consistent with the habits that Duhigg talks about their marketing team wanting to instill in their customers.

How weak ties (acquaintances) are a powerful connecting force, how accidents and crises tend to make organizational changes easier, how a sense of control helps preserve one's willpower.But the book fails to show exactly how to make changes in habits, and so it gets the three stars.Combined with Influencer, Switch, and Change Everything, this will deepen your understanding of how change is made. Overall, recommended."

At the last part of the book, it says about ""the social habit"" which , I think, is more of sociology than psychology, especially habit. It seems like more phenomenon, I would say. The problem I don't agree in the end is that author tie all of social, psychological and decision making, behavioral thing tightening to just only habit which I don't agree with. These are separate phenomenons, I think. As the person who is interested in these subject, he uses some sort of rhetorical connections to make it interesting. After I read this book, I thought what exactly the author define habit. Because, in the book, it will totally different or distinguished, perhaps, to define the habit in the book he meant if he uses his definition and anecdotes in this book instead of separate psychological and sociological and psychiatric and neuroscience like the last part of the book. In the end, I agree some part and don't agree some parts in the book. I even checked the real scientific definition of ""habit"" after I read the book. Because, it left in the perplex."

It's a pretty interesting read in terms of information, with a few key insights that will surely help me understand my habits and actions and willpower more, as well as, hopefully, improve them.My key takeaways are:- willpower is like stamina: you'll run out if you try too many willpower requiring tasks together;- willpower can be trained;- willpower can be ""cheated"" by habits, making actions effortless;- replacing a habit best works by keeping cue and reward and replacing routine;- creating a new habit will work best if you keep the cue and rewards consistent;- identifying and implementing keystone habit in people or organisations can cause a chain reaction of goodness (how do I identify it though?);With many takeaways and a general good feeling about the book, I can't say it's a great book, as books go. Just like many other self-help ones, it's filled with useless anecdotes, endless stories to make a point long understood. I had to listen to the book at 1.5x speed just to get through it without being bored during stories. Most of them can be reduced to one page reference, but I guess the book would then become just an article."

The case studies were quite a joy to read and actually provided more light on topics I thought I knew a lot about (specifically the Rosa Parks > Martin Luther King bit). Also, Target's freaking scary. They have the best t-shirts though, the ones with the funny one-liners.That being said I can see why some people wouldn't really find this book appealing, some parts seem to state the obvious. Other parts were well-documented and had some of that reporting flair that I was expecting from a journalist-author.While the book itself was a great overview of understanding the causes of behavioral habit, I found myself more interested in the case studies. Honestly, throughout the whole book, I think the Appendix actually had the most impact on me surprisingly.Definitely would recommend to everyone though, provides a great foundation to understanding behavior and how you could experiment your way to better habits. DROP THAT DAMN COOKIE."

I'm not talking Land O'Lakes cheddar; I'm talking about serious expenditure for what is basically milk curd. And then eating it. Daily. I totally sympathize with one of Duhigg's examples, a woman who gambled away nearly a million dollars and her family's house because her brain shut down when she thought about gambling or the casinos. Why? Because she'd gotten into the habit, and the triggers (boredom, the sound of slots, or the offers from the casinos, et cetera) generated a response in her that required the need for a ""reward."" I have no idea why I crave cheese - but this book offers some insight as to how I can find out and substitute some other routine that gives me a similar reward. Very commonsensical. There's some scary information in here regarding how much department stores, groceries, and Starbucks know about us. Our mass of habits makes us easy to manipulate. I thought this was eye-opening."

The most impressive aspect of this book is the way Duhigg explains the power of habits through citing real life stories of individuals, and those of institutions and movements like the Starbucks' training programs, the Montgomery bus boycott, Procter & Gamble's attempts to market Febreze and the safety record at Alcoa to name a few. The premise of the book being the cue-routine-reward loop based on belief and will power inspired me to introspect on a few habits of mine as well. And in my opinion when a book does something like that, the purpose of reading it is well served!"

Reading these stories felt like I am meditating on their inspiring life and I haven’t heard enough. Okay, we got it! Cue, routine and reward, et le voilà you have a habit forming for your good or not. So stick with part one of this book, and the rest is beach reading. "

Cravings.According to the author, we all have the power to change our habits through adjusting the routine to something more productive in order to achieve the desire reward. It sounds so simple, but really takes conscious effort, practice, patience, and persistence. I really enjoyed listening to the author narrate the audiobook and I think I was able to pick up some useful tips to become more productive and less destructive in the pursuit of my goals.

As I've tried to demonstrate throughout this book, habits - even once they are rooted in our minds - aren't destiny. We can choose our habits, once we know how.

Not all of them were success stories, but also neither this book is a self help book. It is a book about our everyday life force - habits. And this book was a real discovery for me. In simple words and flow explained habit cycle (cue -> routine + craving -> reward) was strengthened by a short real stories and experiments. And that's it - no multiple ideas, no bullshit success stories. Just a single idea, it's proof and even step by step explanation how to apply it by yourself (noting that it will be hard) ."

Journalists are too good at picking and writing convincing anecdotes that make me believe narratives that aren't supported in the science. And despite seeing that Duhigg is a journalist, I still read and enjoyed it.The cue was the title and premise of a popular psychology book with a self-help undertone (though the second half turns towards a smattering of organizational anecdotes that are less obviously related to habits). I gobbled up the ideas because it fit the routine: each chapter had a simple idea (e.g. the golden rule of habit change, willpower is a muscle) with two anecdotes that support it. And then I got the reward of feeling smarter and better able to improve my life through better habits. Though it's probably more of a near-miss since I haven't had a chance to apply it to my life.Dang. I think reading this book was a habit."

116,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9944562-pooja-kashyap,4,"The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg is quite an impressive book. With its umpteen examples of how people defy old habits at the sake of new productive habits and eventually achieve marvelous feat is extremely inspiring. Although the book does not promote or support one secret formula for quickly changing any habit but it makes one think with a different angle. Case studies of corporate success of Alcoa, Starbucks, and P&G’s Febreeze were quite a fascinating read.Other than these, there were some takeaways for those who’d like to try Duhigg’s work.Automatic modeHabits form an integral part of human brain that is responsible for carrying out day-to-day activities. Brain is always looking for ways to save energy as a consequent of which habits emerge. The process initiates from basal ganglia of the brain, where the region looks for cues or the first timer triggers. Later when the cues are same every time, brain goes into automatic mode and thus, forms a habit cycle.Habit loopHabit loop makes us behave in a certain fashion although we might not remember the experience that led to the development of a particular habit. However, if we try to figure out how habits emerge we’d find that there are two basic tenets that is grounded in human psychology: first, simple and obvious cue or a trigger and second, the consequent reward(s).The same two rules are followed for building a new habit cycle. However, at times, there are no cues or the available cue is not sufficient to trigger the new habit loop. In such a situation, an element called craving comes into play.Craving As a matter of fact, habits create neurological cravings. Most of the times, we are unaware of these cravings. Craving is an expectation that the brain begins to show towards receiving some kind of award. Only when brain starts expected reward, loop of new habits begin.Replacing habitsThus, the cycle of habit constitutes of three elements, which are cue, routine and reward. Cue and reward are constant elements. However, routine can be re-worked to change a bad habit into productive habit. For instance, if cue is stress, routine is biting nails and reward is feeling a sense of satisfaction. If routine is changed, the nail biting habit may get curb until some extent. Like, in the same situation when stress is observed, instead of biting nails, if attention is drawn towards sketching or towards calculating multiples of any random number let’s say 9, mind will get distracted to the fresh activity. After finishing the new assignment, the same sense of satisfaction is observed. Hence, if the routine is continued during the same state of stressful situation, chances of relinquishing the bad old habit of biting nails become high.Willpower Most importantly, replacement habits become a long lasting friend if they are also accompanied by belief of believing oneself. Experts have witnessed cases where habits like addictions have been cured when the element of belief is held strong.Duhigg has done a lot of hard work in taking out gems from the fields of social psychology, clinical psychology and neuroscience for surfacing the habit formation and change. His ideas of presenting fascinating stories and case histories would surely help the readers in relating themselves every now and then. Overall, an insightful book, delving into the art of building good habits since setting high goals is not enough."

Finally, he gives us a contrast between two stories, one of man who killed his wife while sleepwalking; the other of a woman who became addicted to gambling -- and how jurors ultimately found the man innocent and the woman guilty -- and why. Those two stories are the bottom line on the book -- what you can change, and what you cannot.Overall CommentsDuhigg reminds us that business processes and routines are nothing more than habits practiced on an organization-wide scale. If you can get your kids to brush their teeth every night, you can get your employees to provide great customer service and you can change and transform any habit you are addicted to.This is indeed a book that deserves a standing ovation for it Brilliance, Beauty and Boldness. I loved it! If you liked Freaknomics (Steven Levitt & Stephen J. Dubner), Blink, The Outliners, What the Dog Saw & Tipping Point (Malcolm Gladwell), then this is a book you must read.Overall Rating10 out of 10.Loy MachedoLoymachedo.com"

But with time and effort, almost any habit can be reshaped.” Definitely one of the best and most important books I have ever read!Charles Duhigg is an American journalist and reporter for the New York Times. In the power of habit he has a close look at how habits are formed and how we can change them. He explains how their concepts were discovered by the media and how we are manipulated by them on a daily basis. He introduces the concept of keystone habits and how small wins can effect our life's. By looking at the community factor of habits, concepts from the anonymous alcoholics to the civil rights movement are discussed and he finishes the book with raising critical ethical questions.This book offers deep inside and the storytelling of Duhigg is compelling!Here is what this book teaches you:- learn the anatomy of a habit- learn different factors that influence them and approaches on how to change them- realize how habits are used as advertisement tools and partially purposely instated within us- learn about the connection between habits and addictions- educate yourself about the power of community believes in order to provoke habit changes- get to know keystone habits and learn how to use them to your advantage- see how keystone habits can help you to build up discipline and grit- get awareness about willpower, from which we only have a limited amount of- get insight into how companies like Starbucks used those strategies to build their business- reflect on good and bad habits in medical care and their partly deadly consequences - see how companies predict the habits of their customers and influence our consume- Start deep thinking about ethical questions about who is responsible for what- Get a clear example of application on how you could try to change a bad habit The problem is that there isn’t one formula for changing habits. There are thousands. Individuals and habits are all different, and so the specifics of diagnosing and changing the patterns in our lives differ from person to person and behavior to behavior. Duhigg tries to provide a framework for understanding how habits work and gives a guide to experiment with how they might change.Once you understand that habits can change you have the freedom—and the responsibility—to remake them. Once you understand that habits can be rebuilt, the power of habit becomes easier to grasp, and the only option left is to get to work.Pro Tip: Read ""The Power of Habit"" by Charles Duhigg first and ""Anatomic Habits"" by James Clear after! They build up on each other."
120,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7309374-romanas,4,"This is a dual review of two books about habit. Habits are important things in one’s life and there are numerous books on the subject. The classic book, a must read, is The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey. Another two popular books about habits are The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and Atomic Habits by James Clear, that came out very recently. Having read all three of them I combined my notes for the last two in this post. No matter what stage in life you are, it is always good to review one’s habits and behaviour – these books provide a good framework for doing it.One of the habits I’m struggling with is to get rid of the reading of self-help books. Thus, reading The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and parallelly Atomic Habits by James Clear became a sort of a meta enterprise. Would these self-help books about habits help me to get rid of the habit of reading self-help books? There’s nothing wrong with the self-help genre per se. I believe, everybody should strive to become a better version of themselves. Evidently, there’s a lot of great wisdom in this type of books – many prominent figured refer to them when they tell the story of their success. However, having read tons of them, one would usually circle around the same known stuff and shabby ideas wrapped in different narratives and supported by different anecdotes. The trick here is to know when to stop and, actually, go out and do something by using the knowledge and inspiration gained.My own habit of falling back to self-help books is, obviously, grounded in the alluring products of the habit loop driven by the craving for knowledge on self-improvement. We can use the basic members of the habit loop – cue, routine, and reward – well covered in the Duhigg’s book and analyse the situation with the reading of self-help books. For this type of products, the cues (triggers) are everywhere, and who can ignore the wish for excellence? Then, the routine is easily carried out – the messages in those books are straightforward that doesn’t require a very deep thinking and reading between the lines. It just assumes the acceptance in many cases, and, finally, the reward is instant – the feeling of getting something very valuable – a digested wisdom and not seldom a bit of inspiration. It can be compared to junk food (which by the way is almost gone from my life thanks to this kind of books). However, my point is not to pick on this genre, but rather to stress the importance of not getting stuck in it, as in my previous point. Habit as a phenomena humans and other living creatures are equipped with is one of my favourite subjects. I strongly believe, in the end, habits defines us and our destiny. The subject of habit covers several interesting areas as neuroscience, biology, psychology, and more. The basic mechanics of habit system can be described through the theory of operand conditioning, a term coined by B.F. Skinner back in 1930. It is a technique of learning that occurs through reward and punishment for behaviour. Through operand conditioning, an individual makes an association between a behaviour and a consequence. A relatively simple feedback loop forming habits of an individual can be described in terms of drive, stimulus, response, reward with different kind of reinforcers – positive or negative. What was lacking in the model of operand conditioning was other influencers like feelings, thoughts, and, very importantly – beliefs. Moreover, human behaviour is so complex that factors as the environment and group psychology are of crucial importance when it comes to the habit science. Modern behavioural science takes these terms into account and they are very important in the habit theory. The authors of both books did a great job addressing these factors in their respective methodologies.Based on the early theory of operand conditioning, different models around habits and behaviour (in my interpretation, behaviour is a series of actions evoked by habits) are developed and fundamental terms are just called different names. Charles Duhigg in The Power of Habit grounds his model on the habit loop consisting of cue-routine-reward parameters which are driven by craving. James Clear in Atomic Habits suggests his model consisting of four steps called cue, craving, response, and reward. These factors are systematically analysed by respective author and the steps how to build good habits and remove the bad ones based on these models are suggested. In both books I found some valuable and interesting points as well as good tips on how to keep one’s habits on the right track.As one can see from the parameters in each model, there’s a difference in the arrangement of them making some differences in application of the methodologies of habit treatment. Duhigg sees the term craving as a driving force for the members in the habit loop – cue, routine, reward. Clear suggests that craving is simply a second stage in his model of habit. This is the main difference, and I need to admit I haven’t put enough time to analyse which model is right – both make sense. We would need some deeper diving in relevant disciplines and get help from ontology of the actual things here. Anyhow, I tend to believe that a craving lies above cue, routine, and reward. Cues alone without craving are meaningless. Nevertheless, both models are very useful for working on one’s habits. Duhigg argues that the way of changing or replacing of habit is to focus on the routine parameter, or the response part according to the terminology or Clear. Clear gives a lot of examples on how the cue and reward steps can be worked on. I completely agree that even these parts can be influenced, whereas Duhigg argues that the most important thing is to focus on routine leaving cues and rewards unchanged. I believe, we can remove unwanted triggers. Like making the tempting things like candies hard to reach and out of sight, etc. This has been well researched in a very interesting work by Richard H. Thaler for which he was awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2017. Then, we can reprogram our brain to think about rewards differently – change the mode of them or reinforce the distant rewards requiring immediate sacrifice by some direct reward. Clear has a lot of good examples how to do it.Habit should be seen as one of the essential parts forming an individual. A brilliant quote by Margaret Thatcher shows the operational importance of habits: “Watch your thoughts, for they will become actions. Watch your actions, for they'll become... habits. Watch your habits for they will forge your character. Watch your character, for it will make your destiny.” If we put those terms it in a different order, we can see that habits are very important, perhaps more important than one’s thoughts, because they are operational tools defining which actions one will take and what destiny those actions will form.In summary, if you are somehow unsatisfied with any of your habits and would like to actively and effectively change them and thus become an individual you’d like to be, I strongly recommend both books. I would read The Power of Habit book first, this book is longer, has more stories, and has more research behind it. Atomic Habits book is easier to get through, especially after reading Duhigg’s book. Both books, as you might have guessed, are clear, easy to read and grasp. They will give you the right mindset to approach your behaviour and provide valuable tools to shape your personality."
121,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/821228-adrienne,3,"I was having trouble staying asleep one night when I went to the Goodreads webpage (I know, you're not supposed to browse the web if you can't sleep), which recommended this book. I'LL DO IT!, thought I. What's more, I'll do it as an ebook on my iPad and I'll figure out how to start buying ebooks from the Tattered Cover. It's incredibly easy, by the way.It struck my fancy because I've been reading a fair amount about behavioral economics (you know, that radical idea that you can better predict how humans will behave if you study their behavior) and this sorta fit with that. It's basically a self help book, though. (I think the last line of the book was something like: ""You now know how to swim."")It covers a bunch of topics--some of which were more engaging than others. The bit about how Target using your buying patterns to accurately predict whether or not you're pregnant was cool and freaky. I felt so much gratitude and appreciation and curiosity for AA all over again, highlighted here for its behavioral therapy group sessions. The bit about the army major who prevents riots by keeping food vendor out of a public square was very interesting.My biggest complaint about this book is that he very rarely gets into the nitty-gritty of whatever it is he's describing. Even for something as simple as those little cue-action-reward diagrams that pop up all over the book, he waits until the appendix to really explain it (and I would recommend that anyone reading it start with that). There are heaps of end notes referring us off to scholarly articles--which is good but also a bit maddening. I would've loved to see more info about AA's twelve steps. Or read in more detail about how that woman got to be better at money. Or found out more about those habit patterns the army major mentioned.Still, totally enjoyable read. Reading on the iPad does not make you sleepy, but that's not the book's fault. I took down a few notes to look into some of those articles, and I made notes of those cue-action-reward steps. I'll be thinking about this book for awhile."
122,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7205156-oana-sipos,4,"The Power of Habit is an easy to read and practical book. Being interested in changing some habits, it did meet my expectations on how to proceed to do so. Moreover, it presents real cases and very interesting situations of how habits have been changed. As mentioned in the book ""habits can be changed, if we understand how they work.""The most important aspects to keep in mind are:1. The habit loop :: cue --> routine --> reward. The cue is that trigger that makes our brain go into automatic mode and also which habit to use. The next step is going into the routine loop (which can be physical, mental or emotional). Then comes the reward which is what tells your brain if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.Over time, the loop becomes more and more automatic and a new habit (good or bad) is born. Important to keep in mind is that ""when a new habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making.""2. How to create new habits :: (simple) cue --> (new) routine --> (clear) reward""To change a new habit, you must keep the old cue, and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine. Almost any behavior can be transformed if the cue and reward stay the same.""'The truth is, the brain can be reprogrammed. You just have to be deliberate about it.""Other interesting citations:- ""Foaming is a huge reward, said Sinclair the brand manager. Shampoo doesn't have to foam, but we add foaming chemicals because people expect it each time they wash their hair. There's no cleaning benefit, but people feel better when there's a bunch of suds around their mouth.""- ""There's something really powerful about groups and shared experiences. People might be skeptical about their ability to change if they're by themselves, but a group will convince them to suspend disbelief. A community creates belief.""- ""Willpower isn't just a skill. It's a muscle, like the muscle in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there's less power left over for other things.""If you're in doubts, I'd say ""go for it"" ;)"
123,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3056629-jenn-jr,4,"A colleague recommended this book to me - and I was pretty surprised at how much I enjoyed it! Charles Duhigg is an engaging writer, the book flows really well. Some chapters alternate stories to provide long-form examples along similar concepts which works well in most cases. The stories of individuals with injuries, addictions or even night terrors are juxtaposed against organizations and communities -- all demonstrating how habits can be individual or group. It's interesting note how much participation in a group or community can have on habits -- as well as creating a ""belief"" to improve the habits of a group (company, team, community).There was a fair amount of data on things such as weight loss and cutting out smoking or alcohol. The story of Alcoholics Anonymous was really fascinating. The story of ""Febreze"" was really interesting to me - esp since I have heard of the stuff and never used it thinking it was just another gimmicky air freshener. After reading about how it works - I am surprised that they had so much trouble marketing it! The story of the turnaround of ALCOA to a ""safety first"" company and the effect that had across the entire organization was also extremely interesting.The basic idea is this: identify the cue, the routine and the reward for your habit. If you find you are snacking, pay attention to what you are doing when you feel motivated to go get that snack to determine the cue. After you had your snack - think about what you feel and what you're getting out of the exercise of getting a snack. Then - figure out a substitute. A lot of people struggle with long days in the office and mid afternoon is a time when people often need a distraction. So a walk to the cafeteria or kitchen to get a snack - when all you really needed was a chat, a walk around the block or five minutes of meditation. It all begins with identifying the situation and the reward -- then you can change your habit, and maybe one day win the Super Bowl. Or something. Great book - check it out!"
124,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24428233-anna,4,"Although I wouldn't classify everything Duhigg writes about as ""habits,"" he told some very excellent stories about patterns of behavior, routines, social movements, addictions and neurological disorders in persuasive detail and context. He set out to write a book about what he considered repeated behaviors and defined all of them as habitual -- pounding that point home by cramming every concept into a neat ""cue, routine, reward"" patterned diagram. I appreciate what he was trying to do here. I enjoyed reading about such diverse examples as Starbucks' and Alcoa's changing company cultures -- and the individuals who made that happen, as well as its impact on employees, the civil rights movement, sleep terrors and personal habits -- -- but the subjects got to be disparate as the book went on. I think he should have renamed the book something along the lines of ""Thinking Behaviors: How Routines Evolve for Individuals, Companies and Society,"" or something like that. Maybe a title like that isn't snappy and attention-grabbing enough, but it would have been more accurate. I dunno.I just couldn't quite go along with his discussions of sleep terror murder, the founding of Rick Warren's Saddleback Church and gambling addiction as all under the same umbrella as ""habits."" He also injected a paragraph praising the Obama administration's implementing the stimulus package and healthcare reform way back when as good leadership in a ""crisis,"" then offering no follow-up as to how they were monumental failures that caused far more harm than good.These narrative flaws aside, he makes a good point that repeated routines -- whatever you want to call them -- can be changed and manipulated for the better in our lives, our professional lives and in society.I feel like I should point out how much I loved the chapter on Tony Dunge and the Colts and Buccaneers (given where I'm from, maybe that's not a surprise!). Very inspiring.Overall a decent read. "
125,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18918161-david-zimmerman,5,"Conservative Christians are often naturally suspicious of self-help books and books that are closely connected to modern psychology. While still cautious of such writings, I have found that many of them can be very helpful. Humans are a complex creation of God, consisting of a spirit, soul, and body. In the same way that a study of plants yielded the discovery of photosynthesis (a process designed by God to utilize sunshine in a plant's feeding cycle), so the study of humans has revealed many amazing processes that sustain our lives in this world. Some are physical; others are neurological, but together they help us understand how we function. Conservative Christians should not be afraid to learn from books that identify how these processes work. The Power of Habit is a fascinating and helpful book in understanding the science and psychology (in the best sense of the term) behind the habits we form. It is a completely secular work, but the research it appeals to is sound. The applications it makes are helpful. The illustrations - which make up a large part of the writing - are fascinating. They connect us to common struggles. They provide hope that lives can be changed; that bad habits can be broken and that good habits can be formed. As a secular work, the author does not address the fallen nature of man that creates our capacity for unhelpful, bad, or destructive habits. It does not provide the additional hope a Christian finds in a new birth and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. In this sense, it falls short of pointing people to all that God has provided to rescue us from fallenness. Those who know and understand these spiritual realities should find The Power of Habit a solid resource in their pursuit for a changed life. It provides additional insight into God's creative design and reinforces many biblical truths. Reading it was a good investment of my time."
126,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855541-marianne,3,"I found the Habit Loop (cue, routine, reward) a helpful framework for individual habits, and the appendix, ""Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas"" very helpful. The rest of the book lagged, but that is likely because I am not the target audience. This would have been a really good series of articles. In my opinion, best anecdotes supporting The Golden Rule of Habit change were about Tony Dungy's coaching. ""Belief is easier when it occurs within a community."" Habits at the corporate level were very interesting as well, Starbucks has the corner market there too. Their proactive teaching about how employees are to respond at inflection points - pressure situations -- was clutch. Made me want to think through the pressure points of my days and think through the best response. Loved the LATTE approach to communication - listen, acknowledge, take action, thank, explain. Howard Schultz's mother's questions of him at school resonated with me, ""What are you doing tomorrow? How do you know you're ready?"" Training kids to set goals and know how to proceed to achieve them. You can't extinguish a bad habit but you can change it. How we change habits should have been in the book not an appendix. 1) Identify the Routine. 2) Experiment with Rewards. 3) Isolate the cue.(Location, time, emotional state, other people, preceding action) In the sociological portion of the book I thought Rick Warren's mention was interesting, ""If you try to scare people into following Christ's example, it's not going to work for too long. The only way you get people to take responsibility for their spiritual maturity is to teach them the habits of faith. Once that happens, they become self-feeders. People follow Christ not because you've led them there but because it's who they are."""
127,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8164533-lilit,3,"I was thorn between giving this book a 3 or 4 star rating and here is why. Do not expect deep scientific analyses and interpretation of our brains' neurological functions, as the Author is an investigative journalist and not a scientist. That being said, the book is based on real science experiments/test/analyses which the author presents in a very lively and engaging manner. I personally felt, that it had enough science for me to grasp what habits are, how they are formed and how to change them...These were the first three chapters of the book ( my favorite ones) and probably the biggest part of the book that i will take for myself. Do not expect a rich literary language and stylistics accents. This is not the focus or the benefit of this book. Why I loved this book, is the reason it went beyond discussing habits on a personal level. It went on about keystone habits in organizations and how they can be altered through a crisis or cleverly administered policies. This will prove to be very interesting for those who manage their own businesses and is a reminder that organizations are run by people who bring in their habits. However, at this parts I was hoping to get more tools from the author and deeper analyses, which is not present in the book. The parts about Football were quiet boring to read...probably it will be more interesting for a fan. I feel there was no need to go into such great lengths to illustrate the point. The great part about the book is that it did not limit the notion of habits to an individual but dissected it and presented along a spectrum of broad magnitudes, objects and cases relevant to an individual, company, organization, social movement etc. It definitely rises interest in going into all these subjects one by one at a greater depth. "
128,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2371280-melanie,5,"I was fortunate enough to meet Charles Duhigg at the Science Online conference last week in Raleigh, where we were all given advance copies of this book to take home with us. First of all, Duhigg himself is awesome. Let's just get that out there. So I may have gone into reading this book with a bit of a bias.Secondly, as a psych academic, I know we're not supposed to like ""pop psych"" books. And admittedly, some are better than others. But I really think that this is one that actually gets it right! He talks about research in a way that is accessible yet completely accurate; every time he would be discussing research and I'd say something to myself like, ""Man, this sounds exactly like implementation intentions, I wish he would talk about implementation intentions,"" lo and behold, I checked the appendix and he was citing about research on implementation intentions! He was just talking about it in a super accessible way, so I didn't realize that was what he was doing.Thirdly, I feel like sometimes these ""pop research"" books will start with a theme...and then get a little off course. You can tell that the author found out a bunch of stuff while researching that he/she had spent so much time reading about, he/she could no longer realize that the topic material wasn't quite relevant to the central theme and didn't really belong in the book. I think that Duhigg does one of the best jobs I've seen of really tying EVERYTHING back to habits, and not going off course. There was only one minor part where I remember thinking it was a bit of a stretch (though I can't remember what that part was now...), and it still came back to habits in the end."
129,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59263288-mimo,4,"This book is a MUST-read for everybody who wants to change his habits or would like to know more about the nature of habits from a psychological perspective. First of all, I really enjoyed that Duhigg used a lot of examples to clarify his points since this gives you an overview how or brain works when it comes to habits and routines. Moreover, the book has a past paced and vivid writing style which made everything comprehensible.The only thing I didn't like about this book is that it could've have been a bit shorter. I felt like the author sometimes used too many examples illustrating one point when I was already like: I GET IT! However, this was a really informative read I would totally recommend!"
130,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4901672-debra-hamel,5,"A 2006 Duke University study found that some forty percent of what we do every day is habit. That is, we don't make decisions every day about how we're going to, say, brush our teeth--which hand to hold the brush in, when to turn on the water, how long to brush. It's a routine that we consciously settled on at some point, but it has long since become automatic, something we do without thinking, a habit. This is good, because if we had to make decisions about every single action we take in our lives every day, it would be paralyzing, and we would have no time to think about more interesting stuff. So it's vital that our lives are filled with these routines, these habit loops, although the habits themselves, of course, can be either good or bad. In The Power of Habit Charles Duhigg talks about the habits of individuals, businesses, and societies, using examples of each to show how habits work for good or ill in real life. He discusses, for example, how Starbucks instills willpower in its workers by inculcating good habits, how Target profiles its customers based on their habitual purchases, how the new CEO of Alcoa turned the company around by focusing on the institution's habits related to worker safety. The most interesting part of the book, however, is Duhigg's discussion of how habits work, how they can be created, and how bad habits can, with work, be reprogrammed. It's really a fascinating read."
131,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34320095-krishna,5,"It is very good book for learning the power of habits.Brain treats the routine action is a habit, habit is a formula the brain automatically follows.Once if u understand how habits works,it is easy create new habits.For some people drinking and smoking is a habit from young age,for them difficult to quit/change the habit. The replacement of habit with other habit is easy,once if u practice with few possible habits and for instance you can replace smoking habit with walking to a certain distance.The brain will tell what is good and bad, once if u take control of habit loop. If u start choosing the good things as a habit, ur life will turn towards success.Brain will follow hundred's of habit everyday from wake up at morning, brush teeth and walking etc.. to go to bed at night. At the same time however the brain depends on automatic routines can be dangerous, habits often is much benefit. For instance take Indian Hindi movie Gajini (Amir Khan), habits gave him his life back and after his memory loss and they took away every thing again.Companies like Starbucks created a habit as an organizational habit -when will power become automatic, this is a habit of success for Starbucks. Starbuck did teach every employee with a self-descipline and good customer service as a habit.Some times leaders will create a habit through accident and design,when the company in crisis."

It's a must read for everyone who wants to understand themselves better, be more effective at eliminating self-destructive behavior, and generally broaden their knowledge. I wish this was what they taught us in school, instead of all the crap that's useless in everyday life.It's not like I didn't know how habits are formed, but reading about it in such detail has helped me to finally see my bad habits for what they are - a random pattern in my brain that formed when I wasn't paying attention. I've already broken a bunch of such patterns in a matter of weeks. (The book is pretty big, so I've had plenty of time to work on it.) It was also a real page-turner.I'm bewildered at the number of 2 star reviews from people who found it hard to read. You're embarrassing yourselves.It's obvious that the author used additional examples to better explain his point. If you can't keep up with two-three stories while also remembering what it's all about, go back to school. Don't give a poor rating to a brilliant work because you couldn't understand it or because you wanted a magical formula. In other words, this book is for those who are ready to work in order to get results. "
133,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1335442-charlane-brady,4,"I enjoyed Duhigg's perspective. He states the real power of habit is the insight that our habits are what we choose them to be. Once that choice occurs - and becomes automatic - it's not only real, it starts to seem inevitable. He presents research and shares examples of powerful organizations that have brought about change by replacing one habit with a more desirable habit. The sociological nerd in me thoroughly enjoyed Part Three: The Habits of Societies. Throughout the book, I often found myself thinking of Nelson Mandela. I thought of Mandela because he is a perfect example of how habits create the world one inhabits. As Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years, his habitual thinking of himself and his surroundings created the world he inhabited. The oppressive setting did not create his world, his power of habit created his world. Though not mentioned in the book, I admire Mandela even more after this reading and I am encouraged to continue believing in the power of habit. There is a delicacy and a beauty to a habit. A delicacy we must identify and believe with a beauty of choice and reality. William James wrote about habit and said it is ""the thing that bears us irresistibly toward our destiny..."". "
134,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,3,"Interesting. Duhigg addresses habits of individuals, organizations and societies. I thought the part about individuals was packaged quite well. The organizational habits section was an eye opener and most definitely not for conspiracy theorists. What Target (the store chain) does to track people is disturbing (I wonder what my Guest ID is in their monster database), but all the more interesting to me because whatever they think they are doing fails with me - I never think of Target as a place to shop. Oh, I do shop there, but I see them as more expensive than their competitors. Anyway, the bar dropped significantly in the last section on societies. I thought he was reaching a bit with his stories.A few good references to studies and a LOT of anecdotes. If you don't have time to read the whole book, go for the first couple of chapters and the appendix (a method for changing personal habits) - the rest is fluff; not bad, but still fluff. (Note: each chapter covers at least two story lines, and Duhigg breaks them up as one would a television drama that uses flashback. I thought the connections for a few of them were a little tenuous, but the flow might take some a bit aback.)"
135,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50647721-soheil,5,"A fantastic book. Some may argue that it uses too many stories to drive its point home, but I'd say I remember everything in the book BECAUSE of the stories.The book establishes the part of the brain that stores the habits and explains how the habits are recorded in our brains and as a result control certain behaviors. It goes on to establish that a habit is consisted of three distinct parts: A queue (something that triggers the habit), a routine (which is the action that is resulted from the queue and leads to the next part) and a reward (the feeling of satisfaction you get when your routine leads to a certain result). The book states that habits can be changed but never erased. The only way to change a habit is by identifying it's queue and reward and trying to change them while the routine remains the same. Some examples are given in this regard.In its latter part, the book explores the concept of social habit which is interesting but less practical than the earlier parts of the book.The Power of Habit belongs to my favorites list only because it added a new insight to my life. One which I can identify with and is completely in keeping with many other books I've read on other subjects. A recommended read indeed."
136,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1964234-paul-m,3,"This book fits nicely alongside Malcolm Gladwell's books- it's kind of all over the place, has lots of anecdotes, but still provides a nice dose of interesting information from the social to biological spheres. Here, it's the role of habit, very broadly defined. As Duhigg uses it, habits range from the neurological processes behind individual habits to the cultures of corporations, the Civil Rights movement, and all the way back to sleepwalkers. This broad definition (which is not really directly defined in the book) seems to include just about any ingrained (or even instinctual) behavior, yet allows, I think, for a more entertaining read, even though I sometimes found the analogy between larger culture and individual neurobiology to be a bit strained. Overall, though, I think it (along with ""Willpower,"" which I am now reading as well) has given me some ideas for changing and instituting better habits in my own life, and I may even try to employ some ideas in my classrooms.In short, if you're looking for hard science, this probably isn't for you, but I think this fits in well with the tradition of good popular science."

Just enough science to give the author's premise some credibility and plenty of anecdotes to illustrate his points.Yes, the author has a bias and it becomes more pronounced toward the end of the book but he plays a subtle hand while showing that our habits can change. Moreover, habits are instilled throughout companies and societies so that even large groups can change for the better, if the habits of those groups change.The is an appendix at the back of the books with suggestions about how to implement the ideas in the book but I haven't read it...yet.Many reader/reviewers have pooh-poohed this book because it is heavy on story and anecdotes. To me, that is what make this book so powerful and interesting and entertaining. It teaches without being didactic and it doesn't overwhelm the lay reader with massive scientific review.To me, it was a well written book that clearly stated the author's ideas and inspired me to think more deeply about my own habits and how I can change the ones that so obviously need changing.Get it. Read it. Enjoy it."
138,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3230750-molly,5,"Fantastic exploration of the neuroscience of habits - why our brains develop them and how to break those that are maladaptive. It is neither a how-to book, although anyone who reads it will automatically inventory their own habits - physical, emotional, intellectual - which make up the VAST majority of behavior, nor is it a dense neuroscience-brain book. It’s an engaging read with lots of well-summarized research and case studies about what is going on in the brain when we opt for sitting on the couch rather than going for a run. Turns out, we have a lot in common with rats. Charles Duhigg, New York Times reporter, covers personal habits, the habits of societies and social movements (eg: why did Rosa Parks lead to the Montgomery Bus Boycott - believe it or not, social habits are involved) and the neuroscience of free will. Best news: habits can be broken, but you need to identify the cue and the reward to change the routine. Willpower is a muscle that needs to be exercised. Duhigg quotes William James: ""All our life ... is but a mass of habits ... for weal or woe ... bearing us irresistibly toward our destiny.""  "

But I was wrong. I wish I hadn't thought about this book at that time. I wish I had got to read this book in my teenage, though it was released 5 years back. This book, If followed with devotion would change your life forever. It will give you control of your life and You will control the change. The most neglected and underestimated power would be the power of habit. As said in the book, A habit is a choice that we deliberately make at some point of time and then we stop thinking about, but continue doing, often every day. Even just knowing this simple definition will change your perspective towards your habit. The simple formula of habit, Cue->Routine->Reward, has been explained beautifully with various examples and how some of those examples have changed the way we look habits. A must read for EVERYONE. Keep aside whatever you are reading and start reading this. You can thank me later. This book enters my list of re-reads as it will and probably already has changed something in me."

So this was a pretty random selection, dictated more by circumstances than choice, but it turned out to a pretty rewarding reading experience. And while it does offer a self help guide and the general theme is about improving your life through improving your habits, it also talks extensively about fascinating real life examples (individuals and major companies) who have done just that, which was very interesting. Naturally there is plenty of psychology as well...the most fascinating part of the book to me. Duhigg writes in an easily accessible, enjoyable manner without being pedantic. He even uses himself as an example at some point. Everyone has habits, life shaping, decision informing, potentially crippling habits. This book provides an excellent perspective that can help identify and possibly change those. At the very least it's a great food for thought. At best it might improve someone's life. Either way worth a read. Recommended."

Author provides a very convincing explanation on why something stays as habit while other interesting things that you might like won't. How the very same principles that work at an individual level gets applied to an organization or to the societies as a large group. This has been one of the most insightful book that I've read and would rate it even above textbooks in terms of knowledge content it delivers. The author keeps you always interested through the book and once you start a section, its very had to let go of the book without finishing. The comprehensive nature of the book makes it one of the unique ones and the exhaustive references provided helps validate the authors claims and inferences. I'd definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants to either understand the psychology behind how habits work or if you are a leader wanting to bring about a change in your organization by inculcating organizational habits to bring about positive change."

Well-written, well-researched, interesting, engaging and informative, I thoroughly enjoyed reading the Power of Habit. This book had been on my radar for a while. I'm not sure where I first heard of it, but then I saw it popping up all over the place. However, it wasn't until an online newsletter recommended this book, that I finally ordered it. I'm so glad I did! This book explains (as the title suggests), the power of habits. Based in neuroscience, the book details, in easy to understand terms, the way habits are formed and the habit loop. Duhigg gives various examples of the habits of individuals, organisations and society, with anecdotes that I found fascinating. Furthermore, by understanding the basis of habits in our lives, he gives us the keys to substituting our bad habits with good ones - he empowers us to change. All we need to do, is the work of identifying our habits and intentionally modifying them in our lives. We cannot escape habits, but must learn to use and shape them to our advantage. "

The power of habit gives an insightful analysis of how habits are formed and how they can be replaced. It gives a three-step formula: Routine, Cue, and Reward.What I really liked about it that it incarnates into your mind that bad habits not only destroys oneself but affects society and relationships as well.What someone learns from this book is how self-destructive things can be avoidedWhat I disliked about it is there are too many detailed examples of individuals and organizations who succeeded or failed to prosper because of their inability to form habits.Sometimes it looked like it's a promotional book for Starbucks.In the start, Charles Duhigg tells us that you cannot extinguish a habit, you can only change it  then he gave examples of how people destructed themselves because they did not eliminate their bad habits. Apart from these, the power of habit is a single successful piece of literature which can help one change their habits and be more productive."

It wasn't saying that your life is a disaster, or you're a big loser , and compare yourself with those rich and happy people, you must follow our tips to be a successful person. All what this book does, was explaining how things work, specifically the habits, and how to make changes whether in real life or the career based on studies and experiments. It provides frameworks and keys to creat our own ways to better habits and better life quality. I've tried to keep on track and count how many stories the books has, but I couldn't. I loved the stories especially that the book tells how they failed at first and then how they twisted to be successful by understanding how their habits function. The appendix was great! The author summarized all chapters and the framework in it. It helps the reader to remember what is needed.

Duhigg talks about how scholars are puzzled by the success of Alcoholics Anonymous despite the fact that it doesn't seem to be grounded in any sort of physiological science. Duhigg posits that AA is successful because it inspires habits of belief: people meet each week to hear stories from people who have kicked their bad habits, and they confirm their belief in a higher power. These habits of belief inspire long-term change."

170,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13308178-matthew-trinetti,4,"My Biggest Takeaways (with quotes from The Power of Habit)1. It’s easy to confuse decision-making with ingrained habits.Showering in the morning, brushing our teeth, making breakfast, backing a car out of the driveway, taking a train or bus to work, opening up our email inbox as we sit down at our desk — these are all habits disguised as decisions. At one point we made a decision to do these things and decided how we will do them, but they’ve since developed into deeply ingrained habits. We’ve done them so many times that our brains go on autopilot as our body moves through the motions. It’s eye-opening to understand that most of our day-to-day “decisions” are just automatic routines.""When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making. It stops working so hard, or diverts focus to other tasks. So unless you deliberately fight a habit -- unless you find new routines -- the pattern will unfold automatically.""2. Habits are are like screen-savers for our brains — they save us mental energy and help us function productively.While traveling around Europe in 2012, I was perpetually figuring out where I’d sleep the next night, how to navigate the streets in a new city, or learning new words in the local language. This was incredibly exhausting, much more so than I anticipated. It’s easy to take for granted how much mental energy our day-to-day actions could take up, if not for the habits we develop. Habits allow our brains to take a break while our body moves through motions.3. Yet routines are a double-edged sword — they can also work against us and pose a serious risk to our personal growth.""As each rat learned how to navigate the maze, its mental activity decreased. As the route became more and more automatic, each rat started thinking less and less.""Thinking less may save us mental energy, but it may also cause our demise. I can’t help but drawing parallels to the rat race we may find ourselves in our lives and careers.Many people continue down a career path even when they know in their heart of hearts they should leave and do something different. And with each subsequent week, month, or year, it becomes harder to leave. Their mental patterns, habits, and routines are ingrained so deeply that they’re less able to imagine a world where they’re NOT working in that particular job. While this may be great news for an employer, it can be a detriment to one’s personal development. This is the downside of routine, and it stresses the importance of shaking up one’s routine and challenging one’s habits.4. Travel shakes up our routine and makes us feel more alive.""We might not remember the experiences that create our habits, but once they are lodged within our brains they influence how we act -- often without our realization.""The temporary suspension of habits and routines is one reason why traveling into worlds unknown is such an enriching and enlivening experience. Our routines and habits are suddenly rendered useless when we land in a new country or drive into a new city. The sights and sounds down an unfamiliar street — new faces, strange languages, funny food and drink — cause our brain to become more attentive. Our senses are heightened and dance around this whole new set of stimuli. It’s exciting.It’s why some people come back from an extended vacation or a long journey or a pilgrimage with a new perspective on life. They’re once again able to imagine a world removed from their routine.5. When intentionally harnessed for good, routines can accelerate our personal growth.Duhigg uses the example of Michael Phelps to describe the positive power of habits.At the beginning of his training as a swimmer, Phelps’ developed a nightly routine of visualizing the perfect race before falling asleep. He also developed raceday routines for a race at 10am, for example: wake up at 6:30am, eat a large breakfast at 7:00am, begin a stretching regime at 8:00am, warm-up laps at 8:30am, get dressed at 9:15am, listen to warmup music at 9:35am.Habits can turn a talented swimmer into a 22 medal-winning Olympian.6. At the heart of every habit is a deep craving.""Cravings are what drive habits. And figuring out how to spark a craving makes creating a new habit easier.""As someone trying to develop into a better writer and create a sustainable business, I appreciate how a deliberately created routine can be my best friend.Over the past few months, however, I’ve tried to develop a habit of writing daily — a habit at which I’m failing miserably. But after reading The Power of Habit, I realized that I haven’t created a craving strong enough to drive the creation of my new habit. I’ve half-heartedly stated I wanted to write everyday, but I haven’t felt it with all my being. I simply haven’t craved it hard enough; it needs to become a deep, burning desire. I have to get hungrier. And I have to create cues and rewards to perpetuate that craving.7. Cues and Rewards are the key to understanding and modifying habits.""But countless studies have shown that a cue and a reward, on their own, aren't enough for a new habit to last. Only when your brain starts expecting the reward--craving the endorphins or sense of accomplishment--will it become automatic to lace up your jogging shoes each morning. The cue, in addition to triggering a routine, must also trigger a craving for the reward to come.""Duhigg summarizes that a habit is made up of (1) a cue, (2) a routine, and (3) a reward.So the key to understanding a habit is to understand what cue triggers the routine, and what reward occurs when the routine is completed. For example, let’s just say I bite my nails. Biting my nails is the routine. What cues this routine? Let’s just say I find myself biting my nails when I’m anxious, feeling pressure, or stressed. What’s the reward after this routine? Perhaps the reward is a feeling of control and sense of resolution. Once I bite every bit of my nails off, I’ve completed something — something has been resolved. It’s not the right something that needs to be resolved, but it makes me feel better. It’s the reward.So the key to changing this habit is to become cognizant of those cues, and instead of biting my nails, substitute another routine, like eating an apple. The reward of finishing the apple could mimic the reward of biting my nails. This all sounds so simple, but it’s certainly not easy.8. There’s a habit that perhaps holds the greatest weight of all: Willpower.""Willpower isn't just a skill. It's a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there's less power left over for other things.""I’ve really come to appreciate how self-discipline and willpower can positively influence all areas of one’s life. But like a muscle, it takes constant practice and work, and if not practiced enough, can become weak. It can also be exhausting to constantly be practicing willpower. Eventually, something always beats us and our willpower is compromised (For more on this, Duke Behavioral Psychologist Dan Ariely talks about something called “Ego Depletion”).Duhigg brought it home for me when he described that willpower can be a habit as well — an overarching habit that he calls a keystone habit. And when willpower becomes a habit, we don’t have to exert as much mental energy to harness it. And the beautiful thing about keystone habits like willpower is that they influence all subsequent habits. So once willpower and self-discipline is mastered, other habits are much more maleable.""Sometimes it looks like people with great self-control aren't working hard -- but that's because they've made it automatic...Their willpower occurs without them having to think about it.""9. Community creates belief and encourages habits to develop or change.""There's something really powerful about groups and shared experiences. People might be skeptial about their ability to change if they're by themselves, but a group will convince them to suspend disbelief. A community creates belief.""Although I’ve mostly touched on individual habits, two-thirds of the book discusses the habits of organizations and societies. This is something I touched on in Thoughts on Coming Home (Part 2): Reverse Culture Shock, but I’ve come to appreciate how much our environment and the people we surround ourselves with influences us, for better or for worse.In my aforementioned desired habit of writing daily, I’ve tossed around with friends the idea of forming a ‘writing group’ with people who also want to develop the habit of writing daily. A habit is a lot easier to develop if you’re developing it alongside others.10. ”Every habit, no matter its complexity, is maleable.”""However, to modify a habit, you must decide to change it. You must consiously accept the hard work of identifying the cues and rewards that drive the habits' routines, and find alternatives. You must know you have control and be self-conscious enough to use it -- and every chapter in this book is devoted to illustrating a different aspect of why that control is real.""If you’re more of an audio/visual person, here’s a 37-minute interview on Jonathan Fields’s The Good Life Project with Charles Duhigg on The Power of Habit."

Various case studies and references used by author help you absorb the know how of the habits and how one can control and then change them.I wish I could have read it earlier when I was fighting my habit of alcoholism. The fight would have been much easy. But I didn't know about all these techniques mentioned in the book back then and I did it the old school and hard way by pure will power without use of any of these possible techniques. It was a very difficult time for me fighting this habit, my mind and body both were fighting against my will. I had withdrawal symptoms like hand shaking, depression, overeating, Insomnia, rage etc. But I did not quit and managed to change a keystone habit in a month. This process has changed my life and has made me a different person with strong will power and believe that I can achieve anything now.The way we habitually think of surroundings and ourselves create the worlds that each of us inhabit. There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them says morning boys, how's the water?. And those young fish swimming on for a bit and then eventually one of them looks over at other and goes 'what the hell is water?'.The water is habits, the unthinking choices and invisible decisions that surround us every day and which just by looking at them, become visible again.Any habit can be changed with strong will power and with this book and techniques mentioned in it, you can do it a lot easier and quickly.5 out of 5 rating, a must read for all."
172,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43567297-salvatore-daddario,5,"I read this book because I am working on a book with my sociology professor about life turning points and the situations that predict them. Charles Duhigg's book circles around the same ideas, but ultimately sidesteps talking about the idea of situations that produce life-changing events at a high frequency.This book is a very intriguing summary of the literature on the habits that we such large parts of our lives. This book is about why habits exist and how habits function. The idea is that there is a cue, routine and then reward for each habit loop that is on for large chunks of our day. Driving to work, eating something sweet, exercising (or not exercising) - all of these are things that we do without much thought. This book made me think about them, and think about how I want habits to be a part of my life.The writing is clear and concise and the storytelling is gripping. There are stories of corporations like Starbucks and Target, devastating fires in the London Underground, dysfunctional hospitals, football teams that lose a lot and then win a lot, an inspiring woman that kicks off the Civil Rights Movement, huge churches, and so much more. Duhigg is an impactful writer and I would love to read more of his work."
173,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2746510-melanie-cannon,5,"The Power of Habit is not a book that you read once, absorb, and newly armed with research and anecdotal evidences begin to wave around like a wand at your ingrained habits in an effortless gesture to evolve. Rather, it is more like reading a thesis that takes in all the progress research has made over the past half-century at unlocking the secrets of how the brain processes habits and distills into approachable language. The first 9-chapters each try to unlock one element of habit or even peer-pressure, but only hint at change. If you are reading this book in an effort to give yourself a leg up on a quest to quit smoking, begin exercising, or loose weight -- these first 9-chapters will each feel more like a neuroscience or psychology lecture than a how to class. That is not to say they aren't captivating. They absolutely are. You will become so absorbed in the revelations about how your basal ganglia is taking over your routine tasks, in how predictive analysis of the data you are handing over when you shop is mined, and how the elements of the habit loop function -- that you will almost forget that you picked up this title with a desire to change. But have no fear, when you come to the end of the book, both the Afterword and Appendix will give you some help in trying to change using the new vocabulary you've acquired by reading the first 9-chapters. This book is worth the investment of time, attention and money. I'm excited to begin my journey of habit change and habit formation."
174,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91999564-adithyan-raj,5,"The idea behind this book is that habits can be replaced but not eliminated. So to replace a bad habit like smoking or alcohol consumption you should find what motivates you to behave in a certain manner. Then we should try to replace it with a habit that is less dangerous to us which gives us the same reward. Suppose a person drinks or smokes to socialize then he/she can join a club (it can be any sort of social gathering where he/she can satisfy his/her need to socialize, it can even be a gym if that's your thing) then you can get the same reward through this activity. Also this book splits habits into cue-routine-reward and also belief system. What this means is 'cue' is our signal to do a certain habit, 'routine' is the habit itself and 'reward' is the feeling or satisfaction we get from doing the action. So we can only change the routine that's what this book is mostly about. It touches on organisational habits which is quite interesting and tells us a lot about mass psychology. Also even when we replace a habit with another we wouldn't be about to maintain it unless we change our belief about the habit we are tackling. What this means is if in some part of your mind there is a thought that the habit you replaced is not that bad or something it will come back so unless you change your opinion about a habit you wouldn't be able to replace it permanently. "
175,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7068779-russ,5,"Read this book. I guess I should say, read this book unless you have a background in psychology or neuroscience because if you do, you probably already know what it has to teach. I have a BFA, so I didn't have any issue with Charles Duhigg's take on a relatively simple concept that runs as an undercurrent in every aspect of our lives. The Power of Habit is not a research text, nor is it ready for scientific review. It's written by a reporter, who covers the topic and its subjects like a reporter would. While this might be a deterrent for readers with more expertise in the subject than myself (or than Duhigg), I find it to be one of the book's strengths. Duhigg illustrates the science of habits with examples and studies, from individuals to corporations, to societal movements. Aside from learning about productivity and what makes habits work in our brains, I learned about all sorts of things that just weren't on my radar before. I now know the history of Febreeze (it originally didn't have a scent!), I have a profound respect for Alcoa's safety standards, and I learned about the tragic King's Cross fire of 1987. More than all these new tidbits that I've been unable to shut up about to my friends, I find myself employing the strategies Duhigg covers for habit creation and redirection in my own life. The book teaches you how to look very plainly at yourself to determine what cues your bad habits, and what rewards you're getting out of them. I've joked that I read a book about habits and now my depression is cured (really I'm just medicated), but if you struggle with executive dysfunction, this book might help you overcome the insurmountable tasks of day to day life. Finally, I have to thank Charles Duhigg once more because this book helped me form the new habit of reading physical books before bed. Cue: After I brush my teeth, no more screens. Routine: Read a chapter of the book I'm reading. Reward: Better sleep! A sense of relaxation! Book!"
176,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10011687-naveed,5,"One of the most valuable book I should be keep referring to myself!""We can choose our habits, once we know how""Charles Duhigg tells us precisely what habit really are, how they are created, and how they can they be transformed. The Cue, Routine, and Reward Loop together with Cravings successfully realize a habit loop. In order to cultivate a habit, we have to create a Cue and Reward. The effect of this would be Routine and Cravings. On the other hand, to aim at transforming a habit, we have to scrupulously look for its Cue and Reward and afterwards replace the Routine with something else.The habit loop looks like this.->CUE -> Routine -> Reward->Create cravings, and have a belief to sustain the habit loop.Various key concepts related to habits which Charles Duhigg introduced in this book are:- Willpower muscle training through self-discipline. Regulate the impulses and distract from temptations - Will habit loop: By choosing a well-thought behavior in advance and follow that routine when an inflection point arrives. For example, having a plan when cookie(temptation) arrives. Or having a plan to handle an anticipated painful situation- Familiarity: The authors explains how the Target sells mom various products or how some songs become hits, or how organ meat was made popular. ""By dressing something new in old clothes, and making the unfamiliar seem familiar...If you dress a new something in old habits, it’s easier for the public to accept it."" TO make something unfamiliar a part of habits, initially it needs to be slightly camouflaged inside a familiar garb, then the trick is just slip in the new component along with old without making it much noticeable. Make the novel seem familiar.- Near miss: Problem gamblers neural activity shows they feel a sense of reward even when they get near misses although they lost the bet- the basal ganglia and the brain stem are the regions where habits reside. If a bad habit happens to form there, you act without a choice. That's how gamblers keep playing even when they don't want toThe author suggests a framework for reshaping habits.-> Identify the routine: What I do exactly. Identify the cure, routine and reward-> Experiment with rewards: Why I do that. Which craving is driving your routine. jot down your feeling after every experiment to identify which one is your real craving-> Isolate the cue: Identify the triggering point by scrutinizing the follow list of 5 things:Location: Where were youTime : What time was itEmotional state: How were you feeling beforeOther people: Who was aroundImmediately preceding action: What was your preceding action->Have a plan: Write down your intended routine and build your new habitCharles refers James quote “do a thing with difficulty the first time, but soon do it more and moreeasily, and finally, with sufficient practice, do it semi-mechanically, or with hardly any consciousness at all.” Once we choose who we want to be, peoplegrow “to the way in which they have been exercised, just as a sheet of paper or a coat, once creased or folded, tends to fall forever afterward into the same identical folds.”William James in his book The Principles of Psychology gave habits an analogy to water as it “hollows out for itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after having ceased to flow, it resumes, when it flows again, the path traced by itself before.”. So our task is to define the direction of that flow by our conscious choice.Footnotes:An idea which came into my mind after reading this book is that I should have an app for logging daily activity at the end of a day. Before I go to sleep, it would take hardly a minute to record what I accomplished today. For example, I like to develop a habit of daily exercise for one hour. After going through the cue and award strategy, I should be able to see my progress through a daily journal. This would give me a sense of completing something, a sense of accomplishment. So, I browsed through the Google app store and came across a very useful app Habit Bull. I am giving it a try how it goes, but I guess it would be very useful app in creating and maintaining good habits while getting rid of bad ones."
177,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14226205-menna-tarek,4,"4.5As a fiction reader. I read very few non-fiction and usually, I take a long time to finish them. However, I found this book to be very entertaining and informative. It was written in the story-telling mode and the style was very interesting, which I think contributed to how much I loved it.The basic idea, and feeling of this book -as obvious from its name- is how habits work. How they develop and how they affect our lives and actions without even noticing. It demonstrates many stories on how habits influence individuals, organizations, and societies. It is not a long book, however, I find that the main idea is displayed in the first few chapters and afterward it was only application of this concept on many stories. But that did not bother me as it enforced the idea and displayed it from many directions with the addition of few concepts on the way. Also, I liked the stories. One thing that bothered me is that I found the practical tips for practical application to be shallow or theoretical. Although the author mentioned this specifically in the appendix, I still found myself unsure of how to do it. But I guess that's the problem with all self-help books, the ideas are only useful if you integrate them into your life, the self part is very important. And we just tend to ignore it.  Now that's a habit that needs changing xD .I liked the stories about how organizations use statistical analysis of individuals' habits and use them for marketing and sales. They show you what you need.so basically the habit loop consists of:-Cue -Routine -RewardIn order to change the habit, you need to use the same cue, the same reward but change the routine.And to do that you need to identify those components first.Also, craving plays a very important role in habits.Keystone habits would help in improving many aspects of your life (I didn't like the lack of demonstration of this concept though).It was a very enjoyable and useful read, highly recommend it."

In small words, it’s an amazing read for small vacation. It correctly explain the cue-reward cycle of habit formation.Want to form or alter a habit? Just identify a routine (the path you will have which will drive you towards achieving the reward, then identify a cue (none other than the problem that you want to remove by following a routine) and then a reward (that you achieve after solving the cue).The books gives an insight in the importance of process of habit formation in various industries such as marketing, rehabilitation, advertisements etc.The author gives an amazing array of examples of a variety of people to the great big MNCs like Target. It tells us how the humongous companies make their customers come and visit regularly in their stores."
179,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/982809-jmjester,5,"I tilt my head to the side when I’m listening hard. My dad and his mother did too. Is this genetics or something we picked up along the generations as if that might help us to hear better and/or to signal to our listeners that they’ve got our full attention? I always wondered if was the result of nature or nurture. Now I wonder if it isn’t merely a habit.I recently read The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg, a columnist for The New York Times. I first read an excerpt of this online that described the tracking procedures that Target employs on its customers. They’re so accurate that Target can predict which of its shoppers are in the second trimester of their pregnancies, some times before they’ve divulged this information to family members. I found the content of the excerpt fascinating, and Duhigg’s writng style engaging. What sold me on buying the book was a small section about how he broke himself of eating a chocolate chip cookie every afternoon. At first glance you might wonder how the two are related, but both center on our habits whether as shoppers, employees, or as dieters.Duhigg draws on many different fields from the habits of medical institutions before performing surgery to preventing riots from starting in the Middle East, from how the social habits of Rosa Parks prior to the night she was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white man led to the tipping point in the Civil Rights movement to the compulsive behavior of gamblers and whether or not they should be held liable for the debts they mount. A nimble writer like Malcolm Gladwell before him, Duhigg introduces a topic only to veer away from it for a bit to introduce another that as the examples above show seem little to do with one another. Duhigg then circles back to show the relationship, the second strengthening the argument of the first.While I learned a great deal about neurosurgery, experimental design, how several companies enacted large scale change by seeming innocuous tweaks, etc., what seemed most important to me was the information abut how habits are formed and how they can be changed. The other information demonstrated what good (or harm) resulted from these habits. As someone who hopes to shape academic and altruistic behavior, I wanted to know how to go about doing that. By the way, I trust the information in the book even though Duhigg is neither neurologist nor historian because his research was so thorough. He included sixty pages of notes for about three hundred pages of text.The first section of the book explains how cues (feeling the impulse to do something) might be as simple as “It’s seven o’clock. It must be time for breakfast.” It doesn’t necessarily mean that you are hungry. If this is a habit, your response will be the same, to eat anyway. Once you’ve completed this response, then you will get some type of reward – a full stomach, a check on your to-do list, a pat on the back if you are a small child. This is how all habits are learned. If the habit is an unhealthy one like smoking, you can try responding to the cues in a different way, say chewing a piece of gum or taking a walk. Then you’ll have to create a reward for avoiding the unhealthy behavior – a checkmark each time you held off smoking, buying yourself a small treat at the end of the week, etc. If you can actually change the response into the reward, all the better. For example, exercise produces endorphins, which make you feel great without any check marks to track.Duhigg thought this information vital too. He included an appendix where he distills them from their original ninety pages to just fifteen. He uses his chocolate chip routine and its attendant eight-pound weight gain to explain how the cycle works and how to disrupt it, which he did and gives us the skinny to do exactly the same. (Pun fully intended.)He tells us“Individuals and habits are all different, and so the specifics of diagnosing and changing the patterns in our lives differs from person to person and behavior to behavior…As a result this book doesn’t contain one prescription. Rather… a framework for understanding how habits work and a guide to experimenting with how they might change.” (275-6)He advises isolating the cue. Pay attention for several days to see what proceeds your impulse to turn on Facebook while doing your homework, etc. Then try responding in different ways. For example, get a drink, set a timer to go off fifteen minutes from then, etc. Record how the different responses work out. What is the reward? Did you complete the HW in that additional fifteen minutes so you feel accomplishment as well as guilt-free while you’re surfing? Were you merely bored and a drink of water gave a very brief constrained break? If you choose the right response, the reward might be readily apparent. Or you might have to set up a reward system until your response becomes habit. Of course, none of this can be happenstance. You must have a plan and record how these all play out if you’re truly dedicated to making the change.Duhigg closes his book be citing William James, a psychologist. “All our life so far, as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits – practical, emotional, and intellectual – systematically organized for our weal or woe, and bearing us irrestibly toward our destiny, whatever the latter may be.” (271) Duhigg reminds us that now that we know how to redirect our habits that destiny can be reconfigured.I can’t wait to try what he suggests. Perhaps I’ll even stop tilting my head."
