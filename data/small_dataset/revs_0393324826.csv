I figured at the time he had watched a couple of episodes too many of Quincy M.E. and that he would find a normal job eventually. It is probably 15 years since I stopped being an archivist ‚Äì my friend still cuts up dead people for a living. A few weeks after he started work I asked him how it was all going and he replied, ‚ÄúGood, yeah, I can even eat spaghetti now.‚Äù Sometimes it is best not to ask.This book is a bit of a career guide for those of us who are post-life. There are a remarkable number of interesting things one can get up to after life. Many of these choices are presented in this book in an up-close-and-personal way that I particularly enjoyed. I‚Äôm a fairly robust character, but there were many moments when I made involuntary noises during this book. The swallowed fly was a case in point and by far the worst. The noise I made was loud enough and distressing enough for my daughters to ask what was the matter ‚Äì they didn‚Äôt ask again.Part of my friend‚Äôs job involves removing people‚Äôs brains ‚Äì this is also described in some detail here. The problem is that once the brain has been removed you can‚Äôt really pop it back from whence it came ‚Äì so instead it is placed in the chest cavity. This means the head needs to be ‚Äòpacked‚Äô and generally this is done with newspaper. One of the decisions made by those putting you back together again is which newspaper would seem most appropriate for you. (I assume in these days of obsessive Orwellian Double-Speak the corpses are called clients or customers or something equally ridiculous ‚Äì although I wish it was after Waugh and they were called Loved Ones.) I really don‚Äôt mind what happens to me once I‚Äôm dead ‚Äì I figure I‚Äôm going to be busy enough explaining to God why He doesn‚Äôt exist to be worried about what happens to my body ‚Äì but I must admit that spending eternity with my head stuffed with a Murdoch rag does seem to be a punishment disproportionate to any crime I have committed whilst alive."

Many people will find this book disrespectful. There is nothing amusing about being dead, they will say. Ah, but there is.
Mary Roach brings cadavers into a whole new, sometimes painfully bright, light. We follow her as she attends autopsies and medical discussions. We learn what happens to bodies as they decompose on the field, under the field and in so, so many places.
The way I see it, being dead is not terribly far off from being on a cruise ship. Most of your time is spent lying on your back.
 We get a bit of a history lesson with the sordid tales associated with body-snatching and the early medicine's need for atomically correct models. We even go so far back as ancient Egypt and their secret honey recipe (you will never look at honey in the same way) (trust me).This is one book you'd have to be
 dying
 to miss out on.
Death. It doesn't have to be boring.

2,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent,3,"Mary Roach writes about what happens when you donate your body to science. Hilarity ensues. Well, maybe not hilarity but it is a good dose of edutainment.Way back around the time the earth's crust cooled and life spread across the planet, late 1994 or early 1995, I should think, I visited a chiropractic college with the rest of my Advanced Biology class. This trip was memorable to me for three reasons:1) It was the first time I experienced an excruciating caffeine withdrawal headache2) It was the first time I saw a human cadaver3) I smoked five of my classmates playing pool in the student lounge at lunch.Obviously, #2 is the one pertinent to this review, although I am still quite proud of #3. The cadaver I saw had its face covered and its skin looked shriveled, somewhat like beef jerky. My 17 year old mind briefly wondered where the man had come from before my hormone-fueled brain returned my attention to the nubile young ladies in the room. Anyway, let's get down to review business.Mary Roach manages to take a subject that give many people the heebie-jeebies, donating one's remains to science, and makes it humorous at times. She covers such topics as learning surgical techniques via practicing on cadavers, human decomposition, ingesting human remains for medicinal purpose, using corpses in car crash tests, using cadavers for ballistics tests, crucifixion experiments, and even head transplants.While it's not ideal meal-time reading, I didn't find it as stomach churning as some reviewers did. The talk of decomposition and quack remedies of the Middle ages were fascinating and I was really interested in the head and brain transplant experiments. Frankenstein's monster doesn't seem as unrealistic as it did yesterday.Apparently, necrophilia is only illegal in 16 states. Imagine if that was one of your criteria when choosing a place to live. ""Honey, I'd love to live in Florida but then we couldn't have our sexy parties...""Actually, the funeral bits were also pretty enlightening. Did you know they have to suture the anus shut to keep nastiness from leaking out during a funeral? Or that dead people can fart from gas trapped in their intestines? Or that they insert special caps underneath the eyelids to keep them from suddenly opening? Fascinating stuff.Stiff is a very interesting read for those interested in what happens when you donate your body to science, softened somewhat by Roach's sense of humor. Three easy stars."
3,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin,4,"Omg and Grossness! I made the mistake of trying to eat a bit while reading this! Just no! And then a part where they talk about left over skin being used for wrinkle stuff and something to do with penises. I didn't even look up the word they used. Although, now, if a penis was ever whipped out somewhere, I would have to wonder if that penis had something to do with cadaver skin! I did have to skip over stuff due to my ewww reflex. But there is a lot of stuff I learned that I had no idea about. There is a lot of historical stuff too. And the cadaver drive test dummies! I can't even. So if you're one that is going to donate your organs, just know that no part of your body will go to waste. Well, most of it! Mel üñ§"
4,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/763514-tung,1,"In my nonfiction phase during the year, I grabbed this one and after finishing it, regretted its purchase. The book is about medical use of corpses and the human body, present-day and in the past. The subject matter is extremely interesting, and some of the methods, tests, and history behind human body experiments is worth the read. The book makes you want to be an organ donor, or want to donate your body to medical science. The problem is that the author is one of the WORST writers I have ever read to the extent that every time I picked up the book I got angry. I only finished the book because my OCD made me finish it because I‚Äôd already started it. The two irritating aspects of the book are: 1) Roach would spend a few pages describing something fascinating and then ruin it all by throwing in the snarkiest comment imaginable. For example, she‚Äôd discuss how feet are used by scientists, and then throw in a comment about her stinky socks. 2) A few years ago, a friend saw a movie about the roads to concentration camps at the Tribeca Film Festival that was atrocious because the director stuck himself into the film and made himself part of the story. That‚Äôs what this author does for the whole friggin‚Äô book. Just awful. "

It made me greatly disposed to finding out what else Roach has written, before I become a subject for studies like this one. And here are reviews of what we found:-----Grunt-----Gulp -----Packing for Mars-----Spook"
6,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,4,"First read of 2017 complete! It was a good one - 4.5 stars.Who knew that a book about what happens to our bodies after we die could be so interesting. This book covers everything to the horrific to the incredibly fascinating. This book may not be for the squeamish, but I think Roach did a great job combining information and humor in a respectful manner to make it more easily accessible to a wider audience.I recently helped to prepare a funeral plan for my Mother. She is still alive, but it was suggested that we prepare ahead of time to make sure that all wishes are met and there is no scrambling when the event happens to figure out what is wanted and where the money comes from - less stressful for all! After reading this book, I am not saying I will go back and change any of our decisions, but it definitely gave me a lot of thinking points I would not have considered and may have had an affect on how my decision making went if I had read this before the planning took place.After death - the inanimate body lives on and something has to be done with it - read this if you want to know more!Side note - This is my second Mary Roach (I also read Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal) and I liked this one a bit better."
7,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,3,"Mary Roach details a lot of uses for human cadavers in this book, but she missed a major one. As Weekend At Bernies taught us, you can always use the corpse of your boss to scam your way into a free weekend at a beach house. That scientific research is all well and good, but there‚Äôs nothing in here at all about the best ways to simulate a life like corpse for your own selfish purposes. I learned more from Andrew McCarthy than I did reading this!Ah, but seriously folks‚Ä¶ This is the second book I‚Äôve read by Roach, and I admire the way that she can take touchy and gross subjects like corpses in this one or human feces in Packing for Mars, treat them seriously but still manage to keep a sense of humor about them. While she always has one eye on the science, she never uses it to shield out the normal human responses, and this allows her to provide a clear eyed account of the uses and disposal of the dead. (One of my favorite parts involved Roach asking someone how heads were removed from cadavers for surgical practices and was told that one woman in the lab removed them all. She later met the woman who actually did the chopping and Roach admits that all she could think was, ‚ÄúYou cut off heads!!‚Äù)So we get treated to a gory set of stories about how science uses corpses in a variety of ways including the study of impacts for the auto industry, how a brain-dead woman‚Äôs organs are removed by a transplant team, and a field of bodies left to rot for forensic research. We also get an overview of how science has used or misused bodies to advance both legitimate research and outright quackery in the past. There‚Äôs also a long section reflecting on the best way to dispose of human remains since traditional burials and cremations are costly, environmentally harmful and wasteful.While I found this really interesting and enjoyed Roach‚Äôs writing and approach, there were times when this book completely disgusted me, and I‚Äôve got a pretty high tolerance for gore. One section about the history of various mad scientists grafting severed heads of dogs and monkeys onto other dogs and monkeys and actually managing to keep them alive for some time was almost too much, and I kind of wished she would have left that chapter out.Still, this was a really interesting book. I just wouldn‚Äôt try to eat a plate of lasagna while reading it. "

‚ÄúCadavers are our superheroes: They brave fire without flinching, withstand falls from tall buildings and head-on car crashes into walls. You can fire a gun at them or run a speedboat over their legs, and it will not faze them. Their heads can be removed with no deleterious effect. They can be in six places at once.‚Äù
If you know me, you already know that I have a different sort of relationship with the dead. You know, the kind where you dress them up . . . 

and play offensive hilarious games with them . . .

Obviously once I heard about Stiff it had to go right to the top of my TBR. In all honesty, I was expecting something just a smidge more entertaining than my high school biology book. You know, the kind of book only a morbid weirdo like myself could truly enjoy. To say I was pleasantly surprised is the understatement of the year.Most of us are already familiar with the potential a cadaver has to continue on after his expiration date . . . 

Stiff takes it to a whole new level, covering just about every potential ‚Äúcareer‚Äù one can have after death . . . 

^^^^ Yes, please.As well as tackling everything from burial to composting as a potential ‚Äúdisposal‚Äù method. Not to mention dealing with the more taboo subjects that relate to the dead . . . 

As a bonus, all of the above subject matter was written about with such charm and humor that I found myself LOLing for real at times. Mary Roach is the type of gal I‚Äôd like to have a drink with. Not only was she able to write about ‚Äústiffs‚Äù with a sense of humor, she also shamelessly owned up to her own oddities . . . 
‚ÄúI ask whether he thinks it‚Äôs bad that I like the smell, which I don‚Äôt really, or maybe just a little. He replies that it is neither bad nor good, just morbid.‚Äù


If reading a ‚Äúsmart people book‚Äù (a/k/a non-fiction) is something you‚Äôd like to do more of, Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers is one I‚Äôd highly recommend."
10,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39595324-jay-green,5,"I'm a compulsive buyer of Mary Roach's books. Part of the reason is research for my own books, of course, part of it is fascination, thanks to her astute choice of subjects, and part of it is simply enjoyment, derived from her clear prose and tales well told. In this case, I read Stiff just after my father passed away, so I was trying to make sense of his loss while trying to come to terms with the brute reality of death. It helped a great deal, as I anticipated it would, largely down to Roach's sympathetic and informative tone. It was like being taken through a morgue by a thoughtful friend."
11,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70522717-kayla-dawn,3,"3,5* - this was a pretty interesting and entertaining read. It felt a bit repetitive at times but it made up for that with being quite humorous. "
12,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/425220-lissa,3,"I bought this book when I first taught my class that has a foresnic anthropology component. I thought I could pick out a chapter of this book to assign to them, and it would be a nice, informative, lay-person account that would be entertaining, yet informational. However, due to time constraints, I never got around to reading the book. In that time, several people have borrowed and returned this book to me, so my copy is a bit tattered and dog-eared, as if I'd read it many times. I can safely say, having read it once, that I will not be going back to read it again.Stiff is a non-fiction, ""science"" writing book. Roach chronicles the different processes that happen to a human being after it dies. Each chapter tackles a different possible outcome for a person's corpse. She goes through chapters about anatomy labs, decay, crash-test and military trials (for safer vehicles, or more effective bullets), plane crashes, transplants, burial and cremation, and even cannibalism. The material for this book is endlessly fascinating and I feel like it has a lot of potential.That being said, I find Mary Roach's style of writing intensely irritating, which took away from the overall effectiveness of the narrative. Much of her writing is sort of falsely funny, as if she is very intentially trying to inject humor into a situation through the use of ridiculous asides that do nothing to add information or further her point.She also continually resorts to forced bathroom and genetalia jokes in order to articially infuse the book with humor. On many occasaions, she asks the scientists she interviews about what happens specifically to penile tissues. She then describes the patient if annoyed air that some of the scientists take with the assumption that the readers will all be tittering with her on her side. Well, I'm sorry, I'm with the scientists. I find that kind of thing immature and irrtating, like many of the jokes in this book. The last way that she commonly tries to inject humor into her writing is by pretending squeamishness for the sake of her readers. What kills me about this is that there are parts of the book that are legitimateuly funny, where the humor is not forced but just found in the situation. There is a description of her first visit to a very small town in China that strong reminded me of some of my problems getting around in small towns in various African countries. There is also a funny commentary about a woman who volunteers to get multiple pap smears so that future ObGyns can practice (a job that I hope pays very. very. well). Additionally, there is some really interesting information in this book. I knew a lot about the use of bodies to determine what happened in plane crashes and the sort of things that happen in gross anatomy labs. But did you know that males and females have slightly different EEG profiles? And, after a heart transplant, those do not change. Also, did you know that there have been many proven ways to make riding in aircrafts safer, including shoulder harness seat belts, more emergency exits, sprinkler systems and side airbags for impact, but none of these are being implemented because the airlines don't want to have to incur the extra costs? There are plenty of little factoids like these that are quite interesting.The bottom line for me was that there was simply not enough actual science in this science book. I've read plenty of popular science books that have managed to do a much better job walking the line between entertainment for the layperson and providing good information. As far as book that tell stories about cadavers, I would recommend any of the popular science books by William Bass or Douglas Ubelaker over this book as both fascinating and more informative."
13,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36873041-amanda-never-mandy,5,"A while back I told my husband I really wanted to read this book. I went on and on about how it received great reviews and at the time he seemed extremely interested. Let‚Äôs pause right here so I can explain his levels of interest and how to read them:NOT INTERESTED ‚Äì Changes subject at end of the convo and/or walks away.KIND OF INTERESTED ‚Äì Nods at end of the convo like he might have listened.INTERESTED ‚Äì Brief eye contact and a nod or two during the convo.EXTREMELY INTERESTED ‚Äì Total eye contact and verbally interacts throughout convo.I was obviously wrong about his level of interest because he ended up purchasing a different book by the same author. I guess maybe he was only kind of interested instead of extremely, which means I now have to reevaluate how I read his levels of interest. You would think after a gazillion years together I would have this shit figured out.
‚Ä¶ANYWAY‚Ä¶
I did read the other book he purchased first and I enjoyed it (see other review) which made me super excited to read this one. Reading up on facts is kind of my jam and topics about death have always caught my eye because I have a touch of the morbid curiosity. I figure it is a part of life so why not study up on it like you do with anything else you have to eventually experience. Knowledge is power and all that BS.The author did a fantastic job of presenting the cold rigid facts with her unique sense of humor. My only complaint is with my content expectations versus reality. I thought this book would be more about what happens to our bodies after we die, the process of handling and disposing of said body and what all that entails. This book seemed to focus more on what happens when you donate your body to science. I didn‚Äôt reduce the rating for this because as a boyfriend breaking up with you says, ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt you, it was me‚Äù."
14,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"I never guessed I would want to know about what happens to a dead body after it ... dies. But here I am, reading and now reviewing a book on just that. Was it funny? Sometimes. Was it gross? Sometimes! But was it deeply FASCINATING? Yeah, I guess it was. It really wasn't too deep on the science bits, actually, not spending too much time on the actual bugs in your gut partying down on the glut of the you-buffet, but it did have plenty of eyewitness accounts of morgues and the everyday lives of the folks there. Plus the military outfits that used bodies for ballistics research. And let's not forget about the second half of the book that goes into the really funky stuff.You know, like methods of disposal of your earthly remains from a historical standpoint. Oh, you wacky Resurrectionists. Or my personal favorite modern (and hopefully soon-to-be-legal for you, soon) composting farms!Look, seriously, folks, I think it's a wonderful idea. First I get freeze-dried, shattered into hamburger-sized chunks, then I GO ON TO FEED THE PLANTS FOR REAL.Like, for real, for real. Since ashes are pretty much worthless for that and getting buried is a joke when you think about it, getting turned into mulch so that you ACTUALLY return your nutrients back to nature is a BEAUTIFUL gesture.Where can I sign up? I mean, donating my body to science is great and all, but the poetry of getting mulched is TOO MUCH FOR ME. My daughter to my granddaughter: ""Your grandfather helped grow this grove of apple trees.""""I thought he was a writer of Science Fiction who rarely went out of the city?""""Oh, I mean it literally, sweetie. After we mulched him and spread him across the land, he literally helped grow these!""""But not with his own two hands.""""Oh, no, we used those, too.""""You don't understand me!""""I want to grow roses. Pink ones.""""Moooooooom!"""
15,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"There was not a single zombie in this whole book!!Mary Roach writes books about some interesting topics. This is the one that most interested me, though on finishing I realized that I also had ""Packing For Mars,"" which I think will likely get read sooner rather than later, now that I've finally got around to reading one of her books and have really enjoyed her style. She brings a bit of levity and a healthy sense of the absurd to topics that most of us can go a full lifetime avoiding even thinking about. I find myself having to be a bit of a messenger-killer though, because, while I get that she was being thorough in reporting on the history of anatomy and scientific discovery and experimentation regarding the body, all of the stuff about the animal experimentation just really bothered me. Like, a lot. I think that I'm already like 92.3% misanthropic, and all the ""Hey, let's take the head off of a monkey and graft it onto a different monkey and see what happens!"" stuff probably raised that to like 95.9%. If I had to guesstimate. I can understand if we're trying to understand and DO something. Experimentation is needed. Practicing some things, like grafting together veins and arteries to reattach limbs or do transplants, is vital, and since people are generally hesitant about being the guinea pigs... real guinea pigs are needed. I can understand that. But some of these experiments are just... frivolous god-playing, in my opinion. It doesn't serve a purpose in the long run, for people or animals, and is just done because it can be, because there's no compelling reason not to, and they were ""doing science"". Then there are some little quirky writing things that kind of annoyed me, like Roach's tendency to get off-track and ramble on about a side topic for a bit too long before getting back to the interesting topic she interrupted with her anecdote or sidebar story. And so, I drop a star for these things. But only one, because the rest of the book is great. There are some insights in this book that really made me stop and think. For instance, laws against necrophilia in Nevada were more complete and specific than rape laws in the US: ‚ÄúThe carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will.‚Äù Until January 1, 2013 that is, when rape was redefined as: ‚ÄúPenetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.‚Äù (Per FBI.gov.)Then there's the statistics of just how man lives can be saved by doing crash test experiments on actual human cadavers. Or how squeamish and prudish people can be about dead bodies. I am not a religious or spiritual person. To me, everything in this book related to putting cadavers to use made perfect sense. I've been an organ donor for as long as I've had the ability to check the box when renewing my drivers license. If I die, take anything useful and give it to anyone who needs it. I can't use them anymore, why should I keep them? Sentimentality? I've had discussions with people who say that they'd ""never!"" check that organ donor box on their license because EMTs and doctors ""won't try as hard"" to save organ donors. To which I call bullshit. They aren't going to check your ID for the indicator before deciding whether to give you CPR, and they probably aren't the ones who would determine whether your squishy insides are even viable options for donation. Plus, the purpose of that kind of transplant would be to save a life, right? And your life is right there, waiting to be saved, while a potential organ recipient is a spot on a list and probably not bleeding out in front of them. Check the organ donor box. They'd try to save you if you need it. I promise. If they don't, haunt the shit out of them. Anyway, as I was saying. In my mind, it makes no sense at all for a perfectly good body to just rot in a hole somewhere, or be incinerated. It can do something worthwhile. Maybe try out the newest seatbelt or airbag technology, or safety harness gear for people who work on insanely high platforms, like the guys who have to fix antennas on building or something. Or maybe they could be used for teaching the next crop of doctors how to actually perform the procedures they are supposed to do. If they botch it their first time out (or second or third or fourth), wouldn't you want that to be a practice run on a cadaver who isn't going to know or care, rather than on you? The section about the soul was lost on me, because, well, as I said, I'm not much of a spiritual type person. I don't really give that kind of thing much thought. That being said, I think it's pretty silly to claim traits have ""followed"" an organ from the donor to the recipient. The claim that a donor heart made the recipient into a sex fiend or made the recipient feel like a teenager and want to drive fast cars and listen to loud music is pretty outlandish. My theory is that the recipient has just been given a healthy heart (or whatever) and suddenly has a new lease on life, and wants to make the most of it. The simplest explanation is usually the right one. Another thing that I thought was kind of silly was Dr. Oz being quoted several times in this book. As an expert, not a TV celebrity quack. I'm sorry, I live in 2015. I just can't take this guy seriously. He's a joke who got rich on daytime TV by exploiting people and selling them bullshit and lies. If he was an actual legit doctor at some point, he's lost any credibility he might have had. I was actually really surprised to see his name in this book. It seemed so rational otherwise. But this, really?: ""[L]ife and death is not a binary system. [...] In between life and death is a state of near-death, or pseudo-life. And most people don't want what's in between."" Uhhhh, right, Dr. Oz. If you say so. You're the ""expert"".The section about ingesting human flesh or secretions for health benefits was pretty yucky, but otherwise I didn't think that this book was distasteful or gross at all. I really thought that the anatomy and decomposition research sections were fascinating, as well as the black box death investigator guy. I also learned quite a lot about the funereal business, which probably shouldn't have surprised me as much as it did... but I guess it's just not something that I've had cause to think about (and hopefully won't yet for a while). I actually appreciated the journalistic detachment mixed with first-hand experience that Roach brought to this. It definitely gave it a lot of credibility in my mind. I think she asked good questions, better questions, if maybe a bit different, than I would have asked. All in all, I think that this was interesting and informative, and it's made me want to explore my post-life options a little bit more. There's a lot of them available now, but there still seems to be a stigma about remains being dealt with in non-traditional ways... or maybe that's just because of where I am, with the prevailing Catholic notions in the area. I'd be perfectly happy being composted via an organic burial pod so I'd be tree-food. "
16,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"I've never been squeamish. From when I was a little girl I wanted to know how things work. And ""things"" were also living organisms. Not that I killed off animals to cut them up, mind you, but I started reading non-fiction books very early on and love books about anatomy as much as suspenseful novels about Jack the Ripper to this day. Therefore, the cover and title of this book instantly appealed to me and I'm pleased to report that the author had a very good way of blending facts with an amicable writing style that was simultaneously precise and slightly humorous (though never in an inappropriate way).Mary Roach takes us on a journey through the history of medicine. We learn about ""cures"" from all over the world (including but not limited to placentas and aborted fetuses for a better skin - and you wouldn't believe all the stuff Westerners did, it wasn't just the Chinese) as well as funeral practices through the ages (since it's been 16 years!!! since she mentioned the alternative to cremation, I will definitely check out if there are any news on that front). We thus learn how humans in general learned about anatomy, how that changed our understanding of life and death and how we are still sometimes influenced by romantic (and illogical) views today.This directly ties into human culture around the world and I liked the author all the more for pointing out that what seems strange to us doesn't have to be for others. I'm not sure I agree about the chapter regarding eating dogs vs eating cows but I get what she was trying to say and I was reminded of the German proverb ""In der Not frisst der Teufel sogar Fliegen"" (""In dire times, the devil even eats flies"") which made the excursion into cannibalism so interesting.Most interestingly, for me, was Tennessee. I knew about the university there and its project to help forensics by having the ""Body Farm"" where several human cadavers are kept in various places in different stages of decomposition and loved that she included it in this book as well. Some might say ""yuck"" or ""ew"" but nobody can deny how important forensics are so this is important work and we should be glad there are some people willing to do it!Equally, though not having known about it before, I was quite intrigued about the Swedish project for human compost. I know the Innuit have the mentality of giving their bodies back to nature (though they are often eaten by polar bears consequently so that's a little different at least), but to actively use dead humans as compost ... The thing is, you can still have a memorial service, but what happens to the body needs to be sustainable when looking at our growing numbers and it should benefit us humans and the planet if at all possible. And if a loved one wants a special place to remember the deceased, why not use a familiar and important spot? You don't show love and grief by spending more money than anybody else on a wooden casket that rots anyway, flowers that will wilt or by buying a grave or even crypt. Moreover, once again, this sort of thing just isn't sustainable (it also doesn't matter if you are an ecofriendly person or not, it's just a fact).Personally, I especially liked the chapter about organ donation or giving your body to science after your death because why not? I myself am an organ donor, but I'll definitely also look into donating my body to science if that is possible here. Anything's better than just uselessly rotting or being burnt to ash which benefits nobody but the funeral industry. And let's face it: you won't care once you're dead because you'll be gone.In fact, there is an ongoing debate in my family about this. I, personally, find most funerals disgusting because they are not about the dead but the living. People showing off clothes and who cries loudest and who bought the most opulent flower arrangement. Later, there is constant arguing over who takes care of the grave and who pays for what. And what for??? If your body can serve to make cars safer or doctors better at their work or your organs can save a life or even several - WHY AREN'T WE ALL DOING THAT?! Because of sensitivities and religion and other stupid notions just like them. Honestly, we should be better by now.The author is right: crash dummies will only get you so far, just like certain animal bodies (and how sick is it that we are impious when it comes to animals but not when we're talking about the animal homo sapiens?). Theoretical knowledge, too, will not sufficiently serve a doctor-in-training. I understand why someone would prefer their body to be used to cure cancer instead of helping plastic surgeons but so many scientific breakthroughs came from a corner we didn't expect and whether we're talking about removing gall stones or correcting the angle of a nose, it is surgery so why not help fellow humans? One other thing: I'm all for treating a body on the table with some respect but people tend to take even that way too far and I was negatively surprised how common that is even amongst doctors and scientists!You can see, it is a very interesting topic to me and so many others (like religion for example) have influenced pathology and continue to do so (for the moment at least) so I'm sure many will have vastly different views on this topic. Not that I care. I hope we will continue to develop new ways and to look into what is possible (hands up who enjoyed the chapter about those experiments with severed heads *grins*) so we can evolve further still and maybe shed stupid superstitions.And yes, I've been meaning to finally get to ""K√∂rperwelten"" (the exhibition of specially prepared REAL human and animal bodies) by Gunther von Hagen. I see nothing morbid or wrong with it but regard it as a unique opportunity to see the inside of different bodies. Bonus to the author for mentioning von Hagen and his work as well.A very well-written book full of facts that were presented in a humane way. The author put a lot of effort into this and I learned some very interesting facts. And like I said in the beginning of this review: while the writing style was respectful, she laced it with just enough slight humour here and there to make reading this book very enjoyable indeed."
17,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275498-jim,5,"In spite of the macabre topic, Mary Roach must have had a ball doing her footwork for this book. Not happy to glean her information from published sources, Mary travelled extensively to conduct her research, and had doors opened for her that I doubt get opened very often. Let's face it, when your job requires you to work with the dead the average Joe already thinks you're a ghoul, so it follows that you would be very cautious about allowing someone, a reporter no less, to observe you at your work. I think that her fair and open-minded approach probably broke down barriers very quickly,Mary, you see, is not the squeamish type. She is perfectly willing to stroll around a field of rotting corpses or sniff a shovelful of composting human in order to obtain not only information but sensation and experience. Certainly some work was done in the library - she covers a good deal of the history of the uses and abuses of dead people, with corpses being used for everything from uncomplaining patients for the instruction of cosmetic surgeons to dangling about as test subjects for new military munitions - but the majority of Mary's work was done on site at the labs, clinics and mortuaries where dead people tend to congregate. The result is a fair and honest look at the dead, how we have used them in the past and what we may have to do in the future in order to dispose of the millions of people who will be expiring daily.The book has every right to be sombre. It isn't. In fact, Ms Roach approaches the subject with a form of reverent humor that entertains the reader but does not disparage the departed. This is a respectful and thorough treatment of the topic. I hereby declare that this is one of the best books I have read this year, and I further declare that Ms Roach is one writer I would love to hoist a pint with some day...I have no doubt she could relate many a fascinating anecdote that didn't make it into print."
18,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1654286-lynx,5,"Loved this one! Mary Roach brings enjoyment to the macabre in this extremely educational book. Everything you wanted (and some things you didn't want to) know about the life of a cadaver. Packed with laugh-out-loud humour and interesting facts on every page, you'll be sad as it reaches the end. So check this book out and learn all about the exciting life your own body could have after death!"
19,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/144625-athena,2,"Well, I am half way through this and it has turned into a huge disappointment. What started out to be a funny depiction on what happens to donated cadavers, has taken a turn for the horrible. By the 6th or 7th chapter, the author showed what I can only equate to laziness and added commentary on subjects not pertaining to her once appreciated topic. I now find myself skipping over entire pages due to the lack of interest her writing presents and the tangents on which she goes; this I image done for two reasons 1) She needed filler and 2) She thought that by adding humor to the book that it would deflect some of the gore...not so. It gets 2 stars b/c it started off well, but sadly enough, I may not even finish this one.***** UPDATE *****Okay, so I can't really say I finished reading this book, because I didn't. All I can say to sum it up is it sucked. I am that person who cannot put a book down once I have committed myself to a least half of it because I have a hard time leaving things undone, sort of speak. But this book was impossible for me to finish and I cannot understand why it became a best seller. Anyway, save your money and pass this one up."

Or history. Or geography. Or math. Really anything that requires a level of intelligence that is based on facts and an excessive amount of information and concentration.These are just not my strong suits. And as much as high school teachers would want to make me feel bad about that with those shitty grades I kept getting, I‚Äôve accepted myself now as an adult. I fully embrace that I will never be able to help my stepkid with science or math homework. He could ask me about English and art though. And I do appreciate logic and thoughtfulness.I do have some intelligence, y‚Äôall!With that in mind, Mary Roach makes heavy scientific topics, experimentation and the history of anatomy and scientific discovery, easy enough for this dumb-dumb to understand. And even find funny! Roach imbues her writing with levity and a flirtatious tone that makes this more entertaining and less textbook-y.Maybe funny isn‚Äôt something you want to see associated with cadavers and their uses, but it works in this book. It walked a line between informative, engaging and delightful that any dark and twisty booknerd will enjoy.And for the less dark and twisty among us, there are great sections in this book that will make you think and examine your opinions.I‚Äôd like to say I‚Äôm surprised by some of the US legal things that came up regarding crash testing cars with cadavers etc., but given what uneducated, ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù prudes the US representatives have been towards things like sex education, abortion, climate change and stem cell research, it‚Äôs really not at all surprising that they‚Äôd rather test the effects of car accidents on dogs or pigs, than on cadavers that could actually save human lives in the big picture.Though I am, in large part, a misanthrope, I do have a respect for human beings and the advances we can make as a society. And it seems just plain ridiculous that there would ever be a question about what kind of scientific research we should be doing with cadavers. As if they know. As if they didn‚Äôt donate their bodies to science for a reason. As if some person sitting in a government chamber going ‚Äúewwwww‚Äù about research that might make some individuals uncomfortable, is a good enough reason to not see progress and find advancements for the future safety of all of us. Or to cure diseases. Or to save a woman‚Äôs life.Like, for real some of you suck.And if you don‚Äôt like hearing that, please head to the comment section, take what you‚Äôd like to write back to me in argument and insert it deep into your rectum, because I don‚Äôt give a shit.That said, there‚Äôs also a part of this book about souls that I found kind of silly and eye-roll worthy. I‚Äôm not religious or ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù ‚Äì though I waver on some ideas about human energy ‚Äì regardless, the facts that souls were even included in a book based on cadaver science didn‚Äôt land with me. Especially when you start getting into things like the donor organ transferring ‚Äútraits‚Äù of the ‚Äúsoul‚Äù it came from into the recipient. ‚ÄúI got a new heart and it made me a sex addict!‚Äù No, you had a brush with death and the psychological ramification of that, combined with knowing someone else‚Äôs heart is in your body, has just fucked you up. Stop cheating on your wife and get some therapy!Anyway, I‚Äôm not typically a super squeamish person, except for that part in Hostel where he slashes that guy‚Äôs ankles‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but the whole thing about animal testing in this book just made me want to scream. Head transplants on monkeys just to see what happens? I will burn this place to the ground! These are living things!As I said, I‚Äôm all for progress and logic/science-based laws and rules, but I have a huge, huge, Huge, HUGE problem with animal testing. Just as I would with children testing. Anything that is alive and cannot fight back should be left the fuck alone.All in all, this was a fun and educational read. And I typically don‚Äôt want to be educated on science-y topics. I can‚Äôt keep my eyes open. The part about The Body Farm was probably my favourite. Fun fact, my husband once suggested we take our honeymoon there.There‚Äôs much to be absorbed from this and I think it opened my mind to what my options are for after I die‚Ä¶ If I ever do! Muahahahahahahhsdgffg *cough, choking*‚Ä¶ (But seriously, become an organ donor.)I think I‚Äôd like my ashes put into a bio urn so that I can become a tree in death.

21,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2644090-erica,4,"I really ought to have read this sooner. I'm not sure what happened and why it took me so long to get this information into my brain.This is a book about what happens to dead bodies. It's an older title and some of the information therein has changed (Spoiler alert: there are now six? body farms in the US, I think. And the Swedish lady has not been as instrumental as hoped in burying the dead via compost, more's the pity because I totally want to compost myself! There is currently, however, a woman in CA who is trying to bring body compost to popularity and I am all on board!) but it's still incredibly fascinating to find out what we, in America, do with the all our dead bodies and what have been done to corpses historically, and how our opinions on death and the remains have changed in a rather short period of time.Covered herein:-What your corpse can expect as a medical donation;-What happens when you're buried versus cremated;-Other options available for getting rid of your remains;-What other people have done with their dead throughout history;-And much, much more!Keep in mind, this was written by a journalist and not by someone in the medical or deathical profession so if you're hoping for in-depth anatomy discussions, you may be disappointed. Also, if you're the type who feels death should only ever be treated with the utmost respect and honor, you may want to steer clear as, at times, she is mildly irreverent, which, of course, I loved. Only once did I think she bordered on downright disrespectful and I don't even remember what it was that made me feel that way so, obviously, not a huge deal if you're not easily offended by joking around a bit in regard to death and dead bodies."

3.5 StarsHUM-ANE: adjective: humane; comparative adjective: humaner; superlative adjective: humanest1. having or showing compassion or benevolence. ""regulations ensuring the humane treatment of animals"" synonyms: compassionate, kind, considerate, understanding, sympathetic, tolerant; How is it that a species with a history ripe with abuse and mistreatment of animals has come to use a word so similar to that species title to describe the very thing history proves us not to be?! ARROGANCE. The above is just food for thought, not something Roach broaches in Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers. In this book you will find many different uses for a human body after that body is no longer occupied. And to say it is fascinating is the understatement of the year. While some may call this morbid, I simply found it a scientific, at times humorous, and an extremely interesting read. As a species we have this almost innate fear of death. If you were to do a study of fears you would in fact learn that ‚ÄòDeath‚Äô is the most common fear that exists. I find this preposterous, death is inevitable. What we really fear isn‚Äôt death itself (at least for the most part); it is the act of ‚Äòdying‚Äô and the pain and hardship that comes with living in a body you KNOW is failing you. Death isn‚Äôt scary, DYING is scary.  This book also isn‚Äôt about that. ( I should really stop talking about things this book ISN‚ÄôT about) This book is about the serious scientific advancements that have come about owing to the use of the cadaver. And our history is full of horrible instances of grave-robbing, non-consensual cadaver use and even murder when it comes to furthering science or scientific advancements by using the body of a person who can no longer object. Some of these uses, naturally, are horrifying. Some of the stories and snipits from history are deeply unsettling. There are a couple chapters I wouldn‚Äôt advise eating before, after or during (I.e. the one on human cannibalism) but for the most part Roach has a witty, interesting non-fiction that manages to be illuminating and funny at the same time. Now I will answer the question that crosses probably every reader's mind, and certainly crossed (and is shared) Roach's mind, what about you:My answer is similar to hers actually, I will - provided they want them - be at very least an organ donor on this I will firmly stand, to the devil with my family or loved ones' squeamishness if I can save lives. I will however leave the final call on donating my body to science pending my survivors wishes. I will be dead, they will be the ones living with that not me.Category: A Non-Fiction Book"
23,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,5,"Opening paragraph:
The way I see it, being dead is not terribly far off from being on a cruise ship. Most of your time is spent lying on your back. The brain has shut down. The flesh begins to soften. Nothing much happens, and nothing is expected of you.
If you read this book, you will undoubtedly have many ‚Äúick‚Äù moments (especially in the chapter about eating the dead, but there‚Äôs also that footnote about necrophilia on page 43...), but you should have even more laugh-out-loud moment, and maybe a few bemuse-the-other-bus-riders when you groan and laugh simultaneously, especially if they see the cover of the book.Roach as a writer delights in the subtle twist creeping into the prose, the textual double-take. An excellent example is the first paragraph of Chapter Three:
Out behind the University of Tennessee Medical Center is a lovely, forested grove with squirrels leaping in the branches of hickory trees and birds calling and patches of green grass where people lie on their backs in the sun, or sometimes in the shade, depending on where the researchers put them.
Isn‚Äôt it splendid the way she paints the bucolic scene, so typical of an introductory paragraph? Almost like the copy for a university marketing brochure. And then... you remember what this book is about.Roach does occasionally rein in her curiosity, but only with an effort, and only after telling us where she almost took us. By that point, we are usually grateful for the mercy.It is easy to imagine her as a child running into the house with a handful of squirming worms asking Mom ‚ÄúAre these good for eating? They tickle your tongue! I saw birds feeding them to their babies! Can I feed them to my little sister?‚ÄùI think Mary Roach makes the world a more lively place, and I‚Äôm glad she writes this stuff. But don‚Äôt read this book while eating, especially not rice crispies or chicken soup."
24,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/653359-mindy,2,"Mary Roach didn't strike me as funny or witty, just annoying. She's like the wise ass class clown in the back row, heckling the teacher and distracting everyone from an otherwise fairly decent lecture. Only she's supposed to be the teacher, too. What was her point? To talk about dead bodies or impress herself with her own juvenile jokes? On a professional note, Roach seems awfully distrustful of librarians. Does she really think the circ clerk at a medical library thinks she's freaky for checking out books on dead people? Does she really think he even cares? Does she really think a librarian is going to mistake her PubMed search as porn and bust her? Too bad, because her ""facts"" like ""a dozen websites say..."" and ""when I googled this I found out..."" make me think she has the research prowess of a cadaver. Roach could use a good librarian, who could help her improve her search skills and also help her find the next open mic night to practice her shtick. Skip this book. Stick to Six Feet Under."

Gone are the days when I thought that bodies were either donated to universities, cremated, or buried - there are SO MANY MORE OPTIONS.This book was both a fascinating and gruesome read. Although I wouldn't say I am the most squeamish of people, I did find myself screwing up my face in disgust at particular sections of this book (*cough*cannabalism*cough*). I wouldn't recommend it for people that are faint of heart, as this might be a bit of an ordeal to get through.I really enjoyed the mix of fact and humour as well as first-hand experience that Mary Roach included in this book. I did find myself grinning or chuckling inwardly at several moments throughout this book - the woman has a fascination with cadaver penises, for real!There was quite a lot of animal cruelty portrayed in this book, which did admittedly make me somewhat uncomfortable. However, I can understand why it was included, because this is a microhistory after all and must stay true to the facts put forward throughout the book. There were also some sections, such as the use of cadavers in ballistics practice, that didn't appeal to me as much and I did find myself zoning out a bit in those sections, but overall I found this a highly entertaining and informative read. This topic may possibly be only interesting for those who are ever so slightly morbid though."

Have you ever wondered what happens to the body when it dies? Or how cadavers donated to science are used? Have you ever wondered if embalming keeps your body from ever decaying? These are just a few of the questions covered in this book.I absolutely love Mary Roach‚Äôs writing style! She‚Äôs hilarious without being disrespectful, and I can‚Äôt imagine anyone being able to write about this subject as well as she does. She keeps the reader engaged and asks the questions we are all curious about.. Well, at least the questions I was curious about. This was a fascinating and at times a disturbing read. If you get nauseous easy this may not be the book for you.  This may also not be the book for you if you are an animal lover.

Roach covers it all--medical laboratories, crash testing, funeral rituals, gunshot wounds, body snatching, death and religion, organ transplant, and cannibalism. While the book details many aspects of death and dead bodies, it is not morbid at all; Mary Roach handles the topic with mirth and candor. I found myself smiling and chuckling but also grimacing at times as well. The faint of heart should probably proceed with caution."

30,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,4,"Last year my man and I visited Calgary on our way to the mountains and spontaneously decided to check out the Body Worlds exhibit in the local science museum. Because, you know, hanging out with human cadavers for a few hours is our idea of a romantic outing. The majority of the exhibit was exceptionally fascinating and educational, and considering the subject, not too outlandish, until we reached the curtained room that illustrated human reproduction and sexuality. Here we were, with a bunch of other museum goers, facing a table with two cadavers perpetually suspended in a cowgirl position. I'm sure I wasn't the only one in the room wondering, Would these people donate their bodies to science if they knew they'd be displayed this way to strangers? Would this woman, now tenderly embracing a random chap underneath her, blush profusely and say, Nope, bury me six feet under? Needless to say, on my way out I just awkwardly shuffled past the sign up sheet calling for new donors.See, I was still trying to assign human characteristics to the remains that seized to be humans long time ago. My logic told me that being the subject of studies that educate and contribute to life-saving research is the noblest way to go out, yet something primal in me urged to run for the hills. This is the subject that Mary Roach discusses in her book, Stiff. She argues that once a person passes it would make much more sense to be useful to humanity than simply laying in the ground. She investigates multiple branches of science that utilize cadavers, as well as explores ethical dilemmas and social stigmas associated with it. Bottom line: humans are uncomfortable talking about death and assign overblown meaning to dead bodies to avoid thinking about mortality, but they shouldn't. I thoroughly enjoyed pushing the boundaries of my own comfort zone while reading this book. I actually started rethinking my views on cremation in favour of pod burials. And this review must officially seal my weirdo reputation on the Internet. Hello, prospective employers :)"

I had no idea they used cadavers for tests to improve automobile safety. I thought they used those crash test dummies you see in the ads. But only a real body will do if you want to know what will actually happen to a human body upon impact. There are a lot of other studies requiring real bodies, so you might consider just saying no to cremation and donating your remains instead. If you donate your body for medical study, you even get to include a biographical note in your file for the students who dissect you. If your brain wasn't good enough to get you into Harvard when you were alive, they'll accept it after you die. I had a hard time with this concept. I could just see my brain on a shelf in a jar marked ""Abby Normal,"" with Marty Feldman dancing around it singing ""Ain't got no bah-dee!""For this book, it's a good idea to suspend the habit of reading while you eat, especially for the chapters about historical practices involving cadavers.

35,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8024272-kasia,4,"Morbid humor supported by extensive research = my kind of read. Now, how do I make Mary Roach my eternal BFF?"
36,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1356469-fiona,5,"I'd never heard about this book before until it came up within a non-book related discussion topic in a group here on GoodReads. Strange how some books just pop out at you. Reading about cadavers - dead bodies, interested my morbid fascination with the dead and death.She writes sensitively, but humorously about what happens to you when you die. If you are considering donating organs or your whole body to science - like I was before even picking this book up, curious, or a family member wants to do this and you want to know more - this is a good book to read.It tells you the history of the dead body - how once upon a time people were afraid of being buried alive, the history of how cadavers were once acquired. The usefulness of cadavers and how they have been used. Not just for medicine, but also in testing and improving the saftey of cars, and also by the armed forces testing for other things too. Roach attempts to reduce the stigma that is sometimes built up over the uses of cadavers. It got me thinking, how we seem to be more worried over how we treat the dead then we do the living. We would rather test on a live animal then an already dead, and much more reliable human body part. I think she does this well, without coming across as overly preachy. But maybe that is because I already agree with her.Death is not the end. It has always seemed to me a waste to just die and then get loaded into a furnace to be cremated. I do not want to be cremated. I want to donate my organs to those who need them. I quote this paragraph, because I think it really sums up how I feel - about donating organs and people who oppose it.""It is astounding to me, and achingly sad, that with eighty thousand people on the waiting list for donated hearts and livers and kidneys, with sixteen a day dying there on that list, that more then half of the people in the position H's family was in will say no, will choose to burn those organs or let them rot. We abide the surgeon's scalpel to save our own lives, out loved ones' lives, but not to save a stranger's life. H has no heart, but heartless is the last thing you'd call her."" (p. 195)Also, if I do not end up donating the rest of my body to science, then I want to become human compost. I'd never heard of that before this book, but it appeals to me - better then just simply being buried - better to think that a tree or a plant will use my body to fertilise it's flowers and I can become one with nature - go back to the earth instead of being burnt up into useless ashes. "

It took me a long to finish it. Stiff is just not my normal type of book, and while I was interested in the subject matter (and pretty un-squeamish) the science of it all had me struggling to get through it.That being said, Mary Roach is so witty and funny, she took something dry and pretty gross and made a great book out of it. Not at any point did I want to quit reading this book... I just had to make my peace with the fact that I was going to have to read it a little bit at a time.And while Stiff is not something I'd ever read again, I think she did a really great job with it. I have no doubt that people with Science brains will LOVE this book.So, I settled on a 3.5 star rating rounded up to 4**P.S. - For the record, I do NOT want my body donated to science"
38,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1170391-sara,2,"DNF at 60%.I tried really hard to get into this, but in the end I just found it quite monotonous. There were certain sections that were quite interesting, such as the visit to the body farm and crash test dummy studies but a lot of the rest was repetitive or oddly insensitive. I think on some level the author became quite detached and unemotional with regards to death and dead bodies - which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing sometimes, but it didn‚Äôt help me connect with her. There are better books on the subject out there, that deal with the subject matter in a more emotive tone. "

40,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7951847-caro-the-helmet-lady,3,"Dear Author, what's wrong with the word ""maggots""? I think that if readers pick something that has ""cadavers"" in the title, you don't have to play euphemisms with them - they know what they're getting into. Or was it supposed to be funny? Oh, okay then. Ha ha.But putting aside weird joking in weird moments it was quite an interesting book on subject that too many prefer to avoid. We don't like to think about ourselves as of dead bodies, that have no more choices and voices. That's why it's probably the best to actually think about it and decide while you can still decide about what they gonna do to you when you're dead. And there are many choices - well, in some countries at least, if not everywhere, and the author gives us a glimpse at some of the most nontraditional. She also emphasizes another important subject - how our body instead of slowly decomposing or burning or else can be used for science purposes - to save lives in quite many ways.Also there was an interesting chapter about cannibalism. Interesting and creepy.3,5 stars."
41,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216776-jill,1,"Stiff, by Mary Roach, is a book about human cadavers and the curious situations they find themselves in. Well, they didn't find themselves in any situation. They are dead bodies. But Mary Roach found them and this book is the result.While reading this book I paused at halfway and actually asked myself if I wanted to bother finishing it. I have never found myself asking myself this before. I usually stick it out to the bloody, gruesome end. This book, however, just was not interesting. It was not the hilarious screamfest that I was promised on Amazon reviews. It did not take me into worlds that I had yet to explore. It was simply this: a disappointment.I had heard much about this book before I plucked it off the shelf at Barnes and Noble. It came highly recommended by MeFites and I had seen it referenced many different places around the internet. My first impression was that the author was a periodicals journalist trying to write a book. Each chapter is its own article, at least until she starts weakly trying to tie them together by adding things like, ""But in the next chapter, we see how dead bodies really do push up daisies,"" at the end of chapters. Clearly an afterthought.Also, it may be due to the success of the book when it was initially published, but it just seems to me that almost every topic covered in the book has been recently covered on television or in magazines. Perhaps I read about these things in college. I certainly don't seek out interesting tidbits about cadavers, yet somehow, from somewhere, I was familiar with almost every chapter's subject. This book is not funny. I cannot imagine anyone laughing out loud to this book. It's not that I can't laugh at death or dead people or the situations, it's just that the author tries too hard. The humor is forced. It's not natural. It's like she spent hours trying to describe a lab tech in a funny way. It falls flat. Additionally, the author inserts herself into the action and records her own interviews, including awkward attempts at humor with very serious people. It just makes you cringe and you almost feel embarrassed for her.The end of the book couldn't have come fast enough. Toward the end, she morbidly tries to top each chapter with more disgusting details, more gross descriptions and more sick and twisted happenings. It begins to overpower the little bit of grace and dignity the book started out with. It's almost as if the publishers realized this, because odd, tiny rants about the dignity of deceased persons and the way people handle them are awkwardly inserted into the text. It gets repetitive.In the end, I just plain didn't enjoy this book. The author and her injected awkward humor and odd opinions annoyed me. The book seemed unpolished. Nothing seemed new and different about it. It was just a disappointment. "
42,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13036247-diana,4,"The opening paragraph in the introduction of Stiff reads:‚ÄúThe way I see it, being dead is not terribly far off from being on a cruise ship. Most of your time is spent lying on your back. The brain has shut down. The flesh begins to soften. Nothing much new happens, and nothing is expected of you.‚Äù Thus begins this journey Mary Roach has written for us about The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers. This is not a book I would have normally chosen to read. In fact, I hate the cover. When I wasn‚Äôt reading it, the book was laying face down so the feet wouldn‚Äôt be staring at me. üôÇ So why did I read this? I have always been fascinated with the medical field. I am always looking to learn more about it and I‚Äôm always looking to rotate my reading through many different topics. So, when one of my book clubs selected this for July, I did not even hesitate. It‚Äôs hard to give this book a rating because of the, shall we say, ‚Äúicky factor?‚Äù Mary Roach has done her homework so thoroughly and there is so much information in this book! What I like best is Roach‚Äôs ability to gross me out and make me laugh in the same paragraph. An example of this is: ‚ÄúThe early anatomists were dealing with a chronic shortage of bodies for dissection, and consequently were motivated to come up with ways to preserve the ones they managed to obtain. Blanchard‚Äôs textbook was the first to cover arterial embalming. He describes opening up an artery flushing the blood out with water, and pumping in alcohol. I‚Äôve been to frat parties like that.‚ÄùFor the sake of this review, I chose one of the less gross examples but you get the idea. Despite the fantastic way Mary Roach writes this book, there were still portions I had to skim because of the grossness. Even with occasional skimming, I now know more than I ever knew I wanted to know about human cadavers! "
43,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7399266-camie,5,"This book has won pages of awards since being published in 2003. I've seen it around forever, but chalked it up as "" not for me"" until it was placed in my hands by my husband who having worked with hip and knee joint replacement surgery and the requisite cadaver research for 30 years still found it pretty darn interesting. And it is actually quite fascinating along with being chock full of information, and just plain entertaining to boot. If you're the pragmatic type like me, and figure that once your soul has ""left the building "" you're body is really but a shell that may as well be put to good use in some endeavor to help the living , you'll be surprised by the many ways in which you can do so. Here's where I have to confess that if you know my families medical history , you'll know I have more than a casual interest in more research being done for medical conditions that retain enough mystery even in this day and age to seriously promote the idea of increasing the education of medical professionals , along with helping out fellow health issue sufferers. That's the part I'd already thought about , marking that box for organ donation on my drivers license long ago ( well, back when folks might have wanted them ) but there are so many other things I seriously hadn't thought much about that involve cadaver use. Some of those being crime investigation, public safety , product testing, and the list goes on and on. This is my first read by Mary Roach ( and many say her best !!) and it's pretty impressive that she has taken a subject that many would consider just way too morbid ( and sometimes just plain gross) to read about and turned it into a very thought provoking statement about how the study of the human body has already dramatically affected us all ( penicillin , car airbags, football helmets ) and will continue to for generations to come. You know this already but still , this is absolutely and seriously NOT for even the mildly squeamish or those offended by differing religious/ moral views 5 stars "
44,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369975-lisa,4,"I usually don't laugh out loud when I read books, but this book had serveral passages that had me giggling. Also, I don't get, ""Grossed out,"" very often, but I had to put this book down once while I was reading and eating lunch. This book has so many interesting tidbits on what happens to our bodies after we die. I was amazed and facinated by the history and current research being done on human cadavars. My parents, much to their children's objections decided long ago to be cremated when the times comes. I felt squimish about this for years, but after reading this book I have completely changed my thinking on the matter. This book had me thinking about things I hadn't given much thought to before. What happens when your body is donated to science? The chapters on human crash test dummies was dare I say inspiring? Where does the sould reside? The author was witty and sensitive and by the end of the book I felt like we were friends who went on a journey together. I think I've lived in the Northwest too long, because he last chapter titled, ""Out of the Fire, into the Compost Bin,"" ended sounding like not such a crazy idea. You'll have to read to see! Highly recommended!"
45,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,5,"A fabulously humour-filled look at what happens (or has happened historically) to bodies after they die. Roach looks at the body in its numerous ways (muscles, organs, circulatory system, ect) and shows how people have done the damnedest things to themselves or others. She also talks about some of the very odd new-age ways to preserve one's self in the afterlife, as well as some gruesome experiments that have been undertaken to determine what DOES happen to the soul after death (or could we have a second head survive on our body).Roach presents this completely serious material in such a way that you cannot help but laugh or at least shake your head and wonder. From cannibalism in China to human composting in Sweden and even a visit to a body farm to see how they study decomposition. A wonderfully entertaining (and eye opening) look at life ...after life.Highly recommend this for the curious and those in need of a WTF moment.Kudos, Madame Roach!"
46,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"'Stiff' is such a fun read! I recommend the book to people with scientific curiosity and a sense of delight in quirky human behaviors. I do not recommend it for anybody who is remotely squeamish or for very young sensitive people. Mary Roach writes of how people use cadavers as explicit and factual as a pathologist or a medical examiner writing for laymen.Although I liked it, there were times I had to take a break and put it down. Not entirely because of squeamishness, though. I often needed time to process the amazing details of historical and current scientific study and research into anatomy, dying, and decomposition, and the variety of methods of using and processing dead people the author Mary Roach dug up (how many times has a review included that line. ; p ). Mary Roach often uses dry and slapstick humor to discuss the detailed science and pseudo-science and early-century proto-science that people have been doing to corpses for hundreds of years. She also travels around the world to a variety of medical, commercial and environmentalist laboratories who use either corpses and body parts for experimentation. She tackles the folk beliefs and practices from centuries ago, and not so long ago, which required what we would label cannibalism today, but these early cultures felt were either spiritually honoring their dead or curing their diseases. The jokes sometimes are groaners, but I thought they were more than appropriate and in tune with the centuries of human silliness and bizarre but earnest research about dead people mixed in with the mainstream studies.Commercial research has used corpses more than I guessed! Car manufacturers use corpses for impact studies in order to design safe cars. Medical schools need bodies and body parts. Investigators of airplane and other types of crashes often use trauma studies of cadavers to determine likely causes of passenger deaths found after disasters (odd fact - being a male increases survivability because maybe the strongest survive by pushing everyone else out of their way). Military services use studies on corpses who are shot. Sports equipment are designed after throwing baseballs and such at dead people. Cadaver dogs need to train with body parts. Embalming techniques are explained. Researchers even know some of what internal body parts feel pain when hurt (past and present animal studies : O ). Gelatin made from animals is in thousands of commercial products you really don't want to think about because of what gelatin comes from. Illegal uses and past uses of cadavers which are now illegal are touched upon as well (for example, necrophilia!).Then there are the early scientists and doctors who wanted to know where the soul might be living, or who simply wanted to know if it was true guillotined heads lived for awhile after being cut off(view spoiler)[ - they blink for several seconds! Or, sadly, if a transplanted dog's head on another dog would work because if it did, they hoped to transplant a human head onto a braindead body with a still beating heart. Of course, there were the wallets, false teeth, handbags, etc. made from body parts.  (hide spoiler)]Gentle reader, human, dog, pig, cow, and various other animals' poop have played major major major roles in early crackpot medicine for human ailments, wounds and injuries, along with spit, menstrual blood and urine, for centuries, literally, centuries. How in earth did humanity survive these early 'cures'? (view spoiler)[The major ingredient in these medicines and tinctures was usually liquor. People were eager for these elixirs despite the lack of permanent relief, generally.  (hide spoiler)]If you have managed to read this far without your gag reflex engaging, this is a must read!There is a bibliography included."

50,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6303796-rachel-bavr,5,"Because it's December 29th, I think I can confidently name this as one of my favorite reads of the year. What happens to us when we die? This is one of the grand mysteries of life, right up there with Where the fuck do all the socks go after you put them in the dryer? I tend to think I'll just go to sleep and never wake up. It's the eternal rest we all dread but sort of look forward to, a hands-in-the-air gesture of I give up. Granted, there are many who feel differently, and it is nice to think of the possibility of a fancy afterlife without all of our earthly problems. We have nothing to tell us what will happen to our souls/essence/whatever you call it aside from faith, but the end of our bodies isn't a mystery. At least, it isn't a mystery if you're the morbidly curious type like me. Mary Roach covers the variety of things that happen to human cadavers. We can be anything in death, really - a sawed-off head for plastic surgeons to practice facelifts and nose jobs, the dissection specimen for a new medical student, a crash-test cadaver, an organ donor, a decomposing experiment in a field in Tennessee, a pile of ash, or an embalmed corpse in a casket. You know what I learned from this book? How damn useful cadavers can be. Cadavers, in their many forms, can tell us a lot. The level of decomposition can pinpoint time of death and narrow down a murder investigation. Wound patterns and autopsies can tell us just how a plane comes apart in the air. Open-casket funerals can confirm to loved ones that the deceased is, indeed, deceased and that morticians are really good at making the cadavers look less dead. Sometimes I find it difficult to be that useful as a living, breathing human. Think of the number of lives one cadaver can save through the donation of various organs. Only in death will some be raised to the status of superhero. I kept repeating my ""cadavers are USEFUL"" mantra while reading this, even during the gruesome parts. Yes, Roach details the gore, and yes, it is fascinating. You have the chance to follow her to an embalming and a tour of a research facility consisting entirely of decomposing corpses. Fortunately, Roach has a talent for keeping the mood upbeat and holding the grotesque at bay. When dealing with heavy material like this, it helps to have a narrator with a sense of humor. For those of you with a strong stomach and a healthy curiosity about what happens to our bodies when we die, I highly recommend this book. Cadavers are USEFUL, after all. It's time they start getting credit for it. "
51,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon,4,"Ever wonder what happens to your body after you die? For most of us, we‚Äôre either buried six feet under in a box or cremated and poured into an urn. That being said, there are a few folks who make the decision to donate their mortal vessel to science. In Stiff, Mary Roach explores the world of cadaver research with a humorous, often conversational tone that‚Äôs far removed from the dry, overbearing tomes from your high school biology class.I had a bad experience with Mary Roach about two years ago when I took a chance on an audiobook version of Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void. While the subject matter was interesting, the narrator was about as fun to listen to as a seminar on box factories put on by Ben Stein after he woke up from a nap. After making my way through Bill Bryson‚Äôs One Summer: America, 1927 a few months ago, I wanted back on the Mary Roach train. I decided to grab one of her more known books, Stiff.Stiff is a fun, informative, albeit morbid experience in which Mary covers a wide variety of uses for the human body after its expiration date. Roach visits a body farm where the departed are studied during various stages of decomposition, a research lab that studies the effects of car crashes on cadaver test dummies and even discusses ill fated head transplant experiments. There are also crucifixion tests, practice patients for surgeons in training and when exactly a person should be considered legally dead and thus available for organ harvesting.Without a doubt, Stiff has definitely renewed my interest in checking our more Mary Roach. I can‚Äôt wait for the next time someone brings up dead bodies at a party so I can flex my random cadaver knowledge.Also posted @ Every Read Thing."
52,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1085121-stephanie-extremely-stable-genius,3,"I have been thinking of donating my body to science. I think that would be the best way to dispose of it I am gone. I know that I am not my body, not that I know who ""I"" am, but I am pretty sure we don't hang around worrying about what happens to the sack of meat, water and bones once ""we"" leave it. While reading this book I pictured my body going through all the scenarios that are described in this book. Some were disturbing, some were kind of funny. Picturing my body being propped up as a creepy crash test dummy and being all slumpy and uncooperative.....struck me as funny.Nothing really changed my mind about donating except for the testing of ammunition and guns, and their effectiveness....... might. I really am not a fan of the gun.....do I want to help out with that? Mary Roach points out that you cannot specify where your body goes, so I don't know.Another bad thing that could happen was pointed out by a friend of mine. She had a friend going to nursing school, for some reason they had to do some kind of learning with cadavers. When the friend saw the cadaver, it was her grandmother. Now this sounds like an urban myth, and could very well be, but it makes a good point. In the end, the very end, it's about the loved ones of the person who's passed and not about the dead person. So as long as there is no one around that cares anymore, or my loved ones are completely comfortable with the decision, then I will donate my body to science."
53,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark,4,"This book is fascinating, morbidly funny and right up my alley. The author has a very dry wit and the narrator of the story reads off these quips with a skillful deadpan. But be warned author Roach details all sorts of cadaver research including some horrifying experiments including animals (innocent little puppies) as well as dead humans. I learned many things that I could have lived the rest of my life quite happily without discovering. The author has nerves of steel as she wheedles her way into weird situations and suffers from an obsessiveness about cadavers that verges on the creepy. Great stuff. This one will hold up to many re-reads."
54,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"Mary Roach never disappoints me. She is interested in unusual subjects and she approaches them with a slightly off-kilter sense of humour. However she has finally found a subject that I can‚Äôt read about while eating--I had to save this book for after-supper reading.We hate to be brought face-to-face with our mortality and that is exactly what human cadavers do. We have to consider who they were before death and that we will be like them some day. I think even Ms. Roach found herself testing her usual gung-ho boundaries during this research. She talks about the line that she had to ride, to be sufficiently respectful of the dead (who, after all, still have people in the world who care about them) and her usually irreverent self. She retains the humour by making fun of her own reactions.As a society, we don‚Äôt like to think about death, yet we get all emotional about using human bodies (which were donated by those who used to inhabit them) in safety tests of various sorts. I guess it‚Äôs not as dignified as we expect the dead to be treated. It also seems to be extremely uncomfortable for those doing the testing.Weird and wonderful, this is everything you wanted to know about being dead, but were afraid to ask. Mary is rarely afraid to ask. If you enjoy this book, I would recommend her logical companion volume, Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife."

Maybe 75. And it's gotta be presented in terms on how said science-y stuff effected societal and cultural and historical...stuff. And thangs. I dunno. Yeah. So the stuff like the French Revolution & guillotine was nifty but the more contemporary stuff bored the stuff out of me.Stuff.I really wish I found science more interesting. If only because I had a friend in college who majored in chemical engineering. My first year out of college, I was doing customer service crap for T-Mobile at slightly higher than minimum wage.

Yes, you read that right! (CADAVERS!) I learned so much more than I ever thought I needed to know about this topic. How bodies decompose to how to compost with bodies (it's good for your garden!-- WHO knew?) So many cringeworthy moments, and parts that made me gag- I'd encourage not to read this one while you are eating.

I didn't even mind hearing the stuff I already knew because Roach is so entertaining. It's very difficult to come across as wryly funny at the same time as respecting the personhood of the cadavers she discusses, but Roach manages it effortlessly. I can't say enough good things about this book without sounding repetitive. Loved it.Mucho thanks to Adriana for connecting me with this writer."
59,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/661417-laurel,3,"This book is amusing, though after the first few chapters a little boring. I was sufficiently grossed out by the chapter regarding human decomposition, and the bit about the embalming process and how funeral homes prepare the body was particularly interesting to me when I found myself sitting at a wake the evening after reading it. I couldn't stop thinking about how the dearly departed's eyelids were held down by a little disk that pinned into his eyeball so the lids wouldn't pop open. I'm not all that interested in crash-test dummies for some reason, so I skipped over that part. The airplane crash bit scared the shit out of me. Mary Roach's voice is strong and clearly passionate about the subject, without being weirdly passionate/creepy. She's often unsure of how much she really wants to know about this stuff too. I can definitely see being annoyed by all of the jokey comments she makes, but it didn't really bother me all that much. I read it as sort of a self-conscious attempt at making sure the readers know she's not a creep. "
60,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,4,"I had no idea dead bodies could be so fascinating. In Mary Roach's capable hands, however, the subject of what happens to our physical selves after we die is page-turning reading. I always thought it basically came down to burial or cremation. But I now know I also have the option of becoming a crash test dummy, a bit of chemically rendered goo, or some hearty memorial compost.As this book explores everything from organ donation to anatomy labs to cannibalism to the budding ""head transplant"" movement, I learned an astounding number of things. Many of these things were not exactly comfortable to consider (I will never look at Chinese medicine the same way again), but Mary's sharp wit and ability to keep the tone light despite the subject helped me get past the parts I personally found most difficult.I can't say that what I learned is really of much practical value, however, unless I ever find myself in the position of hoping to dispose of a dead body at the bottom of a lake. Turns out that's not such a good idea, as dogs trained to find human remains are able to smell the decomposition gasses as they bubble up to the surface. Who knew?Upon finishing it, however, I can say that this book has gotten me to think a lot more about the possibility of donating my body to science after my demise. While it's not exactly comfortable to read about all the various things that are done with donated remains, the wealth of knowledge that has been gained from those who have made that choice is truly astounding. The book closes with the author's reflection on what to do with her own remains. Her discussion of the impact of that choice on those who are left behind is valuable reading for anyone considering end of life planning, as well as for those of an environmental inclination who may not have yet considered the planetary impact of their choice. After all, just because you can be plastinated to last 10,000 years like the folks in Gunther Von Haagen's BodyWorlds exhibits, that doesn't necessarily mean you should."

Roach manages to be respectful yet humorous & insightful all at the same time. The first chapter begins with a training session for plastic surgeons who learn new procedures by working on cadaver heads & she follows up with a brief history on doctors getting corpses to learn on. It's just fantastic. Original review from when I joined GR, read date end of 2005, early 2006Not the best thing to read while eating lunch, although that seemed to be the only time I found. It's graphic & very well done. Before reading it, I'd already decided that donating my body to science after I died was the way to go. This convinced me I made the correct decision. She handled the subject matter really well.It's a pretty ghastly subject, but she again proved that she's an above average writer. Her monthly column in Reader's Digest is a 'must read' for me. "

When any of those things combine together to include dark humour - even better! So, needless to say, Stiff, a seriously funny (and, in a strange way, cute) book all about the dead human body (how we die, what physically happens to our bodies after we die, what our corpses endure if we donate our bodies to science, etc) is one of my all-time favourite books. I have my very own handy dandy copy in my personal collection, and I pick over it every now and then just to amuse myself and to refresh my memory - because you never know when you'll need to describe, in graphic detail, to someone the process of cremation."

I've actually dissected a body before- abdomen, neck, and face, to be precise- so I figured I would be really interested in this story. I was pretty into the dissection and mortuary chapters, but as the story went along, I found my interest waning. The narrator was a little dry, and I just felt sort of... blah.

Me and my broadsword on a big raft, and I'll be decked out in my regalia, and . . . oh, I suppose David and Emily will fight over who gets to fire a flaming arrow onto it . . . apparently we'll need some kindling, unless my regalia has been doused with gasoline. Yes, lets go with gasoline. I'll explode into a ball of flame as I drift down the Eerie Canal. Since I'm an athiest, I doubt I'll make it into Valhalla--then again, the idea of waiting around and/or doing battle for all of eternity sounds boring and/or unpleasant.  Barring that, I'm going to donate my body to science. My reasoning is this: I don't want to get stuck in a box. Not fun now, not fun later. I equally don't want to get converted into pollution via incineration, and then dumped out in my favorite childhood park, or whatever people do with cremains. These aren't environmentally friendly ways to go, nor are they entertaining.  Instead, I can be part of a science, which, from the depictions in this book, is a fucking awesome way to go. Perhaps my severed head will end up in a big row of severed heads of various shapes and sizes in a classroom somewhere! Students will try to keep their lunches down while opening my head and seeing all the gross inside parts! Or, perhaps they'll put my dead and naked body out in a field to study the decomposition process! I imagine the field is flat and green, with trees and a few birds . . . and dead bodies scattered all over the place! Can you imagine what it would be like to walk around in a field like that? Very surreal. As a socially conscious person, I want the world to be bettered in some way by my death (please resist the obvious joke). And, as a fan of surreal experiences as performance art, donating my body to science sounds like a great way to continue weirding people out long after my blood stops pumping. Yes, my decision has been made. Only through donating your body to science can you do something noble, socially responsible, and absolutely disgusting, all at the same time.Since this is the closest I've ever come to writing a will, I'll go ahead and mention that none of you get anything: I'm taking it all with me on my blazing Valhalla raft. It's better to have it all close by, just in case there IS an afterlife. "

Thanks, Mary Roach.It‚Äôs hard not to think about your own mortality and that of your loved ones while reading about cadavers, but morbid curiosity seems to be an innate quality in humans. Reading Stiff, you will inevitably experience a mix of discomfort, horror, fascination, and amusement. This made for an odd audiobook read, as it tainted my daily tasks with an eerie atmosphere. I‚Äôd be happily making lemonade‚Ä¶while listening to vivid descriptions of decomposing remains. Going for a walk in the sunshine‚Ä¶with a history of head transplants as my background music. Taking a relaxing shower‚Ä¶and learning about what other, less alive naked bodies were doing with their time. I can only imagine how harrowing it must be to listen to the parts about dead crash test dummies while driving to work.Mary Roach herself seems like a fascinating and intelligent individual, the kind you wouldn‚Äôt mind getting stuck on a plane with for a few hours. Her writing style is vivacious and fun (although she‚Äôs fairly obsessed with the state of penises postmortem), but she remains thorough and objective in her research. I especially enjoyed her recreations of the interview process as well as the gallows humor and the frequent asides. My favorite sections were probably those about China medicinal practices. The variety and scope of the topics presented are truly amazing; you have to respect the amount of research and interviewing that went into the creation of this book.As for what I wish to do with my body after I die, I am rather interested in the idea of some kind of bio-cremation that provides new growth for a tree rather than a gravesite. Once upon a time, I might‚Äôve considered donating my body to science, but after reading this book, I can‚Äôt help but imagine researchers dissecting the skin of my unattached head or attempting to position my flaccid body in a crash simulator as moist seepage leaks onto the floor‚Ä¶ Yeah, I‚Äôll stick to the ecologist‚Äôs daydream."

Mary Roach, a science journalist, also discusses what happens when people donate their bodies to science, often through a university or medical school. Most of the bodies will be used in the anatomy department for dissection, and for teaching doctors new surgical techniques. But other cadavers will be used for safety testing to determine tolerances in car accidents and airline crashes, saving thousands of lives. Some may be used by the military, such as testing the protective value of different footwear getting blown up by a land mine.The author interviewed forensic specialists who examined the remains of passengers to determine the causes of an airline crash. She also talked to people about cremation, and other new alternatives to burial. The book was written in a conversational tone with humor which ranged from light remarks to rather juvenile humor. Some people might want to skip the chapter about cannibalism and cultures that use body parts for medicinal purposes, especially if they're reading right before dinner. The author did an impressive amount of research for this book, and presented it in an understandable manner. I found the science interesting, and definitely learned more than I ever wanted to know about human cadavers."

Mary Roach obviously did her homework for this volume. It's chock full of information about how cadavers are used in many, many fields of research and testing. She's sharp-witted, too, which makes this morbid, potentially stomach-turning topic much more palatable. Each chapter describes a different aspect of how cadavers are used, from plastic surgery practice to research on the Shroud of Turin to determining the level of force of a windshield needed to crack a skull. Interesting, no? Recommended for anyone interested in unusual research techniques, historical inquiry, and with a morbid sense of humor. "

77,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11566536-guy-portman,4,"This non-fiction work investigates the more unfamiliar scenarios involving our dead bodies. Topics include human crash test cadavers, bullet-testing cadavers, and the virtually all-encompassing medical research field. As well as the crucial contribution that is organ donation, cadavers, we are informed, are being used in more contentious ways, such as the practice of plastic surgery procedures on severed heads. Environmental concerns surrounding cremation are leading to a search for new methods. One enterprising, eco-friendly Swede has been experimenting with cadaver composting as a viable alternative. Historical cadaver usage is also explained. Fortunately for the author she has a sense of humour, and she needed it for this book. One chapter sees her visit a field research facility dedicated to the study of human decay. The visit entailed inspecting cadavers in various states of putrescence.  Although Mary Roach applies a light approach to explore this taboo topic, she employs a more serious, empathetic tone as and when required. Her ability to make the scientific aspects comprehensible to the lay reader is to be applauded, as is the decision to omit photographs.This reader found some sections to be more engaging than others, and he was critical of the excessive utilisation of footnotes. None the less this is a rewarding read that will intrigue those with an interest in the macabre. This work was published back in 2003, and considering the doubtless advances in post-mortem science since then, perhaps a sequel is in order. "

80,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/285762-katrina,2,"I wanted so much to like this book and I did, to an extent. But the author's seemingly inconsistent squeamishness started to annoy me after awhile. (She was perfectly okay with seeing bodies decomposing in the sun but freaked out so much at the description of a method used to keep cadavers' mouths closed for funeral viewings that she stops the mortician student mid-explanation.) Also, it seemed to me that, the longer the book went on, the more the author became impressed with her own jokes, some of which are downright juvenile. (Yes, people in Australia pronounce and sometimes even spell words differently than we do here in America, but it's not really funny unless you're five.)I feel like I'm being mean and that's not my intention. STIFF does provide a lot of interesting facts about the post-mortem experiences of people who donate their bodies to science or their organs for transplants, without being dryly academic about it. I just tended not to care for the author's tone. Your mileage may vary.Note: Be aware that this book does sometimes discuss medical testing on animals both alive and dead. A lot of it is testing that was done many years ago, but the level of detail provided at times caused me to skip paragraphs here and there and several pages near the end of the book."

I used to watch open heart surgery on a weird educational channel on tv.This book came close to maxing out my tolerance. If Mary Roach didn't have such a weird, dry sense of humor, I don't think I would have made it. But she is a trooper, so I was a trooper. Even though it meant I sometimes had to put down my fork and stop eating my corned beef hash while listening to the description of a particularly ""ishy"" story about grave robbery. Btw, my review is somewhat tongue in cheek. Lambie did come running into my room once shouting, ""What the h3// are you listening to?!?!"" Then she made me start the chapter over so she could hear it. We have a pretty straightforward attitude at our house toward the disposal of our bodies after death. Arrangements have already been made for me to go to a state university body farm for study, and Lambie wants to be composted. Ridley says he is going to destroy the entire universe when he goes.

84,0393324826,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2109885-literary-ames-against-gr-censorship,4,"Never have my Western morals, pre-conceptions and beliefs been more challenged than when reading Stiff. No one wants to consider their own mortality and make any arrangements for the afterlives of their bodies. Being confronted with the cold hard reality of nature, science and history of death was an uncomfortable, disgusting and enlightening experience. Those of a delicate disposition and strong religious belief will find this a particularly difficult and offensive read. But honestly, they should suck it up and read it anyway, hopefully with an open mind. My views were unexpectedly changed on quite a few issues. Nothing was as clear-cut and simple as I assumed they would be. I share Roach's feelings towards cadavers: ‚ÄôCadavers are our superheroes: They brave fire without flinching, withstand falls from tall buildings and head-on car crashes into walls. You can fire a gun at them or run a speedboat over their legs, and it will not faze them. Their heads can be removed with no deleterious effect. They can be in six places at once.‚ÄôCadavers can be:‚ú∫ Used to train doctors. Historically, and currently, controversial. I was surprised by how much respect is shown by students to their cadavers, and I can completely understand why they hold memorial services for them as an emotional outlet for how disturbing it is to injure and deliberately disfigure another (albeit dead) human being. Digital anatomy instruction and/or plastination (I‚Äôll explain later) may replace the dissection of the dead.‚ú∫ Stolen from their graves and sold to medical schools. Thousands of body-snatchers or Resurrectionists (hehe!) made a career out of it, including the infamous murderers, Burke and Hare.‚ú∫ Sex objects, i.e. necrophilia. Self-explanatory, that, eh? *wink, wink*‚ú∫ Used to study decay on body farms, where cadavers are placed in controlled conditions and left to decompose, returning at pre-determined intervals to examine the results, which can later be used to determine cause and time of death.‚ú∫ Embalmed. The ultimate plastic surgery, turning the old youthful once again. Morticians actually have to paint wrinkles on the elderly so their relations can recognise them. Morticians sanitize the body, plug the orifices (""Will we be suturing the anus?"") and replace the fluids with formaldehyde, a toxic preservative. Much the same is done with the language used to describe their ‚Äòclients‚Äô. Wrinkles are ‚Äòfacial markings‚Äô, a stiff is the ‚Äòdecedent‚Äô. ‚ú∫ Used to test safety as crash test dummies, improving vehicle safety and ultimately saving lives as a result.‚ú∫ Used to determine the cause of plane crashes. Not all wreckage is recoverable and sometimes only the dead can tell you how and why a plane crashed. This chapter was particularly interesting, detailing many facts about the aerospace industry you really don't want to know if you ever want to fly again.‚ú∫ Used to prove or disprove Jesus's crucifixion. Forgive me, but I believe Dr. Pierre Babet was batshit crazy. To put it more mildly, fanatically religious, obsessed devoted to Catholicism, and didn't much care about the people whose limbs he was cutting off, for perhaps mild injuries, to further his quest for the ultimate, undeniable proof that Christ was wrapped in the, now defunct, Shroud of Turin in 1931. If he did indeed amputate healthy limbs, it was uncalled for. No lives were hanging in the balance. So, for once, I can, while reading this book, definitively say that I would be sickened if this was so.‚ú∫ Used to test munitions, though it‚Äôs taboo. The purpose is to take lives in order save lives. Ballistics gelatine and animals are the more common targets. The shooting and blowing up of live pigs and other animals for the training of military doctors, is also controversial. But which would you prefer: dead soldiers and alive pigs, or alive soldiers and dead pigs? I think if you had family and friends in the armed forces you‚Äôd rather those pigs die. Honestly, I was horrified when I heard about this practice on the news and yet after reading this, I completely understand why it's necessary. If there were no guns or bombs, surgeons wouldn't need these skills in the first place.‚ú∫ Organ donors. Beating-heart cadavers are brain-dead (i.e. legally dead). On the one hand, one person can save many lives. Alternatively, the actual process is quite upsetting. Organs are removed while the donor still has a pulse, including the heart, which is the last to be cut out, and continues to beat ominously afterwards, for a few minutes. Although gender can be discerned from an ECG by a heart surgeon as they beat slightly differently, contrary to popular belief, transplant recipients do not begin to exhibit traits of their donor‚Äôs. A wildly inaccurate myth.‚ú∫ Used to experiment with new surgical techniques. Head transplants have been attempted, both with humans and animals. Real-life Frankenstein here, people. Both disturbing and grotesque. I‚Äôm not religious, but even I was throwing out words like ‚Äòunnatural‚Äô and ‚Äòbarbaric‚Äô while reading the various experiments. Shockingly, a transplanted monkey head was responsive for a few days before it died. Yes, it‚Äôs most definitely cruel, though I took Roach‚Äôs point that if a way was found to reattach the spinal column/cord, paralysis could be a thing of the past. Still, this head will only ever know one body and will hopefully remain attached until body and brain are decomposing.‚ú∫ Used for food, i.e. cannibalism. Alive aside, this practice generally isn‚Äôt acceptable in the West in current times, apart from the placenta. Historically, and in the East, almost every body part was ingested in the name of medicine. Chinese women used to cut off a body part and cook it for their mother-in-laws. Today, the Chinese still find aborted human foetuses a delicacy. I really want to judge them for this, but wild animals eat their dead. Nothing‚Äôs wasted. Personally, I‚Äôd be worried about kuru, the incurable degenerative neurological disorder contracted via cannibalism. Roach details the options for your body after death:

(Click table to enlarge)Plastination, developed by Gunther von Hagens (you may have been to one of his exhibits or seen one of his TV shows), seems rather gimmicky to me and possibly expensive, though Roach never says how much it costs. For me, the tissue digestion seems the most 'natural', but I won't be surprised if human compost becomes popular since Roach notes the interest of the general public, many investors and funeral corporations, especially in Scandinavia. However, in the final chapter, I was swayed by the argument that it should be up to those you've left behind to decide what happens to your corpse. Or at least a compromise on what you're all most comfortable with to avoid conflicting moral or religious belief. That's if you have that conversation at all. Many don't, at least not in any real detail.But there's another possibility. Even if you choose a traditional burial, future archealogists may dig up your bones hundreds of years from now and decide to display them in museums around the world. Not much you can do about that. And as I said in the table, a number of cemeteries have been moved or built over, so ""your final resting place"" may not actually be your final resting place. And in a world with finite resources, including the ever-decreasing acres of land in the face of rampant population growth, showing no signs of slowing, this is the most likely scenario. Better to pick something more permanent, if you ask me, or your naked skeleton could be eyeballed by your descendants, without your permission. Informed consent is a tricky thing. In ye olde times, doctors and students took advantage of the poor and while performing surgery on them, did a little unnecessary exploration resulting in 'gratuitous pelvic exams' and 'superfluous appendectomies'. Donated cadavers were so rare that body snatchers were more likely to steal the bodies of the poor because the rich had the money to employ thief prevention techniques. Today, people want to know what will be done to their bodies when they donate it to science, and we should have that right, but the reality is so off-putting that you won't be told. You can only specify what it can't be used for.Roach really takes a sympathetic approach to those that work with cadavers. You can tell she had real difficulty in the first few chapters, coming to terms with her first-hand experiences with the decaying and dismantled dead. Her humour isn't particularly humorous in those moments, because she's clearly uncomfortable and doesn't quite know how to process or write about them. I sympathised. Reading it was discomfiting, being there ... I'm not sure I could've merely observed as Roach did, without running screaming or vomiting my breakfast, especially while smelling the foul stench of decay. I'm fairly certain I could never watch the removal of organs from the beating-heart cadaver. The way it's described, it's too much akin to killing someone, even though you know they're brain dead and will never wake up. It's hard to be judgmental when the author presents a balanced view on all topics. My initial gut reaction regarding a few things was most definitely disgust and horror, but after Roach told the other side of the story, I found some tolerance and understanding beneath the abhorrence. So if you go in with an open mind, you'll be rewarded.I urge everyone to read this book, and to seriously consider the issues therein. It may help you decide what you want to happen to your body after you die. Anything that makes a difficult decision a little easier, is a good thing. An essential, thought-provoking and educational read."

However, author Mary Roach approaches this normally disturbing topic with enthusiasm and crafts a book that manages to be intriguing, gripping, gruesome, and yet hilarious at the same time. In the Alex Award winning book Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, readers will learn how scientists have used human cadavers for over 2,000 years to accomplish a variety breakthroughs, both miraculous and just plain weird. Cadavers were used to test the humaneness of France‚Äôs first guillotines, crucified to verify the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, and shot to determine the effectiveness of military munitions. Cadavers were also the original crash test dummies. In this book, readers will find out whether it really is possible to eat oneself to death, what the weight is of a human soul (three-quarters of an ounce), and how cadaver theft grew into a booming business in the 19th Century. Using wry, gallows humor, Roach convinces readers that cadavers truly are the ultimate ‚Äúsuperheroes.‚Äù They can withstand brutal violence without feeling a thing. While this book is full of bodies, Roach also approaches the human reaction to cadavers and offers a sensitive, almost philosophical look into the role the dead play in the consciousness of the living. Stiff is definitely not a book to miss for any reader who is interested in science, forensics, theology, and of course, corpses."

For more fun facts along these lines, do delve into ""Stiff"". I give this book two stars because apparently I am so morbid that this book didn't really bring anything new to the table. I might even have read it before, although I don't think so. It's just that the themes have cropped up in a lot of other things I've read and seen. This book absolutely did not live up to expectations. I expected far more detailed scientific facts and what I got was sensationalim.If you are want to know how a body decays, the sordid history of acquiring human bodies for dissections by anatomists in the 19th century, how many seconds a head retains sensory after decapitation, a number of horrible animal experiments, how to stay fresh after death, the numerous ways cadavers can be used in science - do read this book. If you're of a morbid inclination and above - say - 25 years old, little in this book will be news. The author tries to lighten up the contents with humour. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Not being in a particularly jolly mood myself while reading this, the attempts at light-heartedness annoyed me. But hey, that's just me. You might enjoy it. "

This is really good if you have a grotesque sense of humor. Did you know that human brains most closely resemble those of a 6 month old Jersey Cow? Recommended for readers who are interested in any area of the Medical field, people considering donating their bodies to science and anyone who enjoys forensic fiction such as Kathy Reichs,Tess Gerritsen or Patricia Cornwell"

It's about all the kinds of research that cadavers are used for, and if it has a greater purpose than run and find out, it's to encourage people to donate their bodies to research when they die.I love Roach's narrative voice; I love the way she wanders off on tangents. I love her endless curiosity and her journalist's ability to ask embarrassing or awkward questions without flinching. Or, without flinching much.Also, for once, I whole-heartedly recommend the audiobook. The reader has a flat, dry, deadpan delivery that suits the book perfectly. Usually, I yell at audiobook readers. This time I giggled."
