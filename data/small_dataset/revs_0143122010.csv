0,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4671027-miquixote,1,"Breathtakingly mindless for 2/5 of the book, blowhard the whole way through.Sometimes a good joke is more revealing than 800 pages of blowhardness. Pinker gives himself away with this quote by George Carlin on page 622: I think motivation is overrated. You show me some lazy prick who's lying around all day watching game shows and stroking his penis, and I'll show you someone who's not causing any fucking trouble!......I hope I am not the only one who thinks it is not necessarily a good thing to be reduced to lazy pricks watching game shows and stroking our penises...Anybody with a modicum of a background in anthropology, history, sociology and economics should be laughimg themselves silly (if it weren't so disturbing how much influence Pinker has)... Pinker proposes 5 ways that have reduced violence and can continue to do so: the Leviathan, Gentle Commerce, Feminization, The Expanding Circle, and the Escalation of Reason. The final 3 I have no argument against. But I have issues with the first 2. The state gets a monopoly on violence and capitalism is caricatured as gentle.But there have been moments when violence spiked and recently, so Pinker has to explain it. Pinker conveniently blames Marxism (and leftism in general is caricatured the whole way through) as the singularly destructive ideology of modern times (without acknowledging the dangers of his own classical liberal ideology) and throws in 'a few other individuals' to the mix as the responsibles for the genocides of the 20th century, and the increase in violence in 1960s, 70s, and 80s. Fascism is acknowledged only as the twin of dialectial Marxism. Classical liberalism gets the nod as the ideology that reduces violence (of course Pinker would never admit that classical liberalism is even an ideology though). There is no comprehensive study of how fascism and communism came to be. It is really lazy stretch to say that fascism was just a few flukes of individual psychology, and not give credence to the idea that both fascism and communism came about from the specific conditions of a social system in crisis. Neither is it mentioned that big business actually financed and promoted fascism in Italy and Germany. That would complicate things too much. So, nothing about communism coming into being as a reaction to capitalism... it is simply assumed that capitalism has been an overwhelmingly positive contribution to the world, since 'violence has declined since its advent, minus a few inconvenient peaks of violent wars and genocides' which, as I have already said, he attributes to Marxism and a few accidentally placed crazy individuals. Nothing either about theory, philosophy, economics, anthropology, activism owing anything at all to Marx's ideas. Marx isn't even worth the time of day to Pinker, except as an explanation for violence. This should raise the question, really can any intellectual who tries to analyze the history of modern times be taken seriously if they haven't taken the left seriously? how can you call yourself an intellectual if you just shrug off the whole left side of the policial spectrum as ideological nonsense? So leftism gets all the blame for the bad stuff, but the increased rights that accompanied the 20th century are not attributed at all to leftist ideas or practice. They are accounted for as simply natural by-products of classical liberalism (ie. capitalism). The Expanding Circle of Empathy, the Escalation of Reason and the Feminization of society have nothing at all to do with leftist ideals. Class struggles never happened. Activists weren't leftists, they were classical liberals. These rights eventually became 'common sense'. If there any battles they were set forth by non-violent classical liberals, and always as peacefully as possible. There are plenty of examples of serious breaches of truth here. According to Pinker, Martin Luther King apparently rejected Marx completely. Something patently false: 'King disagreed with Marxist materialism, but he found certain elements of Marxism's economic critiques of capitalism quite insightful' (I May Not Get There With You: the True Martin Luther King, Eric Michael Dyson). In fact, you would be hard-pressed to find any successful activist who doesn't find certain elements of Marxism insightful. But none of that is mentioned here because Pinker is not at an activist, he is status quo, out of touch with reality, pure and simple. It is also fairly embarrassing for Pinker to not acknowledge how far from anything even remotely leftist or Marxist several so-called communist and their undoubtely genocidal regimes were. Something akin to blaming Jesus for the Crusades. It is not said that it is a far more convincing argument that Stalinist Russia and Maoist China were actually STATE-CAPITALIST regimes. And indeed ideological twins of fascism, but not at all in the sense that Pinker argues. But if he tried to go there, his simplistic view of everthing would implode. Most people who rave against communism base their assumptions on secondary sources. It is clear that Pinker hasn't understood Marx (or even remotely leftist politics). As a fairly well-read leftist, it is obvious to me that there hasn't been a communist state to this day, as much as the leaders of those states have claimed to be. Neither is it mentioned how many different interpretaions of communism there are. He lumps the left all together. But if Pinker were to do so honestly, it would be quite a stretch to suggest that leftism is not about equality, freedom and the destruction of totalitarianism, oppression and alienation. In fact, you would think leftism was fascism the way Pinker describes it. Pinker comes across as a reactionary anti-communist suffering from the Red Scare, still inhabiting the frigid mental landscape of the Cold War. But hey, when you are an authority in Harvard, sweeping caricatures and generalizations are allowed. There’s more. According to Pinker, dialectics are simply mysticism and a justification for violent struggle. Class struggle is of course also blown off as mystical dialectical hogwash. Well, that is some feat blowing off dialectics, considering how many of the greatest philosophical works in world in the last 2 centuries have had to deal with the idea of dialectics (because of its intellectual force), but the eminent Steven Pinker waves it off with his magic wand and without anything at all to back it up. He also blows off 'intellectuals' in general because 'they are attracted to extreme ideas'. But he wholly contradicts himself when he proposes the superior intellectual value of classical liberalism. Which of course isn't extreme, it is just the obvious rational choice that doesn't even need to be intellectually defended. How arrogant can you get?It's also fairly wacky when he argues that 'intelligent people overwhelmingly tend to be liberals'. Based on IQ test scores and surveys of people with high scores he concludes that the smartest people are liberals and the other lesser ones are leftists and conservatives. But what about the smartest of the smart (the intellectuals) being attracted to extremes? This should leave you wondering if these arguments are for real? Apparently so.I am not familiar enough with the statistics that Pinker inundates us with to know if 'violence' has actually dropped or not consistently, progressively and continuously throughout history. But our propaganda alarm bells should sound when anyone makes a statement like that. According to Pinker, it is obvious that primitive tribes were the most violent humans ever. I have read some fairly convincing arguments otherwise, but I think it is likely the differences in opinion are going to come in the very definition of violence. The definition of violence by Pinker is dictionary strict, and very limited. Humans sometimes have to fight to survive. Pinker doesn't substantiate any difference in self defense and aggression, justice is mocked, freedom is not even covered. But when class struggle is just vain ideology to him, what can you expect? Neither does he take on the prison industrial complex, although he does acknowledge the importance of caging up of the maximum amount of people that are considered most likely to fight back and apparently thinks it a necessary evil if there are 'a few too many' (as deterrence). Apathy or depression is not even mentioned. But of course if you look it up in a dictionary, violence isn't any of those things.Since only 100,000 have been killed in Iraq(a disputed low-flying number) and there were at least 1,5 million in Vietnam, apparently US foreign policy is getting way more compassionate. Of course nothing is even mentioned of thinly-covered up US intervention all over the world (like in Latin America). An ignorance easily corrected by leafing through books like 'Killing Hope' by William Blum (on the ongoing American holocaust). A book Chomsky says is 'far and away the best book on the subject'. But the book has leftist leanings, and is therefore intellectually irrelevant to a religiously loyal status quoer. Democracy is hailed as a reducer of violence, and justifiably so. However he also has an extremely limited idea of democracy. There is a crisis of democracy right now because of a lack of participation (the Manufacturing of Consent and Public Opinion) and fast-growing awareness of it. What about acknowledging the advent of a type of coercion that creates ignorance, apathy and depression? This is not considered as an element of violence of course. It would even appear to be a positive thing, if it can reduce those violence stats and keep us wanking. Even if certain types of coercion cannot be defined as violence, why not acknowledge it for what it is? As said, Pinker targets ideology as a main cause of violence. When ideologies clash it often creates even more violence. Obviously. But it would seem Pinker is unaware of the current ideology’s potential for violence (and many have argued quite well that it is the main present cause of violence today). Currently the ideology of capitalism is being questioned by a large variety of people (because of its weaknesses). If and when that increases there may just be an increase in violence again, and not only from the Leviathan state that Pinker raves so much about. Of course Pinker would blame the new ideology if that happened, instead of the old one and all its weaknesses that brought it to the conflict. This is ironic because he does spend some time criticizing conservative ideology for its inability to adapt to progressive change. I argue that Pinker betrays exactly that attribute despite his humanist claims. Liberals and conservatives are the only two electable parties (because neither is so different from the other and neither is at all threatening to the current status quo). But for Pinker to have his moral authority he should also be arguing that if capitalism doesn't work well enough or starts to create bigger problems than it solves (ie. environmental destruction and huge gaps in wealth and debt), it is the one that may actually PROPAGATE violence. But then again we might just sit around watching game shows and stroking our penises. If Pinker is right, that would be ideal.Perhaps this can be avoided if the old ideology adapts peaceably. But neither should anyone who analyzes history or anthropology honestly assume that the current ideology is forever. Of course capitalism hasn’t always been there, has only been there for a tiny amount of history, but Pinker sidesteps that. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it. The thing is that a large amount of us aren’t convinced it ain’t broke.But perhaps Pinker’s main point is that we are less likely to adapt violently no matter what the change. Perhaps so, but denying or misunderstanding certain causes of violence (gross inequality and oppression which lead to new ideologies) will not help the matter. The so-called mystical class struggle and violence around the time of Karl Marx and the following century were actually consequences of the inability of capitalism to adapt to its structural weaknesses. If there were enough reforms the violence caused may not have been necessary, or rather it could have convinced the masses it wasn't necessary to challenge the system. However, the inflexibility and fundamentalism of classical liberalism would seem to have actually CAUSED the majority of violent conflicts. One doesn't have to be a Marxist to see that the capitalist system did not adapt appropriately (or peacefully) to the class awareness (or if you prefer inequality awareness) that was developing. Pinker calls 'class awareness' ideology though. A more peaceful adaptation did not come until after World War 2 (with Keynesianism) IN REACTION to THE CLASS AWARENESS. But this has been progressively taken apart since around 1980. The fear of class war retribution has diminished. With the recent austerity measures only being the latest in a series of measures to increase the wealth of the rich at the expense of the middle class and poor. But that doesn't mean that a self-defense type of violence will not develop in the near future if the current system doesn't adapt appropriately (rising homelesseness or unemployment could escalate things). The fact that violence actually went down during the 30s Great Depresssion is almost gleefully mentioned by Pinker though. So there really isn't a guarantee that violence will increase. In fact, it would seem that the elite powers are getting impetus from implementing their austerity measures because of Pinkeresuqe ideas of how non-violent we have become.Anyhow, if Pinker is right and the world is better off being wankers than trouble-makers, then our intellectuals should be the best wankers. And so for that reason a wanker cannot read trouble-making literature, or leftist perspectives, one cannot at least acknowledge their intellectual validity and consider them. Pinker doesn't acknowledge these debates because he is pushing his own ideology, or rather absurdly and falsely pushing the idea of the 'end of ideology' (which is actually a thinly-veiled support for the current neoliberal utopian ideal). One that is as unsustainable and unrealistic as any utopia or ideology. Keep wanking.The book was long and tiresome in many parts, but also very rewarding in the sense that it is an incredibly revealing look at how corrupt and anti-intellectual academics can be. Pinker is arrogant, puffed-up, self-promoting and irresponsible in his ideologizing (ironic isn’t it?) here. In Pinker's mind, it would seem he has earned the right to step right out of his specialty of psychology and linguistics and make sweeping generalizations in anthropology, history, sociology and economics.

1,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,5,"VIOLENCE HAS DECLINED, AND I WILL KICK THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF ANYONE WHO SAYS IT HASN'T Disappointingly, Pinker strikes a slightly less confrontational tone than that, but the basic idea is the same. His thesis is that violence of every kind, from international warfare down to murder and corporal punishment, has been on a steady decline throughout human history, up to and including the present day – and not only does he make this case in considerable detail, but he goes on to give a very wide-ranging discussion of possible political and psychological causes for what's happened. This book is big, and it needs to be: it's built around a vast accumulation of raw evidence. Historical, statistical, sociological, neurobiological, and anecdotal – and I'm slightly confused by some of the negative reviews here, because although you might not like all of his conclusions, it's not easy to argue with the facts when they're laid out in this much detail. Not convinced? Wondering if village life in the 30s can really have been as bad as dodging rapists in today's inner cities? Well, prepare for approximately 8,266 graphs and charts proving you wrong in every direction. Leafing through them is at first daunting, then fascinating, then astonishing, and eventually wearying. But they keep coming!  The decline in some forms of violence is so dramatic that the figures have had to be plotted on a logarithmic scale, so vertiginous is their descent. Hitting kids – gone from normal to unacceptable in barely a generation. Murder rates? Dropping like a knackered lift. Paedophiles and child abduction? Statistically speaking, if you wanted your child to have a better-than-average chance of being abducted and held overnight by a stranger, ‘you'd have to leave it outside unattended for 750,000 years’. Terrorism, surely? Nope; in fact ‘the number of deaths from terrorist attacks is so small that even minor measures to avoid them can increase the risk of dying’ – one study suggests that 1,500 more Americans died in the year after 9/11 because they started driving rather than flying. Okay then, what about WAR. ‘As of May 15, 1984, the major powers of the world had remained at peace with one another for the longest stretch of time since the Roman Empire.’ This is important, because inter-state warfare is much, much more deadly than the small-'n'-nasty invasions and civil wars that are more common today. And even they are becoming less frequent and less individually deadly. Don't get me wrong, this is not a happy-clappy book about mindless optimism, and he is assiduous in stressing that the situation could easily change. The point is not that we have entered an Age of Aquarius in which every last earthling has been pacified forever. It is that substantial reductions in violence have taken place, and it is important to understand them.Pinker takes a good, long look at several possibilities, and (to my mind at least) identifies three major factors behind the decline. The first is the growth of democracy, which strongly correlates with lower rates of violence across the board, and we get the figures to prove it. The second is the revolution in communications, firstly during the Enlightenment, and then more recently with the birth of the mass media age. Again, huge numbers of studies are adduced to make the point. The third factor is what he calls ‘feminization’: women are just less violent than men, and the more involved they are in a society the more peaceful it is. ‘We are all feminists now,’ he concludes, after a typically detailed examination of changing attitudes to, and rights of, women through history. (He is talking about the West here, but even elsewhere the trend is unmistakeable.) Studies suggest that this is not just a consequence of changing attitudes, but a cause of them, particularly given that ‘the one great universal in the study of violence is that most of it is committed by fifteen-to-thirty-year-old men.’ Pinker hones in on the obvious implications: Would the world be more peaceful if women were in charge? The question is just as interesting if the tense and mood are changed. Has the world become more peaceful because more women are in charge? And will the world become more peaceful when women are even more in charge? The answer to all three, I think, is a qualified yes. When he's finished considering social movements and political changes, he pokes inside your brain. We have pages and pages of various neuro-sociological experiments where people were strapped to an MRI machine and told to slap a puffin in the face, or something, so that various lobes and cortexes could be identified and examined. The question is whether there are anatomical, or evolutionary-psychological, causes for violence, and if so how easily they can be overcome. We get a lot of impressive-looking diagrams like this (I may have remembered some of the details wrong): Pinker is very interesting on the Flynn Effect, which, if you're not aware of it, is the upward trend in general intelligence observed around the world in standardised testing since such things began. Many people that have written on this subject are skeptical that folk nowadays can really be smarter than anatomically-identical humans of a few generations ago, despite what the tests say – but Pinker, after a careful examination of how thought processes are influenced by changing social norms, is not afraid to draw his conclusions, at least in the ethical sphere:The other half of the sanity check is to ask whether our recent ancestors can really be considered morally retarded. The answer, I am prepared to argue, is yes. Though they were surely decent people with perfectly functioning brains, the collective moral sophistication of the culture in which they lived was as primitive by modern standards as their mineral spas and patent medicines are by the medical standards of today. Many of their beliefs can be considered not just monstrous but, in a very real sense, stupid.Obviously we are into speculative territory here, but I actually found it very heartening and thought-provoking to see someone prepared to follow the evidence that far. How's it written? His style is exact without being dense, although he is not averse to the odd cliché (‘capital punishment itself was on death row’), and from time to time his desire to cloak the science in colourful imagery leads him into some awkward prose:The age distribution of a population changes slowly, as each demographic pig makes its way through the population python.Yikes. Also…and this may sound like a weird thing to pick up on, but once I noticed it I couldn't take my eyes off it…he is absolutely obsessed with telling the reader to ‘recall’ things he's already said. Recall the mathematical law that a variable will fall into a power-law distribution…Recall from chapter 3 that the number of political units in Europe shrank…Recall that there were two counter-Enlightenments…Recall that the statistics of deadly quarrels show no signature of war-weariness.…and recall that duelling was eventually laughed into extinction.Recall that the chance that two people in a room of fifty-seven will share a birthday is ninety-nine out of a hundred.England and the United States, recall, had prepared the ground for their democracies…Recall that for half a millennium the wealthy countries of Europe were constantly at each other's throats.Cronin, recall, showed that terrorist organizations drop like flies over time…And recall the global Gallup survey that showed…Recall that narcissism can trigger violence…Recall that the insula lights up when people feel they have been shortchanged…Patients with orbital damage, recall, are impulsive…Recall from chapter 3 the theory of crime…Just how much stuff are you expecting me to remember, Pinker?! And surely someone who wrote three books on language has a fucking thesaurus handy? There are a couple of minor errors, too, that an editor should have caught. The Polish city of Wrocław is printed in my edition as ‘Wroctaw’; and he also refers to some statistics gathered in the ‘town of Kent’ (there are dozens of towns in Kent, which in the dataset concerned is a county).However, and despite my sometimes flippant tone in this review, the truth is that I thought this was a magnificent book – convincingly argued and truly multidisciplinary, so that I felt like I was getting a synthesis of the important studies carried out in half a dozen different fields. It's a big, serious argument that deserves proper consideration, and one that'll give you some ammo to argue back next time you're feeling cynical about the relentless news headlines. I think it's a clear 4.5 – and since Goodreads won't let me do that, I'm inclined to bump it up rather than down."
2,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"The Skeptic’s PeacePinker warns the reader upfront that the book is huge, and with more than 800 dense pages there is no question about it. It is so wide-ranging that it is fortunate it has such a memorable title - the reader might have easily lost track of where it is all supposed to be heading. Individually, any single section of the book is a throughly entertaining masterpiece, but as a whole, in terms of coherence, and on how the thesis and the direction of the arguments hold together, the book is not as much of a delight. But it is an ambitious book and is in some respects a new sort of history - almost a moral history of the world and Pinker deserves praise for the attempt. The next such historian to come along has been given much to work with.Pinker is very convincing about the fact that violence has indeed declined; he is even persuasive on why it was but bound to happen. But when it comes to explaining the phenomenon (which he spends most of the book convincing us is real) based on his strength (psychology and evolutionary biology), he comes up slightly short. Pinker says all the right things and spares no punches and doesn’t flinch from taking on the worst arguments the critics might throw at him but his arguments still seem to lack that knockout blow.This is not to say that the arguments are weak. Pinker does a remarkable job in his survey of history, of stats and of a multitude of ideas. The scholarship is immaculate, the intentions are noble and the conclusions are plausible but I would still wager that Pinker would fail to convince the majority of his readers. Why? Because he ignores the contingent nature of history and he forgets that the 'better angels' has not only made us a more moral society but has also made us a more skeptical society. I was disappointed that Pinker does not explore the preventive powers of sheer skepticism. My own thesis, which was evolving as I read Pinker’s, is ultimately that the skeptical mentality is what the ‘civilizing process’ (and the years of bloody wars) has ultimately given us - a conviction that there are no easy answers, no ‘final solutions’. And that is a powerful deterrent to most forms of drastic action, since now it is harder to justify them. This to me is the real cause for optimism (of the measured and skeptical sort, as is our wont now). "
3,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,1,"This seems like a stunning misstep by the normally brilliant Steven Pinker. His ability to write with extraordinary force and clarity has been demonstrated repeatedly in two separate areas of expertise -- linguistics and cognitive science. Unfortunately, the brilliance of his earlier books in those areas is nowhere in evidence in this regrettable dog's breakfast of a book. I found it almost unreadable - poorly argued, undisciplined, self-indulgent, and - despite its grotesquely bloated length (800 pages) - support for its main thesis is woefully inadequate, dependent on a highly selective interpretation of existing data and completely unconvincing. Pinker can sling the statistical jargon (Poisson processes, power laws, the gambler's fallacy, the Gini coefficient) like a pro, but all the jargon in the world cannot make up for his recurrent habit of over- or mis-interpreting data whose limitations he consistently glosses over. The jacket cover breathlessly promises ""more than a hundred graphs and maps"". Any graph is open to misinterpretation. Three of the most common ways of doing so are (i) selective interpretation (ignoring or explaining away the data that don't fit one's preconceived ideas) (ii) inappropriate extrapolation beyond the range of available data and (iii) failure to acknowledge the data's limitations, such as likely sources of bias, or extreme sparsity of information. Pinker commits each of these errors, with such numbing frequency that one loses all respect. We are seriously asked to draw conclusions from a graph of the ""rate of battle deaths in state-based armed conflicts between 1900 and 2005"" (Figure 6-1) while being instructed to ignore the figures for the first and second world wars. After all, ""the world has seen nothing close to that level since"". This kind of rubbish insults the intelligence. Or you could look at Figure 7-28. Lest you be distracted by the actual data, Pinker has helpfully superimposed some very impressive looking solid lines documenting his cheerful belief in the rise of vegetarianism. These are much darker than the actual data points, presumably in the hope that the reader might be distracted from noting their complete lack of fit to the data. Worried about racially motivated killing of black people? Here are the yearly data (number of such killings) from 1996 to 2008:5,3,3,4,3,3,3,4,1,2,1,1,1Pinker's gleeful trumpeting of a five-fold reduction seems to rest on a pretty flimsy foundation to me. Not to mention being a little premature. But nothing as inconvenient as facts, or their absence, can stand in the way of a man who has already decided he knows the answer. The threat of nuclear holocaust? Exaggerated, because - as any fool can see - nuclear weapons have never been used in wartime since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. One imagines this argument must be of great comfort to those who survived those particular ""anomalies"". Just as Pinker's breezy insistence that the only meaningful way to interpret the number of people killed in a given conflict is relative to the world's population at the time is surely meaningless to anyone who has lost a family member in battle. It's at best breathtakingly insensitive; some would find it deeply offensive. To anyone who respects the scientific method, this is a horrifyingly bad book, one which completely obliterates Pinker's credibility. Don't waste your time."
4,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,1,"When an academic steps outside his or her field of expertise, it's best to brace yourself for a torrent of nonsense. Steven Pinker, whose work in linguistics and psychology I greatly enjoy, has made a habit of using that work as a springboard to foist his pet political theories on the public. Whereas his previous attempt in The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature was a vehicle for his ideological ramblings, it was at least not based on a gaping statistical flaw and had some value in refuting common misconceptions, even if it did so in a fundamentally dishonest way.Whatever redeeming qualities to be found in Better Angels are far outweighed by the failure of Pinker's thesis. Has violence actually declined? If not, the rest is window dressing. Pinker quickly notes that the reader will be skeptical of his thesis off the bat -- we are inclined to believe the world is getting more violent due to our constant exposure to it in the media, which is biased toward reporting bad news, criminality, etc. No doubt he is correct in this. It is well known that crime rates in the United States have been in decline for the past 20-30 years yet many continue to believe that crime is on the rise. This likely comes from a bit of selective reporting mixed with confirmation bias; the proverbial man searching for his keys under the streetlight.The main reason I was immediately skeptical about this thesis was that I had seen it before! The general thrust of Pinker's argument appears in a brief section in The Blank Slate and a TED talk he adapted that into a few years back. (http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinke...) Here he totally mangles basic anthropology and archaeology. The chart he presents is a misinterpretation of data from Lawrence Keeley's War Before Civilization -- anyone familiar with the societies he presents knows that most of them are not nomadic hunter-gatherer bands but partly or fully sedentary and horticulturalist, e.g., the Gebusi and Yanomamo. (As an aside, I find the use of Keeley ironic as he argues against a biological view of warfare in the book while Pinker is an ardent supporter of this view.) Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha devote an entire section to deconstructing this Sex at Dawn: The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality (a book not without its own problems, as Ryan and Jetha play Rousseau to Pinker's Hobbes). (An adapted excerpt can be found here: http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/s...) Using modern hunter-gatherer societies (or at least what Pinker thinks are hunter-gatherer societies) as stand-ins for pre-historic societies is a rookie mistake. The degree to which modern hunter-gatherers have been displaced and influenced by industrial societies and nation-states has been one of the big debates over the last half-century in anthropology. Thus, whether they are representative of some ""state of nature"" at all is highly questionable. (See this brief summary of the ""hunter-gatherer revisionist debate"" by Thomas N. Headland for an overview and references: http://www.sil.org/~headlandt/huntgat...) Pinker notes this at one point but then completely forgets about it in taking his own cooked numbers at face value.Even if we accept Pinker's definition of violence, the whole undertaking itself is an exercise in guesswork and absurdity. There were no census programs or bureaus of statistics throughout much of history. Written records of war often inflate or deflate the body count depending on whose side you're reading from (and as we know, winners write the history books) and the archaeological record is spotty in a large number of places. Perhaps we can get fairly accurate body counts here and there, but there are large swaths of history that we essentially have to just guess at. Fortunately, the good folks at Quodlibeta, actual historians, have broken down a good deal of the historical and statistical flaws in the book (starting here): http://bedejournal.blogspot.com/2011/...Considering he has been ""refining"" this argument since The Blank Slate (read: futilely polishing a turd), Pinker seems unlikely to back down. His FAQ released to ""respond"" to criticism completely dodges the fact that he's pulled a good deal of his numbers straight from his nether region. (See Quodlibeta again for an appropriately snarky take-down: http://bedejournal.blogspot.com/2011/...) At some point, it begins to stretch credulity that he doesn't realize there's a hole big enough to drive an eighteen-wheeler through in this argument. (This does, however, make the book a useful litmus test to see which critics will gush how ""thoroughly researched, amply documented, and strongly argued"" something is as long as you flash a few fancy charts 'n graphs and pseudo-intellectual smoke and mirrors their way. Unfortunately, it seems that the answer is ""A whole lot of them."")Once you realize the entire book is a house of cards that's more or less already collapsed, the rest of it becomes an incredible grind. As above, the rest is just window dressing, a game of make believe. Sure, there's some interesting parts about, say, the psychology of aggression and a few delicious nuggets and tidbits of trivia along the way. Digging through the rough for them seems a rather pointless exercise, though, especially where it's already been done better. Large chunks of his argument are recycled from other authors such as Peter Singer and Lynn Hunt.The end result is a whiggish history where sense and nonsense blend together seamlessly, thus negating any use the layperson might find in it. The presentation of history too often crosses into the cartoonish, being loaded down with ad hoc theorizing deployed to save the book's overarching narrative. Pinker's goal is, at base, to push his ideology, his own brand of secular humanism he claims to be based in ""Enlightenment values."" It is an ideology whose values I happen to largely share, but history demonstrates that anything can be taken too far. This is why Pinker is forced to downplay or omit the excesses of the Enlightenment such as the French Revolution with its Jacobins and Cult of Reason.The irony here is that Pinker reveals himself to be as much of a romantic as his ideological opponents. The doomsayers appeal to a mythical past to buttress their claims (Arthur Herman has written an amusing account of this phenomenon in The Idea of Decline in Western History), but the optimists of modernity similarly appeal to a mythical future. While the notion that the kids these days are just rotten and the world is going to hell in a hand-basket has been with us for millennia, one of the central narratives of modernity has been a belief in a steady incline. With an increasingly global economy and the inevitable advance of science and technology, the high priests of modernity preach time and again, we are surely on our way to the best of all worlds. Predicting the future direction of humanity, though, has proven to be a fool's game, a bit of off-track betting for the intellectual class.While Pinker never commits to this teleological narrative wholesale, he does bang the drum for the steady march of progress quite a bit throughout the book. Obviously, while I don't pine for the days of King Cotton or colonial Africa, I don't find much comfort in the fact that while the number of debt and sex slaves has exploded in absolute numbers, their proportion of the total population has decreased. Oh, how marvelous!What Bjorn Lomborg did for environmental issues, Pinker has done for the history of violence."

The bad: everything else.How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Conquistadors:“Though imperial conquest and rule can themselves be brutal, they do reduce endemic violence among the conquered” (56).P opens with some good, old-fashioned, crappy anthropology. After all, if he’s going to argue that we’ve become kinder gentler people, he needs to lump all pre-state societies into the trashheap of the violent.He’s mostly inspired by the Napoleon Chagnon crew, which means portraying indigenous people as nasty and brutish (and side-stepping consent/ethics guidelines).P loves broad statements about very diverse people. He says of all non-state people “In their theory of causation there is no such thing as a natural death” (137). There is a singular “they,” with a “theory.” Or: “Herders all over the world cultivate a hair trigger for violent retaliation.” I've studied pastoralists, find them to be escape artists from violent confrontation. Some live rough lives and some are gentle and egalitarian. This kind of world-wide smear is something you can do when you’re talking about people who aren’t Harvard academics, and can’t take you to task for what you’re saying.His methods for tallying war deaths are shoddy and insane, and all the non-state societies he looks at are are on the edge of states, dealing firsthand with imperial violence.He's constantly flirting with eugenicist narrations -- the Yanomami and the Maori are just genetically more violent, while white europeans maybe are genetically gentler. Forgive me for chuckling when he then shudders that genocide is ""unthinkable"" and warns against ""“The cognitive habit of treating people as instances of a category.""(His lust after the leviathan also pushes him to show that in Nazi Germany the one-on-one homicide rates continued to decline (79). I mean, if you ignore the mass-murdering part.)Hatin’ on the Poors:The Civilizing Process, which gave us table manners and non-violence, “never fully penetrated” two zones: “the lower strata of the socioeconomic scale, and the inaccessible or inhospitable territories of the globe” (81). Ergo, violence comes from the poor and far-flung (though it’s worth asking, while we’re at it, “inaccessible” and “inhospitable” to whom? The board rooms on Wall Street are inaccessible and inhospitable to me, but I assume that’s not who he’s talking about).Proof that the lower classes were vicious comes from the fact that terms for poor people were synonymous with viciousness. Epithets are proof of that minority is bad, not proof of some messed-up discrimination.Racism is a thing of the past, says P, before he says a bunch of racist shit.Like: white people might just have better genes for “maturity and self-control” (121). Cities became peaceful because “tourists and young, urban professionals recolonized downtowns,” replacing those nasty, poor brown people (117). Uneasily I see him dividing up crime rates between “whites” and “blacks,” to show that any increase in crime is just because “lower-income African Americans were effectively stateless, relying on a culture of honor (sometimes called ‘the code of the streets’) to defend their interests” (98).What’s the most effective way to end this violence? “putting more men behind bars for longer stretches of time” (121). Because “Imprisonment physically removes the most crime-prone individuals from the streets, incapacitating them and subtracting the crimes they would have committed from the statistics” (122). Don’t worry about the ways that prison might breed violence or is itself violent.P repeatedly refers to poor and brown people as living in a state of “anarchy,” without the benefits of belonging to a State. This despite the fact that the poor and brown actually tend to come up against the state far more frequently than others. They bear the bruises from the state on their bodies. They are put behind bars at insane rates, they are physically deported, they are forced by the state to jump through hoops to get basic goods like sufficient food, healthcare, and housing. The wealthy, with their off-shore tax havens, are far more stateless than the poor.In a global perspective, P puts out a map showing how poor countries have the most “sites of conflict.” He doesn’t ever mention that when a rich country is aggressive against a poor one, naturally the conflict will be fought out on the soil of the poor country. Any counter-attack is, after all, “terrorism,” not the same thing as the gentlemanly war we’re waging on them. The air bases in Nevada from which direct their remote-controlled armed drones are not “sites of conflict.”Also, extra gross points when he’s reasserting that “European governments may have brutalized the natives when conquering a colony and putting down revolts, but they generally had a fairly well-functioning police, judiciary, and public-service infrastructure. And while they often had their pet ethnic groups, their main concern was controlling the colony as a whole, so they enforced law and order fairly broadly” (307). Pet ethnic groups. Well-functioning police. No, no way did he say this.But as P shows, racism is only natural. Babies are racist, after all (523).And Sexism:“We’re all feminists now,” says the man who’s never been a feminist (404).Evolutionary psychology folks like P are quick to jump into gender-essentializing, and redescribe sexist shit as being biologically mandated. Reading this book helped explain why P hurried to the defense of Harvard pres. Larry Summers when he suggested that women weren’t in math and sciences because of their woman-brains. He reiterates it in this book -- “most labor economists consider these sex differences to be a contributor to the gender gap in earnings and professional success” (517).The book is full of men-are-from-mars-etc. claptrap, usually in a form that is totally unnecessary, and without caveats. “Men fantasize about copulating with bodies, women fantasize about making love to people” (405), says this expert on your fantasies. He later cites a study showing that when you compare people who have done a will-power-depleting task and people who haven’t, and then ask them if they are likely to have sex with someone, will-power-depleted men are the most likely to say yes. Ergo, such differences are natural, and men are the ones who have to exercise self-control to live in the civilized world. Women, on the other hand, these natural gatekeepers, are just inherently sexually inhibited. (604)He also claims that biologically, males are Cads or Dads, and explains the differences between the rapists and nice guys as exhibiting these two evolutionary strategies. He explores the evolution of sexual jealousy and the drive to rape, concluding that because it’s because of a prioritizing of evolutionary fitness that in no society do women obsess over the virginity of gooms (397). He will never concede that this might have something to do with social power, rather than reproduction, and so has nothing to say about the raping of little boys or prepubescent girls. Men just naturally can’t see “abrupt unsolicited sex with a stranger to be repugnant rather than appealing” (405). Apparently, men would all love to be raped.Women don’t like to be raped, according to P, because evolutionarily we’re designed to want to produce fit children, and we experience “agony” when that principle is violated (398). It’s not the pain and coercion and weight of the cultural baggage -- it’s our hope for kids that win at evolution. P pooh-poohs the feminist responses to rape which point out how power is at play, and not simply lust (406). This ""preposterous"" claim is just a Marxist penchant to explain all phenomenon as a struggle for power between groups. And with an extra boost of smarm, he corrects us: “But if I may be permitted an ad feminam suggestion, the theory that rape has nothing to do with sex may be more plausible to a gender to whom a desire for impersonal sex with an unwilling stranger is too bizarre to contemplate” (406). The upswing of all this Marxist feminism is the “campus rape bureaucracy” won’t give the young ladies good advice about dressing modestly and behaving yourself at parties so others can’t take advantage of you (406). “Because of the sacred belief [that rape isn’t the victim’s fault], rape counselors foist advice on students that no responsible parent would ever give a daughter” (406).Bullshit like this makes me want to enforce Jill Filipovic’s suggestion: “if conservative and anti-feminist men continue to argue that women’s very public presence enables men to assault them, then perhaps they’re the ones who should be pressured to stay home.”He’ll also throw out some great lines like “men are more likely to find themselves at the receiving end of racism” (525). No really, there was a Study.Progress Comes from People like Steve Pinker:Why did people begin to believe in human kindness? Well: they just started thinking hard about it (180). And of course the ones thinking were the privileged, white, male thinkers. they’re the ones who made us play nice. Our distaste for slavery is owed to William Wilburforce, not Harriet Tubman. P is, incidentally, one of these people, using his thoughts to move us all toward progress.Even when he concedes that some popular movements have been beneficial, that is because of some Great Man who led them, and that great man got the idea from the Great Books (he actually goes through MLK’s philosophical reading list) (479).This is also where P shows his (anti-Marxist) Hegelian stripes: what the little people do is meaningless -- we can only hope they catch up to the civilizing power of these beautiful white brains.Adjusting all violence to per-capita:It’s undisputed that more people are being killed, but your chance of being killed as a random person in the world is arguably reduced.It’s an interesting question whether rates or amounts are more important. It’s possible to ask: could it just be that at a certain point it’s too difficult to keep up with birthrates when it comes to killing others? We just don’t have the technologies to do away with people as quickly as new ones are created -- is this progress if so?But the bigger question for me is how this prioritizes mass populations. If there is a small tribe wiped out through genocide, that is still just as horrible as it would be if there were fewer people. Wiping out a village in a dirty war is still wiping out a village, even though New York exists.What it comes down to is that P could show how the Aztec empire had a low death-through-violence rate, and a neighboring tribe had a high rate, and say See states are more peaceful. When what actually happened is the State massacred the tribe.(A Utah senator once argued that being gay was bad because you were more likely to be murdered -- instead of concluding that being homophobic is bad because you’re more likely to murder.)Making meaning and meaninglessness:P can't edit his arguments down -- he's writing 800 pages, after all, everything in!Like: remember that Dr. Seuss story, where a man was “nearly beheaded for being unable to remove his hat in the presence of the king”? Now that’s violent.Or: Let me tell you why the 60’s was so violent with this Wikipedia quote about that wild party. Also quoted in the Wikipedia quote is “[citation needed]” (113).I mean, come on, you're not even moving these to a footnote?But P will find his argument anywhere. I had heard of Lewis Fry Richardson before as a kind of tragically comic figure, who tried to figure out the mathematics of war and got nowhere. But P finds this positively instructive: he couldn’t figure out a mathematical formula for war, ergo: war is random. So if we’ve had the most destructive wars in history in the last century, well, that’s all chance, that was bound to happen sometime (207). Our current episodes of violence, like the 20th century wars, are just RANDOM occurrences. Some decade had to be the bloodiest, after all! But all the other violence? It has REASONS. (191)World War II and the holocaust were basically just the doing of one bad apple. Take away Hitler and viola, peace and understanding (249). Hitler is credited with possessing magical powers to make people behave badly. This can of course be a comforting thought -- you no longer have to hold everyone else to any responsibility (so what if the churches and the social clubs all happily participated? they were hypnotized into it by the dashing Hitler). This also fits with his outdated Great Man theory of history.He’ll strain to create patterns out of scant data, and when the obvious patterns don’t fit (like, suppose that war has, over time, claimed the lives of more and more people. Suppose the very most deadly wars came after the Enlightenment enlightened us and most players were “democracies”) -- then he’ll spend pages and pages kneading the statistics into chaos, until he can say: “The two world wars were, in a sense, horrifically unlucky samples from a statistical distribution that stretches across a vast range of destruction.” (222)And maybe he’s right, but if so, every murder is a horrifically unlucky sample also, and he’s severely compromised his attempts to make tidy morals to the story.His data is also unconvincing when he’s talking about the revolution in animal rights. He basically tells us to look at all that faux-meat at the supermarket. If he were to track the number of animal killings or meat consumption anywhere in the world, we clearly wouldn’t be very optimistic, and so he ignores those numbers and instead tracks how many films harmed their animal actors.And about cooking the booksWhen he’s trying to make the case that democracies are less warlike, he sets up a very careful statistical analysis. And then he just throws in that for these statistics, any conflict will be attributed to the “less democractic” country in the conflict. P is living in a belligerent democratic country that is currently and historically creating wars with “less democratic” countries. I’m completely in support of democracy, but this ain’t no Norway fighting Germany. How could he feasibly have written these paragraphs without worry that he was cooking the data? How could his editors and readers have feasibly let him get away with this? Isn’t it better to admit that some democracies can be warmongering, and do some hard thinking to figure out why that is, rather than just wash it of responsibility?Love affair with enlightenment and capitalismHe finally gets to his real argument, which is that capitalism is peace. We don’t bomb the Japanese because they made my minivan. He says the good arguments for this are “sure to leave leftists speechless.” Ha ha, remember when we used to call capitalists ""merchants of death""? And so if we’re now in corporate-fueled resource wars at the behest of war profiteers -- well, that’s clearly the “less democratic” country’s fault, for not simply handing their resources over to our CEOs to begin with.His love affair with corporatocracy is further clarified when he rejects the United Nations as a “soap box for dictators” and instead promotes IGOs as the answer (289). You might think it’s odd, with his previous assertion that democracy is important for peace, that he would see the future of peace as coming from non-democratic IGOs like the World Bank. But in the end, he only supports “democracy” inasmuch as it supports free-market capitalism, which is the real ultimate goal. The democratic part can be skipped completely if we can get to corporate governance in a faster war.Anything that gets in the way of the free functioning of markets is sure to cause violence. Also, it’s sure to be an ideology. An ideology is a different thing that some people have, particularly if they’re communists, while P and his book are free of ideology (556).He blames communist ideas for Stahlinism and the violence of the 60s, but when he’s up against the violence of the French Revolution, which clearly grew out of his precious Enlightenment ideas, he’ll say, with characteristic smarm, that the connection between the two is “to put it mildly, dubious” (184). “Political murder, massacre, and wars of imperial expansion are as old as civilization, and had long been the everyday stuff of European monarchies.” In other words: shit happens. You can’t blame ideas for that. UNLESS that shit is utopian, and then it’s an “ideology.”Marx can be blamed for Hitler, his “fraternal twin” (343). Sure, Hitler hated Marx, but we have some proof that he read a book by him, and basically the holocaust is just a tweaked class war. They’re both counter-enlightenment doctrine.This is when his ire toward Vietnam comes out. Those “expansionist” jerks only beat us because they had an ideology and so didn’t care about human lives anymore (308). “The American democracy was willing to sacrifice a tiny fraction of the lives that the North Vietnamese dictator was willing to forfeit (no one asked the [Vietnamese] men how they felt about this).” Fortunately, now that they’ve sloughed off most of their ideology, and are instead “commercial” (which is ideology-free terrain), they’re less interested in these “unnecessary wars” and we can all have a little peace.I’ve seen a lot of victim-blaming in my days, but never anything so blatant and disgusting as this.But Marx is to blame for all the anti-communist “reactions” he caused in Indonesia and Latin America (not the democratic and free market US) (343). ""The decline of genocide is the decline of communism” (343), and if those genocidal acts were happening at the behest of US puppet dictators against indigenous communities suspected of harboring communist sentiments, you can’t blame captalism for that. And of course capitalism is in no way to blame for wars of plunder and colonization. Those don’t even happen anymore, anyway. He proves this by showing that countries rich in oil are among the most violent (674) (he ignores the obvious fact that other countries might be trying to plunder their oil).Of course, P would like to find psychological research supporting his idea that people engaging in commerce are less violent. But unfortunately it doesn’t exist. Why? “I suspect that among researchers, gentle commerce is just not a sexy idea” (684). Intellectuals, he concludes, feel too superior to businessmen to actually study the idea.Burying Truth:""In absolute numbers, of course, civilized societies are matchless in the destruction they have wreaked. But --”(47)“Europe’s ability to kill people [through the present] outpaced its ability to breed more of them. But --”(230)“European governments may have brutalized the natives when conquering a colony and putting down revolts, but --”(307).“The law may be an ass, but --”(538)Howard Zinn wrote:“Outright lying or quiet omission takes the risk of discovery which, when made, might arouse the reader to rebel against the writer. To state the facts, however, and then to bury them in a mass of other information is to say to the reader with a certain infectious calm: yes, mass murder took place, but it’s not that important--it should weigh very little in our final judgments; it should affect very little what we do in the world.”"
6,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"In this book, Steven Pinker explores a very controversial thesis, that is, violence is declining. Different types of violence are declining on multiple time scales. It would seem like the twentieth century had some major wars and plenty of genocide to make his thesis sound rather foolish. But in the first seven chapters he shows lots and lots of statistics to back up his thesis. In the eighth and ninth chapters he also explores the scientific reasons for violence and the reasons for increasingly non-violent behavior. The book is very comprehensive--it is quite long and detailed. The first chapters are not particularly ""heavy"" reading, but towards the end of the book, it can be tough-going--but fascinating throughout.Pinker tackles the main objection to his thesis--the three worst dictators of the twentieth century (Hitler, Stalin, Mao) were responsible for an immense amount of violence, deaths and misery. Some of the reviewers here at Goodreads have remarked that Pinker underestimates the number of deaths that are attributable to Mao. Perhaps he did grossly underestimate the numbers--I really don't know.Pinker makes an interesting point about the recent theory, raised in the book Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything, that crime in the United States declined in the past few decades, because of the legalization of abortion in 1973. The idea is that the reduction in unwanted children led to fewer violence-inclined youths. Pinker argues that after 1973, the proportion of children born to vulnerable women actually increased, rather than decreased.One of the reasons for the decline in violence is the increase in literacy and reading. Pinker argues that the transmission of new ideas in books has acted as a liberal force in society. He shows that during the Middle Ages, most people were religious and believed in the literal truth of the bible. Heretics were everywhere, and were persecuted in wars, massacres, pogroms, executions and torture. Nowadays, while religious people ""believe"" in the bible, most do not take such a literal interpretation. They don't think that it is moral to invade a city and kill--or take as slaves--every single person. A higher value is placed on human life, because of the ""shift from valuing souls to valuing lives."" Pinker writes, The theory that religion is a force for peace, often heard among the religious right and its allies today, does not fit the facts of history. Later, he writes, The world has far too much morality. Very true indeed.Pinker shows how game theory plays a big role in the evolution of morality. In fact, he defines morality as the opportunity for positive-sum games. In so much of history, people played in zero-sum or even in negative-sum games. For example, war is usually a negative-sum game, in the sense that so many people die and suffer, that the gains to the victor are completely overwhelmed by the losses to both sides. Nowadays, the language of violence is often cloaked in ""bureaucratese"", in words like purges, deportations, bombardments, pacification, rectification, ethnic cleansing, collateral damage, and rendition. These euphemisms help to self-exculpate the perpetrators of violence, and make violence seem to be justified or involuntary. Pinker discusses in some detail the factors that he believes have led to decreased violence in recent times. He talks a lot about the concept of Leviathan from the book by this name by Thomas Hobbes. According to Pinker, the presence of a legitimate, strong central government helps to reduce violence, at least on a personal basis. People are less inclined to violence when they think that punishment is likely. (Not always true, but usually.) He describes how ""gentle commerce"" helps to ""turn zero-sum warfare into positive-sum mutual profit ... sweetening the outcome of mutual pacifism with the mutual gains of exchange."" Pinker also shows how ""feminization"" has helped to move society ""... away from a culture of manly honor, with its approval of violent retaliation for insults, toughening of boys through physical punishment, and veneration of martial glory.""One of the most interesting--and potentially useful--parts of the book is his analysis of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The root of the problem is that there are so many sacred concepts on both sides. A sacred concept is one that is not subject to negotiation--it is completely off the table. People will not compromise on their sacred values, but they might compromise on so-called ""pseudo-sacred"" values. Pinker describes evidence that both sides might be willing to declare compromises through symbolic concessions, even though they are not actually willing to perform on their compromises. Pinker writes, To find anything that softens the opposition of Israeli and Palestinian fanatics to what the rest of the world recognizes as the only viable solution to their conflict is something close to a miracle. It all has to do with the symbolic framing of a peace agreement.There are certain parts of the book that might make a squeamish reader cringe--there are some short descriptions of barbaric tortures. If you can get through (or skip) those parts, then you will find a fascinating theory developed from the point of view of scientific scholarship--sociology, psychology, and evolutionary biology. As with all of Steven Pinker's writings, this book is fascinating, comprehensive, and sure to be controversial. He has (most of) the facts behind him, and it is difficult to argue against his major points. "
7,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,2,"I love optimistic books, and there is a lot of optimism in the almost 800 pages of ""The better angels of our nature"". At the same time, I find it impossible to give a single opinion about this behemoth of a book, because I found some of its elements truly excellent, some ok, and some absolutely scream-out-loud dreadful. In brief: - the great: the quality of the writing is superb. This is one of the best books I've ever read in terms of clarity of exposition and effectiveness of the writing. Also, at the very beginning the author outlines the structure of the book, which gives you a clear mental map of what you're getting into. As a plus, Pinker peppers his prose with anecdotes, jokes and references to pop culture (a bit like Malcolm Gladwell) that enliven the experience. I know some may not enjoy that. I do.- the good: the analysis of the decrease in violent behavior throughout history is deep and overall fairly convincing. Pinker acknowledges the fact that we are missing a lot of crucial data (about deaths and violence in the past), and he's received a lot of criticism for presenting a thesis that's partially based on guesswork, but I think there is a lot of value in making the layman (like me) think about these topics, and at least in trying to find some general patterns. Some reviewers hated his methodology, or the way he handles some piece of data - all fair. I think it all makes for a healthy discussion.- the not so good: is that Pinker didn't make much of an attempt to present a truly global perspective on the subject: in this book, Western world = The World. China, India, Africa, South America... marginal ""who knows?"" footnotes. ""Religion"" = Christianity. He explains that European history has the most available data, but I'm not the only one to think that he could have made a much better effort in this regard. - the dreadful is where Pinker lets his underlying personal New Atheist agenda seep through without any restraint. Sadly, this lowers the level of the book in many parts to pure tripe, in particular when it comes to the very subjective reasons behind the apparent decrease in violence throughout history. On page 642 Pinker spells out exactly what the main problem with his own book is: ""Even the scientists are piling on. Human beings are led by their passions, say many psychologists, and deploy their puny powers of reason only to rationalize their gut feelings after the fact"". Ironically, that is precisely what he ended up doing with this book. To be clear, this has nothing to do with Pinker's titular argument in favor the decline of violence, which as I said I found fairly convincing and rational. No, Pinker's emotional, irrational underlying argument is the following: 1) Enlightenment humanism, secularism and atheism are the only cultural forces for good in the world. 2) Religions have been purely a destructive, negative force throughout history, therefore our planet will be a much better place when religions have completely disappeared. THAT is where the author's heart is. ""As if biology didn't make things bad enough, the Abrahamic religions ratified some of our worst instincts with laws and beliefs that have encouraged violence for millennia"".Incidentally, I just found out that Pinker and Richard Dawkins are buddies and share the same New Atheist credo. That gave me a sudden bout of nausea... Dawkins, the Grand Master of Missing The Point himself! Watching Pinker zig-zag his way through his own version of world history where religion has caused only mayhem and suffering is like watching a professional skier slalom down through the obstacles. You have to admire his incredible ability to make it through without tripping over every few seconds. For example: in Pinker's world, the ""Rights Revolutions show that a moral way of life requires a decisive rejection of instinct, culture, religion, and standard practice. In their place is an ethics that is inspired by empathy and reason and stated in the language of rights. [ ] This conclusion, of course  [but OF COURSE!],  is the moral vision of the Enlightenment and the strands of humanism and liberalism that have grown out of it. The Rights Revolutions are liberal revolutions"". Under this light, it becomes hard to reconcile and explain how Martin Luther King, perhaps the greatest protagonist in the ""Rights Revolutions"", was a Baptist preacher who dedicated his life to worship, prayer and to following Jesus Christ as a role model. But no worries! Slalomist Pinker turns his skis swiftly and manages to dismiss MLK's adherence to Christianity almost completely! What a feat, ladies and gentlemen!! Here he goes:""MLK, as a graduate student in theology, was, of course, conversant with the Bible and orthodox theology. But he also read renegade theologians such as Walter Rauschenbusch, who criticized the historical accuracy of the Bible and the dogma that Jesus died for people's sins. King then embarked on a serious study of the social and ethical theories of the great philosophers, from Plato and Aristotle down to ... [etc. etc.]."". ""King was profoundly inspired by Gandhi's theory of nonviolent resistance not as a moralistic affirmation of love, as nonviolence had been in the teaching of Jesus"". And now - pay very close attention. After this microscopic cherry-picking, later on, on page 677 comes the master stroke. Here’s how Pinker references his ridiculously insufficient excursus through MLK's cultural influences:""As we saw, Martin Luther King rejected mainstream Christian theology and drew his inspiration from Gandhi, secular Western philosophy, and renegade humanistic theologians"".Wait wait wait ..... we ""saw"" what??? The only thing you said was that he read some books, that is all we ""saw"". We never ""saw"" that MLK ""rejected mainstream Christian theology""! Oh, what a number he just pulled there. Of course, an anti-christian MLK would fit perfectly in Pinker's nice little box. If only it wasn't a complete fabrication! Maybe, if we stretch it a bit, King was a ""liberal Christian"", but still very deeply and fully embracing Christian theology. www.sfgate.com/news/article/Writings-... For King, his Christian faith was far more than a source of soaring rethoric. It was the boundless reservoir of the colossal courage he would need to risk his life day after day. Frankly, I find Pinker's statements about MLK's faith quite offensive. So it is with unbelievably misguided violence (pun intended) that Pinker strips our history of any trace whatsoever of the positive influence of religion and religious people on the world, while focusing only on the stereotypical negative stories (of course, confusing ""religion"" with ""corrupted clergy"").As I said above, what Pinker really means with Religion is Christianity, because it's the only one he keeps referring to, and he doesn't seem to know much at all about Hinduism or Buddhism. ""Very little good has come from these ancient tribal dogmas. [List of stereotypical pub-banter-level bad things that the Church did] Defenders of religion claim that the two genocidal ideologies of the 20th century, fascism and communism, were atheistic. But the first claim is mistaken and the second irrelevant"". Pinker is often leaving rationality aside to go FANTASTICALLY off the rails like this. Aside from the fact that he is clearly wrong, what is even the point of this argument? What value does a defense of atheism bring to this book? Pinker then constructs a couple of sentences aimed at resolving and clarifying why he has chosen to completely ignore religion in the 800 pages of ""The better angels of our nature"":""Religion plays no single role in the history of violence because religion has not been a single force in the history of anything. [Says the erudite expert on religion, as we have just seen] The vast set of movements that we call religions have little in common but their distinctness from the secular institutions that are recent appearances on the human stage"". Ok. So, let me get it straight: you find it reasonable to metaphorically piss on 100% of what goes under ""religion"" because you say it's always been so diverse and multifaceted that its overall impact on history is, in the end, completely irrelevant? There is no fundamental golden rule, no consolidated drive for empathy and compassion, no focus on respect for human life across the main religions? The declaration of Human Rights has been inspired exclusively by Enlightenment humanism, and not at all by Christian values? You are actually using the horrors committed by a small part of the clergy to invalidate all the positive messages of religion and, more importantly, the useful and positive initiatives that most religious institutions pursue throughout the world (and very rarely make it to the news - like these www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/17/100...) ?After these statements, it's not surprising that the author forgets to articulate how ""secular ideas"" possess this ideal quality of being ""a single force in the history of something"" that religions do not have. As if everyone who was ever inspired by secular ideas behaved in the same way and went exactly in the same direction - the BEST direction, of course. Here Pinker goes on to perform some more professional skiing to get around other obstacles, like the excesses of the French Revolution, Cult of Reason etc., at the risk of losing his pants: I thought people who kill, or in general use violence, do it in the name of anything at all: good, bad, old, new, religious beliefs, political beliefs, and science- or reason-based beliefs (a small example: the interpretation of Darwinism by the Columbine killers).More in general, I wonder: was it really that difficult for Pinker to admit that all types of cultural movements, religious and non-religious, have been influencing each other and impacting the history of violence in many different ways? Why did he need to defend secular ideologies as if they'd never been the inspiration for violence or violent acts? And why did he pinpoint all these cultural movements as a cause ""in themselves"" for violence and war? How would communism IN ITSELF or atheism IN ITSELF or Christianity IN ITSELF cause atrocities and wars? They are ideas: words on paper. None of these ideas was ever a specific order to commit atrocities. I've always thought that, in reality, bad or deranged people are the ones who read those words and bend them to their basic, animal desires. But again, Pinker is a human being himself, and each human being needs to worship something - we are powered by emotions, not by reason. As much as he tries to tackle this immense subject with pure rationality, his personal opinions come through loud and clear and crash to a pulp any of his efforts to sound objective and fully rational. So, in the end, to go back to the main official thesis of this book: violence has probably decreased, overall. We can talk forever about the type of statistics used by Pinker in this book, but it seems he could be right, and I hope he is. As for the reasons behind the decrease, as discussed, Pinker gets irrational about it, for understandable reasons (his wife). Here is his own explanation from his website: "" It was only through the intellectual influence of my wife, the philosopher and novelist Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, that I understood the logic connecting them. She explained to me how morality can be grounded in rationality, and how secular humanism is just a modern term for the world view that grew out of the Age of Reason and the Enlightenment (in particular, she argues, from the ideas of Spinoza). To the extent that the decline of violence has been driven by ideas, it’s this set of ideas, which I call Enlightenment humanism, which has driven it, and it offers the closest thing we have to a unified theory of the decline of violence"". A crucial passage here is ""To the extent that the decline of violence has been driven by ideas"". No one knows how much this is! It could be 0.2%! But Pinker certainly thinks the history of ideas has been much more impactful on reality than what it actually has been. This is a common misjudgement of academics: many of them tend to give far too much practical importance to ideas, books and cultural movements, and too little to money and power. If violence has decreased, I see no evidence that the decrease has been directly and mainly caused by the advent of the Enlightenment ideas, as Pinker is trying to convince us with this book. Those ideas were certainly a big piece of the puzzle, a great inspiration, just like many other ideas have been a positive inspiration. But fundamentally, I think what needs to be credited most of all is: military technology, increased wealth and global commerce, a change in the cost / profit scenarios of violence, the increased spread of information, and therefore better risk assessment tools.--------------------------Here is a good book that quietly destroys the myth of Enlightenment perfection: ""In defense of Faith"", by David Brog Here are some interesting articles that talk about Pinker's world view:On his view of scientism:http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013...On his New Atheist credo:http://www.patheos.com/blogs/scienceo...On his (mis)understanding of religion:http://bedejournal.blogspot.com/2008/..."
8,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1931383-faruk-ahmet,1,"Loathing is the word. It infuriated me. You'd think that after all these years one would stop being surprised by this style of typical new-atheist/liberal argumentation but when I see this much cherrypicking, oversimplification, handwaving and western supremacism shoved into a single book, I still get all worked up. And of course, it doesn't help that they call themselves ""The Brights"" and ""The Enlightened"" etc. I mean, who does that? Even if I was intellectually convinced by their arguments, I still wouldn't wanna hang around these jerks.His main thesis is simple and for anyone brought up after the 19th century, overly familiar: We were savages, then we were saved by Science and Reason. Not all of us, of course, only Europeans and Americans at first, but thanks to Capitalism (or as he labels it, the gentle commerce), everywhere else is catching up slowly, too. One time this evil thing called Communism had suddenly sprung up out of nowhere and caused many deaths and suffering but it was ultimately defeated by the Allies of Light. Etc.""If you'd suggest occupying another country today, everyone would laugh at you and they'd think you were crazy; it is a thing of the past"", he says (paraphrasing). So what about Iraq or Afghanistan? Panama, Bolivia, Vietnam, Libya and countless other bloody conflicts and interjections by the Western forces, mainly USA? Oh, they are not ""wars"", he says, but merely unfortunate but ""defensive"" actions taken by civilized nations to protect their democratic ways. Isn't it incredibly telling that in an EIGHT-HUNDRED-page book about the history of world politics and violence, the word ""imperialism"" is not uttered at all. Not even once.There are a myriad of graphs and numbers stuffed inside. But the way he handles them and the way he chooses the sources he gets them from is so blatantly manipulative that it's cringe-inducing. A source repudiates his claims about ""The Long Peace"" and ""the waning of war"", and draws a bleak picture of the condition the world is in outside TheCivilizedNations? Well they are extremist, communist, leftist fanatics, you can't trust their data. Here, we have a government-funded organization that prints out numbers that fit my theory beautifully; surely they're the trustworthy ones. In one of the most embarrasing moments of the book, «we are seriously asked to draw conclusions from a graph of the ""rate of battle deaths in state-based armed conflicts between 1900 and 2005"" (Figure 6-1) while being instructed to ignore the figures for the first and second world wars»**. Why should we ignore two world wars, while looking at the history of wars, you ask? Because ""after all, the world has seen nothing close to that level since"". It was a fluke. This is kinda like saying ""please don't call it murder just because there's a body lying on the floor with a knife in the back, since it's not like we see something like that everyday"". Forgive me for the vulgar language, but this reminds me of a lovely Turkish idiom: ""If my aunt had balls, she would be my uncle"".Well, I could go on and on (like this occasionally biased and contrived -leftists!- but very detailed and informative review does) but you get the gist. In the end, it's not that I find the claim that violence in general is getting comparatively subsided (and it's at least partially thanks to Western Civilization) completely worthless. It doesn't even have to be a glorious, total, irreversible change of paradigm to be worth praising. If we are living in a marginally better, more peaceful world, we should know about it, and understand the why and the how so we can push it further. If it really turns out that the Westerners are morally superior and more evolved or something, so be it; it's not the premise that bugs me at all, but if it takes this much deceptive and manipulative ""scholarship"" to prove a point, maybe we should at least raise an eyebrow in mild suspicion before patting our world of gentle commerce in the back, you know.**Quote from David's review, because I'm too lazy to look it up myself."
9,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5864678-jan-rice,4,"Steven Pinker has written a monster of a book. He has used his intelligence to crunch a huge volume of material. He has made a number of great points to which I'm sure to be referring often.Yet despite all the insights and accompanying drum rolls, I am suspicious of the dramatic hypothesis, the grand prediction that humankind has learned in any permanent sense to be kinder and gentler. That hypothesis is a welcome change from all the dystopian predictions, and I do think I, and western civilization in general, has it pretty good right here and now in terms of space to survive and thrive. I just don't think it's necessarily a permanent pinnacle. And when people are thumping their chests and seeing themselves as representing that pinnacle, well, that's concerning--even though he insists his views are scientific and not in the least messianic. So, if Steven Pinker had been a little more humble and had spoken of current times as pretty nice for some without necessarily approaching the best of all possible worlds, I could better countenance him. But Steven Pinker can be hard to take and he doesn't do humble.Here's a cartoon making fun of Obama from the right--and of the notion that violence has declined. But, as when we see ten feet of snow and sneer at ""global warming,"" everything is not always as it appears!--Ramirez, 06-17-2014On the other hand, given all the predictions of doom for the world that are in circulation, it's good to hear thinking from the other angle for a change. We need it. Having leaned too far one way, maybe the only way to get back in form is to lean the other way. And that's why, when I finish complaining, I'll be touching on some of Pinker's many surprising assertions, despite not being a Pinkerite.But, first, here are some more of my objections.Steven Pinker has thrown so many ideas and hypotheses into this book, and he's such a fast talking, smooth intellect that it's hard to evaluate all of it--as though he were some rogue trader wheeling and dealing beyond the capacity of his would-be supervisors. You can't help but be impressed by his moves even when they're too fast to follow and you know he's sometimes pulling a fast one.Steven Pinker doesn't do justice by his opponents. I remember the Platonic principle I learned in Plato at the Googleplex--that you haven't refuted an argument unless you have it in its best articulation. Straw men won't do. We hear references to opposing ideas and their proponents but in this book it's assumed that Pinker's views represent the ""normal"" and ""best"" views. I mean his views that the current commercial economy and individualism do represent the best of all possible worlds. I may even agree with him, but my point is that not everyone does. One of Pinker's main arguments for the decline of violence is that a lower percentage of humans suffer violence now than in the early modern period, medieval times, the Renaissance, or in antiquity or prehistory. Yes, a lot of people suffered violence in the 20th century, but, according to him, a lower percentage. But, if more people suffer now but are a lower percent of the total population, is that really less violence? Did anybody ask the particular sufferers? If each human is an end in him- or herself, and a greater number are suffering, can that really be considered evidence for the decline of violence?Actually, I took that line of argument--asking what the individuals themselves would have had to say--straight from Pinker's mouth:Ho Chi Minh was correct when he prophesied, ""Kill ten of our men and we will kill one of yours. In the end, it is you who will tire."" The American democracy was willing to sacrifice a tiny fraction of the lives that the North Vietnamese dictator was willing to forfeit (no one asked the proverbial ten men how they felt about this), and the United States eventually conceded the war of attrition despite having every other advantage. (p. 309)(my italics)Something similar happens--the author's doing what he himself reprimands others for--in the area of religion. Over and over, Pinker comes down hard on religion, blaming it for the violence and excesses of earlier eras. Yet he has to employ the most fundamentalist interpretations and he has to ignore aspects that run counter to that thesis, and all in a field that is outside his area of expertise. He has to take things literally and his interpretations as the one-and-only interpretations, laid down once and for all, for example, to take a common and conventionally-made criticism: The overriding principle was that animals exist for the benefit of humans. In the Hebrew Bible, God's first words to Adam and Eve in Genesis 1:28 are ""Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."" (p. 458)And he has to pick out only the aspects of scripture that he finds distasteful. And use whatever ""God said"" in some Bible verse as if an actual historical event to compare to ""other"" historical events. Apparently he must even keep the King James flavor (moveth).Expounding on the meaning of seemingly arbitrary and bizarre but nevertheless rigidly required manners and rules of etiquette, Pinker studies their history. But studying the history of religion that way wouldn't advance Pinker's argument, while blindness to any such thing does, so he leaves it in the dark. ""What you see is all there is,"" as Daniel Kahneman, another cognitive psychologist, says. My early impression from the quotes that were up when I started out was that most casual readers were reading The Better Angels of Our Nature primarily to hear Steven Pinker diss religion and reinforce their own views.In an apparent spirit of fairness, Pinker disses the New Testament, too, but he reserves most of his ire for the Hebrew Bible. Let that be a lesson for you, Christians who disrespect your Old Testament. You are doing the work of atheists for them. Speaking of cognitive psychology, Pinker pretty much worships at the alter of reason. Doing otherwise wasn't something that was going to advance his thesis; the reader will have to look elsewhere for the limits of reason and for the understanding of consciousness as a system of attention rather than as some pristine space for free choice.One more criticism: I was surprised by a clear inconsistency on Pinker's part. This author loves local authority, and, on the national level, Leviathan--a central government large and powerful enough to reserve violence to itself and wield it in an increasingly disinterested and just manner--as an alternative to a wild, wild west scenario of every man for himself. Yet when it came to the international level he argues correlationally for a ""Democratic Peace"" theory, calling the ""empire"" theory of peace ""cynical."" (p. 281) Huh?And going back to religion for a minute, what about God and religion as a means to call up a symbolic ""Leviathan,"" long before there could be an actual central government in that role. He hints as much on p. 539, quoting from Martin Daly and Margo Wilson's 1988 book Homicide on the subject of our retention of a ""just deserts"" approach to justice as opposed to adopting a purely utilitarian ""deterrence"" approach:From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, this almost mystical and seemingly irreducible moral imperative is the output of a mental mechanism with a straightforward adaptive function: to reckon justice and administer punishment by a calculus which ensures that violators reap no advantage from their misdeeds. The enormous volume of mystico-religious bafflegab about atonement and penance and divine justice and the like is the attribution to higher detached authority of what is actually a mundane, pragmatic matter: discouraging self-interested competitive acts by reducing their profitability to nil.Pinker himself goes on to argue that just deserts itself may serve a deterrent function, and that if we were to get rid entirely of the just deserts, ""retributive"" aspect, making the justice system ""too narrowly utilitarian,"" then ""malefactors would learn to game it. Just deserts can close off that option.""I think it is here, in those words, and in waffling sprinkled throughout the book on the subject of religion, that Pinker concedes the value of of the very phenomenon against which he becomes so exercised. But he doesn't get that he has done so.I got the impression that Steven Pinker really, really wants his theory that our better angels have won to be true. More on that at the end...Now to some of his thought-provoking assertions and conclusions:Prehistorical hunter-gatherer times were not some idyllic period during which the world was populated by noble savages free from the corrupting influence of civilization. On the contrary, life was nasty, brutish and short; those times were dominated by sneaky, murderous, rapacious raiding parties. Things had to settle down considerably before anybody could write or read any books, people! Yes, it was two steps forward, one step backward for eons; people lost health and strength when they traded in hunting and gathering for agriculture--but still!Nor were medieval times some idyllic period over which to nostalgically yearn. That would be ""cutting off your nose to spite your face,"" nose-snipping being one common response to a slight. Honor was priceless but life was cheap. The way we feel now--that our bodies belong to us and are ours to care for--a perception that seems to reflect ""reality"" but is of recent, modern derivation. It is an attitude we anachronistically think always existed. Instead, individualism developed gradually. With modern times we no longer belonged to some warlord or king; and with the spread of trade we had to get inside the head of the prospective trading partner and see others as we see ourselves..as we see others.... The biggest problems for a society come with an overload of young males. And, yet, the confounding preference for male babies that drives female infanticide in many cultures!Infanticide itself is far from being some aberration attributable to the impact of modern stress and alienation. Infanticide was the norm from time immemorial--if it helped the survival of current young whose viability was already established, circumstances being such that a mother could care for only so many.This kind of thinking--some people don't want to hear it! It's enough to garner threatening letters for poor scientists.Genocide is not a disease of modernity either. We've just learned to recognize it, that's all. Life used to be a permanent holocaust for nameless multitudes, in slavery and through the impact of war and violence. No one thought anything was wrong with it unless it happened to you, says Pinker. Murderous death was supposed to represent the verdict of history, of God, in accordance with a way of thinking only lately subject to question. In this day of competition for victimhood (at best a two-edged sword!), silence in the aftermath of genocide seems inconceivable, but if genocide was a just verdict, no wonder that, at first, Holocaust survivors couldn't talk about it. I am told that changed for American Jews in consequence of the 1967 Six Day War. Did that raise the possibility of an alternative verdict?I want to digress here on how views on the suffering of violence are shifted around in religious narratives. Some ideas have begun to consolidate themselves while I've been working on this review but since they are off the beaten path of the review I'll hide them. (view spoiler)[For a long time I've been aware that religion takes the suffering of violence and turns it upside down. Egypt deported you? Then it's God hearing you and redeeming you! You're crucified? Look again and it's the salvation of the world! Can't we say that, generally speaking, people do look at suffering (or failure) as a verdict?--and it takes a twist to turn that around. In particular I came back to Galatians 3:13 in which Paul turns around the crucifixion of Christ from the ""curse of the law"" to a blessing. That has always bothered me because Deuteronomy 21:22-23 doesn't say being hanged (or crucified) is a curse. (The Jewish Study Bible and the NRSV share an editor; the translations and footnotes are very similar.) It says that leaving the body out and unburied is the curse (affront to God)--basically the same as for Sophocles' Antigone and her brother whom Cleon considered a traitor and wouldn't let her bury, to the misfortune of all. In biblical times--meaning Hebrew biblical times--stoning was the method. The final redaction was around the time of the Exile, when crucifixion didn't yet loom large. The Hebrew bible--""the law"" in Paul's terms--recognized that, atypically, some traitor-types might be hanged or impaled; in that case, leaving the body exposed might well be part of the punishment. So the bible, to circumscribe such practices, said the body must not be exposed and left overnight to become carrion. The bible, in other words, sided with the morals of Sophocles' Antigone. That is what Deuteronomy is saying.But, by post-testamental--make that intertestamental times, if you're from a Christian tradition--that had changed. The sadistic execution method of crucifixion had become unfortunately well-known, and, by then, that's what people thought of when they read those Deuteronomy verses. Here's an article I came across--the first few pages, anyway: http://www.tsm.edu/sites/default/file... So, I think Paul thought what he thought and wrote what he wrote--and isn't the part about suffering a bad end as a curse typical? Isn't turning that upside down what religions do? But, ""the Law"" didn't say that being crucified is a curse. (hide spoiler)]No gas chambers? We may think genocide requires modern technology, but it doesn't. Just lock a town's population in a building and come back in two weeks. Think of the sieges of the ancient world, or of chariots, the advanced weapons of a long-ago day.And, now--political correctness. For Pinker, PC is the residue of changes that have occurred and that we've therefore forgotten about. During the transition to modernity, people did not fully appreciate that they were undergoing changes aimed at reducing violence, and once the changes were entrenched, the process was forgotten. When Europeans were mastering norms of self-control, they felt like they were becoming more civilized and courteous, not that they were part of a campaign to drive the homicide statistics downward. Today we give little thought to the rationale behind the customs left behind by that change.... ...(A) civilizing offensive can leave a culture with a legacy of puzzling customs, peccadilloes, and taboos. ... The code of etiquette bequeathed by this and other Rights Revolutions is pervasive enough to have acquired a name. We call it political correctness.He also thinks we become amnesiac about the degree of change. We forget what the past was really like. We say little has changed. That is related to PC, enabling us to keep our guard up against the return of ""the bad old days,"" and it also enables activists to exhort us to do more. In other words, exaggeration. If we had to acknowledge how much better things are, could we get away with it? People say racism is just as bad as it always was, but it isn't. Same for antisemitism. Not so far. My husband was taking a Greek course last fall. In Georgia, people over 65 can take college courses for free within the state university system if there is space--isn't that nice? In connection with his course we could attend some lectures on antiquity, and at one the doctoral candidate made reference to the Greek ""dark ages"" (from about 1200-800 BCE). There was an African-American woman of uncertain age--meaning not young (but younger than I, as nearly everyone is getting to be) in the audience. I mention her ethnicity for any light that may shed on her reply, and what she did, during the question-and-answer period, is take issue with the ""dark ages"" designation, for, she said, we shouldn't make such a designation given that this is such a dark age. That exemplifies the point Pinker was making re forgetting what the past was really like and exaggerating the problems of the present, even as we all sat safe, secure, comfortable and diverse, discussing our esoteric subject.That segues to the Moralization Gap. Say I've done something to you. From your point of view, you were my victim. Our perspectives are going to be very different. Mine will be that whatever I did wasn't all that serious. At any rate it was a long time ago. Did I really have a choice? What can one expect, anyway? My stance is going to tend toward you should get over it already, and, while you're at it, stop being so over-sensitive. Meanwhile, you don't see it that way, not by a long shot. Whatever it is lives on in your memory and your heart. For you, not forgetting is more than common sense; it's a sacred trust. In short, the Moralization Gap is about the impact of self-interest on our views and dealings with each other, a potentially fruitful method of analysis for understanding the dynamics of a situation and why it's so hard to get along.According to Pinker the scientist is usually going to side against the past as a living cause and with what's over being over. So, in other words, he's assuming whatever it is is over.One can envisage still more angry letters and protests against that poor scientist.Why does Pinker need to believe at all costs in his Enlightenment values? It occurs to me that for a philosophe who is not from the religious majority it's distinctly unpalatable to consider what it would be like if the hands of the majority tradition were to be untied. What would happen to his vaunted authority then?And yet when he goes on and on with his criticism of the Hebrew bible, it sounds like sucking up to that majority, as if to say ""Listen to me: I'm putting them down; I'm not like them."" And, in that way, he's reminiscent of Marx.Here's a 2008 article by Jerry Muller asserting the triumph of ethnonationalism. If Muller's assertions are correct, they undermine Pinker's general hypothesis. (Foreign Affairs allows non-subscribers one article a month and two if you register.) http://www.foreignaffairs.com/article...Here, critics try to refute Muller but don't succeed: http://www.foreignaffairs.com/article... Finally, don't think that all that's here is all there is. This review isn't very systematic. Or comprehensive; for example, there's game theory and the Prisoner's Dilemma in the evolution of cooperation. Or the concept ""self-determination of peoples"" as instigator of blood baths...."
10,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6163905-knig,4,"I have a peripheral awareness that Pinker awakens red penitus in a goodly proportion of his stalwart readers: but I don’t know why. I shan’t delve into this before I write up ‘better angels’: don’t want to be distracted by ‘noise’. 800 pages of socio-economic postulating: always an inexact science, is going to rub someone the wrong way hither or thither. We see what we want to see, and 800 pages of the ‘humanities’ is like waving a red flag to a bull: plenty of scope to flare up, statistically speaking, and isn’t that just what we love to do best: exploit the ‘Moralizing Gap’ to justify our own world view:we’re brushed up dammit: well, OK, we may not be able to prove a point statistically, mathematically, economically, biologically or physically, but give me the humanities, I say: and see if I know my oochie from my achie. The subject centre stage here is violence, (mainly in the westen hemisphere, where data is more readily available)and the overarching conclusion is that it has decreased over time: in terms of war, rape, homicide and any other conceivable physical violation against the person. No one, as far as I am aware, has disagreed with this overall premise, although certain definitions of violence are under debate : e.g. the high prevaleence of infanticide has been supplanted with high levels of abortion, so in this particular area Pinker’s hypothesis does not hold up: but this is and other instances are outliers in the more general scenario of violence reduction.Pinker’s starting premise is the biological impulse, the Darwinian hegemony for survival . This type of thinking will either resonate or repel. But it is an important point because if you’re going to go down the route of biological justification, then its inadmissible to switch and bait halfway through as Pinker does. And he does so by positing the issue of excessive violence in terms of biological necessity, but resolves its decrease through ambiguous channels such as self control, empathy, reverse morality and, incongruously, and ultimately, the Flynn effect.Hence the incompatibility? How can something which starts off as nature be dampened by nurture? Huh? Huh?On the surface, all of the theories Pinker posits withstands microscopic examination: the Civilizing Process (e.g. the contract between man and state) does indeed explain the decline in violence: prior to Henry II introducing the state vs Jane Doe as opposed to Joe Bloggs vs Jane Doe, violence was the only way out: you smacked your feudal neighbours about, or you lost out. The aristocracy were just as likely as the hoi polloi to ‘engage’ in a good brawl. After the change in law, it wasn’t so beneficial. The upper and middle classes modified their behaviour. The lower classes persisted (and persist), because they have never fully bought into the state-citizen contract (and to be fair, neither has the state, on their behalf). Other influencing factors intervene: commerce, the integration of minorities in spheres of influence which engender the ‘rights revolution’, the pacifying influence of women, the clear demarcation of national borders, the influx of democracy, the redefinition of moral values.And you know what: its all true. All of it. All of these trends decreased violence. And not one person can nary say it didn’t. But how exactly:well, Pinker’s final analysis is: mainly, Reason. Now, I’ve cut and pasted this next section from Peter Singer in the New York Times book review, because he rightly summarises Pinker’s position and I am too lazy to. I’m saving my fire for the constructive anlaysis after:‘Pinker’s claim that reason is an important factor in the trends he has described relies in part on the “Flynn effect” — the remarkable finding by the philosopher James Flynn that ever since I.Q. tests were first administered, the scores achieved by those taking the test have been rising. The average I.Q. is, by definition, 100; but to achieve that result, raw test scores have to be standardized. If the average teenager today could go back in time and take an I.Q. test from 1910, he or she would have an I.Q. of 130, which would be better than 98 percent of those taking the test then. Nor is it easy to attribute this rise to improved education, because the aspects of the tests on which scores have risen most do not require a good vocabulary or even mathematical ability, but instead test powers of abstract reasoning. ......Pinker argues that enhanced powers of reasoning give us the ability to detach ourselves from our immediate experience and from our personal or parochial perspective, and frame our ideas in more abstract, universal terms. This in turn leads to better moral commitments, including avoiding violence. It is just this kind of reasoning ability that has improved during the 20th century. He therefore suggests that the 20th century has seen a “moral Flynn effect, in which an accelerating escalator of reason carried us away from impulses that lead to violence” and that this lies behind the long peace, the new peace, and the rights revolution. Among the wide range of evidence he produces in support of that argument is the tidbit that since 1946, there has been a negative correlation between an American president’s I.Q. and the number of battle deaths in wars involving the United States. ‘Here is where I wade in now: First of all, surely the Flynn effect is fallacious? There has been much debate about the accuracy of IQ tests in general, and how they are loaded with prescribed sense-data which automatically ‘disqualifies’ intelligent people who have not been immersed in the culture of this sense data. Second, the mode in which abstract reasoning is included in standardised tests is very easily a ‘learnable’ rather than an ‘applicable’ commodity, whose sequences have been incorporated in thousands of ephemeral ways in the educational system to begin with, and routinely tested over time. To use the Flynn effect as some overarching proof that we are ‘smarter’ than our predecessors is a travesty. But no more so than Pinker’s next theory, that ‘Reason’ has finally got the upper hand and carried us away ‘from impulse led violence’. This must be intuitively wrong, even to a philosophical novice. How can Reason deal with a biological impulse? In fact, when has Reason ever successfully ‘eliminated’ a biological impulse? Need I remind Pinker about the painful, unnecessary and degrading experiments in say trying to ‘reason with homosexuals’ that they have other choices? Conversely, I’m pretty certain no amount of reasoning will sway my biological sexual impulses either. Obviously countless other examples pertain. Pinker!!!And yet violence has gone down. How to explain this, then? Given I don’t buy Pinker’s theory, I’m going to have to have a go at this myself. Why not? First, Pinker concedes the impulse to violence is biologically driven. Then, buried deep within the 800 page text is a study by Preston and de Waal in 2002 ‘aversiveness of conspecifics in pain’, which basically translates into primates (and humans) having a natural inbred revulsion to inflicting violence on other primates/humans (backed up by Stanley Milgram’s shock experiment and the Trolley Problem). On a separate note, there is also the well known concept of ‘crowd mechanics’: or how we all fall into rank when the mob rules. My personal theory here is that, based on the studies above, it is possibility that violence was ‘overexaggerated’ in early history to begin with, due to lack of behaviour limiting controls. Perhaps in the wild these might be say greater geographical distances between competing primate groups. In human history, perhaps it was the state contract which modified an unnaturally rampant exhibition of violence between competitors in close proximity.(picture two pitbulls in a ring: excessiveness, eh?) Effectively then, an ‘overly violent’ population was stabilised to its natural levels. But this is not the whole story. ‘Better Angels’ shows we have gone one further, and overt violence is now perhaps below what might be considered the natural equilibrium. How did this happen? Well, it didn’t. The first thing that I must concede if I am to accept that violence is a biologically driven impulse, is that it simply can NOT have been dissipated, and certainly not by Reason. The question then is, where did the violence go? Its not easily seen as a subject-object agreement, so what happened? Its been redirected, I think. We’re not rid of it, we’re simply rechanneling in a ‘non statistical’ way. Its not with a little trepidation I’m going to mention the xBox and film now. I realise I might be relegated to cuckoo territory (my only consolation is I’ll be sharing it with Pinker though!). In the first half of the last century we had two world wars to keep us busy (and I think anybody would agree a combined total of over 40 million casualties is enough to keep anyone’s bloodthirsty instinct at bay), in the 60s there was the Vietnam war and the most intense cold war stand off ever (Bay of Pigs), and from the eighties onwards, we have: well, video games. The xBox (and read here all its technical predecessors and contemporaries) cuts across class, race, age divide and unite men (yes, men) in an indiscriminate guts and glory campaign. Usage is phenomenal., and all inclusive. If you’re old enough to hold the controller: you’re in. Its the new passage of initiation: four year olds sat next to fourteen year olds next to forty year olds: killing, massacring, rampaging, destroying and eviscerating (apparently the only taboo is raping: there is no button for it. Says Pinker). If its not the xBox its organised sport in a way well, in a way sport hasn’t been organised ever before. Not for nothing do we have the football hooligans and the mandatory Saturday matches. And finally. Film. This is something I’ve been ‘doing’ for the last month and a half: I’ve traversed the chronological gamut of film, and I find that the level of violence in film ‘now’ is phenomenal compared to anything found before the 1960s, with ever escalating etudes since. Its gotten so bad, that at the moment we are in a new era of image making: and I call it gender segregation. The majority of current offerings seem to run across gender biased lines: mindless violent action for the men, where the directors don’t even pretend to be aiming for all round inclusivity, tempered with a backlash for women: just as silly a regression in stereotypical ‘romcom’ where no allowances are made for the non chicklit minded. Cinema is divided, in a way it never was prior to the 1960s onwards. Which serves no one well. But apropos of violence: this is where its all happening. Behind the scenes, where the victims are not ‘real’ people, and the statistics don’t register. Which means, of course, that the problem of violence hasn’t gone away. It will resurface in all its glory. Just give it the right time and place."

Although he is nominally a professor of psychology at Harvard, but even with specialties (per Wikipedia) in experimental psychology, cognitive science, linguistics, he somehow dove into history to present one of the best TED Talks, back in 2007: 
Steven Pinker on the myth of violence
 (watch those nineteen minutes, if you haven't already).Wonderfully, he has now followed that presentation up with an entire volume.Peter Singer wrote the glowing review of this book for the New York Times, and that somewhat lengthy essay is itself well worth reading:

Curiously, the podcast I was listening to on the way to the library was on a related topic. The U.C.

12,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6852430-fourtriplezed,5,"What an interesting read! If the idea is to give the reader food for thought this book more than nourishes. My approach to this book was a bit different than is usual. I have tended to write a review and then read others. Not in this case. I read many good reviews and few that were critical so was very open to being a critic. I am of the opinion that a few did not take note of what Pinker wrote. He got some numbers wrong was a fairly common complaint. He may have and admits as much. A few times he made it clear that his numbers were estimates based on researchers who are respected in the field. “…. so there is no single correct estimate” he writes on page 60 of my copy. Page 168 “….. no one knows exactly how many were killed…..” when discussing holy slaughters. In fact Pinker supports scepticism as he suggested on page 217 when discussing the Enlightenment. As a westerner living a very comfortable life in Australia I was intrigued to read a comment by US politician John Kerry on page 417. “We have to get back to the place we were, where terrorist are not the focus of our lives, but they’re a nuisance. As a former law-enforcement person, I know we’re never going to end prostitution. We’re never going to end illegal gambling. But we’re going to reduce it, organised crime, to a level where it isn’t on the rise. It isn’t threatening people’s lives every day, and fundamentally it’s something that you continue to fight, but it’s not threatening the fabric of your life” He was right of course but he became “unfit to lead” and had to back pedal as the reality is that the authorities may well have reduced and contained crime, by cripes don’t tell the people that because the media will not be happy unless they are able to make you feel bad about just about every part of your life. Less violence? How dare that be considered when there is news to sell. And take it in your stride as you are not going to get hit by the Mafia? Bah! This book covered a variety of female issues and after conversation elsewhere I even read On Rape by Germaine Greer. Hardly an area I knew much about. Glad I did. Perhaps blokes my age, 60ish, need to get of their fat arses and not think they rule the world as Pinker has given a very good case that the rise of feminist thought has been good for our collective health. While reading this I came across this item on the repulsive practise of female circumcision. Yes the item says caution is required but it is good to read that progress is taking place. https://www.theguardian.com/global-de...This book has some fascinating sub chapters and one on page 572 called Whence The Rights Revolution? should thrill the hearts of all book readers. Among other things is a fivefold increase in books published from 1960 to 2000. The information we are getting seems to just make us collectively smarter when it comes to treating each other with a little bit of respect and not get on our high horse and want to smash the face in of our neighbours be they next door or in the nation next door. So does Pinker say we are in for even less violence in the future? No! In fact he makes it abundantly clear that one bit of lunacy can change everything. I personally am very unsure we have rosy future. I am like the next father of children and worry about the environment, that a loony with a nuke will go mad but the book itself is in fact not really about that. It is about the data that shows violence has dropped and gives several reasons why. Disagree with the reasons by all means but also enjoy the fact you have more chance of dying in a car crash than by a terrorist attack no matter what the newspapers tells you."
13,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36819318-scott,4,"Are you afraid of being of being attacked or murdered? Do you think our society is becoming more violent and less safe? If you watch the news, read the papers and listen to politicians it would be logical to be afraid of the seemingly rising tide of violence and criminality in the world. However, Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature will show you your feelings are misguided- crime and violence in society is lower than it has ever been, and our often idealized past (even the recent past) was a very violent and scary place.Before you read this book (and you should read it) be aware that it is Looooong. Weighing in at 832 pages  The Better Angels of our Nature is no reading Everest, no Tolstoy, but each of those pages is a heavy bit of paper, drowning in a kudzu of fascinating facts and info that has spread to near every sentence. It was a long march to the final page, but trust me, it was worth it.This is a fascinating and constantly surprising read. Pinker presents the perfect antidote for the doom, gloom and bolt-your-doors crime hysteria present in the media. I already knew that we live in a comparatively safe era of history- the lack of recent Viking raids on my apartment block is noticeable - but Pinker makes it clear that this is by far the safest period of human history that there has ever been. Present-day developed nations make even the 1970s and 80s look like a time when to step outside was to enter a gritty urban version of the hunger games, complete with roving packs of armed rapists (the sexual violence stats for those decades are genuinely horrifying).The United States, sadly, is still more violent than Europe or Australasia, but even with all the shootings and killings of recent years the cold hard statistics show that Americans are still safer than ever. This completely flips the established narrative in politics and the media, and the hard data shows that suicide is a greater threat than murder, or even from war and natural disasters combined. The average person in twenty-first century society is more likely to die by their own hand than they are by the hands of others. The reality of contemporary crime and violence is completely contrary to the apocalyptic vision presented by fearmongering politicians and news outlets and The Better Angels of our Nature, or at least a summary of Pinker’s findings, should be compulsory reading for anyone standing for public office. Pinker's book stands as an engaging testament to how much progress we have made in making our broader human society far less violent."
14,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"Steven Pinker’s ""The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined"" is a big ambitious book. Perhaps too big, perhaps too ambitious. And perhaps, too sprawling for its own good. One could opt for a Peace Studies reader and get a more eclectic taste of what research is out there. Would it be as comprehensive as this book? Maybe, maybe not, but you would get the benefit of tasting the many kinds of literature through many different voices. Here, we get a great deal of peace science, behavioral science, religious literature and more, all sifted through one scientific (and often brilliant) voice. Much research is included in this volume, and the many references often drown out the voice, but the voice is also in control of how we receive the literature. So, what is the book -- polemical argument, scientific memoir, or reference volume? I doubt it knows the answer. The point of the book is simple: to outline how violence has decreased, and to answer why so that we may learn from our successes and continue to replicate them. The book might strike some as counter-intuitive -- in the time of Rwanda, Darfur, Iraq, mass-casualty terrorism, runaway gun violence in the US, and much, much more, it would seem like our times are just ""another bloody century"". Surely, if we subtract the effects of nuclear weapons in deterring warfare between major powers, and on top of that, if we discount the way modern battlefield medicine has led to a decrease in fatalities from warfare (many are still wounded and crippled), then our century can't be that much more peaceful than others. And there is also the other issue, the possible historical contingency of our own ""long peace"" (much like the long relative peacefulness between the Napoleonic wars and the first World War). One really bloody hegemonic war between nuclear powers might be all that's needed to eliminate our current gains. And yet there is a surprising body of evidence that suggests that violence has decreased that spans across multiple disciplines. Pinker makes the case that this trend is deep, enduring, and possibly sustainable. Ancient and medieval societies took genocide, rape, mutilation and other types of violence as given. All of these forms of violence were permissible as long as customs and traditions were adhered to. For me, the most interesting aspects of the book are the tracking of the rights movements and the civilizing processes. These are truly fascinating aspects of the evolving peace that I was not fully aware of. I think for many of the scholars coming to this book with some background in peace studies or studies of violence, they will have a similar reaction to mine. I know that...and I know that...and I know that...but ah!, I didn't know that! This speaks to the benefit of having such a comprehensive volume. Peace researchers who are aware of one of type of literature might be bored by some chapters of the book, and yet, find themselves enthralled by others. Overall, a fantastic read and one that I would readily recommend to others."
15,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35434974-kevin,1,"This book asserts that violence has decreased. I can set this aside as a worthy discussion. However, that is just the hook to catch readers. The purpose here is spreading ideologies to explain why violence has decreased.The Bad:Well, it turns out Pinker puts much of his faith in the status quo (i.e. power) as directly responsible, i.e. the State (""Leviathan"") and Capitalism (""Gentle Commerce""). Let us consider status quo bias:1) One can argue that it is resistance to power that has brought much of the decrease in violence we see today! After all, slavery and colonialism were the most profitable Capitalist ventures, backed and enabled by the growth of States. Elites sure are innovative at co-opting grassroots demands (and then smugly taking credit for it!), like the liberal elite property-holders who did all they could to thwart democracy (""mob rule"") until it became advantageous to run as ""democrats"" (while power migrated from the political sphere to the private economic sphere). 2) Even if such violent power structures were capable of forcing an increase in material production, must we assume they are the only options? Have we really reached ""The End of History"", as another status quo shill put it? Euro/Americentric Liberal elitists like Pinker place their faith in ""the Enlightenment"" (similarly, the ""Founding Fathers"") as the foundational social movement in human history, but we should look beyond Orwellian history, towards accounts that do not just assume whatever is written by the victors is the totality of reality. The autonomous communities not requiring and openly resisting the violent shepherding by authority are indeed written out of history...I tried to re-read these 800+ pages to give a thorough unpacking, but frankly there are better uses of one's time. I am thankful for these beautiful (negative) reviews, enjoy!Brilliant review #1Brilliant review #2and one moreThe Missing:I used to first recommend the following critiques on power and appraisal of popular resistance and decision-making for Western audiences given their accessibility.

16,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Pinker goes into voluminous detail to show us that violence has steadily declined in human society since prehistoric times. In this well-structured work rich with statistics, charts, and the ideas of influential scholars he identifies six prevailing trends: The Pacification Process, the Civilizing Process, the Humanitarian Revolution, the Long Peace, the New Peace, and the Rights Revolutions. Turning from history to psychology he identifies five inner demons that lead us to violence: Predation, dominance, revenge, sadism, and ideology. Then he identifies four better angels: Empathy, self-control, morality and reason. He gives us a brief review of violence in human history before explaining each trend and the underlying psychology. Below is my recap.The first trend, the Pacification Process, explains the decline of violent deaths as a percentage of the population from the time of prehistoric tribes to today’s modern nation states. Incessant feuding and raiding between tribes gave way to organized societies that enforced laws and weighed more carefully the consequences of war. The decline has been steady but not smooth with large conflicts and exterminations causing big blips in the trend line but not breaking it. The second trend, the Civilizing Process, explains how people acquired manners and standards of behavior that were less prone to violence. Pinker attributes much of both processes to Hobbes Leviathan, the state. From 5000 fiefdoms in 15th century Europe came 30 nations in 20th century Europe. As these states grew in size, so did strong central authority. Laws, rules and norms on behavior were imposed to ensure loyalty and stability decreasing internal violence. Increased commerce created interdependence between states also engendering stability and reducing the benefits of interstate conflict. The degree of violence in a country or even a region in the US is best explained by acceptance of the rule of law. The rule of law is not accepted where governments are weak or by people in remote regions or by people who feel discriminated against. In these situations street law replaces government laws, honor systems prevail and personal disputes are much more likely to end in violence.The third trend, the Humanitarian Revolution, developed from the Enlightenment which began in the seventeenth century led by philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. The Humanitarian Revolution challenged sadism, despotism and cruel punishments for people and animals. The invention of the printing press had resulted in an explosion of books and rapid increase in literacy. Reading, particularly popular novels which induced vicarious emotion, led to shared ideas, values and perspective crossing traditional community lines. People from different backgrounds congregating in cities and increased international trade contributed to the Humanitarian Revolution as did the Civilizing Process. Prior to the Humanitarian Revolution the world was brutish and cruel. Pinker goes into great detail about many popular tortures that were widely enjoyed such as burning witches and dangling cats over fires for evening fun. Communities even purchased prisoners from other jurisdictions so they could hold executions for public entertainment. Reading this section is like reading about a completely different world. Barbara Tuchman’s A Distant Mirror provides good background.The fourth trend Pinker calls the Long Peace. He is referring to the relatively peaceful period since WWII. He also points to the long period of relative European peace between the Napoleonic Wars and WWI. Pinker goes back further amassing a plethora of statistical measures to posit that the trend of the world since at least the fifteenth century is towards fewer wars and fewer war deaths as a percentage of world population. This holds true even considering the huge casualties of WWI and WWII and other deadly calamities. Pinker believes nationalism and territorial conquest are on the decline as Enlightenment values such as human rights take hold. The humanitarian influence is strongly reinforced by the now readily available real-time graphic pictures of war. He sees hope in the number of countries that have stopped conscription and the slower than expected rate of nuclear proliferation. He goes back 200 years to Kant who pointed out three forces that promoted peace – democracy, international trade, and international organizations. All three have experienced recent dramatic growth supporting Pinker’s trends of pacification, civilizing, and humanitarianism to support peace. The fifth trend is the New Peace. This encompasses the period following the end of the Cold War in 1989 up to the time Pinker wrote the book, published in 2011. Pinker analyses different types of wars (interstate, non-state, and civil), mass exterminations (racial and political) and terrorism to show the world has continued to become more peaceful. He points out how our perceptions have changed. Compare the 5,000 Americans and 100,000 Iraqis that have died during this period in Middle Eastern conflicts to the 58,000 Americans and 1,000,000 or more Vietnamese who died in that conflict. What shocks today would have seemed far less significant just decades prior. Once, even genocide didn’t raise the eyebrows of those not affected. Pinker discusses modern exterminations including the Armenian genocide, Soviet collectivization, the Holocaust, Chinese land reform, and Rwandan genocide. Political instability, ethnic divisions and ideology all play roles leading to authoritarianism and genocide. Terrorism has always afflicted the world. But reliable statistics are available only going back to the 1970’s. Western Europe has seen a steady decline of terrorism as has the US with major exceptions: 9-11 in 2001 and to a lesser extent the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. Pinker points out with the exception of 2001 and 1995 “more Americans were killed each year from lightening, deer, peanut allergies, bee stings, and ‘ignition or melting nightwear’ than by terrorist attacks.” So the recent trend, despite all the histrionics, is toward less violence, but it only takes one megalomaniac with nuclear weapons to undo all the trend lines.The sixth trend Pinker calls the Rights Revolutions, which were primarily due to the increase in access to information exposing people to new ideas and different viewpoints. Contributing are democracies which promote access and prosperity which allows people to focus beyond necessity. Pinker describes five Rights Revolutions:Civil Rights: From the lynchings of the American South to the pogroms of Russia, racial and religious violence has persisted throughout history. In America only since Truman integrated the armed forces in 1948 and Johnson signed the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968 did change begin to take hold. Today most Americans accept diversity and respect differences. Woman’s Rights: Rape and wife beating have been endemic in every society. Women were regarded as property. Rape was considered a crime against the husband or father. Not until the late middle ages did Western views begin to change and so.me cultures still haven’t. It wasn’t until the 1970’s that states in the U.S. began to pass laws against husbands raping their wives. As late as the 1970’s women were denied credit unless their husbands signed. A 1974 law made that illegal. Change has been dramatic in the last fifty years with the “me too” movement the latest iteration of progress. Children’s Rights: Until recently 10-15% of all children were killed shortly after birth. Infanticide has been regularly practiced by all types of societies. Mothers did it to ensure the survival of other children. Men did it because they did not believe the child was theirs. Both men and women did it because the child was a girl. For children that survived, beating or at least spanking them was considered good parenting until the last half of the twentieth century. Today the danger may be that parents are obsessively controlling their children’s lives and taking “safety” precautions that are counterproductive. Children should be allowed to learn how to play without adults around. Parental influence has its limits. Children take on the values and vernacular of their peers. Gay Rights: As late as 1969 homosexuality was illegal in every U.S state except Illinois. That gay and lesbian marriage is now legal and widely accepted in the U.S. is to me the most unanticipated of all the gains in human rights in my lifetime. Animal Rights: Abuse of animals like abuse of humans has a long history and only in the last decades has the issue come to the forefront. Rising concern over the humane treatment of pets, farm animals, and laboratory animals has spawned action groups and regulations to protect animals. Cock fighting and dog fighting are outlawed many places and even bullfighting is on the decline. This is a far cry from primitive, ancient and medieval societies where torturing animals for fun was widely practiced.Next Pinker describes the psychology that predisposes us to violence. He describes the Moralization Gap, self-serving biases used to justify our actions and feelings. This gap enables perpetrators and victims to create widely different narratives of the same event. He even digs into brain structure to explain how violent and anti-social impulses are generated and to further discredit the concept of pure evil. The ingredients for evil lurk inside all of us. One is reminded of Solzhenitsyn’s observations that, “…the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.” and “To do evil a human being must first of all believe that what he’s doing is good...” Pinker identifies what he terms the five demons that drive violent behavior: Predation is exploitive, practical violence done for personal gain. Dominance is characterized by actions that tell others - Don’t mess with me, I’m in charge. Narcissistic (grandiose, needs admiration, lacks empathy) political leaders are particularly violence prone. Thwarted narcissists feel humiliated leading to envy and rage. Virulent nationalism and tribalism can form in the presence of group narcissism. Revenge is a common urge and major cause of violence. Empathy, dependence and close connections can modulate revenge. Sadism, inflicting pain for pleasure, is hard for most of us to understand. It can grow out of predation and punishment. It is largely an acquired taste. People in control of others can slide into sadism. Ideology justifies violence as a means to an end for the greater good. People in tightly knit groups feed off each other making violence seem reasonable. When the group is dominant others behave like sheep and pretend to believe. Euphemisms, gradualism, diffusing responsibility, distancing from and denigrating victims are common techniques that lead to moral disengagement.Lastly Pinker reviews four “Better Angels”, those traits that mitigate violence: Empathy, often used in the sense of sympathy or compassion, has several meanings. One is perspective taking which refers to seeing things from someone else’s point of view. Another is theory of mind, trying to figure out someone else’s thoughts and emotions. Empathy is typically applied disproportionately to individuals in the same community, or who share our values, or are cute. Thus empathy does not embody fairness. Expanding our perception of interconnectedness with others can expand our circle of empathy and altruistic behavior. Self-Control often means delaying gratification. It’s fair to discount future benefits but many of us discount them far too much. Individual self-control is rooted in brain structure and function including the workings of hormones and neurotransmitters. But it can be cultivated. The Civilizing Process by setting behavioral norms has helped us make substantial improvements over the centuries. Recent Biological Evolution (not a better angel) has been proposed based on varying demographics in birth and death rates, but there is not adequate proof for this. The Humanitarian Revolution, The Rights Revolution and significant recent declines in crime have happened too rapidly for biological evolution to be a factor. Morality and Taboo have shifted. Pinker reviews several models. The shift has been from morals based on purity, community and authority which appeal to social conservatives to those based on fairness, individual autonomy and rationality which are values embraced by social liberals. The shift is reflected in recent changes in minority, women’s and gay rights. Reason despite newsworthy examples to the contrary is on the rise. It reduces violence by identifying the absurd, promoting self-control and even morality. It introduces the concept of proportionality which is essential to fairness. For whatever purpose reason originally developed, its continued expansion to other areas is only natural. IQ test do show people are getting smarter, at least in the area of abstract reasoning, a skill that is developed as educational levels, science, technology and a symbol rich environment have increased. This does not mean underlying general intelligence has increased only the way it is applied has changed. The development of abstract reasoning promotes cooperation, liberalism, economic literacy and democracy; all of which help reduce violence. To put this all together Pinker looks, “for common threads in the Pacification Process, the Civilizing Process, the Humanitarian Revolution, The Long Peace, the New Peace and the Rights Revolutions. Each should represent a way in which predation, dominance, revenge, sadism, or ideology has been overpowered by self-control, empathy, morality, or reason.” He identifies forces that turned out not to be important to the six trends: Weaponry and disarmament, resources and power, affluence, and religion and ones that did matter: The Leviathan, gentle commerce, feminization, the expanding circle of sympathy and the escalator of reason. It is popular to opine nostalgically on the good old days and extol the simpler more natural life of past centuries and eons, but as Pinker points out those past times for most people were harsh, bitter and much more violent.Pinker makes a convincing and well documented case that we have gone from a society where violence is the accepted and expected norm to one where violence has diminished to the point that we look on it as an aberration. He takes pains to not predict the future even though the many statistical trend lines Pinker presents imply that we might expect more of the same in the future. I’m not swayed by statistical implications for the future but his analysis of the forces at play give me hope. Pinker’s thesis is not uncontroversial. However, despite its detractors, it has won many awards and significant endorsements. But even if you don’t buy in to Pinker’s conclusions, there is much food for thought. This book is for readers with a serious interest. It is well written and clear but there is a lot to digest and I think most readers will be best served by patience and allotting the time necessary to take it all in. It is, as widely claimed, a very important book that can change the way you look at the world and the human animal that is dictating its future."
17,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,1,"Audio Books : Educational : MP3/Variable : Englishblurb - We've all had the experience of reading about a bloody war or shocking crime and asking, ""What is the world coming to?"" But we seldom ask, ""How bad was the world in the past?"" In this startling new book, the best-selling cognitive scientist Steven Pinker shows that the world of the past was much worse. In fact, we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species' existence.Evidence of a bloody history has always been around us: the genocides in the Old Testament and crucifixions in the New; the gory mutilations in Shakespeare and Grimm; the British monarchs who beheaded their relatives and the American founders who dueled with their rivals; the nonchalant treatment in popular culture of wife-beating, child abuse, and the extermination of native peoples. Now the decline in these brutal practices can be quantified.With the help of more than a hundred graphs and maps, Pinker presents some astonishing numbers. Tribal warfare was nine times as deadly as war and genocide in the 20th century. The murder rate in medieval Europe was more than thirty times what it is today. Slavery, sadistic punishments, and frivolous executions were unexceptionable features of life for millennia, then suddenly were targeted for abolition. Wars between developed countries have vanished, and even in the developing world, wars kill a fraction of the numbers they did a few decades ago. Rape, battering, hate crimes, deadly riots, child abuse, cruelty to animals - all substantially down.How could this have happened, if human nature has not changed? What led people to stop sacrificing children, stabbing each other at the dinner table, or burning cats and disemboweling criminals as forms of popular entertainment? Was it reading novels, cultivating table manners, fearing the police, or turning their energies to making money? Should the nuclear bomb get the Nobel Peace Prize for preventing World War III? Does rock and roll deserve the blame for the doubling of violence in the 1960s - and abortion deserve credit for the reversal in the 1990s?Not exactly, Pinker argues. The key to explaining the decline of violence is to understand the inner demons that incline us toward violence (such as revenge, sadism, and tribalism) and the better angels that steer us away. Thanks to the spread of government, literacy, trade, and cosmopolitanism, we increasingly control our impulses, empathize with others, bargain rather than plunder, debunk toxic ideologies, and deploy our powers of reason to reduce the temptations of violence.With the panache and intellectual zeal that have made his earlier books international best sellers and literary classics, Pinker will force you to rethink your deepest beliefs about progress, modernity, and human nature. This gripping book is sure to be among the most debated of the century so far.	SHEEIT - turned off half way through the introduction, how could I possibly force myself to trudge through nearly 900 pages of earnest wrongness.

18,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672661-lois-bujold,5,"After a steady recent diet of short-attention-span theater internet surfing, it was very interesting to dive into a dense read that took me a week to chew through. (I am not a very fast reader, but I'm usually faster than that.) The exercise of following a really long, complex, sustained argument was probably good for me.Seven chapters of convincing examination of historical evidence to the best approximation that could be managed, all of which jibes well with what I know or have experienced of history, followed by three chapters of attempts to figure out the why of the what. Pinker was pretty good about fencing off his facts from his hypotheses with suitable disclaimers. Several times he more-or-less interrupts his narrative to give the reader tutorials on basic statistics, in a desperate bid to bring his audience up to speed so that they can understand his data and how he massages it to get it to yield up more understanding. I was very interested in the brief survey of recent formulations in neurology and cognitive psychology that he used to underpin his arguments. I was also reminded of a classic little book from the 50s, How to Lie with Statistics by Darrell Huff, which should really be required reading for every voter and consumer. (It has been reprinted in paperback and is now available on Kindle, I'm pleased to note.) Pinker, I think, is trying very hard to tell the truth with statistics; that little book would help ground one's evaluation either way.I was charmed by how many of my own humanist beliefs about history and human nature were supported variously, not to mention how many of the jokes and cultural references I got, but naturally, I would be; Pinker and I are of the same generation and share a certain amount of world-view, after all. I am pretty fond of the modernity that cocoons me and has repeatedly saved my life, and he does not underrate it, either. Not everything worked for me in his arguments, but enough did for going on with. He footnotes the hell out of everything, which I appreciate. Along the way he dropped recs for what sounds like a lot of potentially interesting further reading, should I find energy for it. (31 pages in very small print of sources one could go check up, ditto.)Highly recommended. "
19,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9517361-blaine,5,"This book is sure to anger or confuse just about everyone who cares about the world today, but particularly those who love to hate the idea of cultural progress: ""What? You gotta be kidding - violence has declined over time? No frikin' way - just look at the news."" But be assured - after you read only a few pages of this book, you'll be reminded of what life used be like in the foreign country called The Past and you just might change your tune and recognize how, for large sectors of the world's population, life today is less violent, less brutal, and less cruel. Pinker's basic thesis is that, no matter how you look at the data, no matter what time frame, no matter what part of the world or what era, and no matter what form it takes, violence, cruelty, and brutality in human society has declined over time. With over 700 pages of detailed charts, data, and references to other such studies (such as the books ""Homicide"" by Daly/Wilson and Keeley's ""War Before Civilization""), Pinker demonstrates the astonishing fact that, despite the continued violence everywhere in the world today, much of today's world lives in a time of relative peace and safety unknown to past generations. It's not an argument that violence has been eliminated but that there is a pacification and civilizing process at work in history in which violence in its many forms has been decreasing over time. It is especially an argument for the success of secularism, modernity, liberalism, the democratic state, and societies based in law and order, an argument many just don't want to hear. Many of my friends simply refuse to read it because they're unwilling to challenge their adherence to some version of the narrative that ""the world is going down the toilet"" and that some version of modern western culture is the reason why. They may be right in some sense but they're not in terms of what Pinker is talking about. When you are able (willing?) to separate out just how Pinker is framing ""violence"" from your overall view of violence in today's world, his argument becomes crystal clear. He is quite aware that there still exists cruelty, slavery, and horrific brutality in today's world but, like the difference between the institutionalized, culturally-sanctioned slavery of the past and the clandestine forms of human trafficking of today (not to mention the sheer numbers difference), there really has been progress here as there has in so many other areas. Pinker's book deals mostly with human-on-human violence and to a lesser extent, human-on-animal violence. While the evidence he presents points to an ongoing decline in the former, it could be argued that human>animal and human>natural world violence has actually increased as human populations increased. The question for Pinker is: have certain privileged parts of the world's population gained a relatively violence-free society at the expense of the continued violation-destruction of nature, of plant and animal species?

Unfortunately many will appreciate it without watching critically at the data used. The main reasons I say so:- Pinker uses 2nd sometimes 3rd hand raw data without further reflecting upon it.- data on warfare in prehistory is cherry-picked exaggerated.Read: http://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/sites/fas...- data on pre-state societies is sometimes simply wrong and the extended debate on violence in these societies is completely ignored.Read: http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/content...- in order to reflects on violence during certain periods of time he instead chooses single events as representative""For instance, would a typical person living in the 8th century be at a higher or lower risk of being killed in wars and atrocities than an individual living in the 13th? To answer that question, you’d need to look at the annual death rate from wars and atrocities, per 1,000 people, and because the annual death rate might fluctuate markedly from year to year as atrocities come and go, you’d need to average the annual death rate out over the course of a century, in order to get a typical figure that represented your annual risk of dying as a result of an atrocity.""- the two atrociologists he cites both disagree with him that the 20th century has been the least violentFor a full review of Pinker Bogus statistics read:http://www.uncommondescent.com/intell...- Pinker book has quite an Imperialist American-centric point of view.

21,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1944947-barnaby-thieme,1,"I was recently listening to a BBC interview with two historians on the An Lushan rebellion, and the interviewer read a passage from Pinker's book in which he argued that this Chinese civil war was primary evidence for his thesis that human violence used to exist on a scale we would find hard to believe, from our current perspective. When the interviewer read some of Pinker's fact and statistics about the rebellion, both of them spontaneously burst into laughter and one of them asked ""What on earth is his evidence for that?"" What, indeed? Pinker relies throughout this book overwhelmingly on the death statistics for major historical events compiled by a librarian and published to his personal website in his spare time. If you think I'm exaggerating, look for yourself. No, I'm afraid this book is the joke, and it makes a joke of its credulous audience, making specious, anti-empirical, and fatuous arguments fueled by breathtaking narcissism. What if the situation were reversed? That is, what if a history professor wrote an eclectic book on cognitive linguistics that was fundamentally at odds with the consensus of linguists everywhere, and that relied overwhelmingly for support on a single source, which was itself entirely the work of an untrained amateur? I think such a book would quite likely be universally regarded as a laughingstock. However, we live in a generation in which the increasing consensus among intelligentsia holds that scientists hold the answers to questions that used to be addressed by the humanities, and so Pinker's book is not only accepted as plausible, but widely lauded and championed. I expect this is in no small part due to another factor - this is a work that very much flatters its secular humanist audience by suggesting we have learned our lesson and, by and large, moved past our brutish origins, carried on the wings of science, progress, and bourgeois values. "
22,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5129340-joakim-wendell,1,"An interesting idea, but Pinker fails to deliver a convincing argument. The subject of the book is violence, and Pinker argues that 1) violence has declined historically, and 2) that the decline is due to a number of factors. His five factors are a) strong states, 2) commerce, 3) feminization, 4) cosmopolitanism and 5) reason. There are several glaring problems with his thesis. First, he never defines ""violence"", a rather big problem since the book is about violence. From his examples, I infer that he defines violence as acts of physical violence between humans. Against that, I would argue that violence can be mental, and it can be directed towards animals and/or the environment. But with such a definition, the statistics Pinker use would probably tell a different story.Be that as it may, the main problem I have with the book is that Pinker always takes the easy route. He refuses to acknowledge alternative interpretations of the trends he analyzes - for me it is incomprensible how one can write a book about the causes of historical violence without mentioning Foucault - if only to disprove him. A large part of the book is about ideology and its use for violence, but Pinker steadfastly refuses to discuss any violent tendencies of his own Liberal Enlightenment ideology. When he reaches such points in history - the French revolution is a case in point - he just blames some other ideology for being the real culprit, and moves on. With such a lack of self-reflection, the line of reasoning becomes exceedingly brittle. This unrestrained, unreflected bias colours the entire book in a very bad light. It is too bad. With a less self-serving agenda, the book might have been interesting. As it is, I cannot recommend it, except as an example of how not to purue an argument."

Magic Mirror, do tell me, which one is RosierPinker??I still don’t figure it out, in what planet psychologist Pinker lives on. I have watched him many times insisting on “things are getting better”. Due to his studies on violence, he sees there is less violence amongst humans. He adds to this optimistic picture: “we’re getting more humane”. 



 

 

One thing is reported, numerical cases of violence, in wars, in crime etc. Another different thing, is the human nature. Despite his studies going back in thousands of years, he just doesn’t report on the POTENTIAL for violence; I mean, atomic weapons still exist today (in big numbers, and in several nations), as well as chemical and biological ones. Should an atomic war conflagrate (say, in the Korean peninsula) (God forbid!), The Day Afterthe next day the book of Pinker would be just obsolete. Yes, you cannot cope with (the idea of) the numbers killed. Pinker, the one who had affirmed “nuclear weapons are useless”, would be instantly refuted. For good. 

Deep down in the human nature, violence does exist. Let’s not put some sort of pinkrosy camouflage, in the human nature. I've been thinking about Africa in this and the past century; Mao's China and Russia under Stalin, and other examples, which should make Pinker think thrice, at least,... about demons.I would like Pinker to comment on the Mandalay Bay hotel shooting, in Las Vegas, the past October. And on similar cases.

24,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,4,"Did this really take two and a half years to read? I see that it did. I picked it up after a new-ish boyfriend press-ganged me into seeing Pinker talking about his new book - this one - in Edinburgh, and thinking that it sounded fascinating and potentially relevant to a PhD I was considering doing. Well, the PhD idea is discarded, and as for the boyfriend, I swapped Pinker for Susanna Clarke and moved in with him. He finished my book first.The premise of The Better Angels of Our Nature is that the world is getting less violent. I read about the first half fairly slowly, as it marched through prehistory and the Middle Ages, with graph upon graph and source upon source - I mean, that's pretty uncontentious, isn't it? That there are far fewer beheadings and settlement-on-settlement raids and Hundred Year Wars as we get through history past the Enlightenment. Knowing next to nothing of east Asian history, I was interested to read about things like the An Lushan Rebellion and a brief history of belligerent Mongols. There are parts on international armed conflict, on genocide, on civil war. I spent a year studying humanitarian law. It felt like a lot of the coursework from that year, albeit a bit rearranged. So far so good, Mr. Pinker; I accept where you're going with this.I put the book down, for a very long time. Then in November 2015 two things happened in quick succession: the Paris bombings, followed quickly by the vote in the UK Parliament to bomb Syria. I'm in Scotland, and a more dyed-in-the-wool pacifist you'll not find. So I picked this back up, to keep reading the sections about armed conflict in the twentieth century, because I wanted to be reminded (convinced?) that the world is broadly heading in the right direction.I mean, it is. It is; but we're not anywhere near out of the woods yet. And we probably won't be in my lifetime. But maybe we will. Pinker's point is not that violence has gone away. He makes few predictions. (Five years down the line, his predictions on conflict in the Middle East have proved too optimistic. But hold that thought a moment longer.) He plots a direction, and the direction is more peaceful. It seems to involve more things being classed as atrocities and abuses - but that's because we're rightly outraged these days by things that nobody would have cared about fifty or a hundred or three hundred years ago.Finally he talks neuroscience and psychology. Do your thing, Steven; that's more your area than mine, so I'll take your word for it.Let's come back to the optimism of Mr. Pinker. Because he is very optimistic! Let's get the biggie out of the way first, shall we?:In early 2011, as this book was going to press, a swelling protest movement deposed the leaders of Tunisia and Egypt and was threatening the regimes in Jordan, Bahrain, Libya, Syria, and Yemen. The outcome is unpredictable, but the protesters have been almost entirely non-violent and non-Islamist, and are animated by a desire for democracy, good governance, and economic vitality rather than global jihad, the restoration of the caliphate, or death to infidels. Even with all these winds of change, it is conceivable that an Islamist tyrant or radical revolutionary group could drag an unwilling populace into a cataclysmic war. But it seems more probable that ""the coming war with Islam"" will never come. Islamic nations are unlikely to unite and challenge the West: they are too diverse, and they have no civilization-wide animus against us. (p443)...Oops. Well, he did hedge his bets, I suppose.Where he didn't hedge his bets, and where he consequently rather lost me a bit, was when he focused on the US a bit more specifically. When I mentioned to a friend a few weeks ago that I was reading Pinker, she clucked her tongue at me and said, ""Oh dear - does he think sexism is over yet?"" That's overstating it a bit, but the impression I got was, well, yes - it really is as if he thinks sexism is pretty much winding up, and the civil rights movement put paid to racism and racist violence decades ago. After 500+ pages of meticulous research, it seemed like a glaring oversight to just assume that the various -isms had just upped and finished since 1980. No, it didn't seem like a glaring oversight: the quickly glossed-over suggestion that racism in the US is a relic of days gone by made me think there were things Pinker wasn't telling me. This is a 1100-page book, of which the last 300 pages are entirely citations, and here I am accusing the author of leaving things out. Well, I'm gonna, 'cause I feel like he has. No fifth star for you, Steven.And yet I'm still mostly on his side. I'm no John Gray, whose arguments seem to be of the ""when you say 'it's got better', I hear 'everything's fine', which it's not"" and ""I know tribal people and they don't fight each other, therefore science"" varieties (and, I might add, get neatly steamrollered by Pinker himself here - I do so love a good academic spat in the Guardian...). Earlier this year, I proofread an essay criticising Pinker (don't ask how I arrived there; terribly unlikely circumstance is how), apparently on the twin bases that how could you possibly know that 15th century middle England executed more people than were executed in 21st century Oxford; and the ever-classic ""but NUCLEAR!""It plays with an idea that I don't think I'll ever fail to be interested by: it's why I loved The Wake so much last year, and the idea is of a magical past where everyone was nice to each other and had conversations at the dinner table, and none of these horrible new-fangled innovations existed yet to ruin everything. I love this idea! I love what it makes us do, how it makes people react, how intoxicating they (we) find it, how they'll fight so hard to show that it's real - and yet it never was. It's the ultimate bittersweet hope, the most incredible Escher-like illusion, and I just find that the most fascinating thing. There never was an Eden! There never was a perfect 1950s family, or a perfect 1880s family, or however far back you'd like to go! The government never was more competent, and people never had more common sense! The world of your childhood was nowhere near as good as this one, you just weren't looking at the crap bits! The best thing about The Better Angels of Our Nature, or I think, is the same thing that means it's going to wind up people who want to be wound up by it: it's a testament to things getting better, faster. Which if you ask me they absolutely, irrefutably are. Ask yourself this: whenabouts in history would you rather live?I mean, I still think he's a bit overoptimistic in places. But at least I'll agree that his views, my views, and the best the world can be are tending to converge. Plus he's a great writer, you know. Stay for the prose, frankly."

There are numerous problems with it so I'll just highlight a few of the biggest.1. The central premise is a straw man. Nobody says that the 20th century was the most violent century ever, apart from people speaking in a purely rhetorical way. It's not an argument that needs to be disproved. Moreover, everyone from professional historians to the person in the street is aware that, at least in the West, violence is less prevalent than it was in the past: there is no dueling or corporal punishment, less capital punishment and torture, fewer cruel sports, etc. So the central argument of the book is neither original nor interesting."

I read the first two hundred pages, then scanned parts of later chapters to see if it got any better. Nope.Pinker's idea that violence has decreased over time is a nice thought, and I hope it's true. But there is very little in this book that was actually convincing. One thing I really couldn't get past is that there is rarely a denominator in his arguments. An example ( made up): There were ten mummified bodies from a certain era. Five showed signs of violence. Pinker implies from this that 50% of people were affected by violence then. Huh? The rate of violence would be five plus all the other people affected by violence, divided by the number of people alive then, not by the number of dead people found. And logic like this is the basis for much of the book.His unscientific interpretation of data continues throughout the book.Worse, much of the data he uses is not strong enough to support his thesis.Finally, this book could have been complete in a couple hundred pages. Pinker needs an editor who can call him on his BS."

If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. --The Federalist, No. 51, James MadisonThis is easily one of the best books of 2011, and I suppose it must already be earmarked as a Pulitzer finalist. It’s about violence, but so much more than that since it strikes at the very core of human nature, the human condition, government, economics, and moral philosophy. Stephen Pinker starts with a simple premise—proving the decline of violence in modern times. This apparently is so controversial to some that he meticulously plots the decline of violence with great historical and statistical detail—this is the descriptive ‘what’ that Dr. Pinker illustrates in the first 2/3rds of the book. The writing is absorbing even if it rings a mildly irreverent tone that betrays a subtle anti-religious bias (especially vis-à-vis politico-religious violence of the Roman Catholic and Old Testament societies—he was a roommate of Harold Bloom after all and is a dedicated humanist) that includes some humorous satire and contemporary references to lighten the mood of such a grim topic. Indeed, his graphic descriptions of torture, rape, suffering and grotesque sadism is enough for even the most macabre minds. Stephen Pinker is a true evolutionary scientist who is adroit in the heuristic of categorization and you can find lists, and lists of lists to aid in understanding the narrative he describes. For example, the declining trend of violence is broken down into these historical themes: 1)	The Pacification Process—our evolution from hunter/gatherers into political, agrarian societies. 2)	The Civilizing Process—included the consolidation of feudal economies into larger kingdoms and empires with central authority, trade and economic specialization.3)	The Humanitarian Revolution—17th and 18th century that marked the that included the Age of Reason and the European Enlightenment4)	The Long Peace—a result of a Kantian trifecta of 1) Democracy, 2) Trade and 3) International organizations5)	The New Peace—arising out of a U.S. led post-cold war globalized world 6)	The Rights Revolutions—exhibited a more finely filtered intolerance of violence on smaller scales that included violence against minorities, women, children, and animals.Within these historical themes we see five major historical forces that helped snuff out violence:1)	The Leviathan—this includes a Hobbesian social contract which grants to the state a full monopoly on the use of violence from within2)	Gentle Commerce—closely connected to #4 this force increases economic incentives for cooperation 3)	Feminization—results in a decline of authoritarian/patriarchal based societies and the empowerment of women as intellectual equals who tend to be more risk-averse and less violent 4)	The Expanding Circle—from a mixture of globalization, commerce, and increased access to information this purportedly increases sympathy and helped usher in the Rights revolution that even extended to animals 5)	The Escalator of Reason—leading to higher levels of intelligence and emotional empathy in conjunction with more sophisticated foundation for managing moralized concerns in favor of the flourishing of all humanityThe second part of the book is what really interested me and seeks to elaborate the psychological factors that dictate our behavior depending on their interplay with our environment and circumstance. Here the statistical reasoning is a little more squishy and correlational residuals are not quite as well characterized—perhaps leading to creeping confirmational bias. Put aside these minor critiques of this part of the book, the ability to marshal data from such varied fields of study as anthropology, economics (including game theory), social psychology, and cognitive neuroscience into a coherent and powerful explanation of the decline of violence. Factors that influence violence are broken down into two categories of human nature: Demons that incite to violence and Angels that slaken the thirst for blood. The demons include the primal urge to dominance, revenge, sadism including the banality of evil, and ideologically driven moralized violence. On the other side of the ledger are qualities such as empathy (or more importantly sympathy, Dr. Pinker distinguishes the two), self-control, our moral sense, and	reason. Here, the meat of the book can be found in the chapters on the moral sense. Stephen Pinker adapts from the ethics, moral foundations, and relational models of moral reasoning of other people like Shweder, Haidt, and Fiske. First, to understand the psychology of moral reasoning (as opposed to objective moral truth itself), we are to understand that moralized beliefs are more than just the avoidance of something distasteful, but is a ‘distinctive mode of thinking about an action’. Thus, moralized beliefs are universalized (should apply to everybody), actionable, and punishable. These beliefs spring from relationships since, in Pinker’s view, evolution acted upon the population and there is no such thing as a philosophically independent human being. Moralized norms generally include relationships, a context (at home, in the street, at church, at work, at the beach, etc.), and are centered around a resource (information or knowledge, food, money, land, sex, labor, etc.). These relationships upon which socioeconomic moral reasoning is based are divided into 4 categories:1)	Communal Sharing—the most basic tribal foundation for moral reasoning emphasizing in-group loyalty, also includes sacred or pure values that are shared within a group and reinforced through rituals and periodic but specific contextual references.2)	Authority Ranking—e.g., military, paternalistic, totalitarian/fascist, divine right etc.3)	Equality Matching—gifts, tit-for-tat, first relational moralized norm to recognize individual autonomy, fairness, and reciprocal altruism4)	Market Pricing/Rational-legal—much more complex relational model of morality that incorporates universal ethical principles, a high level of individual rights, rule-of-law, social contract orientation, and requires a high level of literacy and numeracy along with a grasp of information technology and access to data on price, costs, benefits, risks, alternatives, etc.As an explanation of the basis of moralized norms this seems quite well-developed and accurate. As I read through this chapter, the current debate over the allocation of scarce health care resources came to mind as a good illustration of this relational model of moral reasoning. The argument is usually centered on the diametric poles of the relational models between communal sharing of universalized health care to rational-legal/market pricing model. Here again we see that moralized norms require more than facile affirmation of one or the other relational models since the specific contexts and resources are important. Which relational model should be employed in the state of emergency, or when the resource is a human organ in which a dead individual does not benefit, or when the allocation of the resource in the community is considered a sacred good such as the right to life-sustaining medicine. Personally, I see a need for a hybrid system that protects sacred values of life, and the protection of the vulnerable (e.g., the elderly and children) with market-pricing and equality matching for preventative or non-emergent care should the patient choose--respecting the autonomy of the patient to make the most rational choice given the risks, costs, benefits, and alternatives. The difficulty with market-based health care, just like the difficulty of running a democracy that this market-based/equality matching system is only functional for the government of a citizenry that is based on the moral foundation of reciprocal altruism and rational-legal system of checks and balances. Like a functioning democracy, a market-based health care system requires high literacy and numeracy rates as well as the dissemination of pricing/cost information (something that the AMA has consistently blocked by restricting access to ICT coding for purposes of pricing across hospitals, specialties and regions). This leads to corruption in which supposed medical principles (e.g., doctors and hospitals who have a fiduciary and moral duty to remain financially disinterested in patient decisions) have the ability to obfuscate their own cost and market prices. With these established cartels, it's not difficult to enrich oneself by choking off a few grains of sand at strategic locations in the billions-dollar health care economy. In this model, there is no difference between the orthopedic surgeon recommending back surgery (that evidence from the Dartmouth ATLAS study shows actually does more harm than good), and the Goldman Sachs executives who traded in collateralized debt obligations, which they 1) controled the price through financial cartels, and 2) were at the same time shorting (had proprietary knowledge that they were bad investments and thus were insuring at low cost against loss of these supposed AAA-rated investments). Some favor total universalization of health care based on moral norms, but I simply think this ancient hunter-gatherer communal-based economy is insufficient for the maximization of public good by actually rationing health care resources away from those who by definition need it most (e.g., through price controls and misallocation of scarce resources). Just because other industrialized nations have atavistic central rationing of health care as a vestigial throw-back to the devastation of the post-WWII days when virtually every single resource was rationed (e.g., labor, currency, food, shelter, etc.) is not sufficient rationale for a complex and advance economy like the U.S. to regress to the communal-sharing model of health care delivery.Finally, Stephen Pinker is an evolutionary psychologist and a progressive and here his confirmation bias shines through quite strongly in my view. Much has been made of the Flynn effect that made the claim that IQs are actually increasing as people today are evolving on an organic and biological level to be more intelligent than those who came before us just a few decades ago. I and not quite persuaded by the data just yet. Furthermore, there is an assumption that modern western elites who exert social control are currently and likely to continue in the progressive beneficial model; this may be a bit too optimistic. The utility of some form of the Hobbesian social contract for the government monopoly of violence and justice is pretty clearly established by Dr. Pinker, however, caution is warranted in today’s modern age when an fewer and fewer of our ‘best-and-brightest’ sociopolitical/cultural prophets can do increasingly greater damage. This is a view that Pinker seems to acknowledge, but dismiss this line of thinking by citing historical data that the introduction of nuclear weapons or other WMD are uncorrelated residuals in the decline of violence. However historical data do not necessarily determine future relationships between the concentration of greater technical power into the increasingly fewer hands of elite social engineers and the decline of violence.With the exception of those minor critiques, however, I am sure this book will contribute greatly to our cultural understanding of the psychology of violence, and by extention, peace. The ideas found here will no doubt be debated everywhere from college bowl sessions up to the halls of congress. This can only be a good thing since the overriding theme of the book is a very well-qualified optimism for the flourishing of humanity.Update: 3-22-2012, I increased my review to 5 stars because I have found myself going back to my Kindle version of this book over and over again to review it. It has been a sublime pleasure to breath in the expert wordcraft, and the section on the Demons and Better Angels is like a symphony of well-conducted harmonious truths that come together in very a gratifying way. As a fervent believer, I found it fit very nicely into my worldview even though it is written from the perspective of just as fervent a non-believing skeptic. Such a task is very difficult to do since it takes painstaking effort to extricate one's ego (believer and nonbeliever alike) in the search for more objective reason. I say 'reason' because as Heidegger would say: facts and truth presuppose interpretation."
30,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"""The Better Angels of our Nature"" is an impressive intellectual feat, and the snarky tone was entertaining, but it was a bit like reading the phone book (800 pages of lists within lists). Despite the size of Pinker's tome, the nitty-gritty of peace-making is given short shrift, even though I think this is the most important issue.I don't care too much about the decline in violence over many centuries. I already don't want to live in the Middle Ages, and I couldn't if I wanted to. What matters for all of us living today is whether the current ""long peace"" is sustainable, and on this Pinker disappoints. The answer to this question requires a thorough analysis of why it is currently so unimaginable that, for example, Germany would attack France, as it did in WWI and WWII. A tremendous amount of active, deliberate effort was put into fighting the entropy that would make that possible, but Pinker glosses over this with abstractions. There's a huge story to tell about everything from the Marshall Plan to the European Union to soccer matches b/w sister cities in neighboring countries. I'm not a professional historian so I can't address some of the other critiques on Goodreads about whether this book is all B.S. or not."
31,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,5,"Anyone who follows me on this site knows that I rarely give high scores to books; I like to make very clear distinctions and to indicate what is just good and what is outstanding. And this book is one of those that belongs to the top category: not because it is a perfect one (see below), but because of the breadth, the depth, the insightful, well-founded, nuanced and yet daring way in which Steven Pinker has tackled the very delicate subject of violence throughout human history.It is not feasible to give a thorough presentation of this book. Because it actually is several books together: 1. a global, especially quantitative approach to physical violence in human history in which Pinker establishes that there’s a steady but very clear decline; 2. a tentative explanation of that decline on the macro-level, in which he focuses on the processes of humanization and civilization; and finally 3. a thorough analysis on the microlevel of good and evil in man in general, with particular attention to biological and psychological aspects that promote or reduce violence (our demons and our angels).For me, Pinker's presentation is absolutely convincing, both in his observations and in his analysis. It is in line with my inner conviction (which of course is based on personal perception, rational analysis, as well as emotional orientation), but it also fits in with much of what I have read over the past years, especially on history. Pinker is 100% right that we have to get rid of romantic nostalgia and cultural pessimism (“the past was better, now we go from bad to worse”), which is no more than a reactionary reflex, motivated by emotional (especially fear), ideological and religious blindness. For him it is no coincidence that modernity (with its emphasis on rationality) has gone hand in hand with a humanitarian and civilization-revolution that has led, among other things, to a marked reduction in violence worldwide. And that is true, despite the daily flow of negative news coverage on conflicts and injustices that still plague our world.Yet, as already indicated, this is not a perfect book. For example, I have some reservations about Pinker's tendency to give great emphasis on evolutionary-biological aspects in his search for explanations; I understand that, because that focus has become a trendsetter in his field of study (social psychology in the broadest sense of the word) and has certainly clarified many things. But the sometimes implicit suggestion of Pinker that these are ultimate clarifications (necessary ànd sufficient) seems rather exaggerated to me. Fortunately, he nuances in other places.Second caveat: Pinker regularly warns against statements about future developments, and cites the well-known saying that social scientists better not make any predictions, because they already have so much trouble dealing with the past. Yet Pinker in this book regularly formulates optimistic expectations for the future and that is strange. At the moment, 2018, for example, the world looks slightly different than when he wrote this book (2009-2011) and his unbridled belief in the further advance of liberal humanism and rationalism isn’t that probable any more.Third reservation: Pinker continually illustrates his observations with both general statistical material and specific experiments. What is striking is that these studies are mainly Western (in particular American) oriented. Pinker does make attempts to break out geographically and culturally, but still, his evidence is almost entirely Western (American-European). And that involves a great risk of bias. Also his focus on our recent history (after the second world war), an era of globalization and enormous advances in affluence, technology and science, can also cause a bias (although we will only be able to estimate this in a few decades). And finally a fourth reservation: especially in the concluding paragraphs, the lyricist in Pinker gets the upper hand and he ventures into a statement of faith in rationalism. Of course, he presents strong arguments that support his theory that the decline of violence in human history ultimately is due to the further advance of reason. But just at that moment he leaves his cautious, nuanced style behind him and his language becomes almost religious (in favor of rationalism); on this instance (after almost 700 pages) he introduces the concept of ""modernity"", without much clarification, and that’s a bit problematic.Pinker has garnered a lot of praise with this book, but also a huge wave of criticism, both on historical details, on the validity of his statistical material, on his psychological-biological approach and on his ode to rationalism and liberal humanism. The critics of this book certainly have a point in some of those cases. But if you look at the 700 pages in their entirety and go through them thoroughly, then you can hardly accuse Pinker of simplism, naivety or deception: he constantly warns about exaggerated expectations; nothing is definitive, and a relapse is always possible, he regularly states. But at the same time his overall conclusion is very outspoken: ""while this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, (our) species has also found ways to bring the numbers down, and allow a greater and greater proportion of humanity to live in peace and die of natural causes. For all the tribulations in our lives, for all the troubles that remain in the world, the decline of violence is an accomplishment we can savor, and an impetus to cherish the forces of civilization and enlightenment that made it possible. ""(p. 696)This book is a tough chunk, which takes a lot of effort to wrestle through, and one certainly has not to agree with everything, but it seems to me that this book deserves its place among the most important ones published in the early 21st century!

Where he talks about history, he seems to be broadly correct, and his explanation of his graphs and statistics makes sense to me.Some aspects gave me serious pause, though, equally. The fact that somehow he manages to endorse all his own views and the views of contemporary Western society as the civilising effect, for example. The fact that he dismisses the issues of hate crimes as decreasing, without much examination. (For example, could the fact that trans* people can now pass much better, due to improved medical procedures for transition, be part of the reduction in transphobic violence?) Colonialism gets a pass because it reduced violence, without looking at the economic problems it can cause, etc, etc. I think sometimes Pinker dismisses serious areas of violence based on fairly spurious data like police reports.I’m not sure if this is a kneejerk feeling in myself — “colonialism can’t be an unalloyed good!” — or whether it’s an actual issue in the data. The problem with reading pop psychology is that you just have to take the author’s word for it, at times. I did laugh at his overly optimistic depiction of the fall of homophobia, though. Apparently queer people no longer have anything to fear, and there’s no difficulty in coming out! Um. I need to have a word with you, Mr Pinker.The overall thesis that violence is declining, I’m inclined to accept, on balance. When people immediately cry, “look at the events in Paris recently!”, Pinker would have an answer for them about the origin of that violence (it might’ve taken place in Western Europe, but where does the motivating ideology stem from?), and when people say that crime is clearly on the rise based on reportage, that’s definitely an example of the availability heuristic at work. Also, he is talking specifically about violence, not about crime in general — which surely means that non-violent thefts, white collar crime, etc, are not included in his dataset.While I’m not ultimately sure how much to believe this, I enjoyed Pinker’s discussion of the issues, his potential explanations of the data, and his deconstruction of the violent bases of things like the Bible and the code of chivalry. It’s a heck of a tome, but fascinating, even if you disagree. There’s a lot of criticism out there, but again, because it’s not my field I’d be taking that as much on faith as I have to take this book, so I’m not heading down that rabbit hole.Originally posted here."
33,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,Steven Pinker is fast becoming a favorite author of mine. Everything he writes is so interesting. He really knows how to pick a topic and provide relevant research and feedback for that topic. As a non fiction lover he is straight to the point but still interesting and relevant. Perfect voice for his audience. I think his topic of violence is facinating. We are very easily influenced by this idea that the world is less safe and less secure because of the media and our own warped perceptions. Steven does an excellent job of rectifying this vantage point using statistical evidence and emotional pull. Thank you again Steven for another fantastic read. 
34,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2559314-foppe,1,"Good review.Another useful reviewreview by John GrayAdditional good review here:“Among respectable countries,” Pinker writes, “conquest is no longer a thinkable option. A politician in a democracy today who suggested conquering another country would be met not with counterarguments but with puzzlement, embarrassment, or laughter.” (260) This is an extremely silly assertion. Presumably, when George Bush and Tony Blair sent U.S. and British forces to attack Iraq in 2003, ousted its government, and replaced it with one operating under laws drafted by the Coalition Provisional Authority, this did not count as “conquest,” as these leaders never stated that they launched the war to “conquer” Iraq, but rather “to disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger.”[14] What conqueror has ever pronounced as his goal something other than self-defense and the protection of life and limb? It is on the basis of devices such as this that Pinker’s “Long Peace,” “New Peace,” and “Democratic Peace” rest. (See “Massaging the Numbers,” below.)...According to Pinker, “The three deadliest postwar conflicts were fueled by Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese communist regimes that had a fanatical dedication to outlasting their opponents.” (308) As regards Vietnam, he goes on to show that the Vietnamese were willing to absorb large casualties inflicted on them by the U.S. invaders. For Pinker, this is the fanaticism that fueled the Vietnam war. There is not a word of criticism of the invaders who were willing to inflict those deaths in a distant land; certainly nothing “fanatical,” no mention of the UN Charter, no word like aggression is applied to this attack; and there is no mention anywhere in the book that the United States had supported the French effort at re-colonization, then supported a dictatorship of its own choosing; and that U.S. officials recognized that those fanatical resisters had majority support as we killed vast numbers of them to keep in power our imposed minority government. While acknowledging 800,000 or more “civilian battle deaths” in the Vietnam war, Pinker does not stop to explain how vast numbers of civilians could be killed in “battle” and whether these deaths might possibly represent a gross violation of the laws of war, or how this could happen in an era of rising morality and humanistic feelings, and carried out so ruthlessly by the dominant Civilized power.Nowhere does Pinker mention the massive U.S. chemical warfare in Vietnam (1961-1970), and the estimated “three million Vietnamese, including 500,000 children,…suffering from the effects of toxic chemicals” used during this ugly and very unangelic form of warfare.[40] What makes this suppression especially interesting is that Pinker cites the outlawing and non-use of chemical and biological weapons as evidence of the new evolving higher morality and decline of violence (273-277)—so his dodging of the facts on the massive use of such weapons in Operation Ranch Hand and other U.S. programs in Vietnam is remarkable dishonesty."
35,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,5,"A lot of ink has already been spilled on the question of whether Pinker's claim that the violence of man has diminished enormously in the past centuries and especially in the past decades, is inaccurate or not; in other words whether the quantitative (statistical) support of this claim is correct. I am not able to judge the statistical aspect, but I am quite convinced by the material that he has put together, also in graphs (which he obviously always borrowed from others). What strengthens me in this conviction is that Pinker is very careful with that material, always indicating how reliable or unreliable the statistics are, sometimes warning for less strong numbers or for the interpretation given to the data. But it is absolutely impressive how Pinker substantiates and defends his theses, and also supplements them with narrative material (strong stories, which of course have a more subjective side, but make things more concrete; but also classic, narrative studies). The latter I find a commendable approach, to back up the statistical analyzes; it is a kind of methodological reality check, to see if the conclusions based on the numbers do reflect reality. Of course, this is not obvious, because the stock of narratives in theory is inexhaustible, but if this is done in a balanced and nuanced manner, then it is definitely an advantage, and that is certainly the case with Pinker.Here’s a quote that describes his central claim and at the same time indicates how cautious Pinker actually remains: : “The numbers tell us that war, genocide, and terrorism have declined over the past two decades – not to zero, but by a lot. A mental model in which the world has a constant allotment of violence, so that every cease-fire is reincarnated somewhere else as a new war, and every interlude of peace is just a time-out in which martial tensions build up and seek release, is factually mistaken. Millions of people are alive today because of the civil wars and genocides that did not take place but that would have taken place if the world had remained as it was in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The conditions that favored this happy outcome – democracy, prosperity, decent government, peacekeeping, open economies, and the decline of antihuman ideologies— are not, of course, guaranteed to last forever. But nor are they likely to vanish overnight.”Especially the final chapters, with an elaborate psychological analysis of man regarding good and evil, and in particular violence, sketches an anthropological image (not always very flattering) of man that offers a special added value to anyone who focuses on history, and especially the reasons of human behavior. Pinker dives quite deeply into the current state of science, and it requires some perseverence to follow the accumulation of hypotheses and experiments. But it is worthwhile as a historian to wrestle through this because it gives a fairly comprehensive picture of human existence that makes human action much easier to understand.Of course, Pinker places himself very clearly in a context of progress, based on the use of reason. You may have reservations about that, but I always find it a plus when an author puts his arguments on the table, open for scrutiny. And Pinker does so! Absolutely recommended reading."
36,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35098441-michael-jones,2,"Pinker’s essential view is that human’s possess both instincts toward violence, and instincts toward cooperation, and that our violent instincts used to have the ascendency, but now our peaceable instincts have gained the upper hand. And we should celebrate this. And it does seem clear that civilized societies (some at least) are less violent than some primitive ones. However I have two problems with Pinker’s approach. The first is this: Pinker has in-effect, simply compared a restrained 40 year old with a 9 year old that occasionally gets into fights in the yard, and decided that because the 40 year old doesn't get into fights anymore, his state is preferable. I am overstating it, but that is essentially Pinker’s argument. But I would argue that restraint is a very superficial basis upon which to judge one state better than the other: what about how personally estranged or divided the 40 year old is compared with the 9 year old?; what about how conceited the 40 year old is compared with the 9 year old?; and what about how angry the 40 year old is compared with the 9 year old? My second problem with Pinker’s book is how he ignores evidence that the human heritage is actually a cooperative one, not one characterized by violence. Pinker ignores that the hominin lineage is characterized by small canines, extending back at least 6 million years (small canines indicate low levels of conflict between males); he also ignores both the Palaeolithic art and fossil record, which show barely any depiction of violence; and he dismisses the peaceable bonobos as an oddity, saying they are not representative of a human ancestor, despite evidence showing bonobos better resemble early humans (including small canines), than the more violent chimpanzees. So I would argue human violence appears to be a recent occurence, as does its restraint, which raises all sorts of questions about whether violence is in our genes at all, and if not, what are its origins. None of which Pinker addresses. It is a very superficial treatment, Pinker’s praise is hollow. "
37,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2619634-steven-felicelli,1,"the thesis itself is interesting, but lost in a welter of verbose, unfunny attempts at fish-in-a-barrel wit - historians make good historians - scientists (cognitive or otherwise) make good scientists and I appreciate their spare, science-filled attempts at prose, but when they write 800 pages of mostly crap I already know (I'm being disingenuous, I didn't get past page 200), it's infuriatingand listen for the racist dog whistles - they're subtle but too recurrent to ignore "
38,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32090028-hugo-leal,1,"In his book “The Better Angels of our Nature” Steven Pinker claims that we’re probably living in the most peaceful era in human history. The vision that humans are savages waiting to be tamed by the state is ancient in Western culture. In his book “The Western Illusion of Human Nature”, Marshall Sahlins explains how this view can be traced until the earliest Ancient Greeks. Steven Pinker is its most recent supporter. My review concerns mainly with his approach to prehistoric warfare and assertion that man in a “state of nature” was violent and warlike:- Pinker relies heavily on ethnography. He provides impressive statistics about “war deaths” in several different hunter-gatherer and horticultural groups. First, let me tell you that horticulture has only existed during the last 7000 years and agriculture in the last 10,000. Modern homo sapiens emerged 200,000 years ago. Therefore, during 95% of modern human history, almost all humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. This does make a difference as sedentism increases the potential for conflict as the group has now land to defend and crops to protect. And there are 3 different types of hunter-gatherers: complex, equestrian and nomadic. Complex hunter-gatherers have emerged within the last few thousand years (although there may be some evidence of complex hunting and gathering in France, 20,000 years ago) and equestrian only in the last 500. This is important as in many samples neo-Hobbesians mix all three categories to assert that the majority of hunter-gatherers are warlike. Complex and equestrian hunter-gatherers are almost inherently warlike but nomadic are not.- More, Pinker’s records don’t reflect “man in a state of nature” at all. Instead of being a pacifier force, at first, the encroaching state wreaks havoc in the native population. Tribal groups have been affected by expanding states for at least 5,000 years, not only by Europeans but also by the Mayans, Aztecs, Toltecs, Chimu and Inca peoples in America; Ancient Egypt in North Africa and the Near East, and many more. There is convincing evidence that Ancient Egyptian imperialism affected local patterns of warfare (see “The Prehistory of Warfare in Europe and the Near East” by R. Brian Ferguson, from the book ”War, Peace and Human Nature”) but no assessment has been done about the impact of other civilisations on the patterns of warfare in nearby tribal peoples. Worse, Pinker’s data about deaths in warfare was taken during the 20th century, when almost all indigenous groups were being robbed of their lands and being victims of genocide: “Dispossetion often forced enemy groups into intense competition for greatly reduced resources and the availability of firearms made the resulting conflicts far more destructive than previous conflicts. These increased conflicts combined with other new disturbances in economic and social patterns often placed new stresses on tribal societies and weakened them often to the point that they willingly accepted outside control and welfare” (book “Victims of Progress”). So, instead of ‘pacifying’ the peoples, at first, the colonial powers robbed them of much of their land making them fight for increasingly scarce resources only to impose their iron fist when the damage was done. It is estimated that from 1780 to 1930, the world’s tribal populations were reduced by 30 to 50 million, not only by direct killing but also by disease, suicide, and lack of will to have children. In Australia, the aboriginal population was reduced from 500,000 to an all-time low of 65,000. Indeed, for the Ache and Hiwi peoples, the 1st and 3rd with the highest rates of warfare deaths, all the so-called war deaths involved frontiersmen killing the indigenous peoples. To say that this table represents the level of war deaths that existed prior to the Agricultural Revolution is not just preposterous: it is ridiculous. Jonathan Haas and Matthew Pisticelli summarize this perfectly:“(...) in turning to the historic ethnographic record to support their claims of the ubiquity of warfare in the prehistoric past, [they] fail to consider how hunters and gatherers of the ‘ethnographic present’ may be profoundly different from hunters and gatherers of the more distant archaeological past. How many of these societies were surrounded and circumscribed by existing states; pushed by the rippling effects of other refugees; armed by traders; provoked, directly or indirectly, by missionaries; cut off from traditional lands? The short answer to this is that all of them, by the very fact of having been described and published by anthropologists, have been irrevocably impacted by historic and modern colonial nation states” (p. 173-174 of the chapter “The Prehistory of Warfare: Misled by Ethnography” part of the book “War, Peace and Human Nature”).- Pinker dismisses peaceful hunter-gatherers saying that they have been forced into isolated territories by more powerful neighbors and became shy due to the constant harassment. This is undoubtedly true as the Semai, the Chewong and other Indian hill tribes represent. But he doesn't acknowledge that for his ‘warrior’ societies. For him, the state can only reduce violence not increase it whether it is through harassment or through the imposition of legal courts.- Pinker’s archaeological data is totally flawed. He gleefully cherry-picks sites at will to get evidence at all costs for his theory. I won’t write much of this matter: much of it has been covered by R. Brian Ferguson (see “Pinker’s List: Exaggerating Prehistoric Mortality available in pdf ). What is remarkable is that Pinker’s evidence of ‘war’ only extends to 10,000 to 12,000 BC. There are at least 2,930 skeletal remains recovered at 400 archaeological sites prior to 10,000 BC, so why doesn’t Pinker include them? More, Pinker says that the percentage of homicides could be underestimated. But, apparently, he doesn’t acknowledge that it could work the other way around as accidents of everyday life could be confused with violence. Surveying the whole of European Paleolithic archaeological record Dastungue and de Lumley conclude “the first Homo sapiens do not seem to have led the warrior’s life so often attributed to them” (see “Les maladies des hommes prehistorique du Paleolithique et du Mesolithique” in the book “Le prehistoire française”, p. 612).Also, there are no paleolithic burials of warrior-aged males, so common in the Holocene. In Portugal, a survey of 400 skeletons of a site immediately prior to the agricultural revolution was made: only two skeletons showed clear marks of violence. In Israel, a similar survey of 400 skeletons was made. There was only one evidence of violence: a single crack in a single skull. So, from my cherry-picked data I can calculate that ‘war’ (Pinker often confuses war with single homicides) caused the death of 0.4 % of prehistoric people.- Not surprisingly, Pinker overlooks evidence in prehistoric cave art. There is no evidence of depictions of battles, warriors or fighting prior to 10,000 years ago, when they start to become more common. There are some ambiguous cases but this is contrasted by the thousands of images of animals hunted by prehistoric people and the increasing depictions of warfare after 8,000 BC (see the book “The Nature of Paleolithic Art”).- It needs to be said that population density in prehistory was extremely low. The total human population numbered about 10 million people 10,000 years ago, according to the highest estimates. Therefore, under extremely low population densities and no viable competitors for an abundance of food and game (see the book “Health and the Rise of Civilization” that debunks the theory that prehistoric peoples were living in a ‘daily struggle to survive’), humans would have relied on neighbours for cooperative hunting of large game and for mating. These conditions were not present in the ethnographic present that Pinker claims to represent “man in a state of nature”.- Pinker praises international trade and its role in bringing peace to modern nations. Curiously, there is much evidence of long-distance trade in the Paleolithic. Throughout Europe and large tracts of Asia all the way to Siberia the period from about 40,000 to 25,000 years ago was characterised by the same material cultural tradition – the Aurignacian. There is evidence of trade as far as 400 km. In the Americas the same cultural pattern is found at the beginning of its settlement. “Everyone, across continental spaces and over long stretches of time was making the same tools. All the issues of group boundaries, ‘traditional enemies’, different ethnicities, and territoriality are simply incomplete with a model of open continent-wide social networks.” (The Prehistory of Warfare: Misled by Ethnography).- In the end of the “Pacification Process” chapter, Pinker reveals his cultural chauvinism saying that tribal peoples didn’t develop a more sophisticated culture because “it’s hard to develop these things if the warriors from the next village keep waking you with poisoned arrows, abducting the women and burning your huts” (p.57). So, for him, tribal peoples are ‘backward’ because they live in constant fear of attack and will do everything to become ‘pacified’. Curiously, Daniel Everett wrote a book (“Don’t sleep, there are snakes) about the Piraha hunter-gatherers of the Amazon, a tribe that even lacks numeracy. However, he praises their peacefulness (they only fight when they’re drunk) and says they’re the happiest people he has ever seen. According to him, they lack every sign of being a traumatized culture despite being in contact with traders and missionaries for 300 years (without the state reaching them). Their lack of numbers according do him is because they ”don’t need them”. Also curiously, Pinker knew about the existence of this tribe when he was writing his book. He participated in the documentary “The Amazon Code” and they are very important in his field of linguistics. So, why didn’t he include them? Because they didn’t fit in his theory. They were neither violent nor traumatized. For Pinker, the existence of such tribe is seen as little more than an intellectual inconvenience. Piraha life is no Utopia but it is very far from the life that Pinker, the Scaremonger, describes for that type of society.So, what to make of that? Pinker victimizes himself complaining that what he calls the ""anthropologists of peace"" are very aggressive. No wonder they are aggressive, Pinker (and others like him) willingly misrepresents the data and omits crucial facts. He does everything he can to gather every sort of evidence to suit his theory. He is obviously a scaremonger whose interest is to maintain the status quo. His critique of the 'decivilization' of the 1960's shows that perfectly. For Pinker, everything is alright now, you don't need to do anything, just sit and watch TV while ""progress"" happens.In my opinion, regarding this matter, Pinker is not a scientist. He is a theologian, a preacher. He is a preacher of the modern mythic narrative of Progress. He claims that humanity has been transformed by “reason” and proves it in the same way that a catholic theologian proves the existence of the Holy Trinity. It looks that, for him, tribal peoples are just ignorant natives who will embrace civilisation if they have the opportunity. Pinker is counting on people's preconceptions about the past.I’ll not make a review of the rest of the book, or I’d have to write a book myself (for an excellent critique of the whole book see ""Reality Denial: Steven Pinker’s Apologetics for Western-Imperial Violence""). It’s very interesting how many people praised this book full of flawed evidence, omissions and faulty assumptions. But it’s comprehensible. After all, Steven Pinker is a known intellectual that supports the dominant narrative of western culture: the view that we steadily progressed from the caves until the brightest stage of human evolution – our global society. That is why this book is was so readily accepted. The biggest myth of our culture is that it has no myths. Pinker tells that the world may be bad now but it was a lot worse in ancient times (they didn't even have a TV!). This encourages a certain resignation in people to the current state of affairs as they willingly accept whatever is imposed on them and excuses western imperial violence under the name of ‘pacification’. It all makes sense once you reflect upon it: Pinker is telling people what they want to hear."

Fascinating narrow conclusions are drawn from carefully parsed evidence—and then sweeping conclusions are drawn from highly dubious evidence. Historical insights are used incisively in an argument—then the next argument is undermined by total historical illiteracy. At the end, the reader is left uncertain whether he has read 800 pages of genius, 800 pages of authoritative-sounding-but-meaningless fluff, or something in between. But I’ll go with the last one. Other reviews available online cover most of the ground from nearly every possible angle, so I’ll confine myself to a few, reasonably fresh, points. There is plenty positive to say about the book, but it’s all been said by others, so I’ll mostly steer away from praise, with the note that the entire book is a mixed bag.The only truly fresh point I have is really not substantive, but is interesting and perhaps shows some tendencies in the book. This is that Pinker makes a bizarre claim about table manners. First, Pinker states that historically people were terrified of being stabbed at the dinner table. Maybe. But in any case, to introduce this concept he spends a lot of time talking about how, as a child, he questioned the Western modern “pointless prohibition” in table manners against using one’s knife to move food onto one’s fork. He concludes that such a prohibition is a type of knife taboo preventing spontaneous stabbings at the dinner table. But I have never heard of such an etiquette prohibition. I cannot find any reference to it in any etiquette manual. I cannot find any reference to it on the Internet. In fact, all etiquette references to knife use I can find specifically REQUIRE using a knife to move food onto one’s fork, in lieu of fingers. As far as I can tell, this “rule” is purely a figment of Pinker’s imagination, and maybe an oddity around his house growing up. Why no editor questioned this, I don’t know. It doesn’t really undercut Pinker’s hypothesis in any material way, but it’s just strange, and maybe symptomatic.It’s important to note that for Pinker, violence means not only actions like war, homicide and assault, but more generally any cruel action with a physical component. For Pinker, war and torture are on the same continuum (though not the same thing) as corporal punishment of children and men having fistfights over insults. Reductions in both are considered progress, rather than the first group being considered progress and the second group being considered the sissification of a moribund society. In fairness, though, Pinker does have limits to this continuum—he concludes that some “reductions in violence,” like the elimination of dodgeball for children and the grossly inflated fears of child kidnapping, are silly and not progress at all.Pinker uses no primary sources and the secondary sources he uses are mostly popularizations, many of dubious accuracy, suggesting that he relies little on fresh research and puts his faith in fresh perspectives. Similarly, most of his analysis is analysis by anecdote. Yes, he does have a fair amount of statistics in the first part of the book. But those statistics are confined to two general groups: improvements in European civilization (largely taken, with full attribution, from Clark’s “A Farewell To Alms”), and the prevalence and damages of war. Other than that, it is anecdotes all the way down. And as Lincoln apocryphally said of Spiritualists, for people who like that sort of thing, it’s just about the sort of thing they’d like. But the result is, as with Spiritualism, much of what Pinker has to say is less proof than belief.And to be clear: Pinker’s conclusions are, fundamentally, predicated on his belief system. For Pinker, his belief system has two related pillars: that religion is evil, and that progress is inevitable, as long as we realize that religion is evil. Pinker is a big believer, whether he admits it or not, in the Whig view of history. He views its driver as the removal of religion from human life. In Pinker’s rosy view of the future, everything (at least in European-origin societies) is getting more moral, as people realize that morality has nothing to do with religion, but automatically arises from “the opportunity the world provides for positive-sum games.” Of course, Pinker’s desired end state of empathy, minimal violence, and human happiness is exactly that prescribed by Christianity (and not, contrary to myth, by all religions). The Eschaton is nigh, says Pinker!—just without any eschatology. Pinker thinks that we can all ultimately behave like Francis of Assisi but be totally without religion. Maybe. If history is any guide, though, probably not—no atheist society has ever flourished on Earth. But hey—maybe the future will be different!There are many possible criticisms of Pinker’s belief system. One threshold criticism is that Pinker’s violent opposition to religion clouds his judgment badly. Pinker is very anti-religious, and not in an educated, thoughtful way, but in the same way the Ku Klux Klan is violently anti-Catholic. A second threshold criticism is that Pinker is entirely focused on Europe, and his core hypothesis, that we’re becoming less violent people, is confined entirely to advanced modern societies that are both European in their culture and Christian in their ethos, whether or not they are Christian in their observance. Pinker adduces little or no evidence, other than post World War II global statistics of wars, that non-European societies are becoming less violent, and he fails to consider alternative hypotheses for the reduced violence of European societies, such as that they are moribund and declining, in the Lotos Eater phase of their existence. (Again, to be fair, Pinker does draw a pretty clear picture of reduction in European intra-societal violence from 1200 or so on, long before anyone could claim European civilization became moribund as it is today.)Pinker’s obsession with demonstrating that religion only creates evil leads him into nearly continuous gross historical and logical errors. He repeats the silly canard (fabricated by 19th Century American Protestants to smear Roman Catholics) that Giordano Bruno was executed for believing in heliocentrism, a position accepted today by exactly nobody who knows anything (although repeated by noted flim-flam man Neil deGrasse Tyson in the recent re-make of “Cosmos”). He gullibly buys into the Black Legend hook, line and sinker. He actually cites for the cruelty of Pope Paul IV “the ‘Inquisition’ coffee table book.” He specifically cites, in-line with the text, as his major source for “the human toll . . . . in medieval and early modern Christendom” a book called “The Great Big Book of Horrible Things.” He confuses the First Crusade and the People’s Crusade. He cites the Anabaptists as “pacifist forerunners of today’s Amish and Mennonites,” apparently unaware of their activities in Munster (which would actually have reinforced his hypothesis). He explicitly equates as identical the judicial murder of Thomas More with random, on-the-spot beheadings of entire companies of dancing girls who displeased an Indian potentate. And on and on.Pinker says with a straight face “Christian ideology was hostile to any commercial practice or technological innovation that might eke more wealth out of a given stock of physical resources.” His source for this is a quote from popular historian Barbara Tuchman, to the effect that the medieval Church rejected interest and that St. Jerome said “a merchant can seldom or ever please God.” Of course, the cite lends little support to his conclusion, and the conclusion is ludicrous. In reality, the adoption of new commercial practices and technological changes up until the Renaissance was led by or cooperated with by religious entities, in large part to expand the productivity of the vast lands owned by the Church. These advances ranged from corporate, long-time-horizon management of land by monks to a wide variety of technological advances, such as improvements in plowing, threshing and grinding.Pinker also ignores that the medieval Church was the primary instrument of opposition to medieval violence. He talks about how the Church celebrated saints who were gruesomely martyred, implying that rather than being used to show heroism, such examples were somehow used to show how violence against others was good. He ignores the pacifism of the Church (complete until about 1000 A.D., incomplete thereafter, when feudalistic concepts infiltrated, leading in part to the Crusades). He ignores the Peace of God. And so forth. For Pinker, religion is an unmitigated bad, and when it is gone, we will all be happy and free. And he tailors his facts and analysis to fit his conclusion.On the other hand, even with its lacks, the book has many good points. It’s refreshing in its lack of ideology (apart from the ideology of atheism). Pinker does not shrink for ideological reasons from addressing unpleasant points. For example, when he talks about the decline in infanticide, he directly addresses whether it is correct to say infanticide has dropped at the same time that abortion has increased by at least the same amount, since abortion logically is indistinguishable from infanticide. (He concludes, in essence, that people don’t feel that abortion is infanticide, and anyway abortion rates have recently dropped too, which he interprets as reinforcing his hypothesis.) Most writers would have simply said that abortion is not the same thing as infanticide and moved on, afraid of being denounced by their liberal friends and no longer being invited to the right dinner parties. At the same time, Pinker does manage to pretty frequently fall into occasional silly left-wing tropes. For example, when talking about the demonization of political opponents, he talks about the “victims of Communist atrocities”—but then feels obliged to add also “the victims of their opposite number, the right wing-dictatorships in Chile, Argentina, Indonesia and El Salvador.” Equating 100 million people exterminated as part of a deliberate ideological program of Communism with maybe 100,000 killed in civil wars is silly, but pretty much par for the course among leftist types. But, to be fair, given his general ability to resist being politically correct, it’s hard to fault Pinker’s occasional lapses in this area.	Finally, and oddly, most of the bad reviews on Amazon of Pinker’s book are not objecting to his anti-religious bigotry. Instead, they object to an underlying premise of his thesis—that prior to recorded history, violence was extreme and endemic. I had thought that this was unexceptional—all primitive societies were horrifically brutal and had stratospherically high rates of battle death. This has been common knowledge since Lawrence Keeley, using detailed anthropological data, exploded the myth of the Noble Savage. But apparently there are a large number of, or at least a small number of loud dead enders in this area, who maintain that pre-historical peoples were gentle, meek and mild, gathering nuts and berries hand-in-hand while singing paeans against sexism and racism, in contrast to eeeeevil modern societies. It’s really not worth even considering such silliness, but it’s interesting that fantasists of this sort exist and are willing to attach their names to their fantasies.Anyway—this book may be worth reading if you have a ton of extra time, or if you’re particularly interested in the topic. It has certain parallels to studies of the Great Divergence, and once you realize that what Pinker really means is that Europeans have reduced violence over time, leading to improved societies relative to the rest of the world’s societies, it has even more parallels. But unless you’re interested in reading this bookstop for some specialized reason, you’re probably better off spending your time doing something else."
40,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5565551-damien,5,"In reviewing The Better Angels of our Nature, I find myself struggling to avoid the absolutes that Pinker so deftly dodges in this epic study of the history of violence in humankinds history. This book is possibly the best structured arguement I have read (even if it does result in a book that you clearly need to pick up with both hands so as to not inflict spinal damage on yourself) and leaves you with a fresh perspective on things that you took as given in so many ways.To even begin to try and summarise the journey that Pinker takes us on here would be to do it a disservice. No stone is left unturned as Pinker takes us through a detailed statistical analysis of the levels of violence through the ages. On top of this we are given a detailed analysis of, not just the volumes of violence that are clearly shown to have reduce over time and colminate in what is often now referred to as 'The Long Peace', but also the shift in the social norms that humans have towards the tolerance of violence - from 'good' families enjoying a public execution in public squares for entertainment to the 'rights movement' of the twentieth century that sort to ensure protection of not just women, children and homosexuals but even the protection of the rights of animals. The last few hundred pages then shift to a neurological and psychological study of what causes humans to act violently and how and why this might be trending down.Overall, Pinker leaves us with a positive view of the future and of how much progress we have made already. He suggests that 'the good old days' that we often pine for may not have been so good as we might like to paint them and that, for all the criticism we may dole out to it, that modernity has in many ways made our life considerably better.The Better Angels of our Nature is a staggering piece of reasearch in both its breadth and depth. I am sure that this research may be challenged by opposing views but, given the level of research on display here, it would have to be a very solid counterpoint to enter the debate. And it's this point in itself that may support Pinker - the fact that we can have this level of open discussion is evidence in itself of how far we have come."
41,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3323634-angus,1,"This hot-shot alleged Harvard pseudo-intellectual guy claims that the current century is the most non violent period in Human history. Really? So this Volvo driving Carpetbagger does some Advanced Geometry and comes up all these fancy statistics. I didn't read the book because it has way too many words, but what is the underlying agenda of Mr. Pinker? Without up, there's no down. Without dark, there is no light. Without violence there is no peace. So, if we, as a species do not make an effort to increase violence, there will be no peace. It's like a Chinese riddle."
42,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6037694-patrdr,1,"Unfair perhaps as this didn't get much past my 50 page not worth it standard. Supposedly high brow with great reviews but I found the early going a puerile compendium of well known examples of the history of human viciousness. I will confess to being particularly put off by the sophomoric take on the nasty bits of the old testament. So I decided time would be better spent than plodding through this. Pity, because I wanted to get a better fix on the theme of progress as an antidote to the pessimism that seems to dominate social comment."

In general the author's ideas are not well enough substantiated, though there are many anecdotes and various studies cited. Also, the author is dismissive of some very important elements in world history. Pinker has an interesting thesis, but his support for it is undermined by not only the shear breadth of his topic which has a myriad of variations that cannot all be addressed, but also by the recurring appearance of academic arrogance and assumption."

47,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/228441-andrewh,2,"I have now read three of Pinker's books and this was certainly the worst of the three and the most annoying (infuriating, in places). The premise is that the world is becoming a less violent (and, therefore, better) place over time - he acknowledges that this is a liberal-baiting plot and then sets out to 'prove' this theory with a blizzard of dubious datasets, which he sees as objective evidence of his claims, as if 'data' fell from the sky unalloyed, rather than being the products of human artifice and thought processes (they are constructs, like ideology - they are an ideology some might argue). The core argument itself really makes two distinct claims - first, that humankind is becoming less warlike (less collectively violent); second, that humankind is becoming less violent in every other sense (less individually or socially violent). The first argument is probably harder to sustain, in my view, and his methodology is based not on the sheer numbers of violent death occasioned by armed conflict (which peaked in the 20th century with WWII, not to mention WWI), but by the ratio of deaths caused by wars/conflict per 100,000 of the population - quite why this ratio is more meaningful than the actual numbers of deaths is not clear to me (and probably little consolation to the dead). The datasets are hard to judge, given that accurate records probably do not exist before the 20th century, and the main thrust of his argument is that, notwithstanding WWII, we are now in a period of Long Peace - this is a highly dubious construct and based on the somewhat Western-centric view that inter-state wars among great powers are not happening any longer (or not so far), while there have been any number of deadly conflicts between and inside smaller states (Syria and Yemen, for just two examples at present). The Cold War was, of course, based on the mutual threat of total nuclear annihilation, so to declare that era as one of 'peace' seems massively complacent - and the threat is still there. This argument is also, overall, reminiscent of Fukuyama's somewhat premature End of History claim, which has now been fairly discredited (to be fair, even by the author himself). The whole argument is though tied up with a larger, more problematic discourse of (neo-)liberal (Western) exceptionalism.Many scholars have made claims about the end of war (e.g. John Mueller, often quoted here) but the way Pinker seems to argue it, the only reason states go to war is because they are too backward to do anything else. He seems oblivious to the structural inequalities of the international system or indeed of society as a whole, and the way this breeds the conditions for violence. His arguments about the decline of societal violence are not as problematic, as they are fairly obvious (albeit Whiggish), but he is again seemingly unconcerned with the actual political processes that led to the Human Rights revolution, or Civil Rights - these were the result of massive, sustained resistance to the elites by brave and principled people, who often died or were imprisoned for their trouble, and who were met with state violence (another one overlooked here). Pinker prefers to interpret these acts of progress in terms of evolutionary psychology, as if they were somehow inevitable (that they are still being resisted in the USA, again, seems to have escaped his attention). Pinker is undoubtedly a talented researcher and has put a huge amount of work into this book, although its argument is either quite specious or simply ignores massive counter-examples. He uses 'data' to gain a patina of objectivity but this, and his selective use of certain scholars (such as Mueller), only underlines that this is a deeply polemical argument: he is advocating a classical liberal vision of the world, which is probably anathema to many on the left, given that it largely endorses the political and economic current status quo and ignores all examples of structural violence (cf Galtung). His true colours are perhaps revealed in his constant critiquing of the 1960s as the era when crime (i.e. violence) went up (in the US) - this was also the time of maximum political consciousness by many in the US, and elsewhere, and the counter-revolution which took place in the 70s/80s is still playing out today. "
48,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68744060-brayton-cole,1,"Well, there are bits where Pinker quotes from research on the history of violence, and the studies he's quoting seem reasonably well-done. That's the good part. The bad part is that everything Pinker personally contributes to the discussion is loaded down with bizarre judgments and egregious logical fallacies. And this is from somebody who started the book roughly agreeing with his central point that violence has declined. I got to page two hundred and some before realizing that I did not value my time so lightly as to slog through the rest just to be able to say I'd read all of it.Just for a taste:*Christianity's reverence for the crucifixion and martyr stories means that it approves of torture. While we're on the subject of religion, he endorses the pagan Christ/Christ myth theory despite it being both thoroughly discredited and irrelevant to his central point. He also doesn't seem to get the point of either the sacrifice of Isaac or Solomon's judgment between the two mothers.*People in the past entertained themselves with violent narratives (e.g. Grimm), which shows they were violent; people today entertain themselves with much more explicitly violent narratives (video games and movies), but we're not violent so that shows we're better at compartmentalizing.*Pinker disapproves, repeatedly, of people who say violence has declined because the culture has become less violent. Instead he says that violence has declined because of ... improved hygiene and manners. We're less gross so we don't want to hit each other so much. Yes, seriously.*He repeatedly uses phrases like ""[X] would horrify us today"" when it's clear that ""us"" means ""people who share the values of Steven Pinker."" He appears unaware that there are other kinds of people. What kind of twenty-first century person would respond to insults to his family with violence? Nobody with tenure, and that's for sure. Other people don't count.*He drags in weird, trivial bits of cultural fluff to prove unclear points; at one point he cites The Five Hundred Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins, by Dr. Seuss. He is also shocked, shocked, that people gave violent names like ""bikini"" and ""atomic fireball"" for innocent things like swimsuits and candy.*There's a long chapter on the end of wars between major powers since 1953. The most obvious explanation would be that nukes act as a strong deterrent. He eventually brings that up, but his arguments against it are, shall we say, unconvincing (don't want to get into the details) because he fails to consider that the relevant variable was not the weapons themselves, but the development of ICBMs that let them strike virtually anywhere, unstoppably, on less than an hour's notice.That's all from the first quarter of the book. All in all, it reads like he started with a conclusion in mind and picked out evidence to support it, rather than drawing his conclusions from the evidence. Secular humanism saved us from the big dumb scary past. When it didn't, it wasn't secular humanism after all. Etc., etc."
49,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7693283-terry-pearce,2,"I started to get a bit suspicious of Pinker's motives, subtexts, omissions and statistics by about hour 4-5 of 35 on this audiobook. Then after nearly 6, I read some of the online crit. Upshot... I'm not sure I want to wade through the remaining 30 hours of this.On the surface of it, he's just trying to show there's a downward trend in violence. It's not explicitly saying the trend will continue, or pushing any ideology connected with the trend that should therefore be upheld. But the subtext I got was that actually, he is. That actually, his message is: the advancement -- the civilisation -- that really counts is really *Western neoliberal* civilisation, and is the key to reducing violence and becoming all humans can be. Some of the crit uses the term 'neoliberal apologist', and actually I'm not sure this can easily be refuted as a label.Part of all this is some worrying stuff about what he chooses to focus on in terms of violence and what he chooses to externalise, and what probably worried me most is how he framed things so that it's more about the nonviolence benefits for Western democracies, even when we achieve those by externalising violence throughout the world, or paying prices unconnected with violence per se, but having human misery costs. He seems to use definition and focus in the way it best suits his hypotheses (for example focusing on the fact that the major powers haven't been at war with each other, and downplaying for instance US state terrorism, etc. A lot of the crit suggests he cherry-picks the stats and interprets them oddly, which further worries me. There are worrying things about how he explains away the two world wars, and his narrative of the rise in violence starting in the sixties is kinda myopic.A kicker is, for a heavily stats-based historical book, its reputation with historians and statisticians seems to be in the toilet. It's journalism moreso than history, stats or any kind of science, I think.A shame, because I wanted to believe to some extent in his hypothesis. I don't necessarily complete disbelieve it at all levels. I do think that, in lots of ways going beyond just violence levels, we take for granted some of humanity's great achievements and how far we've come, and forget how bad things were at other times.I would read on anyway just to get the full skinny on his view even now I'm deeply unsure about it, but another 30 hours of this...? No."
50,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12620694-brian-pacini,5,"***A bit late, but I finally wrote a review***	People, we are some messed up people. I broke a vow to never read a book with the word angel in it and read this book thinking it would be somewhat uplifting, a milkshake after an excruciating race, a greasy hamburger after a long camping expedition. Hey, we made it. We’re no longer extremely violent. I even read it for ammo in debates against conservative snowflakes who vote and view the world out of fear. The world’s not that bad, you all. Stop stocking up on guns, prepper guides, and moving to covenant controlled compounds. (This is coming from someone who wrote a quasi-apocalyptic novel). 	And much of that is true. Yes, this is the safest time to be alive. Yes, the crime rates and chances to be killed has decreased many fold. Pinker does a wonderful job of detailing this all out, both through stats and anecdotes and across multiple disciplines—from history to psychology to evolutionary biology to philosophy. 	However, I finished this book feeling dirty and carrying a more pessimistic view of humanity. We were so brutal for so long this current Long Peace just seems like an anomaly. Maybe it’s the pages and pages of charts around murder rates and atrocities. Maybe, it’s tidbits like this: The reason we have post-partum depression is to cope with the need to commit infanticide. Yes, try reading 700 pages of why we are so violent and feel good about the better angels of our nature. 	That said, this book is a treasure trove of facts, stats, and learnings that opens the door to many different areas of study, from atrocities and history to psychological studies on what makes us violent. If you like long (sometimes dry) non-fiction and have any interest the aforementioned academic disciplines I would recommend it. 	I would also love to see this book updated every ten years or so. It does feel a bit lacking since it was published in 2011; there is no mention of the current political climate and Pinker could do the world a great service by spending more time on how media makes money by exploiting fear and anger. Cough…and Russia. "

I was hoping to purchase this piece on the day it became available, power through it, and be one of the first to post a review on Amazon.This was before seeing the thing...But after pumping through the ~700 pages I feel its worth the size. Pinker dives through history, philosophy, psychology and politics to identify the apparent causes for the 'decline in violence.'I would describe reading the book as a combo of history, psychology and professional polemic. Obviously in picking up such a book, you're going to hear of some of the more gruesome and depressing events in human history, and some pretty scathing reviews of religon and politics. Nonetheless Pinker pursues his thesis scientifically (with a touch of humour) and even with some rigourous finger pointing maintains objectivity.While this piece is amazing, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't keen on the thought of this much non-fiction crammed into one book, and Pinker's style is very dense (in the compact not hurp durp sense.) this isn't really a 'translated into plain-speak' kinda of book (fair warning).Essentially if you've got the time, and the inclination this book will certainly give you food for thought, roughly a years feeding too..."

Reading reviews or discussions of it is not enough; Pinker just covers too much and rebuts too many possible criticisms. It's very long, as a result, but absorbing."

There is a reason that I made reason the last of the better angels of our nature. Once a society has a degree of civilization in place, it is reason that offers the greatest degree of hope for further reducing violence. The other angels have been with us for as long as we've been human, but during most of our long existence they have been unable to prevent war, slavery, despotism, institutionalized sadism, and the oppression of women. As important as they are, empathy, self-control, and the moral sense have too few degrees of freedom, and too restricted a range of application, to explain the advances of recent decades and centuries.
Not long ago, I was playing the game Table Talk with a group of adults and one of the questions was something like, “If you could live in any time and place, what would it be?” We went around the circle and people gave answers like, “I'd move to Cabo (Mexico) in a heartbeat” or, “I'd love to have been a member of Henry VIII's court”, and when my turn came up, the only answer I could give was, “Assuming I'm still me in this fantasy, there's nowhere I would rather live than right here in Canada, right now. I can't think of a time or place that is safer, healthier, and offers more opportunities for women.” Granting that there are many similarly salubrious locales around the world today, there sure weren't throughout history: Would I rather have lived in ancient Greece, seeing my husband and sons off to endless wars, protecting myself and daughters from foreign invaders? Would I rather have lived in the dungheap of the European Middle Ages, under the heavy yoke of the Church and threat of the Inquisition? Would I rather have lived in a little house on the prairie, toiling dawn to dusk, pumping out a kid per year, praying at least a couple of them would survive to adulthood? Living just about anywhere in the early-to-mid-twentieth century would have been a dangerous and fretful experience – if the wars didn't come to me, my menfolk would have went to the wars; leaving me to negotiate a public sphere I was unprepared for – and even in the context of the game we were playing, I couldn't imagine a time and place that I would rather live in than right here, right now. And I didn't need the supporting stats from Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined to garner grudging nods of agreement from both the women and the men I was playing Table Talk with: No matter how pessimistic the nightly news might be, this part of the world just feels safer than ever before. Pinker himself intuited this shift, and this book attempts to explain how we got to today's peaceableness after a long human history of violence, sadism, discourtesy, and disregard for others.
I am sometimes asked, “How do you know there won’t be a war tomorrow (or a genocide, or an act of terrorism) that will refute your whole thesis?” The question misses the point of this book. The point is not that we have entered an Age of Aquarius in which every last earthling has been pacified forever. It is that substantial reductions in violence have taken place, and it is important to understand them.
In May of this year, in a kind of virtual convocation address, Bill Gates tweeted to college grads, “If I could give each of you a graduation present, it would be this – the most inspiring book I've ever read”, to which he attached an image of The Better Angels of our Nature. Later, Gates tweeted, “This is the most peaceful time in human history. That matters because if you think the world is getting better, you want to spread the progress to more people and places. It doesn't mean you ignore the serious problems we face. It just means you believe they can be solved.” It was, therefore, on Bill Gates' recommendation that I picked up this book, and having now read it six years post-publication, I also benefit from the learned reactions of previous readers; which I admit I needed because even as I was reading, I wasn't totally buying Pinker's scholarship: I am not surprised to see on Goodreads that the most popular reviews give it either one or five stars. I don't want to retread worn ground, so here are links to what I found to be the best published perspectives on The Better Angels of our Nature:•Richard Feloni, on the heels of Bill Gates' endorsement, enthusiastically summarised Pinker's thesis in Business Insider.•John Gray tore apart Pinker's “questionable” conclusions in The Guardian. •And Elizabeth Kolbert staked out the skeptical middle ground, more or less where I find myself, in The New Yorker. 
For all the violence that remains in the world, we are living in an extraordinary age. Perhaps it is a snapshot in a progression to an even greater peace. Perhaps it is a bottoming out to a new normal, with the easy reductions all plucked and additional ones harder and harder to reach. Perhaps it is a lucky confluence of good fortune that will soon unravel. But regardless of how the trends extrapolate into the future, something remarkable has brought us to the present.
 Anyone who wants to know the specifics of this book can easily follow my links (or otherwise Google around), so all I want to talk about is my experience. For about the first two thirds of The Better Angels of our Nature, Pinker covers the known and conjectured history of the world, summarising everything in graphs and tables; constantly explaining how he created his graphs, what can be ignored in them, what he ignored while compiling them. I had the uneasy feeling that, as I am not a statistician, I would just need to take his word for everything, and that undermined his persuasiveness. The last third concerns the working of the human brain, and Pinker recounts dozens and dozens of social science and neurobiology experiments, and these were even duller in their recounting than the previous graphs. Whenever Pinker was telling a narrative, I was engaged; when he was sharing (questionable) facts, I was bored. And as the font was rather smallish and my mind tended to drift in the duller bits, I clocked myself at reading a paltry 35 pages/hour: at a not totally unreasonable 700 pages before the footnotes, this book still took far too long to read. I was neither completely entertained or enlightened by what I found here.And yet, I do believe that Pinker made a valiant attempt to explain a phenomenon that most of us intuitively feel to be true. And I do agree with Bill Gates that feeling hopeful about the world leads us to not give up on it. I do think that The Better Angels of our Nature is a worthwhile read, but I would encourage any new readers to also dig into the contrary opinions out there. My weaselly instincts want me to split the difference between the most popular reviews and give this three stars, but the better angels of my nature want me to take a stand, so I'm nudging up to four: this book had more good than not in it.

58,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68404339-alex-o-connor,2,"I really wanted to like this book, but it just had so many problems. I feel like the author was completely west-centric. Yes, violence has declined in the West, but it certainly has not in many other areas. His basic argument for why this was the case was because rationality, reason, and Enlightenment philosophy had displaced ""crude religion and faith"" as the public morality. In doing this, Pinker completely disregarded the philosophical undertakings of countless ""crude religious folk"" in crafting this new age of Enlightenment. Additionally, if that were the case, why are the atheistic regimes of Communist China and the Soviet Union the most deadly of any regime in any time in all of history? He also seems to believe that the Catholic church in the middle ages was purely a religious body, when if anything, it was primarily a political body with religious overtones, much like the Roman emperors that proceeded it. the Inquisition had much more in common with the Gestapo than the monks. The author also seemed to pretty unfairly target Christianity. When discussing religious atrocities, there are certainly other groups that did the exact same things, or worse things in the name of their God. It is a real shame, because I do feel like several of Pinker's arguments had merit. The book was also very well written. I just wish he could have kept his complete contempt of religion, religious people, and everything they have done to better humankind out of his narrative. "
59,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62187194-annag,3,"I found this book interesting, but having read War! What Is It Good For?: Conflict and the Progress of Civilization from Primates to Robots which covers very similar territory to this book, but provides a more compelling narrative, I was slightly disappointed.The first chapters look at different types of violence - war, rape, genocide, murder, torture, slavery etc... and give statistical evidence that it has been reduced over time. In some cases the evidence is hard to come by because historic records are very incomplete, but you still get a 20 page chapter with graphs to tell you that. Ian Morris' book makes the same point in half the time. Alongside the statistical analysis, Pinker explains that violence has reduced due to the coercive power of the government and the analysis of the difference in rates of violence between the USA and Europe was fascinating and the observation that previous elites were more violent, not lower social classes, again however I felt the Ian Morris book provided more insight on how the process unfolds.This book finishes with an examination of the forces that guide violence - seeking gain, sadism, ideology, revenge, need for security etc... This part was a bit short on examples and to me felt like having spent so much time demonstrating that violence has declined there were no more pages left to really examine why people were giving in to these forces less now than in the past.If I hadn't read the other book, I'd have rated this very highly, but obviously I preferred Ian Morris' work."
60,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6631040-jan,5,"Stunning book! Probably the most fascinating nonfiction I've ever found!In recorded form, this was 36+ hours long, but it was divided into sections that seemed like full books in themselves.What a work of scholarship! In order to demonstrate the shift toward greater kindness and less violence in the world, Steven Pinker first examined, thoroughly, the many forms that cruelty has taken since our earliest primate ancestors. He then summarized the relevant studies in the sciences and social sciences that document changes in human behavior that make this the safest time in history for a human being to live. He goes into the neuroscience of self-control, as well as many other psychological and sociological explorations of ""the better angels of our nature."" (Of course, I felt gratified that he found intelligence and education highly correlated with liberal political views - and liberal views the ones that represent our ""better nature""!)Some parts of the book were too technical to enjoy - I just tuned them out. But other parts felt so rich in important new concepts that I'm going back over them. This whole book is one that I know I'll revisit many times!"

62,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,5,"Pinker's Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined is one of the most impressive books I've ever read, which is not to say that I found it always convincing. This book is not only interesting because most readers will learn a lot, it's also interesting, perhaps even inspiring, to observe Pinker attempting to prove his thesis that violence has declined -- and then to explain the whys. I sometimes find myself thinking ""this guy must have spent months in the library."" Maybe he had his students do the preliminary research.There's an interesting, and in my case dual, intuition at work when we talk about violence. On the one hand, I feel like the world must be more violent than ever before. After all, guns, nukes, tanks, drones. On the other hand, I've often noticed that when I ask my students whether they'd like to travel into the past, or when they'd travel to, they don't want to go at all. For a long time, I thought they were just overly cautious or just not particularly curious about history yet. But now I've come to wonder if they just understand that living in a developed nation is in many ways very comfortable compared to living in the past. For many of those students, they know that a trip into the past could lead to discrimination, violence, or in some cases, enslavement. Pinker attempts to put intuition aside and, as much as possible, focuses on data, which is presented in many charts and graphs.Here are some highlights and observations, which I've updated as I read this book.-Why did violence in the USA increase during the 60s? Pinker offers a few takedowns of the Baby Boomers here. While I've mostly encountered the 60s as a righteous time for the counter culture, Pinker points to suggestions that doing what you feel like sometimes meant being violent or even rape. But what about the dominant cultural norms? I didn't understand why he would not have cited the Vietnam War and its draft as an influence. If the central government is usually a pacifying force, what happens when it begins to act in a way that people consider ignoble?-The Spanish Inquisition killed a lot of people in its program of, paraphrasing, ""destroying lives to save souls.""-Erasmus wrote a book on etiquette and hygiene -- I was really shocked by the number of things that I take for granted as gross that needed to be expressed in this book. It seems like hygiene is a big deal, and for many reasons. In genocide, for example, it's not uncommon to dehumanize the target group by denying them access to hygiene. ""Look at them -- they're like disgusting animals.""-I don't think we fully understand what torture -- and torture in public places -- was like. I actually went to a museum about torture in Prague once. It was interesting but disturbing. The idea that people would routinely be tortured in public places is something I don't think people understand when they view the past romantically.-Keen's Empathy and the Novel gets a nod here. So someone other than me did read that book.-Pinker writes with clarity, wit, and insight. I particularly enjoyed when his grandmother told him to wear a watch. He is usually generous in his consideration of counter claims and gentle in his rebuttals. But he is also merciless in his exploration. He'll make a claim and support it once, twice, three times, four times... Bring in the Count from Sesame Street.-This is one of the only TED talk books I've read in which the book is worth reading. (Pinker's TED talk on this subject is good, btw.)-Apparently Peacekeeping forces are very effective! ""Democide"" is a word! Democracy and international trade have many benefits! Kant is a bright fellow, who knew?-Scenario: a married couple and one spouse kills another. A few decades ago, the victim was almost as likely to be male as female. The number of victims has fallen. Why? Pinker argues that feminists brought greater awareness of the violence of battery. There is a lot of evidence that men are far more likely to be violent than women, so what explains the decrease in both sexes? Pinker suggests that what most likely happened is that battered women, when given an escape like a shelter or greater acceptance and encouragement by the culture to speak out, were less likely to murder their partners and less likely to be murdered (and battered) themselves. I swear I encounter theories and trends that are completely new to me in every chapter.-Theories on postpartum depression and infanticide are presented in succession. I'm not sure I'm skilled and knowledgeable enough to represent either theory, but I note them because I was so surprised by them. We find infanticide awful and perhaps also unnatural, but Pinker presents evidence that, though it's awful, it may be natural from an evolutionary point of view. As for postpartum depression, he points to evidence that it is more likely to correlate to certain situations than hormones. If I understand him, he's interpreting the data as suggesting that ppd is a natural phenomena that allows mothers to consider whether they can care for the child; if they decide, yes, the family can provide for the newborn, then love tends to follow. Those mothers who fall in love instantly with their newborns may in some ways be privileged.""Combine narcissism with nationalism, and you get a deadly phenomenon that political scientists call ressentement (French for resentment): the conviction that one's nation or civilization has a historical right to greatness despite its lowly status, which can only be explained by the malevolence of an internal or external foe.""Taken from a discussion of ideology as an ""inner demon"" that leads to violence. ""Groups can breed a number of pathologies of thought. One of them is polarization. Throw a bunch of people with roughly similar opinions into a group to hash them out, and the opinions will become more similar to one another, and more extreme as well. [...] The overall problem is that groups take on an identity of their own in people's minds, and individuals' desire to be accepted within a group, and to promote its standing in comparison to other groups, can override their better judgment.""""The alternative to the myth of pure evil is that most of the harm that people visit on one another comes from motives that are found in every normal person. And the corollary is that much of the decline of violence comes from people exercising these motives less often, less fully, or in fewer circumstances. [...] The mere process of identifying our inner demons may be a first step to bringing them under control.""University graduates who studied the humanities and social sciences could test the quality of their education, given or received, by how familiar much of this text is to them.Pinker looks at the Flynn Effect -- which notes that IQ scores rise over time -- and wonders if an equivalent moral effect has led to a decline in violence.""For all the tribulations in our lives, for all the troubles that remain in the world, the decline of violence is an accomplishment we can savor, and an impetus to cherish the forces of civilization and enlightenment that made it possible.""I read perhaps a half dozen shorter books after starting this one. This book might be better viewed as a sort of encyclopedia. I borrowed it from the library, but I will keep my eyes open for it the next time I'm at a book store. Even those who would challenge the thesis would be wrong to diminish what Pinker attempted here."
63,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6110237-andreea,5,"Before reading this book I was one of the people who thought violence was cyclical and that every one hundred years we might end up having a war. It is something very easy to believe and preach when you don’t really look into the facts. Steven Pinker’s book is set to debunk such myths that we liked to believe in for a while. He tries to gather an extended set of figures to prove his theory, that violence has steadily declined until our times and that we live in the most peaceful era of humanity. He uses facts and figures for all type of violence: homicides, wars, genocides, domestic violence. It was very easy to like this book, because it writes about ideas that I also share. For example, we can teach morality without the means of religion. Those that claim religion is the only way to make people act morally, should start by first reading the books of the Old Testament. Furthermore, an increase of the level of education was noticed in parallel with a decrease in the one of violence. It is very difficult to prove a relation of causality between them. What I liked less is that some forms of violence were discussed in less detail than others. I felt like Pinker spent a lot more pages discussing about war (both inter- and intra-state) and homicide than regarding violence against women and children and genocide. And I understand the reasoning behind the decision, namely, those forms of violence cause a larger number of victims; but it felt like the book was rushed a bit to list some other forms of violence just for diversity’s sake and then move on to conclusions. As a bonus I also got the answer to some questions I always asked myself when my mother was insisting I should read “The code of good manners” when I was a child. Because, at some point in history, society was lacking what we now consider basic education.I just wish I would have read this book faster, but I started it in a period when it was difficult for me to find enough reading time. It is not an easy book due to the numbers and charts that one has to understand so it takes a lot of time to actually read it properly. "
64,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,5,Fascinating and I agree for the most part. But there are some missing connections and it's an ethnocentric view of violence. Like did enlightenment ideas also diminish violence in the East? 
65,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4783921-david-msomba,5,"We do live in the best time in the world history,and Steven Pinker had to compile a book of 800+ pages,to convince humanity that violence has been declining throughout human history and what we did to achieve that and what we should keep on doing,inorder to enjoy the peaceful,prosperous world.Despite covering wide range of subjects,I mean alot has been covered in this massive book,from political philosophy,history,sociology to human rights,psychology and neuroscience and many more other subjects,with alot of statistics and graphs,you have to admire Steven Pinker`s approach,he manage to make this huge book highly enjoyable,entertaining, interesting,packed with mind blowing historical facts & easy readiable not a dry,dull book of historical facts and statistical data I presume it was before I picked it up.One downside though,you need alot of time investment to go through this one and also a bit of open mind approach especially if you are religious or conservative.I agree with everything that Pinker has presented in this book,and I do believe is among the top 5 greatest books that I have pick up this year,including it's sequal Enlightment Now and The Moral Arc by Michael Shermer.I highly recommend this if you a looking for an optimistic book,a book to understand the world or a guide on how to create a better moral compass on 21the century.And if you have decided to pickup this book also I would recommend it's sequal, Enlightment now and The Moral Arc by Michael Shermer,there is so much to be learn from these books too."
66,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,4,"This is a huge book filled with a huge amount of data and ideas. It is a book filled with both horror and hope. I listen to it in the very well presented audible version. I don’t know how thick the book is but it is 36 hours long.I made some observations and comments as I experienced the book and I will not repeat all of them here. For me the author has a political persuasion on the left end of the scale which is something I appreciate. I finished the book having been convinced that in spite of my life being filled seemingly with constant war, the horror of the past far exceeds the reality of the present.Several positive thinkers have observed that the arc of history is bending toward justice. The author ably describes a world also bending toward less violence. He makes the case by examining the reality of violence in history as well as the science of the development of mankind."
67,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76129-wealhtheow,3,"Pinker attempts to study trends of violence throughout human history. He sees a decline in violence of all kinds, on all scales of time and magnitude. The first seven chapters document the historical decline of violence, including hate crimes, murders, domestic violence, animal cruelty, war, and genocide. The remainder of the book traces probable causes of the decline, drawing on a huge range of fact sources, from histories to atrocologists to evolutionary psychologists. To sum up, here are the factors that don't show a consistent relationship with violence: weaponry and disarmament (when people want to be violent, they'll do so regardless of available weaponry and rapidly develop more, whereas when they want to be peaceful, the weapons are not used), resources (wealth originates not just from natural resources but also the ingenuity, effort, and cooperation used on resources. A country rich in minerals could experience more war and civil unrest while everyone scrambles for it, or less because other actors rationally understand that peacefully trading will result in more money for everyone), affluence (wealth doesn't correlate with dips in violence, nor are richer countries less violent), or religion (ideologies can be used for violence or for peace). Factors that do show a consistent relationship with violence: a state that uses a monopoly on force to protect its citizens from one another, commerce, women's involvement in decision making and society's respect for the interests of women, the expansion of the circle of sympathy, and increased use of reason. I've stuck points that particularly struck me in the ""status updates"" section; go there for more specifics and quotes.I was overall impressed. The sheer number and breadth of sources Pinker draws upon is really impressive; even if you discount a number of the facts or his interpretation of them (for instance, I don't believe that a test showign differences in men and women's reaction to hypothetical cheating necessarily reveals an innate, biological difference between the sexes when it could just as easily be due to being socialized to react and think about sex differently), there still remain a mountain of evidence upon which his arguments can still rest. I also think this book suffers from an unfortunate tendency to focus on 19th and 20th century Western Europe and the USA; relatively modern western thought and social movements are given vastly more time and attention than any others, and although I understand that Pinker can draw upon those traditions most readily (and can count on his English-speaking audience to do the same), I still wish a global history of violence used more a more global lens. His data on violent crime, wars, and genocides is decidedly global, but his anecdotes, examples, and the philosophies he draws from are almost exclusively western. That said, his arguments convinced me. I think he demonstrates pretty conclusively that violence, both as a whole and as individual categories, has decreased over time, and his theories as to why made sense to me."
68,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,5,"When I first read reviews of this book last fall, I was profoundly unconvinced to the point of feeling almost irritated at Pinker, despite having read and enjoyed at least one of his prior books. This is a great argument, then, for actually reading the book, because I found it an enjoyable read, written in a personable voice. And, to the extent that it makes any sense to offer overarching theories across such a broad sweep of history (cf. Jared Diamond), I found this one convincing.This is a very, very long book that I read over more than a month and had to return to the library for a while in the middle. If I were to attempt to summarize the author's argument, I'd simply be writing my own unconvincing review. So I'll just offer a few details that I found interesting that bolstered his argument. First, he discusses infanticide as a formerly common practice that is now rarer in almost all societies. This is one example of a form of declining violence that modern people might not even realize they've been freed of. Second, he presents extensive statistics on ""deadly quarrels""--plotting murders and wars on the same chart, a murder like a tiny war. The point is that quarrels of various sizes break out with various frequencies, so it is not statistically unlikely that something as violent as World War II could have broken out amid a general, much longer-term, decline in violence. Finally, he includes a discussion of the prisoner's dilemma, recast as the ""pacifist's dilemma."" Why be peaceable when your neighbor might attack you first? Then he shows how innovations like commerce and evolving ideas of honor can change the pacifist's dilemma so that being peaceful is the winning strategy.Those are just a few details that stuck out for me. The book's length is a weakness; sometimes Pinker goes so far down a road that you forget where you were going or why. He is a peppy enough writer (without steering into Natalie Angier territory) that I didn't mind, but it didn't help his argument. In the end, the individual chapters are worthwhile even if you don't buy into the stratosphere-level thesis."

Problem is, I can't be bothered to work out which those were or where in an 800+ page book. Sounds like someone else's job that should've been done before they sold me this.Therefore my only course of action is to believe none of it, just in case? But over the last month, too much of it has sunk in.That's not why I deduct the star. I did that because it's so long!!

Pinker's basic thesis is that over any time span, at any level, human beings have gotten unprecedentedly less violent, to the point where even the worst pockets of violence on the planet today would barely qualify as average in past eras, to say nothing of the the expansion of tolerance and reciprocity to entirely new areas due to the many revolutions in racial/gender/sexual equality. It's a book that has to be read to be believed, both because of the depth of its argument and because of the horrifying details on just how awful to each other people used to be. Unlikely as it may seem, humanity might actually be progressing."

73,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2252836-john-burns,4,"I've been profoundly impressed with the two Steven Pinker Books I've read. I heard him say in an interview that he's a workaholic and I can really believe it. He's one of these non-fiction writers who really staggers you with the way he can tackle a subject from a vast, distant perspective but yet who can sift through the nitty gritty of innumerable scientific studies and papers. When you read a Steven Pinker book you know that he's going to come at a problem from many different angles. You aren't likely to come away from the book feeling like you've had the wool pulled over your eyes or that he has selectively covered certain areas that support his thesis and ignored others. He's also very good at covering all the counter-arguments to his position, and he frequently gives them their due, conceding ground when he sees that it is warranted. All in all I find him to be a staggeringly balanced writer. There are so many highly respected non-fiction writers in the world who do an excellent job but still are clearly coming from one side of the aisle, chauvinistically forcing their ideology at the expense of the objective truth. The impressive thing about Pinker is that he's so neutral on so many topics that you frequently don't know where he's going with a topic. It seems like he'll be critiquing something and then he'll move onto the next aspect of the subject and I'll have to follow everything he's saying very closely to figure out if he has a positive or negative opinion of the thing he's discussing. You can never pin him down and he always seems to tip toe along razor thin fences of nuance.The basic premise of this book is that violence has been declining and that we now live in the most peaceful time that there has ever been. The automatic response to this suggestion, for most of us, will probably be incredulity. What about terrorism? Domestic abuse? Knife crime? Gun Crime? Civil wars? Yeah sure. There's plenty of that about. But there's always been plenty of that about. Not only that but there used to be a whole lot of other stuff too. Think of all the practices that were totally normal a few centuries ago. Slavery. Hanging. Torture. Child cruelty. Animal Cruelty. Duelling. Most major countries seemed to spend most of their time at war with someone or other. Steven takes us through all the different measurements of violence and demonstrates to us, beyond a doubt, that the 21st century is a totally unprecedented golden era of peace in the history of our species. After establishing this fact, he moves onto looking for the causes of the decline in violence. There are a lot of different candidates to discuss. Feminisation for example. Women are less war-like than men and a world where women have increasingly more influence is bound to be less violent. Hobbes' Leviathan is another. When we know that there are policemen and prisons and law courts to ensure that most people behave lawfully, we do not have to rely on violence in order to protect ourselves and our property.Free trade and Capitalism is another. When we are trading with the world and making decisions based on increasing capital, costly wars with our trading partners are going to hit us where it hurts.Democracy. When the people have a system of governance where their interests are considered they don't need to overthrow the government in a bloody coup.Literacy. We only consider violence to be wrong when we regard the subject of the violence as belonging to the same in-group as us. Meat-eaters do not regard the steak on their plate as coming from a system of ""violence"". If the steak were made of Human then their attitude would probably be very different. Most warring cultures in the history of the world have felt little or no empathy for their enemies. So where has the modern culture of empathy come from? Well, primarily from literacy, from our ability to pick up books (or more recently to watch films) that let us into the lives of others so that we can see that these strange people are fundamentally like us and that their suffering is like our own.Hopefully this all gives you the gist of the material. Violence has declined. Why has it declined? Here are some arguments. Now those arguments will be broken down and examined for credibility. Etc.Yeah, it's a really thought-provoking and eye-opening book that will change the way you think about the human race. However, it is pretty damn long. It's a very enlightening read but I don't know if most people will be eager to slog their way through 800 pages of not especially light reading on a grim and unsettling subject. I would definitely recommend it but it's not a book to be entered upon lightly."
74,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,5,"This is a fascinating book, and many people will be surprised by what Pinker has to say. We routinely tell ourselves that we live in a violent world, that for all the comforts of civilization wars are more common, more terrible, and more fatal to non-combatants. Anyone who follows the news can cite examples of terrible atrocities that are the basis of our certainty that the human race is demonstrating a destructiveness and depravity towards other human beings unknown in the simpler, gentler past when knights and armsmen fought other knights and armsmen, leaving the civilians largely undisturbed.Stephen Pinker explains, with examples, details, and cites to original sources and current research, that we have it all wrong, and the past was a far more violent place than we typically imagine, or than we experience day to day in all but the most violent places on Earth now. And those ""most violent places"" aren't our modern cities in developed countries.He examines the levels of violence and the rates of violent death in primitive human hunter-gatherer communities, mediaeval Europe, and modern hunter-gatherer societies. He mines information from physical anthropology, historical records, recorded causes of death, death rates and causes of death in modern hunter-gatherer communities, and the trend is both clear and quite different from what our reflexive biases often tell us. Hunter-gatherer cultures generally have startlingly, even shockingly, high rates of death by violence. This stems from raids and conflicts with neighboring groups, the need to have a reputation for being too strong to attack and/or likely to take revenge if attacked, and other conflicts that, in the absence of a functioning government, individuals have to prevent or resolve for themselves.He traces the significantly lower but still high rates of violence in early agricultural settlements, as government begins to evolve but is still, itself, pretty violent, and then the evolution of things that start to resemble the modern state. We are introduced to Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau and how their theories both described and influenced the growth of government, Hobbes' ""Leviathan,"" and the concomitant increase in self-control and decrease in private violence. He describes in enough detail to make the point the behavior that resulted from the expectation that mediaeval armies would feed and pay themselves by ""living off the land,"" i.e., raiding villagers, and damage the enemy's wealth by burning the fields and killing the villagers. Torture was also used routinely, openly--and often as a form of public entertainment.Fewer mediaeval Europeans were likely to die by violence than hunter-gatherers, but it was still a shockingly violent time by modern standards.Pinker marshals evidence from the fields of sociology and psychology as we move closer to our own time, as well as crime statistics, war records, causes of death, etc. He does not shirk examining the effects of the two World Wars in the past century, as well as civil wars, the Rwanda genocide, and other painful modern episodes.He also looks at less obvious declines in violence, such as hookless fly fishing and the elimination of many kinds of ""entertainment"" that used to be taken for granted. The banning of dodgeball by some schools and summer camps, and speech codes at universities are discussed as ridiculous extremes that are nevertheless simple overshoots of what are generally beneficial trends.Stephen Pinker has a track record of excellent books using psychology and sociology to examine major aspects of modern life in an interesting, informative, and enlightening way. He's done it again, and in this volume lays out a powerful case that the growth of effective government, the development of political forms that placed a premium on self-control, the growth of modern literature (and, eventually, movies, tv, and the internet), democracy, open societies, and international trade have all contributed to dramatically lowering rates of violence and creating a startlingly safe and peaceful world--for now. He makes no claim that we've changed human nature, or that the trends that have produced our current peacefulness could not be reversed.This a compelling, enlightening, and highly readable book.Highly recommended.I received a free electronic galley of this book from the publisher via NetGalley."
75,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42147710-michael-shore,5,"This wasn't the easiest book to get through; it's long and quite dense at times.As always though, Pinker delivers a tightly-packed, expansive and extremely thorough overview of violence and its decline. I especially enjoyed the final part of the book where he explores moral psychology."
76,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26901966-fathy-sroor,4,"The title of the book fully explains its main idea: This is the most peaceful time in the entire human history.Do you find it hard to believe? I will tell you why: we are living in the age of open skies.A world in which we receive news from all over the world.This creates a collective illusion that our era is a continuous bloodbath...but it is not! And consider this:the last time superpower countries engaged in a direct fight was 72 years ago(the longest interval to be recorded in the entire history) in the world war two....but was it the greatest atrocity of all times? in absolute numbers, it is among the biggest 3 but if we plot the lives lost during it in relation to the world population at that time it will rank 9th!!! what about smaller countries?statistics point out that they go to war less than before and the percentage of deaths is much lower.And terrorism? of course, September 11 is the largest terroristic attack...but if you look at the big picture, the total number of killings due to terrorism in 2001 is a way lower the average number in the 70s or 80s!!(and the curve is keeping sloping ever since)Although the term""genocide"" was first coined during the early years of the 20th century, the total percentage of victims of such crimes is lower than the average of most centuries of recorded history.But never think that the decline is restricted to the massive atrocities only.The rate of homicide was in a semi leaner decline over the course of the past 5 centuries and it still is.In order to appreciate the difference: the chances of a male English aristocrat to get murdered has declined from 25% in the 15th century to almost 0 per 100,000 today! and it is not restricted to the high classes or the developed countries only: it is the same for almost every single country on our planet(the ratios differ of course but the change is always fascinating).Every calculable indicator of violence(ranging from mass killing to animal mistreatment) has shown an almost steady(and adorable) decline.And you do not need centuries to notice it, it is observable on the measure of decades.explore this important website for more statistics: https://ourworldindata.org/............ The first 7 chapters of the book are devoted to state all these facts and trying to explain them leaning on a massive corpse of statistics and metanalyses of historical data besides exploring the suggested theories.The atmosphere changes in the last 3 chapters which try to explain the origin of violence and the resistance against it through the core of human biology, psychology and sociology."
77,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/869064-jeremy,5,"Steven Pinker takes a hypotheses that, reflexively, almost NO ONE in our era wants to believe in: that human violence in all of its measurable forms, has decreased increasingly and exponentially over time. He then proceeds over about 700 pages to organize, display, and rigorously analyze what is surely one of the most formidable collections of data assembled by any popular author in order to prove that idea.This book deals with something perennial in humanity as a species (our propensity for violence in all of its forms), and the only real weakness of this book, for me, is that at times he can be a bit reductionist and overgeneralize a bit.BUT...that's also a by-product of tackling a subject so large and seemingly so universal to the human experience. There's no way anyone can take on a project this large without glossing over some major aspects of social history, etcThis is hugely, intimidatingly erudite, encyclopedic non-fiction that swings for the fences. In an era of eye-rolling ""interdisciplinary studies"" Pinker brings ideas to bear in this book from fields as diverse as cognitive/social psychology, social/religious history, neuroanatomy, game theory, literature, feminism, anthropology...ad infinitum. The ability of a human mind to collect and correlate all of this knowledge and data for the sake of proving a single, massive idea about human progress is profound, to say the least.The idea that humanity has gotten better over the eons is anathema to people of all political and ideological stripes. Pinker uses a massive body of research to show and explicate (in exhaustive detail) that we, as a species, are fundamentally wrong about that belief in a very major way, and to posit why it has become so.I must agree with Bill Gate's assessment: this is, unquestionably, one of the most important things I've read in my life. I recommend this book unconditionally."
78,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31302406-lori,1,"Later edit (2020). Yeah, this is an incorrigible fluff piece. Bumping down to one star from two.Later edit (2018). I have read this book shortly after it was released in 2011. Back then I barely knew any history, and barely knew anything about modern history. The glaring oversights made by this book in trying to twist and turn reality to get to the conclusion that everything is better are just staggering. It is a shinning example of ideology informing one's scientific inquiry so deeply as it to be pathetic. Pinker is the perfect example of the social theorist who projects modern societal organization into the past. I now consider this book to be quite poor. And one day it will be worth writing a more in-depth review as to why.Original review:I don't think I've ever read a work of more sober optimism than The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined.One might criticize Steven Pinker's elevation of investigative journalism (with regards to murder rates in medieval times), to scientific evidence, but nevertheless he makes other very poignant arguments in favor of his hypothesis: that overall, the present is better in terms of overall violence than the past."
79,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9793933-theo-logos,3,"This is a book of fascinating ideas argued convincingly. Unfortunately, it is also a book that is about twice as long as it should be. I started each chapter fascinated by the ideas, often bogged down by mid chapter, and sometimes needed to skim through to chapter's end. I felt that much of the material could have been included in an appendix that could be referenced without breaking the narrative flow of the book, and that much more could have been trimmed altogether without harm. Frankly, I believe the book could have been twice as powerful if half as long. Five stars for ideas and content, one for editing."
80,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1168406-ed,3,"Pinker marshals huge piles of facts in defense of a thesis that seems self-evident: that there is less violence in the world (or at least the western world) now than at any time in the past. He comes across as deeply conservative, firmly welded to an unchanging world view. It is a book that could only be produced by an author able to deploy battalions of research assistants and bright graduate students. I read most of the text--the graphs were barely legible because of the limitations of my Nook Simple Touch--and suggest that dipping into ""The Better Angels of our Nature"" at various points and reading 50 pages here and 100 pages there is a good approach.

This is always a huge plus in any good book. If you feel the need to agree with everything said on every page you will hate this book.

84,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5641405-mark-hanley,1,I may need to come back to this. I couldn't make it through a chapter without falling asleep. At least the first several chapters were just so dry.
85,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275149-cheryl,4,"Now that I am done, I can look at the book as a whole, and say it was fascinating, and an amazing book to debate and talk about. Not that I agree with it all, I am still wary of evolutionary psychology, but I feel smarter at least, and have gained some new ways of thinking about the world we live in and my own pacifist and liberal nature. I love love this quote near the end of the book, and it was said by a man who survived Hiroshima, and fled to Nagasaki for safety where he then survived the other bomb: “The only people who should be allowed to govern countries with nuclear weapons are mothers, those who are still breastfeeding their babies.” Tsutomu Yamaguchi then lived to 93. I have to take back all the suspicions of misogyny of the author for him to include that as a valid and new way of thinking. It is dramatic, and I know reverse sexism; but he also cites studies where male testosterone is lowered by men who are spending quality time with their families, so there are possibilities for enlightened governance with both sexes.Now, the author might be pulling out all the tricks and optical illusions of a magician with graphs and charts and maps (oh do i melt at maps) but he is answering questions I didn't know to ask, or think to ask. He may be drowning us in study after study of impoverished unemployed psychology grad students who are required to participate in research to graduate. Are they a true cross section of humanity that can be generalized to all of humanity?However, the good first: For example, a simple yet elegant reason why people from New England and Mid Atlantic region may be so different in temperament and how they view guns for example than southerners is that the northern states were settled by more “urban” Europeans coming from parts of Europe that had central government with structure and justice and the South by more “rural” people who were more nomadic, independent, less affected by government, theorizing that central government vs. anarchy is related to the evolution away from violence. The author cites psychological studies throughout, but one that impressed me most was one comparing how southern and northern students responded to a incognito researcher who mumbled an insult to them as they walked by; then they had their blood drawn, and interviewed by another researcher. The southerners had higher levels of testosterone and cortisol (stress hormone) and behaved more dominantly towards the 2nd researcher. The theory withstands a test of homicide rates now also; the highest homicide rates are in the “ghetto” that tends to have the worst relationship with government through law enforcement, more like an anarchic state within a country, leading to more vigilante justice because they don’t or can’t trust the government to be fair.Apparently there was a popular theory in Freakonomics that I missed that linked a decrease in violence in the 1990’s (when New York redeemed central park and disneyfied times square) to the legalization of abortion with Roe v. Wade. It stated that the abortions were preventing unwanted children, who were fated to become murderers and criminals, thereby decreasing homicides. It was popular and widely accepted and entirely false. Words are everywhere as in most books, but his writing style is eloquent and rich with new and fun words you don’t read every day, and I feel smarter just by reading his sentences. His sentences bring me pleasure even if I am tuning out a few subjects about the study of war and such. in•nu•mer•ate : unfamiliar with mathematical concepts and methods; unable to use mathematics; not numerate.

It is tied to a belief that their own ethnic group settled an area and is the superior race, and they usurpers must be annihilated. This was a motivation of Hitler, since he associated Jewish people with the progress of a city and he wanted to make more land available to the Aryans for farming. Again, it is a possible elegant explanation or one of many, for the great divide between the politics of cities and rural towns. Not that country folk want to annihilate me, but they might be suspicious of what I see as progress within the great diversity of city, whereas they view in in fear. There are some historians that claim the 20th century is unique in the amount of genocides, but it was just never called that before, nor was it interesting to historians at the time, lumped in with cattle and oxen. The chapter called the “rights revolution” was one of the harder chapters to get through. He opens with a charming anecdote about his skill at dodge ball as a child, and then ridicules the fact that it has been banned in schools. There is not much doubt that “political correctness” can be absurd at times, but this sentence is very biased: “But now the Boy Gender has lost another battle in its age old war with camp counselors, phys ed teachers, lawyers, and moms.” Those pesky moms, I imagine, had to fight with all the cool dads who wanted to keep it right? Maybe the sentence would be okay with “parents” instead of “moms,” implying that only moms could be concerned about the welfare of their children. If I were a father, I would be mad as hell. The author charmingly relates that he wasn’t athletic or graceful or talented at sports, but could withstand pain. So he is admitting that dodge ball causes pain, and he must not have children, because when he grew up in Canada, there were no 14 year olds killing each other as there is now, and children have gotten bolder and bolder in bullying. I saw the jocks in my time throw the ball as hard as they could while making it look effortless, and I have felt the pain of the red marks on the poor skin of the smartest, kindest boys I knew. I could also note that as this chapter dragged, and the second half of the book continued, I found new and intricate words less and less. I don’t think what he was saying about banning dodgeball or other play fighting leads to more violent behavior, because he has already debunked that myth, that suppression of more innocent violence builds up and needs to be aired and does so in an uncontrollable way. It is actually a lovely way that our intolerance of violence has spanned the continuum from war, genocide, rioting, lynching to hate crimes, rape, assault, battering, to bullying, discrimination, etc. He says that, but then uses phrases like “contagion of rights,” and “overshooting of the campaign…to prevent abuse and neglect. And “puzzling customs, peccadilloes, and taboos.” I wanted a dispassionate and fair book, and apparently this man has an agenda to restore dodgeball. While rape is “incomprehensible form the vantage point of contemporary moral sensibilities,” it makes sense from an evolutionary point of view. I can’t believe I wrote that. I am learning more and more about evolutionary psychology which unfortunately for me “seems to be true” but offends my intuition. Most women I know are not jealous of their cheating partners because their genetics are at risk as the male spreads his around. Even if that is a subconscious motive, it is not the only motive, but destruction of trust, fear of future deception, fear of not being sexually attractive to their partner, anger at being a fool, and sense of betrayal are all concrete, real emotions they may have. What I do agree with is that there is some perpetuation of the ownership of women in the custom of a ring to mark a woman and not a man as “taken” and how fathers “give away” their daughters. So I don’t plan on an engagement ring, but am not sure that it is that damaging. What is terrible is the capitalism-encouraged pressure on the guy to get the flashiest ring possible or risk being accused of not enough love. More about rape: “it is the nature of sexual reproduction that a female should evolve to exert control over her sexuality…she should choose the time, the terms, and the partner…which predicts that a woman should abhor being raped.” Sure, sounds true, but what I know what women hate about being raped is again, nothing to do with genetics, and choices being taken away, but with the absolute pain of forced intercourse, the delicate tissues being damaged in a way that would be like a penis stuffed into a man’s nose, with pain not relieving for a very long time; the pain from the muscles being battered perhaps torn; the pain from the multiple strikes to delicate and sensitive areas of the body, face, throat, breasts, etc.; the risk and presence of STD’s that are not preventable; and the emotional aftereffects of being violated and not being able to stop it. Oh, and the questions that society have always had about rape, oh, a miniskirt? Oh she was drinking too much and grinded against him in the club? Oh fuck-me heels? Full disclosure: I have not been raped nor have any of my closest friends. Moving onto domestic violence, apparently men and women are equal in the times they use violence against their partners. The author clarifies the definition of DV as a more “systematic intimidation and coercion,” which is almost solely the practice of men. I can live with it, I am sure there is a lot of slapping and pushing that women initiate. He calls it “small stuff” unless it qualifies as an “assault” and is reported. If you have been living in the same world I have, you know that is the part that is blatantly false and made ubiquitous in made for tv movies and are visible realities in the faded and healing bruises of the women who are finally forced to go to an ER due to a broken bone or a slash that needs stitching; and because women will rarely report all the rapes, the black eyes, the bruised stomachs that they receive. Did you know that many batterers will stab themselves with a knife or injure themselves somehow so they can imply self-defense? Where are the statistics on that? Oh, they must be hidden in the “small stuff” that each partner does equally to each other. I can’t even go into the postpartum depression and infanticide section. He suggests PP depression is not a “malfunction, but a design…loosely based to measure hormonal imbalances.” And then quotes a disgusting quote by Plutarch from the 1st century that is ridiculous. I can assure you, I have seen a thousand births, and a thousand newborns “so naked, so shapeless, so foul and resembling more jus slain than one just born, he is an object for non to touch or life up or kiss except for someone who loves with natural affection (i.e. a mother).” I am not a mother, and definitely not to them, but they melt the heart of anyone with one. And to bond, mothers must “overcome considerable psychological obstacles.” I am starting to think this author is a misogynist. It was interesting to learn that the fear of kidnapping of children has led to most parents driving their kids to school, which has led to more children getting hit by the cars they are driving. The number of kids walking to school has fallen from 60% to 10%. So with relief I left the rights chapter and delved into the psychology chapters which I thought would explain our inner demons, what they were all about, and our better angels. Evolutionary psychology is just not my cup of tea, unfortunately. It starts out by trying to convince me (he calls me dear reader) that I am “wired for violence”, since when I was in my terrible twos, I bit my sister. Oh and 70-90% of men and 50-80% of women have had a homicidal urge within a year. Yes, they were all those nonviolent college students, but let’s extrapolate to everyone. I am sure that there is a wiring in my head that could become active, if I became psychotic or had traumatic brain injury; but I must be in the 20-50% percent of women that do not ever have homicidal thoughts. True confession: I hit my dog across her snout other night because I thought a coyote was stalking us and she wouldn’t run with me. I do not believe that almost all men have homicidal thoughts or that half of all women do. I am sure some do. Dear author, I am not lying as your student shouted out in your lecture. This is warped thinking. Show me the study replicated several times, with multiple cultures and countries, and I will admit I was wrong. I looked at one of the articles he cited and it was misquoted. The results were far less than he said, and stated the people had a homicidal thought in their lifetime, not in the past year. I am questioning the validity of this work. My instincts are being confirmed by the controversy over evolutionary psychology. For example, there was an experiment that was about self-control; the researchers tried to drain self-control and see how people responded. Participants were placed in front of fresh baked chocolate chip cookies and also radishes while the delicious aroma of cookies was being piped in and told to eat 2 or 3 only of one or the other as assigned for a taste test. They gave them unsolvable logic puzzles to solve and then observed them. It was significant to them that the people that had eaten the radishes worked less hard and took less time on the puzzles than the other participants who got the chocolate chip cookies; it could be interpreted that they had to use so much strength to resist the cookies they couldn’t focus on the puzzle. Maybe. Maybe the chocolate did its trademark thing, made them feel good in the pleasure center, and they had more incentive or motivation or feeling of wellbeing or patience. Maybe the simple sugars in the cookies gave them a boost which the author cites in another part of the book as a deterrent to violence. Maybe the harmony of eating cookies with the scent surrounding them compelled them to work harder while the radish eaters felt a disconnect they couldn’t pin down. With this particular study, they did replicate with other stimuli than food, so I might be more convinced. But it is an example how it is controversial.  I do appreciate this overview of the author’s ideas: “throughout this book, I have assumed that human nature, in the sense of the cognitive and emotional inventory of our species, has been constant over the ten-thousand year window in which declines of violence are visible, and that all differences in behavior among societies have strictly environmental causes. That is the standard assumption in evolutionary psychology, based on the fact that the few centuries and millennia in which societies have separated and changed are a small fraction of the period in which our species have been in existence. Since most adaptive evolutionary change is gradual, the bulk of our biological adaptation must be to the foraging lifestyle that prevailed during the tens of millennia, rather than to the specifics of societies that have departed form that lifestyle and diverged from each other only recently.” The last quarter of the book has some interesting theories such as how game theory is used to evaluate history and patterns; who can forget the Prisoner’s Dilemma, which is not a zero-sum game, which might be my favorite new phrase that I am testing out in everyday life. There is research on self-control and strengthening “self-control muscles” as mentioned above, rational thinking, how intelligence affects violence, and morality. I might go back to those at some point, I didn’t feel they were too earth shattering. Overall, what a book, beyond thought provoking to so mentally satisfying.  "
86,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12599895-daniel-lomax,5,"Some facts:-	As a proportion	 of the world population of the time, WWII had the ninth-highest death rate of all known wars. WWI had the sixteenth-highest.-	The number of nuclear states is at its lowest since the 1950s.-	Compared to the late 1970s, there are about four times as many democracies, and a about quarter as many autocracies.-	Interstate, intrastate and extrastate conflicts have declined, both in absolute number of conflicts per year and death rates per conflict, consistently since 1992. Genocide has declined consistently since the end of WWII.-	Racially motivated murder has declined fivefold in the US since 1996.-	The number of white US citizens who claim to disapprove of interracial marriage decreased from almost 100% to around 30% between the 1940s and 1990s. Segregationist attitudes fell from around 70% to around 5% in the same period.-	Homicide rates in the US have fallen by about 50% since 1973. Incidence of rape has fallen by about 75%. Victims of domestic violence, both male and female, have declined in number in both the UK and US since the mid-1990s.-	Vegetarianism rates have tripled in the UK since 1984, and increased even more sharply in the US since 1995.Starting this book, I had four concerns that I didn’t think Pinker could match: what about nuclear proliferation? What about the environment? What about the depletion of resources, and John N. Gray’s speculation that this will lead to a great deal of war in the 21st century and thereafter? And what about the factory farming industry, which has billions of animals a year living in intolerably cruel conditions? Pinker anticipates all four of these objections, although he deals with the nuclear threat better than others. It does turn out that concern for animal welfare is rising steadily and has been for some time, and in some cases this translates into actual better treatment of animals; while it doesn’t look like demand for factory farming is going to go away in my lifetime, factory farm conditions continue to improve, and he makes the point that, once the animal welfare/rights movements reach a certain critical mass, it’ll put more pressure on the process of lawmaking. It turns out that environmental damage and resource depletion, contrary to popular opinion, don’t cause war, although obviously they are bad things in themselves. However, Peter Singer notes that “Solomon Hsiang and colleagues at Columbia University used data from the past half-century to show that in tropical regions, the risk of a new civil conflict doubles during El Niño years (when temperatures are hotter than usual and there is less rainfall). If that finding is correct, then a warming world could mean the end of the relatively peaceful era in which we are now living.""The writing starts off with good humour and a delightful sense of irony, but it gets a little drier and duller as it goes on. This is not entirely the author’s fault – there’s a shift away from historical narrative toward data analysis, and it’s a lot harder to be interesting with that. And because I wanted to read the book carefully, it sometimes felt like a slog. I realise that an ambitious hypothesis like this one needs to be explained and defended at length, and I applaud Pinker for his scope and energy, but there’s too much repetition and throat clearing and I honestly feel that maybe a hundred pages could have been shaven off at no big cost.This is not the first book of this kind, but seems to be the biggest, most comprehensive, and most ambitious. Most importantly, it goes beyond the claim that the world is getting more peaceable, and attempts to explain why. Some of its explanations are better than others (I’ll get to that) but honestly, I’m impressed and pleased just that people are even trying.There are a couple of less promising bits of news – violence is getting more common in Islamic parts of the world, and among poor black Americans. Pinker makes – convincing, I think – efforts to explain why these exceptions exist. And in spite of them, the overall world trends are going in the right direction. Not very appeasing if you live in Somalia or a New Orleans slum, but appeasing if you have a “citizen of the world” kind of perspective. These negative trends are slight, and outweighed in scope and scale by the positive ones.I’m one of the few remaining people who think the Iraq war did more good than harm (I’ll talk about that when I finally get to my review of A Long Short War), and I think Pinker underpraises it, despite having to acknowledge some of the things which I think go in its favour. I think Pinker has to adopt a stance that fits with the modern zeitgeist, in order to be able to have common ground with his audience about what qualifies as progress. But doesn’t that fact make the book’s claim kind of tautologous? I remember that Julian Baggini says it’s a myth that the world is improving, because we’re simply blind to the prejudices and biases of our day; we don’t realise that the zeitgeist is the way it is, and we like it simply because we’ve grown up in it. I don’t really agree with Baggini’s position – I don’t think it can explain why I have different views to the norm, and it also seems sort of nihilistic or relativistic – but it’s something worth thinking about.A lot of the critical reviews of this book, both on this site and elsewhere, are very poor. Several detractors admit they haven't even read the book, and various others clearly haven't read it properly. For instance, John Arquilla criticizes the book for ignoring civilian deaths, which is not true. Robert Epstein says that Pinker doesn't address the concern of a nuclear Iran, which is not true (it's right there on p.373–375). There are people (such as Arquila) who evidently don't understand the concept of a trend and think it's sufficient just to name some violent events. There are others who accuse Pinker of confirmation bias, and consequently dismiss his case, but not once do they ever provide statistics to contradict his own. A case of pot and kettle, perhaps? People attack him for using the dictionary definition of “violence”, instead of some obscure and unworkably broad one. The most common criticism is that Pinker measures violence rates, rather than absolute figures...how ridiculous. Is it better that nobody exists so that absolute numbers drop to zero? Each new human brought into the world has an opportunity to become a psychopath, a murderer, a zealot, so the fact that more and more people are not doing so is vindication of his position. If you have infinite patience you can read Reality Denial, which manages to make all of these asinine criticisms and more.That doesn't mean there are no good criticisms of the book though. As Miquixote notes, Pinker seems to think an ideology is something only other people can have. Ideologies cause all this war and destruction so we need classical liberalism instead, which apparently doesn't count as an ideology. This is only a semantic problem, but it’s one that makes it impossible to understand what he means when he blames wars on ideology. Pinker claims that rationality and classical liberalism are two of the main reasons things are getting better, and that the two are related. To support this theory he cites the studies which find Lib Dem voters to be smarter, on average, than voters for other parties. Other parties, that is, except my own (the Green Party). Ah, he says, but when you control for class the Green Party falls behind! He never explains why one ought to control for class. He also dismisses the often socialist and environmentalist views of the intellectual elite because they are, he thinks, more prone to ""daring opinions, clever theories, sweeping ideologies and Utopian visions"". So the link between intelligence and political position matters right up to the point where it starts to contradict Pinker’s brand of liberalism, and anybody beyond that point is subject to ad hominem arguments and dismissed.Pinker also tells us, in favour of his ""gentle commerce"" theory (for which he finally admits after several hundred pages there is no evidence), that ""whether or not a leader's power is constrained by a ballot box, in a market economy it is constrained by stakeholders who control the means of production..."" So capitalism corrupts the democratic process and Pinker is citing this as a good thing? I have a major political disagreement with him here: it seems that, when forced to choose, he prefers pacifism to democracy.There’s an interesting defense (borrowed from George Eliot) of the value of fiction, in that it expands our moral sphere, enabling us to feel sympathy for people we normally wouldn't. But is this necessarily a good thing? Notice how many people interpreted Humbert Humbert as the victim of Lolita? I know that Tony Soprano and Walter White are psychopaths, but ain't it just so hard not to root for them?Despite these problems and a few others, the overall argument that violence has considerably declined is very convincing, and made with remarkable ingenuity. What's really impressive about Pinker's effort is that he has managed to meet almost every conceivable criticism. Einstein was a controversial writer too, and when a pamphlet was published entitled “100 Authors Against Einstein”, he retorted ""If I were wrong, one would be enough."" I’m pleased to say that after all the dozens of raging critiques of Better Angels I’ve read, the main theory remains intact.Pinker says his next book will be ""a style manual for the 21st century, applying the insights of linguistics, psycholinguistics, and cognitive psychology to the crafting of clear and stylish prose."" What Goodreader wouldn't want to read that? I can't fucking wait. I'm serious.__________AUGUST 2016 UPDATEI just learned of this study which finds an impressive correlation between the rise and decline of lead poisoning (as a consequence of leaded gasoline) and crime in various countries. To memory Pinker doesn't consider this plausible causation in his book."
87,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined by Steven Pinker“The Better Angels of Our Nature"" is the reference quality book that that successfully and thoroughly posits the reasons why violence has declined over time. In this massive and persuasive book, Steven Pinker Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, follows the facts wherever they may go and provides compelling arguments backed by sound science. What makes this book great is the quality of the material presented and the absorbing topic being pursued. Pinker succinctly establishes the premises and systematically goes after them with scientific diligence. This 832-page book is composed of the following ten chapters: 1. A Foreign Country, The Pacification Process, 3. The Civilizing Process, 4. The Humanitarian Revolution, 5. The Long Peace, 6. The New Peace, 7. The Rights Revolutions, 8. Inner Demons, 9. Better Angels and 10. On Angels’ Wings.Positives:1.	Rigorously researched book in the hands of a master.2.	Violence is a fascinating topic. Pinker covers this topic from virtually every angle and I mean from every angle. This is a meticulous book, I can’t stress this enough.3.	Accessible prose. 4.	Great use of charts and illustrations. Very few books provide as many charts as this book. Chart after chart that effectively conveys what he has put so well into words. 5.	This book posits the basic premise with gusto, “violence has declined over long stretches of time, and today we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species’ existence”. I have not read a book that has made a more compelling case.6.	Thoroughly explains MANY kinds of violence that have moved in the same direction.7.	Great quotes, “Across time and space, the more peaceable societies also tend to be richer, healthier, better educated, better governed, more respectful of their women, and more likely to engage in trade”.8.	In a nutshell, “The Better Angels of Our Nature is a tale of six trends, five inner demons, four better angels, and five historical forces”.9.	The Six Major Trends that make up our species' retreat from violence: 1. The Pacification Process (the transition from the anarchy of the hunting, gathering, and horticultural societies); 2. The Civilizing Process (the consolidation of a patchwork of feudal territories into large kingdoms); 3. The Humanitarian Revolution (the first organized movement to abolish socially sanctioned forms of violence like despotism, slavery, dueling, judicial torture, superstitious killing, etc...; 4. The Long Peace (since World War II the great powers have stopped waging war on one another); 5. The New Peace (since the end of the Cold War in 1989, organized conflicts of all kinds, have declined; The Rights Revolutions (since the Universal Declaration Human Rights in 1948, has seen a growing revulsion against aggression on smaller scales).10.	The Five Demons: 1. Predatory or instrumental violence, 2. Dominance, 3. Revenge, 4. Sadism, and 5. Ideology.11.	The Four Better Angels: 1. Empathy, 2. Self-control, 3. The Moral Sense, and 4. The faculty of Reason.12.	Five Historical Forces: 1. The Leviathan, 2. Commerce, 3. Feminization, 4. Cosmopolitanism, and 5. The Escalator of Reason.13.	This is an enlightening book. I have learned so much from this book. So many interesting theories, anecdotes, and history revolving around the concept of violence. Excellent!14.	The Bible as one long celebration of violence. Right off the bat Pinker puts the Bible in perspective. 15.	The book is full of amusing historical anecdotes of course involving violence. ""Andrew Jackson, immortalized on the twenty-dollar bill, carried bullets from so many duels that he claimed to 'rattle like a bag of marbles' when he walked"". 16.	Hobbes and his logic of violence. The three principle causes of quarrel: 1. Competition, Diffidence, and 3. Glory. And the Hobbesian trap.17.	The Leviathan theory, law is better than war. A recurring theme.18.

The author starts many great topics with a series of questions and then proceeds to go to work.25.	The differences between husbands and bachelors.26.	The author brings up so many amusing historical tidbits.27.	The great crime decline of the 1990s.28.	Many social issues of interest are covered with a luxury of details.29.

The author has progressive views (for the sake of honesty so do I) and may rub the conservative voices the wrong way.3.	A couple of editing issues...minor issues considering how massive this book is. 4.	I'm an atheist but even I can find some positive things to say about some religious practices.5.	Having to buy multiple copies of this book, I rented it but I will purchase it for reference sake!In summary, this is a fascinating, massive book about the decline of violence in history. Steven Pinker has written an encyclopedic, enlightening, and ambitious book that covers practically every topic related to violence. This is a book that I will reference for the rest of my life. It’s that thorough and complete. However, this massive book will overwhelm you at times. There is so much in this book that at times it can be repetitive and will test your patience to read it all. All that being said, this book is a worthwhile read. It will reward you with enlightenment on such an important topic. Highly recommended, it’s definitely a keeper.

88,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,5,"Subtitle: ""Why Violence Has Declined"". The opening sentence of this book's preface is: ""This book is about what may be the most important thing that has ever happened in human history."" Well, then. Steven Pinker has never been one to shy away from big topics, but he also is not known for bluster which he cannot back up. So, needless to say, this is not a book of Many Small Ideas. This is a book about One Big Idea, and it is aiming high.The book apparently grew out of the 2007 Question on the website edge.org: ""What are you optimistic about?"" It was a hard time to ask such a question, with the re-election of George W Bush and two ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan all doing their part to bolster pessimism. Steven Pinker's reply was that he was optimistic about violence declining in the future, which seemed a non-obvious answer at the time. To provide more evidence to back up his assertion, he went on to write this (700 page, plus notes) book.For such an optimistic book, it is a hard read for the first few chapters, not because it is in any way badly written, but because the content is so disturbing. The first section of the book is titled ""A Foreign Country"", and the country in question is the past. In order to demonstrate that violence has declined, nearly continously over the entirety of human existence, he has to explain to us just how violent the past was. Not just violent, but sadistically, systematically, and thoroughly violent. Violent towards not only wartime enemies and murderers, but towards petty thieves, women, children, animals, and just about anyone lower in power than you. Violent as a matter of principle, as an ongoing lifestyle.This requires Pinker to undo what has been called ""the pacification of the past"", a phrase for the tendency of textbooks and museums of history to gloss over how brutal virtually every society in the past was. So, for several chapters, you get to read about torture, rape, punishment both cruel and unusual, murder both premeditated and not, and warfare going back to the Stone Age. Pinker admits in one chapter to having his sleep disturbed by his research. I was a bit worried about that from just reading it.It does get better, though, as you move on. Using many different sources of data that all paint the same picture, he shows humanity moving from a world in which 20% of males died a violent death (hunter gather society), a rate of several hundred homicides per 100,000 people per year, down to less than 100 by the high Middle Ages in Europe, down to 10 by the early 1700's, down into the low single digits by today (in Western Europe, close to 1). That is a reduction in the rate of violent death by more than two orders of magnitude. To put it another way, from the point of view of where we began, as Stone Age hunter/gatherers, the problem of violence has been 99% solved.Of course, 99% is not 100%, and even in the last 100 years there have been upticks (notably WW1 and WW2). Even these, though, on a per capita basis, are not as off the scale as they appear when viewed in absolute numbers; for example, the wars of religion in early 17th century Europe were similarly deadly (relative to population), and the fifty-year periods at the end of the 19th and 20th centuries were more peaceful than any other periods in recorded history (when viewed relative to the population, i.e. looking at the chance of any given young man dying in war rather than in absolute numbers).Of course, WW1 and WW2 are, if exceptions, nonetheless pretty big ones. WW3, if it were ever to happen, would quite possibly be large enough to outdo the death rate of the Stone Age, while simultaneously sending us back to the Stone Age. Thus, it is worth looking at not only whether violence has subsided (it apparently has, albeit unevenly), but also at why it has subsided, in order to try to figure out how to get even better results.Here, Pinker's analysis is less impressive, in my opinion. His answer, more or less, is that violence has declined because of individualism, humanism, and technology. As we are able to read books that take another person's perspective, trade with people in other countries in mutually beneficial ways that would be disrupted if we went to war, and expand our mental circle of ""those who deserve rights"" to include other countries, women, children, other races, and even animals, we ended up less likely to view others as objects to be destroyed if we want.Well, sure. This seems, though, to be describing the result, rather than explaining it. It also doesn't do a whole lot to explain what would be the best way to help the process continue. As an example of this kind of weakness, Pinker's analysis of WW2 more or less subscribes to the idea that it wouldn't have happened if not for Hitler, or if it had would not have been as destructive. It's a result of Pinker's highly individualistic belief system that he has a hard time seeing the problem in 1930's Germany as being a system in which someone like Hitler could come to power, rather than Hitler himself. Personally, I think there were probably hundreds of anti-Semitic egomaniacs who could have understood how to use radio, film, and graphic arts to ride fascism to the top of the German power structure, if Hitler hadn't gotten there first. Radio, film, and modern color printing enable nationalistic propaganda to have a reach it hadn't before, and until the experience of the late 30's and early 40's had provided a vivid example of how badly that can go, any democracy in a deep economic depression would be vulnerable to takeover (which is why Mussolini popped up at around the same time). This doesn't jive well with Pinker's classic liberal philosophy, because it more or less puts the blame for fascism (and the wars that it caused) on technology and democracy (which both Mussolini and Hitler used on their way up, even though they eliminated it once in power), two of the things he wants to credit for a decline in war and violence generally.Pinker also avoids any credit to monotheistic religion for a decline in violence, preferring to quote some of the most violent and repugnant sections of the Old Testament (and there are plenty). Nonetheless, many historians would say that the Catholic Church had more of a pacifying effect on post-Roman Empire Europe than Pinker is ready to give it credit for, and the link between the rise of monotheism and the decline of human sacrifice is pretty hard to ignore (although Pinker manages to ignore it nonetheless). Pinker also wants to give partial credit for the long-term decline in violence to the spread of literacy (if you can read about the viewpoint of another, even if in a work of fiction, you are preparing your mind to sympathize with the viewpoint of others in real life). He avoids mentioning the obvious role of Protestantism and Islam in spreading literacy, in order to facilitate reading holy texts.Still, as a thorough survey of just how far we've come, it's a great work. Steven Pinker has clearly dug deeply into the topic, and it's one we have a need to understand the reality of, not just the impression recent headlines might give. In the end, despite the difficulty of reading the first few chapters, it is an optimistic book, and it leaves the reader inoculated against the pessimism that modern atrocities might otherwise bring up. Let us hope that a generation from now, a successor can write a book (or whatever the future equivalent will be) that explains not only how far we've come, but why, and how we managed to keep those positive trends going in the 21st century."
89,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6352291-leani,5,One of the best books I have ever read.
90,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185000-jon-stout,4,"Skeptical as I was of the idea of progress in a moral sense, Steven Pinker convinced me that civilization really has progressed in terms of the way we treat each other. The book is really divided in two parts, first a historical study in which Pinker amasses enormous statistical detail to show that there has been a continual progression in the reduction of violence, and second a psychological study to unearth the causes, the constraints and the directions of this progression.Pinker’s erudition is overwhelming. The footnotes and bibliography reveal a breadth of study beyond what I could imagine one person could accomplish. I most enjoyed the historical part in which Pinker isolates six trends which have contributed to a less violent and more considerate society. The trends start with a 5000 year old trend, the move from raiding and feuding to agriculture and government, and move through more historically proximate trends toward three in the 20th and 21st centuries, namely the post-World-War-II peace, the Post-Cold-War world and the Rights movements. All six trends are exhaustively documented with an endless series of downward sloping graphs, all quite persuasively. I am a bit more skeptical of the more recent trends, since I have the feeling that what has developed in my lifetime could turn around in another lifetime. But I have become enormously grateful that I do not live in Medieval or Homeric times.The psychological study is less interesting to me because it puts more weight on controlled experiments in which human subjects (college students) are manipulated to reveal characteristics which promote or inhibit violence. The experiments are ingenious, but seem to me a lot less interesting than a discussion of social issues, or even talking with the subjects themselves about how they think. But there are still fascinating pieces, such as when Pinker discusses moral psychology, how people think about moral issues. He covers psychologists such as Jonathan Haidt who have written about how moral attitudes influence political viewpoints, and gives a comprehensive and unifying summary of the current state of the debate.Pinker is a cognitive scientist, but he also wears the hats of a linguist, of a neuroscientist and of an evolutionary psychologist. In addition, he is a very entertaining writer and has a good grasp of history, sociology and current cultural history. In short, he is a very well-educated man who has a wonderful ability to bring it all together and to offer a sound basis for a positive view of the future."
91,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41957840-antoine,5,"I'm afraid that if I were to mention all of the good things I had to say about this book my review would be as long as the book itself. Better Angels of Our Nature has the informational value of a textbook but Pinker's writing style can make you feel as though you're reading an enjoyable novel. This narrative of our violent past and much less violent present elicited in me feelings of vindication in some respects (I've never been too nostalgic about the past) and challenged me in others (broken glass policies have some strong evidence that would suggest they work). The mountain of knowledge that just rolled over my head has me struggling with how to apply what I've learned to my own life. Though the book seemed to be fashioned as a case for optimism, which it did inspire in me, I couldn't help feeling a bit pessimistic in light of the data as juxtaposed to where we find our current politics. Some findings from Pinker's analysis; Braggadocio leads to more war (Khrushchev and Kennedy independently noticed this and backed down rather than reduce civilization to a smoldering crater). Trade leads to peace as the two parties now have a vested interest in the other's well being for sake of profit. The general intelligence (apparently only a controversial concept outside of expert circles) of the president is strongly correlated to what bi-partisan historians rank as bad outcomes for the country(war, recession, strife). I am now sitting with these facts...On a happier note, it was interesting to learn of the evolutionary roots of violence. I was surprised to find out to what extent sex played a roll in human cruelty, although I shouldn't have been considering most things about us evolved to help us have sex, to keep us alive long enough to have sex, or to keep our offspring alive long enough to have sex. I wasn't surprised by which half of the species sex inspired violence in. While we're on the subject of inspiration. It was inspiring to see, in a very step-wise manner, how humanity has been making strides towards peacefulness and egalitarianism. I have a number of books that I always recommend when someone asks me what to read and this one just joined their ranks. 5+ stars. "
92,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1741894-karen,5,"An amazing and astonishing book, and one that I think that everyone should read. Although I have to admit I found the last few chapters a bit more of slog than the first several. Pinter expects people will have a hard time believing that violence has declined dramatically throughout history, and especially in recent decades; after all we hear about murders and wars and so on on the news all the time. So he spends the first several chapters going over all kinds of violence (wars, murder, rape, torture, witch hunts, genocide, etc.) and provides charts showing the decline in all of them throughout history, often with more detail on how they have declined recently. He also goes over why it's believed each kind of violence has declined. His tone is analytical and occasionally wry (when needed), since the sheer numbers of people who have suffered and died, and the few times when he gets into details (mostly in the chapter on torture; where he spells out what was standard procedure in most of Europe throughout much of its history) are truly horrifying. One statistic that stuck with me is that the rate of violent death in pre-historic groups (as figured from the remains we've found) was 15%, and that number is also characteristic of many hunter-gatherer cultures in recent history. Think about that; of every 100 people you know, 15 of them would die by violence. The murder rate in the US today is about 3 people per 100,000. The most boring, beige, suburban subdivision begins to look like the epitome of civilization, as indeed it is. The later chapters go into more depth on the reasons that violence has declined tremendously in the last few centuries, and especially the last sixty years. Pinter is not trying to say that violence will never go up again, or that it will ever totally disappear, but that by figuring out what ideas and movements have contributed to the decline of violence we can hopefully encourage those ideas, encourage peace and peacefulness, keep the rate of violence low and hopefully make it decline more. "
93,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2220787-ram,3,"Yes…. I looked forward to reading this book and was not disappointed.Personally when people start bitching about the new generation that are stuck in their electronics…. What will come out of them…. Etc… etc… I usually answer that the same was said about my generation, who grew up with TV's and rock music. But if you look at the world today, a world that is ruled by people of my generation, and compare it to the previous generations (that did not grow up with tv's and such), you see that the previous generations…. The ones that led the world to WW1 and WW2 were much worse and in general the world is a much better place today.This book basically argues that the level of violence is declining in the world, and specifically in the last 65 years has declined to rock bottom levels.The book discusses all topics of violence and describes them in all history (and prehistory) and shows with lots of detail, graphs and research that we are living in a golden era of nonviolence. Wars, crime, atrocities of governments against their own people and against other people, family violence, violence against women, violence against children, violence against minorities and more. There are pages of horror descriptions, be prepared.The author gives various reasons for the decline and is very persuasive.While reading it I was fascinated, and discussed the book with anyone who was ready to listen, and was really into it. It occupied my mind and ruled my thoughts.But the book is long…. And it goes on and on….. and repeats various points… and repeats again… and says the same thing in other words… and says the same words in other things….. Somewhere around chapter 8, is where I started losing him. From that stage, I skipped pages and skipped through the book.For that reason I give the book only 3 stars (probably would give 3.5 if I could). Somehow, I cannot give more to a book that I chose to skip most of the last third of the book.Still, I recommend it… but be prepared to skip (hold a skipping rope in your hands or something)"
94,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070799-chad-kettner,4,"Pessimism is widespread these days - especially about the prospects for living in more peaceful world. And it is understandable, as we are bombarded with reports of murder, suicide bombings, armed conflicts, hate-crimes, and uprisings... and so much more.But is human nature - the way we treat each other on a global as well as individual scale - actually getting worse? Steven Pinker says no... and offers over 800 pages of content to support his claim that ""believe it or not, today we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species' existence.""Pinker has compiled massive amounts of data, taken from a wide range of sources, on all sorts of forms of human conflict and cruelty - ranging from international war and genocide to torture, rapes, infanticide, the abuse of animals, and more. And the outcome is that almost all the trends point in the same direction: downward.This is a massive book... as in 36 hours on audiobook and 800+ pages in print. But the size of the book is justified based on the huge subject that Pinker takes on, which is twofold: 1) Demonstrating that Violence has, indeed, declined over history. 2) Explaining why violence has declined over the course of history.I won't get into the arguments or data, because it's far too much to share here. But if this topic interests you then this book will provide you with some interesting thoughts that are well-supported. I'll just leave one of the final thoughts from the book here:""The forces of modernity - reason, science, humanism, individual rights - have not, of course, pushed steadily in one direction, nor will they ever bring about a utopia or end the frictions and hurts that come with being human. But on top of all the benefits that modernity has brought us in health, experience, and knowledge we can add its role in the reduction of violence."""
95,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/877159-steve,5,"In some ways this might be one of the most important books about Humanism and Enlightenment values ever written, because it charts, scientificallyand even mathematically, the trends that contribute to a quantifiably more peaceful world. Fearmongers would have us believe that the world is a worse place than it once was, but the truth is that the past, which featured slavery, genocides and torture beyond all reckoning, was much much worse. Even if we look at the terrors of modern American industrial military torture complexes, at least we have an active (though by no means sufficient) counter current calling the government out on its crimes.such a thing would be almost unimaginable during the time of the Inquisition.The book is exhaustive, in the sense that it is long and exhausting. It took me days to read, and I'm a pretty fast reader. Pinker is nothing if not thorough, providing fodder that most authors might spread over six books. The book is at times almost Evangelical in tone,as in ""Have you heard the good news? The world is a whole lot better than you think it is, and trends show it getting better all the time!""The fact that the pacification of our worst excesses isn't obvious to us is possibly a good thing: it means that we still know that we have a lot more to accomplish towards making the world a better place. Identifying those trends that allow for pacification can give us insights as to how the levers of the world can be manipulated to accelerate the changes.Conversely, those who value the status quo might find themselves now able to put the brakes on the system.Pinker is quick to point out that these trends don't guarantee future peace and stability, or that there won't be more devastating terrorist attacks, wars, genocides or other atrocities. The trends point towards peace, for now."
96,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1720603-baal-of,5,"I read a lot of depressing non-fiction books, so it is nice to read one that actually presents some of what is going well in the world, even if it is tempered with a fair amount of caution. Pinker presents a powerhouse of a book, with carefully nuanced arguments, tons of data, and extensive references to back it all up. As I like to do, I read several of the one star reviews of this book before writing my own, and I found that even with the most wordy of them, they presented no real solid refutations of the general ideas presented in this book. It was all complaining about Pinker not giving enough credit to one ideology or another, or giving to much. One reviewer said he hid the weaknesses of his data, which is ironic and utterly untrue, since he consistently discussed the weaknesses of any particular data set, and was very careful to explain how things could be over-interpreted, and what kinds of conclusions could not be drawn, even if they were tempting.One point Pinker made that stood out for me was ""the pacification of the past"", in which textbooks, museums, and I would argue, many people including many I know, pretend that the past was not as violent as it actually was. There is a tendency for many people to romanticize the past, and conjure up mythical portrayals of various older civilizations and societies. I see the same mentality around issues of racism, feminism, animal welfare, and many other subjects dear to progressive hearts. This book managed to give me a tiny bit more hope for humanity overall, not that I'm thinking it's going to be a rose garden. Just less bad than my usual pessimistic view. We are still fucking the environment, and I really don't think we'll deal with climate change until the consequences are deadly for very large numbers of people.So, yay?"
97,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15065922-heather-fryling,3,"The basic message: War, murder, rape, and torture have decreased dramatically over human history, and the only reason we don't realize it is because we lack the numerical context. The Better Angels of Our Nature is well worth a careful read. Dr. Pinker lays out the facts in extraordinary detail and depth interspersed with common sense sanity checks that leave no doubt--the world has improved. A lot. We're getting smarter, more civilized, less violent, and more compassionate.I wish I could give Better Angels five stars, but Dr. Pinker's grating rants against religion really detracted from the whole. For all the effort Dr. Pinker put into quantifying every other conceivable variable in the text, he makes no effort to calculate the number of lives religion has improved and saved versus the number who have been killed through its misuse. He does take a few paragraphs to address this issue by defining any benefit derived from religion as part of a larger social movement working in coalition with religion, and therefore not attributable to any positive effects of religion itself. Apparently Desmond Tutu's work against apartheid, Dr. Martin Luther King Junior's contributions to civil rights, and Mahatma Gandhi's nonviolent resistance had nothing to do with religious conviction. If you have a grudge against religion, it's very convenient to define religion's positive aspects out of your discussion, but it's not very conducive to logic.Edit: I've just read several negative reviews on this book. Most of them argue that Pinker's understanding of anthropology is flimsy at best and therefore calls into question most of his thesis. Anthropology is not my field, so I can't judge Pinker's accuracy. Another question to drive further reading."

Bonus points for being a New Atheist. If this is you, do not read this review, just get the book and skim through it. You’ll have plenty of ammo to pat yourself on the back and sound interesting at your echo chamber parties and other social or digital events.If, however, you are looking for more than confirmation bias literature, you will be severely disappointed.Read Faruk Ahmet’s excellent review with which I wholeheartedly agree. My additional views in bullet points:* Pinker relishes in describing the details of torture throughout history, skillfully playing on the reader's emotions which makes the delivery of his dogma more effective* Intensive cherry-picking of facts and statistics that conform to his worldview, avoiding the other 99% of human existence through space and time* His logic goes as deep as: Marxism bad because Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot. The end* Use of biblical texts to prove how violent the past was, then throws all those events out the window saying they were probably fictitious* Miniscule evidence to show the violence of prehistoric times. Humans have an innate aggression because Our Lord and Prophet Thomas Hobbes says soIt is no surprise that Bill Gates gets a mild stiffy at the mention of this book, as do most other dinosaurs in need of a pat on the back as imperialist growth capitalism takes a slow slide down the shithole of history along with all the other unsustainable ideologies of the past."

If you don’t, it’s not necessarily a bad thing, and the good news is that they are all on the decline. Violence is on the decline on the whole, actually.It shouldn’t come as such a surprise because when you think of it we do live in a much more civilized time than ever before. Yet, it doesn’t feel that way every time we hear about an insane idiot killing schoolchildren or of other awful atrocities perpetrated somewhere in the world, so it’s nice to have it supported with numbers. Violence is on the decline across the board when numbers of crimes are calculated relative to the populations in which they occur.Regardless of its uplifting thesis, it is a difficult book to read. It is oppressive from time to time with all the minute analysis of violence and its research overkill. I felt oppressed by the amount of violence described and by all the ways people have caused harm to other people. But, it’s a wonderfully argued book, and Pinker cannot be accused of not having given enough proof to support his theses. It’s that sometimes it just feels there is too much of it. I loved the vindication of humanism, rationalism, democracy, feminism, human and animal rights, and old and boring Hobbesian political philosophy. It really is a superb book, but you don't know how glad I was when I finally finished it. It may be his best book so far though, and I thought nothing was going to beat Blank Slate."

This book was thought-provoking, informative, and incredibly well-researched and has turned my perspective upside down. Steven Pinker has gathered a staggering amount of data to back up the assertions he makes (I wonder that he had the time to do the research required but he is a professor so one could guess that he has a gaggle of grad students doing his bidding). In addition to its other positive qualities the Better Angels of Our Nature was reassuring and left me with a feeling of optimism and a different perspective on the news. While I knew already that the news highlights the negative to grab our attention (and keep ratings high - see http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29...) Steven Pinker has adjusted my perspective even more and I'm relieved to have a better picture of where humanity is headed. Here's his TED talk that's a good overview of the book http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinke.... There haven't been many books (especially non-fiction) that have left me with such a good feeling about humanity. And that's all based on the data he's presented, not just some twee happy ending. It's really a must-read."

""In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. And the Lord God took one of Adam's ribs, and made he a woman. And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain. And she again bare his brother Abel. And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. With a world population of exactly four, that works out to a homicide rate of 25%, which is about a thousand times higher than the equivalent rates in Western countries today.""""The counterpart of too much memory on the part of the victims is too little memory on the part of the perpetrators. On a visit to Japan in 1992, I bought a tourist guide that included a helpful timeline of Japanese history. There was an entry for the period of Taisho democracy from 1912 to 1926, and then there was an entry for the Osaka World's Fair in 1970. I guess nothing interesting happened in Japan in the years in between."""
102,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61580272-devin,1,"This book does show a decline in violence and particularly gruesome forms of execution worldwide, which is very interesting! That said, Pinker’s conclusions about why violence has declined are not convincing. The leviathan, the ‘free’ market, and the enlightenment are given the credit for the decline in violence, which is convenient for his world view. As an example of his narrow intellectual viewpoint, he briefly mentions self esteem and makes the false claim that people who commit violent crimes have too much of it. If he had bothered to look through the literature at all he’d know that violent criminals are notorious narcissists and that healthy self esteem is the exact opposite of narcissism. I’m appalled that he could so thoughtlessly spit out the Conservative party line on this issue, when programs to increase healthy self esteem are some of the most effective against violence, drug use and unwanted teenage pregnancy. A much more interesting look at the subject of declining violence comes from Lloyd DeMause (whom Pinker quotes several times). I recommend his work far above Pinker’s.As any student of climate change can tell you this is a finite zero sum world. Anyone telling you anything else is selling something, as indeed, Pinker is. He claims ideologies are the ultimate evil while faithfully attempting to bail out his own."
103,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29406296,4,"I'm not going to give this a long review as many others have. I thoroughly enjoyed most of this book, especially the retelling of our ancestors horrific past, and for my enjoyment alone it earned 4/5. Why not 5/5? For the many reasons already cited against the text. Is it possible to really tackle the fascinating history of violence (and it's apparent decline) by one person in one book? Frankly I think he should have taken a few more years to finish it, what would he have to say about the growing nationalism today, or the swearing in of America's least intelligent president? And even if people are less prone to creative methods of torture, don't they indulge in it just as much digitally? My biggest problem is that Pinker's main focus throughout the entire book is the Western world. He doesn't really engage with anything outside of it for longer than a sound bite, either because they lack the data necessary to make conclusions about or lack the data that supports his claims. Either way, the book is a narrow window into the world of bad behavior. For it's length, I wouldn't recommend it to most people uninterested in pulling the argument apart and looking at it piece by piece. This argument can be found condensed elsewhere -namely his TED talk, and I'm sure in other places as well. And to get the whole perspective of the topic, one should certainly peruse the one star reviews. "
104,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5209633-richard-brand,1,"I can not do it. I can not and will not even try to endure the next 25 hours that Kindle says are needed to finish this book. No wonder Bill Gates likes it. It is so full of graphs, logarithm, bell curves, datasets, and all manner of things that are pulled together to make the case that the world is getting nicer. It is obvious to me that he has made a good case or there would not be as much talk about this book as there seems to be. The fact that we may be historically getting less violent is not a help to the people being killed in the middle east and the other places where tribes and groups are killing people. The death toll by gun violence in this country maybe statistically lower than it was fifty years ago according to adjustments for population but that does not make the grief for those killed any less. Because I have not read and will not read any more, I don't know if the argument is made that because we are now less violent, we can reduce our spending on military weapons? I doubt it. Because I have not completed his argument, I do not know what kind of conclusions he draws from this massive amount of research and statistic that he complied. It is more than I could endure."
105,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5781681-jonathan-z,1,"This is a dangerous book with a pernicious premise. Pinker is clearly an anti-theist (not merely an atheist who doesn't believe in the divine, but one who is actively and militantly opposed to the idea of an absolute truth) who believes in humanism to the point he is willing to manipulate data to fit his worldview. He carelessly dismisses millennia of history as ""myth"" and claims there is no proof that the events in either the Old Testament or New Testament happened; that archeology never uncovered proof of Noah's flood (there is an entire museum with proof dedicated to the Flood in Kentucky) and archeologists cannot prove where Jericho was, but then uses archeology to back his claim that violence is on the decline. He should not be permitted to speak out of both sides of his mouth like this. Furthermore, he uses percentages to show his point. If an early tribe of 100 got into a fight and lost 30 people, that's 30%; catastrophic indeed! He compares this to WWII where the US, with a provable population of 350M, lost <2% of its population. Sure, that looks good by percentages, but 2% of 350M is 7M... a much higher number than 30 people in the tribal Indian Wars Pinker compares this to. "
106,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422285-james-murphy,5,"Considering the news reports about war, terrorism, and violent crime we hear and read every day, you wouldn't think we're living in an age which might be thought of as the most peaceful in history. But Steven Pinker writes convincingly that the incidence of violence of all kinds has been in decline for centuries, and particularly during the 2d half of the 20th century. Generally, Pinker attributes this to the blooming of liberalism and modern emphasis on political correctness. Societies are more right-thinking and are everywhere undergoing what he calls a civilizing process, a revolution in humanitarianism and a belief in the rights of individuals and groups. After writing about the psychological motivations for violence, Pinker covers comprehensively a history of it with heavy focus on the causes of war, the strong forces within societies which foster violence, and the increase in those human virtues, like empathy and reason, which are sharply reducing it. So Pinker's exhaustive study of violence and its decline moves from psychology to history to sociology to philosophy. I believe this may be an important book."

I question how he came up with some of the statistics but I never got to those statistics to understand how he came up with the numbers. While I think violence is likely declining in many ways due to the data I've seen, I don't know if it's declining to the extent that Pinker is claiming. I found the book incredibly depressing due to the way it was written and some of the author's views, despite the main theme of violence decreasing being positive. I also wonder about a bunch of historical claims he made as some of the violence formerly understood in ancient times is now being disputed with new evidence including by his own colleague at Harvard, William Ury. Again, I didn't finish the book so perhaps at some point these questions and seeming discrepancies were handled. "

Take some time to investigate the source of his data for, say, the Middle Ages. Does he cite any actual medieval historians? no. How about some primary sources? no. It's Barbara Tuchman (!) and some soi-disant 'historical atrocitologists'. Now I actually kind of like the argument in its purest form (that violence is declining), and it might just be possible to prove that point for the period after which reliable data is possible, but Pinker embarrasses himself by reaching beyond that period."

Pinkers main evidence for a decrease in violence is that North America, Western and Central Europe have become increasingly less violent. He fails to adequately acknowledge that for over four centuries these countries have transferred their commerce to the colonies in decidedly ungentle ways, leaving a legacy of oppression, poverty and violence and then he continues to have the gall to suggest that if Africans hadn't deposed their colonial masters we wouldn't be so violent?

He never actually lied, he just distorted the meaning behind everything he was talking about. Anyone not versed in the history or passages from literature or scripture he was referring to wouldn't catch it right away. Example, he talks about Solomon and his threatening to cut the baby in half and states as a fact the king planned on actually cutting the baby in half even though the passage implies he knew the reaction of the true mother. He talks about sports as if they are designed to hurt people while never saying anything actually false, he distorts the truth with implications. "

Pinker's ""The Blank Slate"" also changed my world view. That book also opened my eyes to the false preconceptions I had developed while growing up about man.

127,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1139239-michael-austin,5,"I will admit to being, generally, a Steven Pinker fan. His book The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature, which I read when I team-taught a course with a colleague in the psychology department, was my first introduction to evolutionary psychology. It affected me so much that it started me on a five-year reading binge that culminated in Useful Fictions: Evolution, Anxiety, and the Origins of Literature, my own book on evolution and literature. And I thought that How the Mind Works was even better. Even with this background in Pinker fandom, though, I was not prepared for how really good his newest book would be. It is a remarkably good book. It might even end up being an important book--a designation that I can give to very few books published in anybody's lifetime.In the strictest sense, The Better Angels of Our Nature is two books, or, at least, two book length arguments (at 800 pages, it can easily contain two book-length arguments with room to spare). The first and longest of the arguments is a data-driven, social-science argument that violence had indeed declined. In this, he is entirely persuasive. The second ""book"" is a cognitive, neuroscientific presentation of some of the possible reasons that violence has declined. Of necessity, this is a much more speculative argument, but Pinker acknowledges this to be the case.The first of these arguments, of course, lends itself to the question, ""violence has decreased compared to what, over what period of time, and among which group(s) of people?"" The answer, pretty much, is ""all of them."" But that takes a whole lot of explaining, which constitutes about 2/3 of the book. But most of this is statistical support. The actual arguments are fairly short:Violence has declined over the span of human evolutionThis is the anthropological argument, and it relies, admittedly, on some speculative data. We can estimate the number of hunter-gatherers who died violent deaths from a number of data points: trauma evident from fossilized remains, death rates among contemporary or recent hunter-gatherer tribes, behavior of closely related primate species. All of this is guesswork, but, taken together, it creates a reasonable case for saying that people alive at almost any point in recorded history have had a smaller chance of dying violently than most prehistoric and proto-human beings.The reason for the evolutionary decline = the rise of civilizations that grouped people into larger ""in-groups"" and decreased the number of people in the world who were your enemy.Both Interstate Warfare and cultural violence have declined over the past 500 years Pinker is able to draw on fairly substantial data sets that show that deaths from wars, homicides, raids, plunders and the like have dropped dramatically in the world--especially in Western Europe and America--from about 1500. We can trace, during this time, evolving standards of decency that have dramatically increased the perceived value of human life. In the middle ages, there were multiple engines of unimaginable cruelty: political torture, religious inquisition, aristocratic mischief, serfdom, slavery, etc. Gradually (and inconsistently), beginning in about 1500 and continuing to this day, certain categories of violence have decreased steadily as human beings just get more decent about a lot of stuff.The reasons for the historical decline: 1) The Enlightenment, which dramatically reduced things such as witch burning, inquisitioning, bear-baiting, cat-burning, peasant-torturing, slave-owning, religious warring, and all other manner of violence that ran amok in the pre-Enlightenment world. 2) The Leviathan State, which usually enforces laws against violence more or less effectively; 3) The rise of literacy, which allows people to read about and experience other people, leading to greater empathy for them.Interstate conflict over territory has decreased over the past 200 years Starting at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, there have been far fewer casualties from war than at any other time in history. This, of course, requires us to account for World War I and World War II, along with the Holocaust, and the various genocides of the 20th century. Pinker spends a lot of time talking about these issues and demonstrating that, even with these events included, deaths by violence have been trending downward since the beginning of the 19th century. Pinker presents strong evidence that the ""famous"" acts of cataclysmic violence of the 20th century are spikes in clearly identifiable downward trends resulting from things such as the end of slavery, the decolonization of the third world, and a growing hesitancy on the part of most (certainly not all) decision makers to engage in wars of conquest.Reasons for these declines: 1) The consolidation of state power into fewer and fewer countries that can actually fight each other; 2) Stronger international organizations that have created an international environment hostile to wars of conquest; 3) international trade relationships, which make people in other countries more valuable alive (as customers) than dead; and 4) an increase in the number of democratic governments, which are far less likely to initiate wars of conflict than other kinds of government.IWars of all kinds have decreased dramatically since the end of World War IIDespite all of the predictions for World War III, it never happened, and the Cold War ended with a whimper. There has not been a nuclear weapon used in a war since the close of World War II, and the actual number of interstate conflicts--along with the number of people dying in such conflicts--has flattened out to only a fraction of what they were for most of human history. Only a handful of interstate wars have happened since WWI (Iran-Iraq/Ethiopia-Etria/America-Korea/America-Vietnam/Russia-Afghanistan). Many other conflicts have been Civil Wars or colonial wars, but even these have decreased markedly.Reasons for these declines: 1) Nuclear weapons raised the potential cost of war to something higher than most countries were willing to pay; 2) US and USSR kept most of their allies in line during the Cold War; 3) Presence of international organizations, trade, and democratic governments decreased motivations for war; 4) the collapse of fascism in Western Europe and Communism in Eastern Europe removed from the world Utopian ideologies often used to justify massive amounts of violence.Since the 1950s, ""rights revolutions"" have decreased violence precipitously within statesThe second half of the 20th century has seen a rise in movements for civil rights, woman's rights, children's rights, and the rights of minorities, colonized people, and religious groups. We are very familiar with these revolutions in the United States and Western Europe, but they have been even more important in places like India, Japan, and some of the nations of Africa. These rights revolutions have been responsible for driving down (though obviously not eliminating) such categories of violence as spouse abuse, child abuse, gay bashing, lynching, and violence caused by rioting. Reasons for these declines: 1) More democracies have led to more diversity among decision makers; 2) more open societies have given oppressed groups a greater ability to influence political processes; 3) greater international pressure has pressured nations to improve their internal human rights; 4) Powerful communications technologies have introduced more and more people to each other, making it much more difficult to deny them rights.In sumI find Pinker's evidence to be more than compelling. I think that he more than meets any standard of proof for the assertion that ""violence is declining""--everywhere, among everybody, for a whole lot of reasons. He clearly acknowledges that ""declining"" is not the same as ""ending."" And he clearly states that the decline is not guaranteed to continue. But, for now, the ""better angels of our nature"" (such as the human capacity for empathy, the will to cooperate, the ability to reason through conflicts, the ability to exercise self-control, and the desire to create a secure environment for ourselves and our families) seem to be emerging while the other angels (aggression, competition, the will to dominate, our massive biases towards our own perspective) seem to be losing the iron grip that they have generally had on our souls.The Better Angels of Our Nature confirms my own experience of the world and its people. Most people that I know (including myself) want to be good people. We like to think of ourselves as open-minded, compassionate, forgiving, open to other people, and willing to be a positive influence in the world and in our own communities. Most people I know (including myself) are also capable of being reprehensible, unreasonable, closed-minded, reactionary, aggressive jerks. And most people I know (including myself) could, under the right circumstances, become murderous thugs. One of the most important roles of local governments, nations, and international organizations is to organize society in such away that the good angels have a better chance of surfacing than the bad angels. Steven Pinker's marvelous new book is a good place to start learning how. "
128,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48009491-brianna-silva,5,"I think everyone involved in activism or politics (even to a minor extent) should be familiar with the concepts in this book; and if they have the time, they should read it themselves. Much of what you'll find in here goes against the common narratives or conventional wisdom you may have about the state of the world, and the state of humanity.The surprising, and important truth is: Things are getting better. Violence, in all its forms, is in decline, and has been for a long time. This book presents the amazing case that this is true, then explores the question: Why?It's good for us to acknowledge, and be grateful for, the incredible changes that have happened in the world. It puts our current problems in perspective, and makes the fight for a better world far more hopeful.But at the same time, it's crucial that we recognize there is no natural ""arc of history bending towards justice"". Continuing down this path is not our inevitable future. There are distinct causes of this pacification, and if these forces change or lose their power, we can easily revert into the extreme violence and cruelty of our past. (Such situations already exist, on small scales, in various pockets of the world.)What are those forces of pacification? The book describes and explains them in detail, but in a nutshell they are the following:1. ""The Leviathan"" - Whenever law, or a stronger, bigger force steps into a community (whether that be government, policing, or alliances/agreements between state powers), violence decreases. In other words: Anarchy is bad, people. Sorry.2. ""Trade"" - When two groups begin trading resources, the incentive to fight over those resources essentially disappears.3. ""Feminization"" - Societies that create better situations for women consistently have less violence. Giving more power and autonomy to women, even in small ways, tilt the culture away from runaway masculine aggression. Also, cultures that foster what we feminists call ""toxic masculinity"" (though not the term Pinker uses, it's the same thing) are more violent.4. ""Expanding circles of empathy"" - We evolved to care about people in our group, and to be apathetic to people outside our group. But the miracle of globalization is that what constitutes ""our group"" has been ever-increasing over the centuries. It began with novels, which allowed people to walk in the shoes of people very different from themselves, and continues today with the Internet, travel, and immigration. Our worldwide coldness towards ""the other"" is decreasing, because ""the other"" is becoming a smaller and smaller category.5. ""Increase in reason"" - Religion is not a force for peace. Sorry, the weight of history disproves that quite easily. Though sometimes ideologies like religion do move people towards peace and compassion, they have also been, arguably, the sources of our worst violence and cruelty. On the other hand, as ideas like humanism and liberalism (not the ""leftist"" kind, mind you) have spread, and education has cultivated our worldwide ability to think abstractly and rationally, many of the ridiculous, ideological forces of violence in the past have become unthinkable to us. (Note: #4 and #5 go hand in hand. If you have one without the other, you may not necessary see a decrease in violence. Strangely, even empathy can make us do terrible things - if it's a selective empathy, for instance - unless it is balanced with reason. And I don't think I need to explain how reason without empathy can be problematic.) We must guard and cultivate these forces with everything we have. Literal lives - and our future prosperity - depend on it.This book is, by all respects, a tome. But it's long because it's thorough in its research and evidence. If making the world a better place is something you care about, this should be a must-read. (At the very least, read a summarized version of it. ;D)"
129,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5780762-andreww,5,"Steven Pinker is probably the best science populariser writing today, but to label him as just that does him a disservice. In The Better Angels of Our Nature he has possibly written the most important book of this type since The Selfish Gene was published back in the 1970s. I've read most of Pinker's stuff, The Language Instinct was complex and difficult, The Blank Slate reasoned and hard-edged, this is both of those things, but also, wonderfully and simply, filled with unalloyed good news.Pinker doesn't shout, scream or extemporise, he just diligently shares the evidence and his thinking about the topic in question and trusts that our reason will deliver us to the same place he's already arrived at. This book is a wonderful example of the acidic efficacy of a skeptical, forensic mind, carefully arguing an evidence-based point, the perfect antidote to the distressing herd instinct that afflicts much of humanity's thinking on a range of topics, but particularly that old bug-bear the state of the world today.There is no dewey-eyed naiveté here, this is a hard-nosed analysis of a complex topic, but it is laced with many, many reasons for optimism. What Steven Pinker explodes here is a powerful and horrific myth that stalks our lives and fills the media. We are bombarded in this age of instant news with depressing images of how difficult, violent and brutish life is, much of the underlying commentary and analysis offering a bleak perspective. The mantra basically runs that things are worse now than they have ever been (look at September 11, the war in Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt, the 7/7 bombings, the war in Iraq, the Mumbai shootings of 2008, in fact choose your violent cataclysm or social ill) or at the very least, it's not getting any better.Pinker simply asks the question; Okay, but let's look wider and deeper at the whole sweep of human history and see how those claims stand up. Are they right? From our small ant-sized perspective inside one human life-time we cannot possibly extrapolate from our particular experience, necessarily limited as it is, to the general situation for humanity over time. This books enables us to see so much further and gain more insight into the social development of our species.And what we discover is that something surprising and incredible has been happening quietly and relatively unnoticed for centuries. All kinds of violence have been slowly and steadily reducing over the course of human history. We are getting less violent and nicer to each other over time. Of course none of this takes away from the horror for the individuals suffering in the world today, but Pinker's point is that the horror and suffering we see today is very, very much lower than it was and if we can understand the forces of history that have delivered us relatively peaceful and benign societies in many, many parts of the world we can work to encourage those forces globally, supporting the better angels of our human nature to prevail over the more destructive ones.Nowadays in Western nations we live in some of the safest societies that have ever existed. Our chances of being murdered nowadays are astronomically small where for our forbears, before the rise of democracies, commerce and the feminization of social values the chances of witnessing violence or being a victim of it were almost everyday. The Daily Mail and Fox News and all those old folk huddled round the gas heater at the local nursing home reminiscing about how much better things were in the rose-tinted past are completely and utterly wrong. We kind of knew it really, but there is so much evidence to back up Pinker's hypothesis that the naysayers will have real trouble debunking it.I warn you it's a long book, a half hour reading on my Kindle rendered a reluctant advancement of 1% through the manuscript for example, but it is such an important book you need to read every word. Because this isn't just a claim that we are living through the least violent and most passive period of human history, it is a thorough-going account of the social and psychology forces that have produced this amazing miracle. It also offers clear notions and proscriptions for us and our societies about how we can foster the correct psychology and social environments that will continue this effect.If you read no other books this year, you should read this one as it offers a deep insight into the human condition in the past and how and why it has improved and still improves each and every day. Whilst not a cure to the philosophical cynicism of John Gray, this books certainly lands firmly on the ""glass is half full"" side of the argument.A resoundingly hopeful book, debunking the human-derived myth of the noble and glorious past we used to live when we were supposedly in harmony with nature. What we were was violent, racist, tribal and blood-thirsty. Genetically we are programmed to see ""the other"" as the enemy, a member of another tribe competing for our land, our reproductive rights, our food. However over hundreds of years through a process where we have gradually become more and more aware of each other and the suffering and experience of others, we have collectively began to empathise with that other and reduced our violence towards them as a result.The five forces Pinker says were central to this process of reducing violence are (source Wikipedia);The Leviathan - The rise of the modern nation-state and judiciary ""with a monopoly on the legitimate use of force,” which “can defuse the [individual] temptation of exploitative attack, inhibit the impulse for revenge, and circumvent…self-serving biases.”Commerce - The rise of “technological progress [allowing] the exchange of goods and services over longer distances and larger groups of trading partners,” so that “other people become more valuable alive than dead” and “are less likely to become targets of demonization and dehumanization”;Feminization - Increasing respect for ""the interests and values of women.”Cosmopolitanism - the rise of forces such as literacy, mobility, and mass media, which“can prompt people to take the perspectives of people unlike themselves and to expand their circle of sympathy to embrace them”;The Escalator of Reason - an “intensifying application of knowledge and rationality to human affairs,” which “can force people to recognize the futility of cycles of violence, to ramp down the privileging of their own interests over others’s, and to reframe violence as a problem to be solved rather than a contest to be won.”He also goes onto the detail our demons and our angels psychologically;Predatory or Instrumental Violence – that is, violence “deployed as a practical means to an end.”Dominance - The “urge for authority, prestige, glory, and power”; Pinker argues that dominance motivations can be found both on the individual level and on the level of “racial, ethnic, religious, or national groups.”Revenge - The “moralistic urge toward retribution, punishment, and justice.”Sadism - Violence caused by taking pleasure in another’s suffering.Ideology - A “shared belief system, usually involving a vision of utopia, that justifies unlimited violence in pursuit of unlimited good …”[2]FOUR BETTER ANGELS (Chapter 9) Pinker here examines four motives that “can orient [humans] away from violence and towards cooperation and altruism.” He identifies:Empathy - Which “prompts us to feel the pain of others and to align their interests with our own”;Self-Control - Which “allows us to anticipate the consequences of acting on our impulses and to inhibit them accordingly”;The Moral Sense - Which “sanctifies a set of norms and taboos that govern the interactions among people in a culture""; these sometimes decrease violence but can also increase it “when the norms are tribal, authoritarian, or puritanical”;Reason - Which “allows us to extract ourselves from our parochial vantage points.”A thoroughly informative and important book.***** Five stars, but be warned you'll be there a while but it is worth it because of the sheer sweep of his analysis and the depth with which he explores all of the issues."
130,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63623534-matt-gilbertson,5,"Having finished reading this book, I can finally stop bothering my family, friends, and coworkers with every next fascinating argument it advances or study it references. I think my obsession with it is summed up particularly well early on, where Pinker explains the Hobbesian view that human beings are naturally violent and the Rousseauian perspective that they are naturally peaceful, basically concluding with ""well, those are both compelling points that sound convincing; how are we to know which one is correct? Luckily, we have a bunch of information on this!"" He tirelessly enumerates the facts of the history of violence to make the simple case that it has been in decline, both on the long view of the course of human history and even in the short term of the last few decades. He takes great care to note that many believe modern times are violent to an unprecedented degree, and his refutation of that claim benefits greatly from his dispassionate, factual approach. It doesn't really matter how sad you are when you read the news about the latest terror attack: the numbers betray the truth that people are killing each other at decreasing rates. I thought the first half was interesting enough, taking every conceivable angle at arguing the factual case that the numbers are going down. But the second half, trying to explain the psychology behind violence and understand some of the reasons that people may be engaging in it less, was even more so. Upon finishing this book, I find myself inspired to read more on the philosophers who got some things (though never everything) right, and to look at more of the objective statistics that can hedge against the myopia and bias inherent to any person's view. The phrase ""standing on the shoulders of giants"" keeps coming to mind as I read his references to Hobbes, Rousseau, Kant, Bacon, and others, revealing that the epiphanies of my own that I had thought so insightful were just reinventing centuries-old wheels. I have more appreciation than ever for the Enlightenment and the processes of debating and testing ideas to see whether or not they hold up, regardless of how well they agree with what I already thought. I would strongly recommend this book, both for the series of surprising conclusions it handily draws from a rich well of factual evidence and for the fascinating components of human nature it articulates over a long list of studies in the process of explaining our relationship with violence."
131,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10377581-xavier,5,"Only an inflated sense of our own importance could turn our desire to escape thePacifist’s Dilemma into a grand purpose of the cosmos. But the desire does seem to tapinto contingencies of the world that are not exactly physical, and so it is different from thedesires that were the mothers of other inventions such as refined sugar or central heating.The maddening structure of a Pacifist’s Dilemma is an abstract feature of reality. So is itsmost comprehensive solution, the interchangeability of perspectives, which is the principlebehind the Golden Rule and its equivalents that have been rediscovered in so many moraltraditions. Our cognitive processes have been struggling with these aspects of reality overthe course of our history, just as they have struggled with the laws of logic and geometryThough our escape from destructive contests is not a cosmic purpose, it is a humanpurpose. Defenders of religion have long claimed that in the absence of divine edicts,morality can never be grounded outside ourselves. People can pursue only selfishinterests, perhaps tweaked by taste or fashion, and are sentenced to lives of relativism andnihilism. We can now appreciate why this line of argument is mistaken. Discoveringearthly ways in which human beings can flourish, including stratagems to overcome thetragedy of the inherent appeal of aggression, should be purpose enough for anyone. It is agoal that is nobler than joining a celestial choir, melting into a cosmic spirit, or beingreincarnated into a higher life-form, because the goal can be justified to any fellow thinkerrather than being inculcated to arbitrary factions by charisma, tradition, or force. And thedata we have seen in this book show that it is a goal on which progress can be made—progress that is halting and incomplete, but unmistakable nonetheless.Yet while this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, thatspecies has also found ways to bring the numbers down, and allow a greater and greaterproportion of humanity to live in peace and die of natural causes.For all the tribulations in our lives, for all the troubles that remain in the world, the decline of violence is an accomplishment we can savor, and an impetus to cherish the forces of civilization andenlightenment that made it possible."
132,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745880-audrephilia,4,"This was my first Pinker. Apparently, he has a huge following, which I learned researching this book. I saw him on Colbert a long while back and added this to my to-read. I was very interested in the thesis that violence has decreased substantially over time and we're now living in the most peaceful time in the known history of our species.Generally, he proved his point. It's true. While it's not a patently peaceful time and things aren't perfect (to which he concedes) but it is a damn sight better than it ever has been.I especially enjoyed the ""sanity check"" at the beginning, in which he explores the rationality and horrific violence in the alleged basis of morality, religion. (It's alleged in that it's clear from the contemporary behavior of the followers that they follow modern principles of moral behavior rather than those proscribed in religious texts.) I also liked the chapters on violence against women, children, and gay people. It was really sobering to read how recently it was that the world mostly agreed that women and children are autonomous people deserving of dignity and not deserving of unbelievable violence. I always thought that laws going back pretty far in time that forbade rape was because, to some extent, I thought cultures thought rape was wrong--That it was a horrible violation of women. I thought maybe the laws had sexists bases, like women were helpless and needed patriarchal protection and that's why sometimes men murdered other men who raped. I was really surprised to learn that historically, rape was a tremendous crime against a man; raping a daughter or wife was to rob a father or husband of a precious commodity--the virginity or purity of the girl or woman in his possession. And that one of the only ways for a rapist to make what he did right by the men he offended was to offer a price for the raped woman. And that raped women lived out their lives with their rapists. Often.I was shocked at the history of violence against children and infanticide. That postpartum depression is not a malfunction, but an inborn device to remove the ""rose-tinted view"" of motherhood so that women could make hard decisions about the resources available to her for herself and her other children. So that she can decide if a new baby should live. My god. Postpartum depression commonly coincides with women whose lives are unsure and resources might be unreliable, so the mechanism kicks in after birth to help her do a cost-benefit analysis. So there's an evolutionary function to infanticide! And it was COMMON for so long.It was illuminating, but I have some criticisms: He speaks from an almost purely biological perspective and mostly avoids social perspectives. I know he's a scientist and I knew this book would be more oriented in the physical sciences, but I feel that whenever he encountered an opportunity for a social perspective (even a brief one), he'd avoid it for the most part. At times, it felt like he undervalued social issues and felt that biological ones were more important, applicable, and a better explanation for human behavior than social perspectives. In the section on rape, he did seem a little prickly about the suggestion that feminist movements have had a major role in the reduction of rape and other violence against women. I understand and agree that our culture ""was ready for the change"" and that when laws were passed to protect women and punish the men who beat, rape, and kill them, there were no riots, revolts, people beating down doors at city hall, and so forth (which is seen when government or society implements something for which its members are NOT ready) and that the violence toward and rape of women coincided with a GENERAL decline in ALL violence (suggesting the culture is becoming less violent on the whole), but it felt like he was undermining or devaluing the contributions of various movements and advocacy groups. He did give credit to the feminist movement for making it so that ultimately women had a voice in our government (voting) and held office and other positions of power and that overwhelmingly changed the way women were treated and regarded in our culture. So that's good. But it doesn't change that little sense I got from other comments in the book.Another thing that bugged me was the whole issue of rape. I totally agree that rape is not just ""an act of power, not sex""--Sex plays a role in rape! Totally agree. But sometimes I felt he was being a little snide with things like saying when a frat guy hovers around a too-drunk coed, he's not thinking about reinstating a patriarchy. Maybe I'm too ""politically correct"" or sensitive or something, but it rubbed me the wrong way. I understand that I entered the reading of this from my very contemporary, very western paradigm, one that views most violence as so taboo that it is my cultural imperative to think, ""Never okay, never justifiable, should never be tolerated"" (especially in the cases of rape and infanticide) and I've recently been forced to flex that muscle. Flex it a LOT. Every Tuesday and Thursday, for a role-playing history class. We had to check our entire scientific paradigm at the door to win the game. We had to forget gravity, genes, cells, and every bit of common astronomy we've learned since childhood, including Earth's movement and the sun's position. I was impressed with my ability to manage this! And I understood reading this book that every age in every culture in every part of the world has its customs, mores, traditions, and taboos. To calm my socialized frontal lobe so that I can nod in understanding of why mothers in the 16th century commonly chunked their newborns into latrines, smothered them with pillows, or poisoned them with opium on the breast was a nice, good exercise of that muscle. But for me to accept only or MOSTLY biological, evolutionary explanations for everything and never or rarely social ones is asking a bit much. I know he didn't explicitly say that social issues are irrelevant in the matter of where we land as a culture--more violent or less violent. He didn't even imply that, but he did, in my opinion, somewhat undermine social factors. If we have always been biologically the same, then it stands to reason that society, the social business, has changed and led to this drastic reduction in violence over time. And instead of some comments to that effect at the end, acknowledgement (or at least not being blasé about it) throughout the entire book would've made it a more palatable read for me.I think the knowledge and hope that it's getting better everywhere is moving, amazes me, and assuages the occasional tendency to become morose about my fellow people. Good facts, good data.. I enjoyed it."
133,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97551411-sarah,3,"this book was painfully long, especially compared to the amount of stuff Pinker was trying to communicate (it could have been half the length! maybe two thirds the length). another issue is that the book felt somewhat racist and sexist and insensitive at points, like in the way Pinker characterizes islamic countries or talks about innate biologies or focuses on western civilizations or vilifies leftist ideologies. he does make other points throughout the book that suggest maybe this is not his entire persona, however, although I'm not sure if I should even be trusting someone who is associated with Epstein. the quality of the writing gets five stars - it is very good! and the depth with which Pinker discusses his topic and spells out his thesis is admirable. although I didn't like the part where he talked about specific brain parts and how it relates to human psychology (therefore convincing me that the medical field and psychology are not at all for me), it was a good addition to discuss the psychological science behind the statistics and historical theorizing that happens in the first half of the book. there is always the issue of using statistical methods and how well these analyses have been carried out, which may make or break his argument, especially with a lot of the war analysis. however, his idea that when you really reasonably think about it, violence in terms of war frequency, torture tactics, societal norms, and lots of other categories has decreased over many hundreds of years is both interesting and ultimately believable. a four star book demoted to three stars because I'm convinced Pinker is more closely associated with Epstein than he claims he is."
134,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26771089-leah-lederman,5,"I agreed with the premise of the book before diving in. After eight weeks of reading, and traveling through a history of human violence across the globe, being hand-held through charts and led through study after study, I learned a lot more than just ""We're not as violent as we used to be."" I have always thought humans were always just sumbitches, and we haven't changed a bit. Turns out, we have. We are repulsed by things that were commonplace just a hundred years ago. Genocide unsettling? It's not new--but a revulsion to it is. That's just one example, though it's a pretty good one. If you're interested in human history and you're interested in being contrary on Facebook threads, this book will give you more ammunition than you even know what to do with. I plan to continue soaking this one in for a long time, and make an outline of its chapters while it's still fresh in my head. No, this isn't a great review, but it's a placeholder for a better one. "
135,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855741-christopher,5,"Brilliant for its scope and clarity. Almost seven hundred pages long, but tightly packed with citations, graphs and references. Throughout the book, Pinker underlines the assumptions behind his arguments, as well as the narrow bounds within which his conclusions hold. The effect is that Pinker makes the weak points of his arguments clear. There's little in the way of self-serving obfuscation here; this is not punditry.But despite that, Pinker's thesis is neither sexy nor politically palatable, and much of the pop criticism you'll find of this text (such as some of the one-star reviews here) don't target his arguments as much as insult him. Ignore all of this; I don't think there's much of value to find there.Other critics are more sophisticated. Most famously, Taleb. Be sure to read these criticisms (and Pinker's rebuttal)."
136,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6857911-ryan,5,"The Better Angels of Our Nature makes the bold claim in its first pages that human violence has not only declined (in relative terms) throughout the modern era, but has done so in virtually every measurable category, from war, to homicide, to non-fatal acts of aggression, to punishment of crime, to attitudes about acceptable behavior. Like many readers, I suspect, my eyebrows went up a little. Really? What about the World Wars? The Holocaust and other genocides? Terrorism? Serial killers? All the horrible crimes on the news?However, armed with an abundance of statistics and historical anecdotes, Pinker makes a persuasive case that wars and mass exterminations, on average, really do kill fewer people than in the past, even taking into account the 20th century's major cataclysms (which he sees as exceptions to the overall trend). Other forms of aggression have also subsided considerably, the shocking events captured by the modern media notwithstanding. Pinker dispels the PC notion that man lived as a peaceful “noble savage” in pre-modern times, and provides a free-ranging tour of the history of violence, as understood by historians, economists, anthropologists, behavioral psychologists, primatologists, and evolutionary biologists. Few stones are left unturned in a quest to seek not only if and why violence has declined, but what causes human beings to be violent against each other in the first place.If you're wondering, Pinker attributes the decline to three major causes. One is the ""Leviathan"" proposed by Thomas Hobbes in the 17th Century, a state with the monopoly on the legitimate use of force. It seems intuitive to me that people would behave better towards each other when there’s a ""parent"" figure to mete out justice, forestalling the cycles of revenge that occur when humans seek their own justice, and Pinker makes compelling arguments that this is true. As centralized states with complex economies formed, it became an imperative to the ruling class to cut down on internecine warfare that disrupted its own interests, and aggression became a less rational choice to everyone else invested in the system, as well.Another major cause that Pinker identifies is a change in cultural attitudes. As certain forms of oppression, violence, or cruelty became unacceptable, this put pressure on others. The formation of ""rights"" in a society, not surprisingly, opens the door to other rights, as the progressive-minded call attention to inconsistencies in social or political norms. Then there was the rise in humanitarian empathy that followed widespread literacy, when novels such as Uncle Tom’s Cabin made it easier for people to step into the shoes of those outside their own circles.While this is a somewhat long book, I was never bored with the wealth of detail. Pinker goes out of his way to anticipate opposing positions and respond to them. While I didn't agree with his reasoning on everything and was skeptical of some data points, I felt that he drew in enough support from different places to make an overall convincing case. He also gets credit for not playing too strongly to contemporary politics. While he's writing from the left and takes positions that are bound to annoy a few conservatives (e.g. we're overreacting to terrorism and Iran, medieval Christian churches tortured heretics out of genuine commitment to their faith), he goes after ""politically correct"" orthodoxies as well. For instance, he criticizes the view that ""nurture"" matters a lot more than ""nature"", goes after the notion that people behave aggressively because of low self-esteem (bullies are acting out natural dominance behavior and tend to have a high opinion of themselves), and observes that sadism is unfortunately not a “perversion”, but a product of normal human tendencies that kick in when emotional counterbalances are removed.I particularly enjoyed the last section of the book, which explores the psychological and evolutionary motives for violence, as well as aspects of human nature that resist it. In exploring the “demons”, Pinker considers game theory, dominance behavior, alliance forming, our natural bias towards seeing our own bad behavior and that of others in very different light, and our unconscious tendency to go along with the crowd. If you aren’t already familiar with the implications of famous social psychology experiments, such as Stanley Milgram’s frightening demonstration of the human instinct for blind obedience, you will (and should) be. In the “angels’” corner are moral instincts, rationality, and empathy, which are explained in terms of the findings of other experiments. Fascinating stuff, if you're curious about how human behavior ""works"".All in all, an absorbing, meaty book that gave me plenty to think about, and made me feel profoundly grateful to be living in the civilized 21st century. However, Pinker leaves it ambiguous what his lessons might imply for the future, and I found myself still in possession of several big worries. What will happen as we face continued economic turmoil? Increasingly intelligent (and job-taking) machines? Global climate change? If nothing else, though, I feel assured that the people alive today are better equipped to peacefully respond to serious systemic threats than any generation that came before."
137,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77823834-simona-kulakauskaite,5,"This is the most insightful book I have ever read. The author destroys countless myths about the idolised past and does so with empirical evidence at every step. The author demonstrates how violence is partially driven by the qualities embedded by evolution, how it can be understood through the lense of the Prisoner’s dilemma and how various historical developments can modify the payoffs of the dilemma matrix to make peace a more attractive solution. Most importantly, the author abolishes the notion of pure evil and shows how every average human being is capable of inflicting harm motivated by predation, dominance, revenge, ideology or even sadism.The book starts with a number of chapters reviewing the history of violence - from never ending wars in Homeric Greece to cruel punishments in the Middle Ages to wars and genocides of the 20th century. The author discusses how, regardless of common perceptions, the world has gradually become more and more peaceful. The book then moves on to discuss the inner demons and the better angels - psychological qualities that push humans towards or away from violence. The author then summarises the consistent reduction of violence throughout centuries by suggesting the pacifying elements that include the emergence of the Leviathan, feminisation, trade, and increase of emphaty and reason.This book is huge - 841 pages - but it is worth every page and by the time I finished, I wished the author had expanded more on the implications of the reduction of violence and potential future developments."

140,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88489-viola,5,"Steven Pinker’s The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined is hands down the best non-fiction book that I’ve read in my life. It has completely changed the way I see the world.How much this book will change your perspective on life depends on (1) your prior beliefs and (2) whether or not Pinker’s arguments convince you. I think my prior beliefs about violence were probably about the same as your average, middle-class, American adult. I worried about violence in a general sense, although I’ve luckily not been a victim of violence myself. I worried about events like 9/11, the American wars in the Middle East, school shootings, the civil war in Syria, rapes in India, acid attacks, and practices like female genital mutilation. It seemed like every day, there was yet another news report of another atrocious event to be concerned about.And then, I read this book and my entire perspective changed. Pinker argues that despite the news reports and what the media may lead you to believe, we are in fact living in a time of unprecedented peace and that violence has significantly declined. And his argument is overwhelmingly compelling, for he uses nearly every tool and angle at his disposal. Using common knowledge facts, historical texts, literature, and statistics, he examines numerous measures of violence, including wars, murder rates, attitudes, and rape. Looking at violence in every which way possible, the conclusion is undeniable – violence has declined significantly and yes, we are indeed living in a time of unprecedented peace.The decline of violence is not necessarily an inevitable one; there are forces that contribute to its decline, and Pinker goes ahead to examine all the different possible reasons for the decline. His search for answers is most comprehensive. He explores the Hobbesian theory of the Leviathan, government structure, literacy, technology, economics, social norms, and even evolution. The strength of each contributor to the decline of violence varies significantly (for me, the Leviathan being the strongest and evolution being the weakest), and Pinker readily acknowledges the strengths and weakness of his arguments. But I appreciate Pinker’s willingness to discuss a potential contributing factor even if the evidence is not strong.I most admire the comprehensiveness of this book. In today’s academic world, it seems that scholars have become perhaps too specialized. English professors explain the world through only literature. Economists, only through economics. Psychologists, only though psychology. And even within a discipline, each scholar, it seems, just wants to find that ONE thing to explain a big idea. Their thesis gets boiled down to one factor. For example, take the idea that talent is overrated, you should spend 10,000 hours practicing to be an expert. It’s boiled down to just 10,000 hours. Or even take the idea of democracy as being the one solution to all society's ills. American policy has tried to force democracy into the Middle East, as if this ONE thing that could solve everything. And, how well has that worked out for us?This tendency to boil the solution to big problems down to one idea is a byproduct of not just increasing specialization, but also a byproduct of the scientific method, in which only one variable is studied at a time, and perhaps of scientists’ desire to find the one unifying theory of the universe. And so, we are bombarded with advice and policies that hinge on just one thing, when in fact, the real answers are much more complicated. And in this book, Steven Pinker proves that he is not afraid to get his hands messy with complicated answers.In addition to changing my perspective on the world, this book also had another profound effect on me – it made me stand in awe of the human race. Reading this book made me feel very small in the way you feel small when lying on your back in the grassy countryside looking up at the stars. The world is so vast, so amazing, and so much larger than me. I am merely one tiny spec in human history. Just a grain of sand on the vast beach, subject to the ebb and flow of the tide.Despite all my praises, the book does have a large gaping hole when it comes to Asia. For the most part, the history of violence in Asia is largely ignored. I don’t know much about Chinese history, but I do know that it too was fraught with great violence. The fact that Sun Tzu’s “The Art of War” is a famous Chinese text utilized over centuries must say something about the violence in China, and yet, that is completely neglected.All in all, I highly recommend this book. Indeed, it is a long read and not an easy one at that. But I think it’s worth your while."
141,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38774453-zhou-fang,4,"The Better Angels of Our Nature is a systematic, detailed study of the decline of violence in modern human history. I initially picked up this book because Bill Gates recommended it as the most optimistic book he's ever read, and also because I immensely enjoyed The Blank Slate, another one of Pinker's works. Many causes of the decline in violence are identified by Pinker, including:1. The rise of the modern state, or Hobbes' Leviathan. Interestingly, Pinker cites studies which seem to statistically demonstrate that the imposition of a state with a monopoly on violence does in fact reduce violence. Part of this results from the fact that people do not feel the need to ""self-help justice.""2. A long cultural change in the 11th through the 17th centuries in which European norms evolved to curb base desires and to anticipate the long term consequences of ones' actions. 3. The rise of commerce and trade in which the Prisoners' Dilemma faced by stateless individuals and warring societies gave way to positive-sum situations which incentivized stability of transactions through the decline of violence.4. The feminization of leadership. Wars are fought overwhelmingly by men, and it appears that the elevation of women in public life (in areas such as voting and public leadership) has had a positive impact in reducing the amount of aggregate violence inflicted by individuals and societies.5. The widespread improvement in abstract reasoning. The Flynn effect seems to have measured the steady rise in the ability of individuals to manipulate and think logically about concepts from multiple angles. The rise in abstract reasoning seems to also correlate with respect for democracy and rule of law, two other ideologies with strong norms against arbitrary violence.Ultimately, the book is a bit long and at times overly pedantic. Pinker seems to revel in showering the reader with all the knowledge he's accumulated and all the research he's done in writing this book. However, in doing so he does do a great job of giving the reader an exhaustive treatment of his thesis."
142,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502841-mark-galassi,5,"I have read this book slowly and carefully over a long period of time. I give it an unreservedly positive review.Warning: I am only an ""expert"" in a tiny area of what the book covers, and a layman in most of the rest.I will discuss two things that I liked most about the book: the way in which it is written (both large scale organization and specific wording), and the ambitious scope in pursuing this material.Vis-a-vis how the book is written:Pinker is a persuasive writer who marshals his arguments well, presents a variety of points of view on each topic, and is clear enough that I was never confused about who is making what point, nor was I confused about the overall logic and Pinker's conclusion. He also points out carefully where the ""established research"" ends and his opinion begins.He also makes the story lively with interesting (but never confusing) ways of turning phrases, and with cultural references both to icons of his own time (Bob Dylan, Woody Allen) and to great thinkers of the past. With his references he sometimes renders the mood of the times he is discussing, as when he inserts Mr. Jones into a discussion of what people were trying to understand in the 1960s. Other times he illustrates an idea from a research result by quoting a Woody Allen passage about sex, or a St. Augustine passage about temptation.The use of language is rather full, as is the assumption about a ""framework knowledge"" of political and intellectual history. When something more specialized is required he explains it, often very well. I was particularly impressed by how he explained poisson statistics and power law distributions when discussing the statistics of war. The explanation was accessible to someone who has never studied those concepts in a math or science class.The result is an enjoyable read and deeply instructive about many subjects, even beyond the main topic of the book.Vis-a-vis the ambitious scope in pursuing this material:What struck me the most about this book is that Pinker is not at all lazy. He never cuts corners in how he explores material. If a certain argument needs to be made with some knowledge of statistical distributions, he will introduce all of material and then make the argument. When he turns from a more historical arena to a psychological one he introduces the relevant psychology and brain-physiology knowledge. I never got the impression that I was supposed to take any aspect of the argument on faith.Another part of the ""no laziness"" is that he consistently offers up a variety of arguments on each topic. I never got the impression that he presented his favorite argument and then one devil's advocate argument pro-forma. I felt like I was always given the full picture of the debate surrounding any topic. Sometimes a debate is inconclusive, or the ""pretty"" explanations don't capture the full complexity, and in those cases he rolls up his sleeves and says ""with no single explanation we will need to examine how several separate factors contribute to this phenomenon"" - one example is the increase in violence in North America from the 1960s to the early 1990s.I also found interesting and important the way he brings in the intellectual aspects of history. Cesare Beccaria and Immanuel Kant and many other thinkers are shown to have had a big impact on the development of ideas. He taps into other philosophers, such as Thomas Hobbes, to show the origin of crucial insights in how aspects of societies evolve. He presents a convincing picture that the maturation of ideas is an important part of history, specifically how people and governments decide to wage war and to allow or disallow violence.Pinker also discusses the development of taboos in societies, returning to it when he discusses individual psychological factors.THe ""no laziness"" I observed was inspiring, reminding me of some of my scientific collaborators (not all of them, sadly) who truly complete projects rather than getting a ""minimum publishable unit"".I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in the topic (the history of violence, both warfare and crime). If you feel that you do not have some of the background to read it comfortably, you might look at some books I have discussed on goodreads - accessible history books:* The Way of the World: From the Dawn of Civilizations to the Eve of the Twenty-first Century* Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind* A History of Western Philosophy"
143,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41062449-houssem-hajlaoui,5,This classic from Steven Pinker is his most influential book! Why violence had declined and why doomsday narrative about our world is misguided?

145,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"I read many great non-fiction books, but this is one of only a handful I'd single out as being a truly important book. The kind of book that presents a new way of thinking or looking at the world that might actually make the world a better place. Bill Gates called it one of the most important books he's ever read, and I'd add it to that category as well. I give it five stars for this, resisting the urge to dock it a star for being so large and difficult to read. It took me a year of off-and-on reading to make my way through the 830+ pages, but it was worth the effort.Steven Pinker's message in writing Better Angels is to demonstrate that the world is, in fact, becoming more peaceful over time. The decline of violence holds over pretty much any measure of conflict between human beings: from war, to torture, to homicide, domestic abuse, rape, and even schoolyard bullying. This strikes many as counter-intuitive, or worse - dismissive of current suffering in the world. The latter concern is expressed by people who have not read the book, because Pinker makes it abundantly clear that there is still a long ways to go in reducing violence. Many find the message counter-intuitive because of two factors that Pinker addresses: availability bias and forgetfulness of the past. The availability bias points to our 24-hour news cycle and the worldwide trumpeting of any act of violence. There are more people than ever, and proportionately fewer instances of violence, but we get to hear about almost all of them. Each of us can immediately call to mind recent conflicts and violent outbreaks all across the world. At the same time, we forget just how violent the world was in the past: public lynchings, coliseum battles, inquisitorial torture, duels, honor killings, and other formerly banal expressions of violence. We remember only a handful of recent wars and forget the bulk of constant fighting that stretches into the immemorial past. And yes, to the common question, his analysis takes into account the brutally efficient World Wars. Even with those considered, and our current conflicts around the world, we are enjoying the longest stretch of peace that human kind has ever seen.Pinker exerts a monumental amount of effort in pulling together statistics from numerous sources - there are plentiful graphs to be parsed, and the reader will rapidly become adept at thinking of of violence in the terms of statisticians and demographers: incidents per 100,000 people. Using this metric, we see all the ways that modern historians have tried to extrapolate into the past the levels of conflict, and this research is painstakingly reproduced in the book. He goes so far to support his points that the reading can, at times, become rather tedious and repetitive. Pinker also provides abundant documentation and flavorful accounts of just how scary it could be to live in centuries past, sometimes veering into the macabre and disgusting. This is important, however, to drive home the point of how far things have progressed before laying out the processes and tools that have made that progress possible. Among these are the Pacification Process, the Civilizing Process, the role of the Leviathan (centralized government replacing chiefdom and serfdom), the Humanitarian Revolution, The Rights Revolutions, and various aspects of human nature. Conversely, he points to the various aspects of human nature that propel us to violence, and how we have come to check those urges in the construction of modern society. To summarize these factors would make for a very long review, so I'll simply encourage you to read the book.While many might point to various parts of the world that still engage in tribal warfare, honor killings, witch hunts, female genital mutilation, and a whole host of other abhorrent practices, it is worth noting that these pockets of violence are shrinking, and that there now exists many places that are free or nearly free of those fears. Those sanctuaries did not exist in the past. Also, if things were not improving, we'd have to ask what the point has been of promoting representative government, rights of speech, press and assembly, and all the other hallmarks of modern society. This is some confirmation that those efforts are paying off. Pinker's synthesis underlined a sentiment that I'd long held, and it was enlightening and encouraging to see the wealth of evidence he had amassed to drive the point home."
146,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10857246-ann,5,"If you watch/read/listen to the news, it's hard to believe that violence has significantly declined over time, but that's the premise of this book. And, he backs up this idea with looooooots of information. He addresses the cognitive biases that make us think the world is falling apart and refutes them with data. "
147,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3352854-david-skip-everling,5,"In his lauded but controversial best-seller The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature, Steven Pinker set out to quash a romanticized nostalgia for the lifestyle of people in pre-state societies: the myth of the ""noble savage"". Now, in his new book ""The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined"", Steven Pinker extends this rectification of prevailing but misguided opinion to grand scale, presenting a strong case for our ennobled present; we are living in the most peaceful era humanity has ever known.Pinker blows the reader away (forgive the violent metaphor) with sheer weight of analytical shot. At 700 pages of text interspersed with graphs and heaps of reference data, ""Better Angels"" is thorough-going and methodical because it has to be; contradicting common folk theories (like the noble savage), overriding an often overwhelming sense of unceasing or imminent violence from media coverage (see compassion fatigue), and compensating for a general lack of statistical thinking and probabilistic understanding in the lay public is no easy task. People are right to be skeptical of controversial theories, and knowing this Pinker has patiently lain it all out for us to see for ourselves that violence truly has declined with clear and unambiguously downward direction.""Better Angels"" is structured around an inventory of six Trends, five Inner Demons with four Better Angels, and five Historical Forces (Pinker can't help but enumerate). More than half of the book is dedicated to a chronological exploration of the Trends of our history, six paradigm shifts in the human condition: The Pacification Process, The Civilizing Process​, The Humanitarian Revolution, The Long Peace, The New Peace, and The Rights Revolutions. The bulk of the remaining half of the text is a fascinating look at psychology and sociology, showcasing a combined total of nine human traits (the Better Angels & Inner Demons) that dictate our behavior depending on their interplay with our environment and circumstance. The last five items in Pinker's syllabus, the five Historical Forces, feature in the concluding chapter and encapsulate much of the book's overall content by reflecting combinations of historical trend and human trait.The Five Major Historical Forces for Peace:The Leviathan (the state; reigns in internal violence)Gentle Commerce (economic incentives for cooperation)Feminization (empowerment of women; men are naturally more violent)The Expanding Circle (empathy; sympathizing with ever wider classes)The Escalator of Reason (rationality; application of empathy)A few minor quibbles with value judgments aside, ""The Better Angels of Our Nature"" assiduously justifies its subtitular contention: violence really has declined, and now it's not so hard to see why. Steven Pinker has assembled vast quantities of data to support his position, sourced in turn by the assemblies of other preeminent scholars in ethnography, anthropology, and the history of man. Add to this a trove of lab-tested social psychology, game theory, and the areas of Pinker's own expertise in cognitive psychology. The resulting dissertation, structured with the incredible skill and forethought that define Steven Pinker's books, sums these component analyses into the rational juggernaut needed to upend the conventional wisdom it is up against. Though consistently dispassionate in tone and bearing throughout, the title of this book betrays its emotional impact: optimism for humanity.( Note: a longer version of this review that expands on the 5 historical forces can be read here: http://www.thoughtskipper.com/2011/10... )"
148,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1827671-damian,5,"A brilliant book by the great Steve Pinker that makes the startling -- and encouraging -- claim that not only is the world today more peaceful than in previous generations, it is VASTLY more peaceful. Orders of magnitude more peaceful.The real meat of the book is in the first half, in which he brings an impressive amount of data to bear in elucidating four historical trends that each brought violence down by an order of magnitude: the Pacification Process (the coalescence of small tribes into larger societies) the Civilizing Process (the creation of the nation-state -- Hobbes' Leviathan -- and it's imposition of law and order), the Humanitarian Revolution (in which the rights of the individual begin to supersede those of the state, and the power of the state becomes limited) and the Rights Revolution (the most recent, in which those traditionally denied full social status are finally accorded full rights). Along the way he discusses many forms of violence, including state suppression, warfare, genocide, and small-scale crime, and shows that all are dropping. He also discusses the two blemishes on the 20th century, the two World Wars, and argues that they are statistical outliers on a line that is trending downward. He makes the startling point that though the World Wars were unbelievably bloody, they are neither historically unprecedented nor, amazingly, historically particularly extreme when the number of casualties is normalized by the total world population -- the European Wars of Religion following the Reformation in the 16th century were far worse!Unfortunately the book hits a brick wall about halfway through. This is when Pinker, having moved off of the historical data, delves into the neuroscience, psychology and morality of violence (e.g. what goes on in the mind of the criminal when he inflicts violence). Worse than merely being slow (and it is) this entire stretch of the book merely feels irrelevant. Practically no attempt is made to tie these areas to the historical data (how COULD you connect the abundance of testosterone, or the deficit of a neurotransmitter to the decline in murder rates in the US since the 90s?) and the relation between the two is just sort of ... implied. It feels more or less like we are suddenly plunged into different book altogether, and a book which presents its data somewhat incoherently and certainly less convincingly. If I could, I would give that book 3 stars.But the rest is so good, so eye-opening, that I still have to give it a 5. Maybe the best indicator of the book's quality is that it simply changed my mind about something: in the section on the ""Rights Revolution"", Pinker talks about the Animal Rights movement, the anti-bullying movement and a few other modern anti-violence initiatives. I want not to come off as horribly insensitive, but when it comes to certain social crusades (and Animal Rights is an example) I have found myself thinking thoughts like ""yes, okay, it's not great that animals are abused in such-and-such a way, but really, don't we have bigger fish to fry?"" And even with bullying, a certain part of me has thought boys-will-be-boyish thoughts. After all, to previous generations, our collective experience of violence would seem laughable. Wouldn't it?It would, but that IS the point. The only reason that we have gotten where we have is because of a rising intolerance of violence, because activists at the forefront have found previously laughable offenses suddenly merely offensive. So even if abused animals may not seem like the biggest problem in the world, making even that violence unacceptable plays a role in creating a future world where ALL violence is."
149,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18571740-juli-anna,4,"This is a long and complicated work to try to summarize succinctly, but here are my thoughts. First of all, thank goodness Pinker did all the research for me--and a lot of research there was. He makes a very convincing argument for why violence has declined over time, and the reasons he eventually surmises for this decline are surprising and refreshingly obvious. That said, my opinion is that, if one were to partake in more than a tourist's journey through the history of violence, one could absolutely not stop here. This book is a mere overview, and Pinker comes at the subject from a very particular perspective. He is very much the scientist-social-scientist analyst, very good at creating and interpreting graphs and numbers, and that can come at the expense of a more humanitarian lens on the subject. I appreciated his lightness of tone most of the time (especially in a book that could have been quite heavy), but at others I felt it bordered on flippant. And here are a few issues I take with his scholarship and point of view:-There is a certain lack of perspective about the context of violence or the lack of violence. For example, in talking about the decline in violent crime rates in the 1990's, after it had boomed in the '60's-80's, he credits policing and other ""civilizing"" methods as having made a difference. While I do not question his logic there, I would question his logic that incarceration and police violence somehow don't factor into the rates. While a high incarceration rate may ""reduce"" violent crime in a given society, incarceration itself implies and involves a certain kind of violence, and is certainly visited disproportionately on particular populations, such as young black men.-Ladies, brace yourself for Pinker's short-and-sweet chapter on rape. Watch him try to essentialize men (and women, to a lesser extent) by appealing to their ""evolutionary"" nature. Watch him try to explain that, obviously, rape is about sex and not power. It is not pretty. I cringed bodily many times. That is not to say that women are treated unkindly in most of the book. Overall, he is fairly pro-woman, just ignorant about feminist scholarship and especially rape.-As many other Goodreaders have commented, this is an overwhelmingly Western history. To be fair, he tries honestly to include figures for Africa, Pre-Columbian America, Oceania, and parts of Asia, and he even specifically addresses the dearth of information about the history of violence in most of the world. But one is left with the distinct feeling that there are more numbers and stories out there than Pinker cared to drum up. -Pinker plays off both sides of the political spectrum, and every part of that spectrum will find something to get mad at him about in this book. Anarchists and other radical leftists will undoubtedly disagree with his theories about the roles of democracy and ""gentle commerce"" in the decline of violence. Conservatives will balk at his vilification of ""manly virtues"" and cultures of honor, as well as his explicit endorsement of the ""feminization"" of culture to reduce violence. Readers must come at this book with an open mind and an ability to see multiple perspectives.Overall, a worthwhile read, but I would edit it back about 300 pages to get at the meat of the argument. Pinker is very thorough, examining every possibility within every dataset to come to his conclusions, at the cost of conciseness. But, that said, this book is never boring, and Pinker's tone keeps it light."
150,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14247078-maitrey,4,"The Better Angels of Our Nature is Steven Pinker's attempt to articulate if violence among humans has indeed declined. I thought it would make a great read in this centenary of the Great War and provide a counter-point to all the doomsayers who relish in pointing out humankind's penchant for violence. Pinker's specialty is linguistics and psychology so it was odd to see him tackling something so steeped in history and politics.I think Pinker did a commendable job. Although there is a whiff of selective bias throughout the book when he presents data and statistics, overall the book is very readable and makes some very good points.Each of the chapters could make books in themselves. The earlier ones dealing with violence in pre-state societies sounds like the data is a little bit inflated to forcefully make Pinker's point. Undeniably, we know too little about these societies. But it is undeniable that homicide rate (which correlates with other crime rates according to Pinker) has gone down in the last five hundred years in the West where the data are pretty solid. Another chapter deals with the decline in behaviours such as slavery, torture, adulteress-stoning and even bloody pastimes not involving humans such as bear-bating and cat burning. Pinker credits both the growth of powerful states and national governments and the growth of Enlightenment Humanism for this astonishing turnaround.The next few chapters are slightly controversial and deal with violence decline among states. Pinker states that the 20th Century has not been the bloodiest time in record (despite overall body count being the highest, as a percentage it was not the highest). Pinker then throws some stats around that show that after the bloodletting of the two world wars, wars between great powers has declined (actually nil) and hence there is an overall decrease in body-count. Another history chapter deals with the ""New Peace"", a phenomenon where other conflicts such as civil wars and deaths due to terrorism has also decreased. Some nightmare scenarios such as bio-warfare and nuclear terrorism are briefly discussed so Pinker is not dismissed as prattling fool. The last history chapter deals with the Rights Revolution and how feminism and rights for racial and sexual minorities, and even animals have played their own roles in the decline of violence.The final two chapters deal with the psychology of violence. The first, as Pinker calls it about our inner demons (dominance, sadism etc.) and another with our better angels (empathy, reason etc.) I found some of the neuro-science to be hard going and too jargon-laden but the impacts and inferences to be clear and well written.Overall the book was eye-opening and interesting to read. However I can't shake of the feeling that it could have perhaps been vastly condensed by removing many repetitions and restatements. Also, another book, even by a non-specialist but such a well respected and good writer cannot be a bad thing. The Better Angels of Our Nature is highly recommended to everybody."
151,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7116910-bernard-o-leary,4,"This is a good book, despite a few flaws, but it is nowhere near as fascinating as the response to it.Pinker's claim is pretty straightforward: that the amount of violence in the world has been decreasing over time, both generally and also within specific categories (war, homicide, etc). It is presented empirically with lots of data and graphs showing the decline over time. Of course, plenty of the data is questionable. Records are patchy at best going back to Roman times and before that it is mostly conjecture. Plus, there's always going to be debate about whether pre-civilisation peoples were Hobbesian brutes or Rousseauian innocents; we can extrapolate from data but we'll never really know without a time machine. Also, Pinker does quite a bit of cherry picking. He has no choice, given that his dataset is all people who have ever lived in the entire world.All that said, it is an empirical claim. It is wrong or it is right. Proving it wrong is simply a matter of proving that there used to be less violence, or that the amount of violence has remained constant. Instead, people have this deep, visceral reaction to the very notion. How can someone possibly claim that after [the Holocaust/Allepo/Isis/whatever has recently upset you] that the world is becoming more peaceful? Is he mad? Engaging with his analysis would be an affront to decency! You can read through the one-star reviews here on Goodreads for a selection of lengthy outraged essays on this topic. I don't think people are even particularly engaged by the content of the book, although it contains plenty to offend. Lefties will be outraged at the colonial overtones of his philosophy, while right-wingers will lose their minds at the idea that the feminization of society is a positive thing; both will freak out at the unfashionable idea of the Leviathan-type state being a force for good in the world. I think the real problem these days is that everyone is invested in a narrative of struggle, suffering and entropy, and anything that contradicts that narrative causes profound cognitive dissonance. The world can't possibly be getting better because you just need to look out your window to see it's getting worse. Most arguments against Pinker, even those with citations, seem to be starting from that principle and working backwards.One thing Pinker doesn't have a chart for is general levels of optimism over time. I'm pretty sure, however, that if you had stats on that, you would find that almost everybody at almost every point in time has had the feeling that the world is heading to hell in a handbasket and the human race is doomed. Despite this, things generally seem to sort themselves out over time. What a curious planet."
152,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1394552-keith-akers,4,"O. K., I'm convinced: violence has declined. The descriptions of medieval torture, the decline of torture generally, and the murder rates in the medieval world versus murder rates just a few hundred years later, convinced me. What was less convincing was why violence has declined. In fact, it's not clear that Pinker really has an explanation himself, even though that's the subtitle of the book. To me, it's clearly related to the general rise in standard of living. In the closing chapter of the book, he dismisses this idea after considering it briefly. My answer would be that a rise in the standard of living is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for the decline in violence. Once you have a higher standard of living, that allows for literacy, democracy, communication, education, and all that other good stuff to kick in. There's also a slight problem here which I don't think Pinker is fully aware of. This explanation really only concerns violence between humans. Violence between humans and the nonhuman world has clearly increased since the development of agriculture. I conceive of violence broadly as any kind of destructive or manipulative force, not just the causing of suffering. In fact, it has clearly increased just between humans and animals. Domesticated mammals were likely less than 1% of all mammals at the beginning of agriculture (just dogs, basically). They are greater than 90% today. The same thing applies to wild animals, since they are also affected by human activity which crowds them out. In fact, based on Craig Dilworth's book Too Smart for Our Own Good: The Ecological Predicament of Humankind, we can say more generally that violence between humans has declined just as violence between humans and animals has increased. The other possible problem is how he deals with Stalin. I think his estimate of the deaths due to Stalin is quite high; and his attribution of these to ""ideology"" and to the ideology of communism specifically, rather than to Stalin specifically, is in my opinion false. But that's another argument for another day."
153,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6809550-ahmad-abugosh,4,"For anyone that follows the news, it's hard not to feel like the world is going to hell. This book is a wake up call from that negative perspective. It's not an optimistic book, but rather one of analytical research & data that shows the global trend for violence is downwards. The most interesting part of the book for me is how it doesn't spend much time on the fact that violence went down, but rather how and why it went down, and why we are still noticing pockets of violence in many parts of the world.The biggest takeaway for me was something known as the ""Circle of Empathy"", which makes a lot of sense. The Circle of Empathy, basically means that people have a circle of people that they care about, who they identify as being similar to them, and generally they care more about those people than people outside of that circle. I noticed personally that this concept is very true, as I have come across many people that discriminate, who always find something different about the person they are discriminating, and nearly all of the time they have no close family or friends that fall in that circle. The decline in violence therefore is a direct result of that circle expanding, but how long does it expand for? For example, should it stop at all human beings or continue to animals as well?Another nice thought that has stuck with me is the analysis given on the prevalence of violence in the Arab / Muslim world compared to Western Europe and East Asia. I really liked how the book talked about how censoring ideas and people from each other perpetuates violence, and how one of the biggest factors that contributed to the decline of the Islamic golden age was the banning of the printing press for a few hundred years. I also thought the correlation between women's rights and violence was interesting, which showed that the more feminine a culture is, or the more it empowers women, the less violent it is overall (given other factors constant). Finally, I liked that although the book has cold hard facts in it and presents its case very scientifically, it gives you reason to be hopeful in the future of mankind."
154,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49788249-mars-cheung,5,"I placed this book on my shelf more than a year or so ago. At the time, I had just read through Michael Shermer's Moral Arc. It spoke on much of the same topics addressed in Better Angels (recognition and expansion of human rights, decline of violence, causes of evil, economics and wealth, etc) but was a much more concise read. I took it up at the time because I wanted something that would give me a general view of the overall topic: that of an expanding moral universe. Plus, I didn't want to yet invest the time in reading a book nearly 700 pages in length (sans citations and references).If I had known about the quality of Steven Pinker's writing at that time, I don't think I would have gone down the same path. The book contains a generous amount of data and research to support claims that humans, over time, have become more ethical beings whom have learned to curb, though not entirely eradicate, the worst of our tendencies with the process accelerated by the 17th century Enlightenment values of Reason and Humanism. Subjects such as the decline of warfare, the pacification effect, the Rights revolutions (women's rights, gay rights, animal rights and more), life expectancy and others are discussed as well as their proximate causes (the rise in intelligence/abstract-thinking, recognition of our human nature and the applications of our institutions to direct or curb its effects) . The book makes a compelling case for the idea of human ethical and moral progress over time. A major plus of the book was how it mostly avoided unnecessary didacticism and was able to get it's points across in an easy-to-understand fashion. The book was long but it was a read that exposed me to ideas that triggered a fascination to understand them. I couldn't put it down once I got started.I just met Steven Pinker last evening at an event promoting his latest book, Enlightenment Now, which is an expansion built off the ideas discussed in Better Angels. It's a read I'm very much looking forward to and one that, I would argue, is an important read to give us context as a people as to where we've been, what we have accomplished and what we still have to do."
155,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1013127-jennifer,5,"It was not difficult for Steven Pinker to convince me, a classicist who teaches about the violent societies of Ancient Greece and Rome, that we quite possibly live in the most peaceful time our planet has ever seen. I already know better than to glorify the past as the good old days. What I didn't expect from this book, however, was such a convincing, thoroughly researched case that would teach me so many new things about such a variety of topics.The amount of research and the thoroughness with which Pinker covers the subject of violence is staggering. I often stopped reading so that I could consider just how much information I was holding in my hands. This book examines violence from the cataclysmic clashes between civilizations all the way down to kids playing dodgeball at recess. No form of violence visited upon one person by another is overlooked, and Pinker systematically leads you through the evidence of its decline.Beyond that, Pinker also digs into the how and why of violence's decline. He presents fascinating experiments done by social psychologists that illuminate our human nature, and he explains both our immense capacity and tendency toward violence as well as the faculties we humans possess to overcome it. I especially learned a lot about how human morality operates and was surprised to discover how my own demons and better angels duke it out in my everyday life.At nearly 700 pages of text, readers should expect to spend some quality time with this book, and because of the book's wide range of topics, different readers will find different sections more or less fascinating (and sometimes, more or less of a slog). But Pinker's style is straightforward and readable. If you keep a pen in hand and take some time to consider what you're reading, there is so much important information here on the human condition. Having finished the book, I am filled with a sense of gratitude, not only for the peaceful time and place in which I exist, but for scholars like Pinker who help me see the world and myself more clearly."
156,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/222151-ed,5,"This massive book is so full of the most extraordinary data and insights that I think it is probably one of the best books I have ever read. It certainly met the criteria of changing my mind on a whole array of issues, not least the massive decline in killing per 100,000 of the population from hunter gatherers right through up to today. Hunter gatherers can kill up to 1500 of their number per 100,000 per year. Even 20th century Germany and Russia managed around 100 per 100,000 per year. And today most of Western Europe and the Northern states of the US manage 1 per 100,000 per year. And the US as a whole has fallen from 10 per 100,000 in the early 90s to 5 today. And along with this long term decline in killing has been a parallel fall in other forms of violence.The book is a detailed, data and evidence backed working through of the detail of this trend and its causes. In Pinker's view the fundamental causes of the decline are five: 1) Hobbes Leviathan: the power of the state to enforce the rule of law by the threat of force 2) Gentle commerce: trade builds non-violent connections that make violent seizure pointless 3)Feminization: greater power and influence for women especially over reproductive decisions changes the nature of society towards avoiding violent conflict 4)The Expanding Circle: our ability to include an ever larger proportion of humanity beyond our immediate circle, tribe, religion or nation in moral consideration 5)The escalator of reason: as our powers of reasoning grow we seem able to go beyond violence based Prisoner's Dilemma and see the rationality of cooperation.It will take me a lot of further study to absorb all of this. But based on my own field of study: conflict, his arguments and data sets are profoundly convincing. So I most strongly recommend reading this book."
157,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58657487-tony-salter,5,"I read this book a while ago and am fascinated to see the level of controversy which it seems to cause.I found it fascinating in both premise and execution. Any book of this scale, however well written, will be tough going. Graph after graph, often using exponential scales sweeping down from left to right can be repetitive but they do serve to ram home some key points.Looking at the detractors. Of course he is cherry picking the data to prove his core premise. Everyone does that. But he's managed to find an awful lot of data.He tries (but many people don't want to listen) to point out that he isn't saying that the world is perfect and that violence is a problem of the past. There is still misery and violence everywhere, but that shouldn't be used dogmatically to knock down anyone who tries to suggest that things may not be as bad as they once were.""Pinker is talking rubbish. Look at what happened just last week in ...."" is not a reasoned argument.However, what he does say (I believe) is that:- in many, many areas of global society death rates by violence have been reducing.- as this happens, our standards and expectations for what is acceptable shift- the overwhelming presence of the global media (social, print and broadcast) distorts our perceptions and magnifies bad news.All we need to take away from this book (in my opinion again) is that we can make the world better, man is not inherently evil, and, if we can ignore the incessant chatter of the media for a moment or two, we might be able to identify some of the things that we have been doing right and learn from them.This is my first review on Goodreads (apart from my own novel) and I am surprised that I chose a non-fiction book. I would guess that I read 99.5% fiction."
158,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5889085-h-wesselius,4,"In previous books Pinker revealed himself to be a proponent and supporter of traditional Enlightenment ideas. This continues in his latest work in which he attempts to demonstrate that violence has declined and he places the responsibility on mass literacy, individual autonomy and primacy of reason. In short, secular humanism. He begins by outlining evidence that demonstrates a decline in violence. Although for anyone who has studied history this outline of past violence is hardly necessary, he makes the case better than anyone could expect. Once he established a decline in violence, he looks for the cause. The first step was a state monopoly on violence and hence the decline of tribalism and ""honor"" societies. Again this isn't a terribly radical idea but its only the start. From there he proposes a civilizing process -- table manners, decline in dueling, jousting etc - which culminates in the Enlightenment. Reason, autonomy and a literate society naturally progress to greater humanitarianism and human rights, that is a widening circle of empathy. Finally, he credits democracy and international trade -- the traditional classical liberalism combination. With feminism, gay rights and animals rights he believes this decline will continue. As a pessimist, I can't share his optimism. Statistically we have reached declining returns -- ie how much lower can we go? Secondly and probably more importantly active literacy has declined and society has moved from democracy to a governance based on fear. These developments don't bode well for the development of empathy and a respect of individual autonomy. "
159,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51269042-sebastian-waisbrot,5,"I chose this book as I wanted an uplifting one. However talking about declining violence drives the author to start with examples of brutal acts performed by men in the past, to the point that it might get hard to keep going. Later the book goes into statistics, psychology, intelligence and wraps everything up in the way I wanted originally.I am now more hopeful about the future and just sadden that I won't be around for the next few centuries to live in a less violent world."
160,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Pinker says this book came out of his answer to the question, ""what are you hopeful about?"" It details the history of violence in human society from prehistory to the present day. Pinker argues that violence has generally declined, and offers an explanation of how this happened.He describes a political/sociological theory called ""Leviathan"" in which the government has a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence. Under a Leviathan people are better off letting the state handle punishment than taking matters into their own hands. I think of this as rule of law verses a culture of revenge.Another sociological/cultural trend Pinker credits with a reduction in violence is the expanding moral sphere which has grown in historical times to encompass all races, both sexes, and even non-human animals.He describes a psychological phenomena called the ""moralization gap"" whereby we forgive ourselves more easily than we forgive others. The human mind, argues Pinker, has evolved to spot unfairness and misbehavior committed by others against the self, while maintaining a blind spot for the same behavior oneself commits against others.This book is a must-read for scientific skeptics and humanists."
161,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10697126-howard-goodman,5,"A tour de force from brain scientist Steven Pinker, who amasses a tonnage of evidence to prove an unlikely thesis -- that violence, rather than increasing with the mass murders and world wars of the 20th century, has actually been on the decline -- not just since the Middle Ages, but since the more ancient times of the Bible and probably before that. More startling, our present era from 2000 on -- the Iraq war, 911 and the Sudan and Syria notwithstanding -- are the most peaceful in world history. Certainly Europe, for so long such a blood-soaked continent, has never been so free of organized violence. Given how often we see people murdered in TV dramas and how often bloody crimes are highlighted in the news, these findings come as a shock. Pinker knows this, and part of the fun of reading this huge work is the way he punctures our assumptions.For those of us who were born just after the Holocaust and grew up under the threat of mushroom clouds during the Cold War, this book is a provocation -- you mean to tell me that the human race is improving? Pinker shows that, yeah, it is. "

This warrants an excuse. To me, five stars means ""if everyone in the world read this book, the world would be a better place."" It's been a good summer for reading. Reading this book will leave you with:-certainty that violence has declined. -an appreciation for democracy-a rational love of literacy beyond what teachers usually instill. -a desire to cultivate self control-countless interesting and mind-boggling social experiments.-a review of psychology, literature, manners, history and sociology synthesized for the purpose of understanding violence, which is tangibly important. -a more enlightened view of race as well as a sanity check on some radical positions from the past. -an explanation for why liberals are more intelligent (!).The book offers far more than the cover gives away. If you've ever heard Pinker speak, you know he isn't famous for his lectures. This book was written by a master. "
163,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4532721-alexander-weber,5,"Incredible. There are books that come along and completely change the way you see the world. This is one of those books. It is a big subject, and epic in scope. It's hard to even believe how well Pinker tackles this subject. There are a lot of conclusions that he draws that make me feel uncomfortable (pointing out how state authority and gentle commerce can reduce violence, two things that feel uncomfortable to me with my romanticized view of anarcho-syndicalism), but that's what good books do: they present evidence that makes you see the world differently.I also recommend reading published criticisms of this book. The ones I have read have turned out to be largely unfounded. It is interesting how this thesis can create this knee-jerk reaction in people: ""How dare you suggest we are living in a great time for violence?""He does not tackle whether our current time is the best time by other measures (ecology, for example), so don't let that get you down. He chose one topic, a massive and fascinating one, and did an incredible job tackling it. Bravo."
164,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"Not in agreement with everything Pinker said in this book and in full aknowledgement of the fact that the data reported is mostly on Western countries (due to a lack of it from other countries and probably also to prove a point), I still consider this work to be a huge effort on the part of the author, and a succesful one at that. If you were to give a reasonably educated neophyte in the field of human violence one book that could relatively comprehensively explore the field, this would be it. The whole reason of the book is that human violence has been declining steadily - and lately, pretty abruptly - and the author provides a huge ammount of data from an incredible array of fields in order to convince the reader. Just thinking about how long it must've taken Pinker to compile all of this gives me flashbacks to University work that I'd rather forget. To anyone interested in homo sapiens and our tendency to go bat shit crazy, this is a book for you. You might even be a little hopeful for our future by the end of it."

I know that my family, who has been listening to me ramble ad nauseam about this book, feels like I have been at it for forever. Everything I have encountered in the last few months - movies, news stories, tv, music, etc - seems to relate back in some way to this book.I could write a book about this book. I learned so much about so many different topics. I've been keeping a journal on books I read - defining words/terms I don't know, writing interesting quotes, jotting done questions raised etc. - and I kept a ridiculous amount of notes for this book. Pinker has a very in-depth section of notes, references & an index but I still also googled certain things that came up that I wanted to know more about. Lots of going down the rabbit hole where looking up one event or person led to another and another and another.I don't even know how to go about reviewing this book. It covers so much ground and so thoroughly. Really, you have to just read it yourself. Yes, it's definitely a commitment. It's a long, dense book but it's worth the effort to read.I will randomly revisit a few topics in the book that struck me as being particularly noteworthy. There are 5 types of violence in the world: predatory - a means to an end, like killing someone for the money in their wallet, revenge - retribution for a perceived wrong/punishing someone, sadism - taking pleasure in another's suffering, dominance - the urge for power & glory and finally ideology -a belief system that justifies violence in the pursuit of the good.Certain homicide patterns remain consistent throughout the last 2,000 years. Men kill 92% of the time(except infanticide where women take the lead). Men usually kill in their 20s. Until the 1960's, cities were safer than the countryside.The emotion of disgust evolved as an unconscious defense against biological contamination.Witchcraft was the most common motive for revenge in Europe in the Middle Ages. Something bad happened and you can't figure out why? Sorcery! Usually by that neighbor you don't like!The two most violent centuries in the Europe in the past 500 years were the 20th century(no duh, the two WW's) and the 17th century. Those religious wars were no joke. Basically Europe was at war from 152o-1648. Ah, the good ol' days!In England in 1822, there were over 200 offenses that you could be executed for. By 1861, there were 4. Also, until 1800, you could legally execute a 7 year old. Then the death penalty was raised to 14. During the Tang Dynasty in China, there was an 8 year rebellion called the An Lushan Revolt. 2/3 of the population died. TWO THIRDS. That was 1/6 of the world population back then.The Golden Arches theory: no 2 countries with a McDonalds have ever fought against each other in a war.

Pinker analyses the violence (in historical context) in all possible dimensions (social, political, genetic, scientific, cultural, organizational, ...) - keeping in mind how enormous (in terms of content) the book is, it's still hard to believe that it succeeds in avoiding being repetitive AND it's actually very interesting to read. I have to admit that during last 10-15% I was already tired (with the topic), but that's because I was a bit overwhelmed & needed something else (other topic) to switch to.The best thing about this book that violence in fact is just a starting point - that leads you to many interesting thoughts & conclusions regarding the development of humans & societies overall (over the ages).Recommended. It's not a book for everyone, but if you're interested in behavioural psychology, how human interactions work, how people do think & (re-)act, this is a must read."

I especially liked the section on the violence in the Old Testament! :) But when I got to the second chapter, in which Pinker talks about anthropological history, it was moving too fast. I have just read Douglas Fry's The Human Potential for Peace, which is a very careful, detailed, scholarly book. Because of Fry's book, I realize that the anthropological evidence regarding the violence of our hunter-gatherer ancestors is not clear and obvious. But Pinker breezes through it superficially, at break neck speed, with no regard for the controversies and subtleties in the field. Which makes for ""easy"" reading, but I just don't have sufficient trust in the book to invest the time in its approximately 700 pages."

This very well researched book lays out that facts that the general bend of history IS towards less violence and a more peaceful existence. We live longer, healthier lives and are much less prone to be felled by an act of violence. Of course this gives little solace to the victims of violence, but helps one put in perspective the constant carnival barking of the news media selling doom. That said, I have to admit I didn't finish the book. Somewhere passed the midway point the work got a little too bogged down with statistics and one antidote after another so I put it down, and tried to pick it up again a few times, never quite getting to the end. But I do believe I have a fair grasp of his argument, and I do believe it provides a very important point of view for our times. "

For time immemorial humans have attached myths like honour and concepts like greatness to violent victories. One needs grit to go through the incredibly gruesome details of cruelty that humans have been inflicting on each other to this date. You want it or not, once you go through it you would feel empathy for not just other humans but for any living being capable of suffering. You may choose to ignore the positive picture that Pinker paints. However, in this age of rising nationalism, religiosity, orthodoxy and chauvinism, we must definitely find some time to read at least a few excerpts from this book."

I'll never view in the same way such subjects as the role of liberal humanism in the human rights revolution, the evolutionary functions of violence, dominance behaviors as an evolutionary adaptation yet as maladaptive in contemporary society, Nazism as anti-intellectual backlash, tribalism, racism, globalism and trade as pacifying factors, the counterculture movements of the sixties and seventies, Hobbesian government as solution to anarchic feuding, game theory, etc etc. While I'm not certain I can agree with Pinker on every single point, I found it difficult to cogently dispute any of his assertions, so well did he argue them, and so interwoven-ly did he weave them."

It feels hard to believe, amid the common mass shootings in the United States, the turmoil in the Middle East and Africa, and so on, but violence in every category--murder, war, genocide, rape, abuse--is declining. And that's something to savor, as Pinker says in his conclusion. There were times when his cold, scientific eye seemed to overrule his tendency toward humanity, but overall, this was well composed and brilliantly argued.

Maybe I'll regret this in a few weeks, but I'll stick to it right now - it surelly deserves this ""the best of the best"", even if ephemerally.The breadth and depth that the author achieved in analyzing the unifying topic of his work (the historical decline of violence) is abslotuley astounding. He leaves no trace of unchecked or unsourced data, and gives even a classical pessimist like myself a very bright picture of the future. This book has it all: history, politics, science, ethics, wonderfully woven reflections and of course, a glimpse into the great mind of Steven Pinker. All in all, this book was a joy to read, start to finish."
174,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268636-mothwing,4,"Very illuminating and detail-rich book about why violence has declined. Pinker describes the trend in very broad strokes and at a very large scale, leaving out details, but by and large, this did not bug me overly. As main historical forces he names the Leviathan (nation state), commerce, feminization, cosmopolitanism and the age of reason. It is very clearly aimed at a US American audience, however, and many of the examples are therefore Western ones. This I did not mined too much. Framing almost all politics he mentioned through the US binary was very tiresome, however. While I subscribe to most of the markers he mentions, I am not a ""liberal"". Overall, this was still a great companion read to Factfulness and I'd heartily recommend it."
175,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"This was a very good book, but long and sometimes the statistics got tedious. I can understand why he seemed determined to provide inexhaustible evidence for something he knew his audience might have trouble believing, but it's very difficult to read through descriptions of dry study after study on the same or very similar topic. However, in the sections where he is simply discussing what all those statistics mean, and later in his discussions of why the changes have occurred, he excels. His writing is clear and compelling, sometimes humorous. I enjoyed it, and would recommend to anyone willing to take a little time to learn something about humanity."
176,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42669310-jonathan-gnagy,5,"This book, while long, is thoroughly interesting and informative. The book left me feeling like I took an entire course on the history of human nature and violence, taught by one of the most captivating and knowledgeable professors I've ever had. The book was well-worth the investment in time and has made a profound impact on my outlook on the time in which I live. The frequent comments I hear about the ""scary times we live in"" are now easily dismissed as the nonsense they are.I highly recommend this book and I can't speak highly enough of Steven Pinker and the finesse he used in making such a wholly persuasive argument for reason and human intelligence."
177,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43878721-vinay,5,"Only appropriate response after finishing the book: ""ZOMG"". One of the most memorable books I've ever read - I went back and re-read multiple chapters to make sure I would not forget anything. Alas, if only textbooks in college were as riveting.Pinker uses violence as a lens to write two different books - a data-backed history of (violence in) the world and an overview of moral and political philosophy. I admittedly got bored in the data-backed section (although I realize its importance), but loved the other two parts.I now feel the same way I felt when I first learned about Evolution (""Oh, the Universe makes so much more sense now""). Everyone should read this book."
178,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45360-nick,4,"Steven Pinker has written a very ambitious book exploring the decline of violence over human history and the possible reasons for that decline. Some of his data sets seem to me too small for the weight he puts upon them, like the incidence of spanking to discipline children, but the evidence that violence is declining is very strong, and Pinker''s book is bringing that evidence to a broad public. I was more interested and more excited by his discussion of possible mechanisms for the decline in violence. This book is a long read, but well worth the time spent on it."
179,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8739994-darrel,5,"Steven Pinker is one of the most creative and meticulous minds of our generation. This book is a tour-de-force. I would put it as one of the 5 best books of the last decade. While it is a very long read, every word of it is worth the time. You will leave this book with a changed view of our world and how it has evolved. It will show how much we have changed in a very short time from a very violent species to a fairly peaceful one. I know, it is hard to believe, if you watch the evening news, but the news is not reality, it is marketing. "
180,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20262189-tristan,5,"This book is an excellent antidote for people who can think only in negative terms of centralized government, capitalism, Enlightenment thinking, and all things modernity, while craving a return to simpler times or the imposition of a utopian ideology. Pinker's well-referenced and sober-minded assessment could inject some balance into people's overly negative views of our own society which, as he shows, is doing many things right. "
181,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43592939-leopold-benedict,5,"Incredibly interesting and well researched study on the decline of violence. While Pinker's book offers many points of attacks for data analysts, I think it is a very courageous book and I am convinced by his main argument: that the world has become less violent. Overall, very insightful and one of the best non-fiction books I have read. "

187,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35771996-rohit-sudheendranath,5,"Best book I've read this year. Pinker uses a combination of statistics, evolutionary psychology and cultural change to explain why violence has declined. Masterpiece !"
188,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6143501-kim,4,"Steven Pinker intends this book as a positive remedy to a time and country in which most citizens grossly overestimate the amount and impact of violence and crime. And for the most part it does what he intends.Pinker is a scientist (psychology) and he's much happier working in the realm of statistics than in history or political science. He's also Canadian, which may distort his view of the U.S. to some extent.To extol the comparative humanity of our current world Pinker digs up a wealth of examples of just how horrible our ancestors were. He aso paints a picture of the gradual progress toward the current age. So for a considerable part of the early chapters we learn a great deal about ancient torture techniques, the high incidence of infanticide, the prevalence of lost noses from tavern knife fights, child abuse, and tales of village sport such as getting together to beat a pig to death before having it for a town meal. We also learn about medieval battles in which the main goal was to expand one's personal fiefdom by invading a neighbor and killing as many peasants as possible. And don't forget execution techniques, which included hanging children for theft. Or slavery.Our ancestors were pretty horrible, and Pinker makes that point in case after case in nearly every part of the world. People killing other people was very common and far more common than what we see today. This includes the waging of war. Despite the massive death tolls from war in the 20th century, Pinker points out that as a percentage of population wars have been far less deadly than in past centuries. He also lists body counts for dozens of conflicts, most of which most people have never heard of, for which historians can estimate fairly reliable body counts. He even digs into the Bible to point out the various genocides and events like David, before becoming king, happily collecting foreskins of Israel's adversaries.He tries to puzzle through what changed, and at times one gets the feeling that he's not sure it has been a completely positive change. How did we get from a time of casual slaughter to a time in which it's considered rude to make fun of another person's race, gender, or national background? The terms PC and political correctness are used a lot by Pinker, usually in a pejorative way. He seems to fall along the conservative stance that political correctness is thought control, instead of being a way in which people can make a firm point about maintaining civility in a diverse culture, and that calling people ""snowflakes"" or humorless for having a reaction is a less-than-subtle method of saying ""I'll be as rude as I want and your disapproval takes away my free speech.""Pinker also tries to probe the dramatic drop in homicides and violent crimes from the 1960s to today. He digs through dozens of ideas, some more convincingly than others. He points to changes in police work, such as New York City's ""broken windows"" policy of up-close-and-personal neighborhood policing. Here he misses the point that this also led to ""stop and frisk"" and regular civil rights abuses, including the high proportion of black arrests for comparable crimes among other races. He makes false equivalencies from the 1960s between the ""violent left"" (Black Panthers and SDS) and those on the opposite extreme responsible for decades of lynchings, bombings, and ""disappearances"" of those with opposing ideas or different races. Internationally Pinker seems to be of the opinion that many countries could do with a good dose of western civilization to make them less violent, because that's worked so well since the 1500s.These distractions aside, Pinker hits a positive stride in the last chapters of the book when he gets to work with statistics and failures by humans to make rational appraisals of the dangers around them. In a world in which the media focuses on incidents of violence, despite their decreasing numbers, it can be natural to make the assumption that the world is a violent place, more so than when we were younger. I don't know that some media have changed that much in the past century. We do live with 24-hour news coverage, and violence is easier to report on than political subtlety. But the type of coverage just came in different wrappers in the past. Check out old copies of Police Gazette if you have the chance. Salacious and violent stories have always drawn our attention.Pinker points out that our survival instincts lead us to overestimate dangers. So even though you're more likely to be killed from a bee sting than by an ""Islamic terrorist"" we focus on the most unique danger as opposed to one that is more common and mundane.On the whole, the book is filled with a ton of interesting and unique factoids, along with as clichê-strewn a prose style as I've read for some time. Whether he's on-point or not regarding causes he does make a reasonable point that, for whatever reason, we are less violent and less tolerant of violence than even recent ancestors were. We, as a nation, could relieve a great deal of day-to-day anxiety simply by being more aware that we live in a world far more peaceful than other humans have had the opportunity to enjoy."
189,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4465582-alexander-curran,3,"“An ideology can provide a satisfying narrative that explains chaotic events and collective misfortunes in a way that flatters the virtue and competence of believers, while being vague or conspiratorial enough to withstand skeptical scrutiny.”Steven Pinker's The Better Angel of Our Nature gives the reader an account of how violence has apparently declined. It explores the nature and reality of terrorism, genocide, conflicts... All the aspects that have transpired throughout history, and how religion and ideology has played a part in the human experience so far. The book mostly takes part in 10 chapters which are listed here for a feel to the layout of the work:Chapter 1 - A FOREIGN COUNTRYChapter 2 - THE PACIFICATION PROCESSChapter 3 - THE CIVILIZING PROCESSChapter 4 - THE HUMANITARIAN REVOLUTIONChapter 5 - THE LONG PEACEChapter 6 - THE NEW PEACEChapter 7 - THE RIGHTS REVOLUTIONSChapter 8 - INNER DEMONSChapter 9 - BETTER ANGELSChapter 10 - ON ANGELS’ WINGSStephen Pinker firstly gives us the biological perspective, the Darwinian model that comes with the survival of the fittest. To make his case Stephen attempts to show how violence has supposedly decreased as we reach our present place in time. The reasons for this decrease do include aspects that come with a civilised mentality: Empathy, morality, education and the responsibility that comes with utilising intelligence rather than relying solely on force.Another titular counter, that comes with Pinker's evaluation about the decline of violence, is that since ancient times, medieval times, renaissance times, all the way to the modernity present... The reason that political correctness has given citizens greater pacificated behaviours, the element that comes with domestication and peace is that human beings have quelled their savage natures. I find myself doubting this decrease in violence, even when someone else counters with potential causes such as poverty and war, or where you live in the World... The conflicts that are happening in the World today are showing the opposite. Whether we have militaries around the World that exist to not just provide defensive measures but to be used in battlegrounds the Truth remains the same: War is big business and one aspect that facilitates change in geopolitics. The diplomatic methods and careful interaction taken by political entities reflects at times a certain distrust between various players, even if they are allies or enemies, the stance that if you scratch my back then I scratch yours remains one component among many. I think after over 800 pages here via The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined I'm left with a somewhat long critique of Religion being a main reason for past aggression and violence that perpetuated wars. The wars of the 20th century are looked at by Pinker as still being an indication of declination when it comes to violence. It isn't just the fault that comes with a religious mentality but one that comes with territorial expansion that comes with past empires tendency to view might as right and weaponry, strategy, resources, numbers giving the advantage. Often such tactical decisions may have taken place under the cloak of a premise that included belief. Whether we have armies, from ancient or medieval times for example, on the offensive burning, raping and pillaging... This rather gruesome aspect of conquest and warring was still present in the 20th century and even in our current 21st century. While human beings have the potential to do great things, depending on what they are can come with a burdensome price. Yet Pinker sees humanity and the World through what one could call rose-tinted glasses, radiating a positivity and politically correct charged case that things are getting better overall. Many would applaud his efforts and yet more would be sceptical and say have things really gotten better overall? Especially when we look at impoverished parts of the World... When we look at the poverty and crime still present (And in some places quite high!) can stats really show that suffering has diminished? I think out of the data collected many of us are wondering about what hasn't been included... Although many academics want to show we are at a crucial moment in our time as a species, that the direction we are heading isn't all doom and gloom.“Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities. —Voltaire”Pinker has a humanistic approach to how he views existence, (And it often attacks Religion for being a root cause, in a similar yet not as extreme reasoning that caused the French Revolution or that of Karl Marx to want to break away from the Church and State forms of control...) at times it is commendable, what could be viewed as decent, honourable and sustaining, at others bordering on a rather seemingly Utopic pathway that has flourishing branches of morality, intelligence, wisdom, and the biological necessity of humans being managed and controlled. It would certainly seem that when peace is inherited that many become complacent or decedent, yet those who fought for peacetime actually appreciate what they struggle so hard for. It is this domestication and complacency that sometimes has me worried, to use a metaphor what if de-clawing the tiger and putting the poor creature in the Zoo actually stops the creature from being what it was meant to be? A noble predatory animal living in nature that majestically hunts for food and lives a dangerous yet vibrantly charged existence. What would be the human equivalent if we strip away everything that gave us strength and power in the first place? It certainly is thought provoking to assess our existence in times of crisis and obviously enlightenment often comes through ardent struggles and challenges. The evils that beset mankind are often ones that take away those very aspects of freedom and liberty we have to keep alive. I'm not sure how political correctness and pacifism can do that when these very things backfire at times, weaknesses to be exploited by those more extreme in their actions, exploits and intellectualism. They often become forms of sterility and that is the danger that comes with the pitfalls of progressivism. In no means do I propose we abandon such versatility but also continue to explore the potential consequences that come with good intentions and ethical considerations. Overall Pinker's work is very detailed yet long, I must admit I was bored a few times and thinking I've read or heard this before... Yet the book has statistics, charts, plus certain ideas of influential scholars identifying six prevailing trends: The Pacification Process, the Civilizing Process, the Humanitarian Revolution, the Long Peace, the New Peace, and the Rights Revolutions. Turning from history to psychology he identifies five inner demons that lead us to violence: Predation, dominance, revenge, sadism, and ideology/religion. Before moving onto the four better angels: Empathy, self-control, morality and reason. Then giving the reader an interesting examination of violence in human history before explaining these trends accompanied with a psychological methodology. Worth a read and look for anyone interested in human nature plus the angels and demons that have haunted human beings since the dawn of time. A biological, humanistic and psychological approach from Steven Pinker.“It Begins with skepticism. The history of human folly, and our own susceptibility to illusions and fallacies, tell us that men and women are fallible.”"
190,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45322768-adam,5,"Another hit by Steven Pinker. I read this one a bit out of order having recently read Enlightenment Now. It was apparent speaking to many that this was the foundation for that book. I expected a lot of the same, which it was to some extent, but this also had a lot more ideas, different explorations of reasons and a lot more detail which was nice. With detail and thoroughness comes length and this one is a bit more of a chore to get through but it's well worth it for all of the information it conveys. Pinker delves into such a huge variety of topics and does not disservice to any of them as he really does get right into all the details they require.The fact that violence is decreasing drastically is well established. This is quite contrary to what we hear so often but it's incredibly evident from a bit of research. If I'd have read this when it first came out I would likely have been mostly surprised but as I'd become quite familiar with the arguments, largely because of this very book, I had long ago come to terms with the idea. Still always good to have proper data and arguments to firm up my beliefs and there are some details and aspects I'd not thought of or didn't have details on. For example the idea that violence in media/fiction increased is so pervasive and I'd never really known to counter the idea but Pinker establishes quite well that what we watch is actually much less violent than what we saw historically, even if there may be shorter term ups and downs in the trends.Really dug the exploration that etiquette inadvertedly leads to pacification. From simple etiquette about knives at the table being very related to violence to the more nebulous idea of self control leading to less violence. So many little contributions to peace like this aren't details I'd thought of. There really is no single simple answer to why we are more peaceful but what Pinker presents is just a barrage of small reasons which he does a good job of showing all add up to the reductions we've seen.Enjoyed the exploration of the rise of violence in the 60s until the 80s. This was more of less glossed over in Enlightenment Now as it didn't really fit the trend being discussed but here we get some good reasons. I had previously been a bit dumbfounded by this short term local maximum in violence. No doubt this wave of crime affected the attitudes people had about the decline of society as I grew up and can be seen in a lot of the dystopian fiction written in the 80s and 90s. Surely many still think things are worse than over but in the case of this time period authors were actually right to observe a rise in violence and only in retrospect does it seem inappropriate to have extrapolated that things would just get worse. When I see stories of a future crime ridden New York I know this doesn't represent the city I've seen in recent years but it makes more sense through the lens of the 80s and beyond. Pinker, being a logical analyst of the issue, does not attempt to give any sure fire reason for this increase but gives good ideas for things that could have contributed and awards them a reasonable level of confidence.Great analysis of War and terrorism. Not only demonstrated increases but really attempting to break down the specific causes. I don't chose to be overly optimistic about this because, although we've seen a great decline things could change. I do appreciate that the trends leading to reduction are likely to continue though.Upsetting exploration of infanticide. I never would have imagined this to be so common. Now on top of unplanned infant mortality, disease and high rates of violence as being undesirable traits of the often glorified past we can throw this on top. The evolutionary explanations for how this would have made sense are a bit troubling.Enjoy the exploration of gender. Men are violent for sure. We seem to be much better off having women have as much freedom as possible. A well demonstrated point that too many men, especially frustrated single men, make for bad situations all around! Couldn't help but think of the trendy incel idea, which wasn't really topical at the time of this book's writing, as some of this was detailed. Pinker clearly shows that being in a relationship or marriage is good for keeping men out of trouble and that a lack of relationship options leads to all sorts of terrible shit.All around love this book. So much information. Everyone should read this one!"
191,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3067828-rick,4,"The Better Angels of Our Nature – by Steven PinkerDo you realize that in many ways, you are living in the most peaceful period that's ever happened in the existence of our species? There's so much here. The book is massive and dense, yet valuable in its insight. Thankfully much of it is graphs, research blips, and quick summed points.  While on a level most of us know but argue with this.... The University of Cincinnati found in a study that eighty five percent of what we worry about never comes true. Contrary to the rampant bad news and doomsayers around us, while pessimism is on the rise,... violence as a whole is not increasing. There is documented, scientific studying that shows worldwide violence has been decreasing since 10,000 BC. ""There has been a continuous decline in war, murders, and other violent crimes. Slavery has been nearly eliminated. Overall, murder rates have dropped by about one hundred times from the Middle Ages to today."" Despite the fact that people think war violence is increasing, there has been a ninety percent reduction in war related deaths since World War II. Life expectancy has more than doubled in the past one hundred and fifty years. Poverty levels have dramatically dropped. A century and a half ago, seventy five percent of the world population lived in extreme poverty. Now that number is under fifteen percent. Developing regions realized a forty two percent reduction in the number of undernourished people in the last twenty five years. Citing everything from the Bible, to Marx, to tribalism, Pinker comes full circle on the Better Angels of our world. It's hard to agree with him on all of it because there are some wide sweeping generalizations mixed in, and we aren't entirely parallel in viewing the topic of religion, but for the most part he has provided a heavily thought out and credible reason for optimism. This is not to say that we should stop trying to reduce violence or lower carbon emissions and improve the earth and kindred relationships. It's just that most of the planet lets their lives be driven primarily by fear and worry. ""Everyone is worried about home invasions, sharks, and hurricanes. You know what they should be worried about? - Car accidents, television, and junk food. But those aren’t as newsworthy.""-------------------------------------------------------------- “We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.”― Abraham Lincoln""As one becomes aware of the decline of violence, the world begins to look different. The past seems less innocent; the present less sinister.""""Everything in human affairs is connected to everything else, and that is especially true of violence. Across time and space, the more peaceable societies also tend to be richer, healthier, better educated, better governed, more respectful of their women, and more likely to engage in trade.""""Of all the varieties of violence of which our sorry species is capable, genocide stands apart, not only as the most heinous but as the hardest to comprehend.""""People today think of the world as a uniquely dangerous place. It's hard to follow the news without a mounting dread of terrorist attacks, a clash of civilizations, and the use of weapons of mass destruction. But we are apt to forget the dangers that filled the news a few decades ago, and to be blasé about the good fortune that so many of them have fizzled out.""""States are far less violent than traditional bands and tribes. Modern Western countries, even in their most war-torn centuries, suffered no more than around a quarter of the average death rate of nonstate societies, and less than a tenth of that for the most violent one.""""The decline of violence may owe something to an expansion of empathy, but it also owes much to harder-boiled faculties like prudence, reason, fairness, self-control, norms and taboos, and conceptions of human rights.""""Instead of asking, “Why is there war?” we might ask, “Why is there peace?” We can obsess not just over what we have been doing wrong but also over what we have been doing right. Because we have been doing something right, and it would be good to know what, exactly, it is.""""The growth of writing and literacy strikes me as the best candidate for an exogenous change that helped set off the Humanitarian Revolution."""
192,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1758411-lisa,0,"Well, I haven't exactly abandoned this... I never undertook to read it all anyway. As you might recall if you read the exchange of comments after my review of On Rape by Germaine Greer, Fourtriplezed and I agreed to read each other’s suggestions: he had never read anything by Greer, and I hadn’t read The Better Angels of Our Nature, the decline of violence in history and its causes (2011) by Steven Pinker. Mercifully, since the Pinker book is 802 pages long, I wasn’t asked to read the whole book— just the sub chapter in Chapter 7 ‘The Rights Revolution’ which is called ‘Women’s Rights and the Decline of Rape and Battering’. So this is not a ‘book review’, it’s just a response to the part of the book which I was asked to read…Pinker’s book has been nominated for a swag of awards: the Royal Society Science Book Prize Nominee for Science Books (2012), the Julia Ward Howe Prize Nominee (2012), the Best Book of Ideas Prize Nominee (2012), the Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction Nominee (2012), and the Cundill History Prize Nominee for Recognition of Excellence (2012). There are also numerous reviews from people who’ve read the whole book. See Tim Radford at The Guardian; and (notably) Peter Singer at the NYT. The admiration seemed to be universal so of course I went looking for another PoV—actually, I went looking for a female reviewer and couldn’t find one, (strange, eh?) but did find John Gray at The Guardian and include him here for balance. And I do that because I found a couple of examples of intemperate language (such as referring to ‘proclamations from bully pulpits such as the United Nations and its member governments on page 414) which made me feel uneasy about The Better Angels, but not enough to make me want to read the whole book…So… I read the prescribed chapter, but for good measure, I also read the Preface, which I summarise thus:Pinker argues that contrary to popular opinion and the impression we get from mass media or our own experiences,…violence has declined over long stretches of time and today we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species’ existence. The decline, to be sure, is not smooth; it has not brought violence down to zero; and it is not guaranteed to continue. But it is an unmistakable development, visible on scales from millennia to years, from the waging of wars to the spanking of children. (p.xxi)He maps the decline of violence by identifying six trends, five inner demons, four better angels and five historical forces:Six trends (chapters 2-7) consists of *the Pacification Process (from the anarchy of the hunting, gathering, and horticultural societies…[…] to the first agricultural civilisations with cities and governments, beginning around five thousand years ago. (p.2)] Yes, I hear you. Pinker has consigned Aboriginal societies from the oldest living civilisation on earth* to the category of ‘anarchy’.*the Civilising Process between the late Middle Ages and the 20th century best documented in Europe: the consolidation of a patchwork of feudal territories into large kingdoms …[…] … with centralised authority and an infrastructure of commerce. *the Humanitarian Revolution, beginning in the Age of Reason and the European Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries. This brought the first organised attempts to abolish socially sanctioned forms of violence like despotism, slavery, duelling, judicial torture, superstitious killing, sadistic punishment and cruelty to animals. *the Long Peace, dating from the end of WW2. Pinker says this is unprecedented: the great powers, and developed states in general, have stopped waging war on one another.  [John Gray in his review refutes this because of the number of proxy wars that have taken place].*the New Peace, since the end of the Cold War in 1989: a decline in organised conflicts of all kinds—civil wars, genocides, repression by autocratic governments, and terrorist attacks.*the Rights Revolutions, symbolically inaugurated by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, has seen a growing revulsion against aggression on smaller scales, including violence against ethnic minorities, women, homosexuals, and animals which has led to a cascade of movements from the late 1950s to the present day.It was this last chapter, and the chapter about violence against women that I was asked to read.*The Five Inner Demons are predatory or instrumental violence; dominance; revenge; sadism and ideology;*The Four Better Angels are empathy; self-control; moral sense; and reason.*The Five Historical Forces are those which favour our peaceable motives and that have driven the multiple declines in violence:  *the Leviathan (a state and judiciary with a monopoly on the legitimate use of force); *Commerce (trading partners who are more valuable alive than dead); *Feminisation (moving away from the glorification of violence); *Cosmopolitanism (embracing the perspective of the Other); and *Escalating Reason (applying knowledge and rationality to human affairs).So, to ‘Womens Rights and the Decline of Rape and Battering’ in the chapter about the Rights Revolutions…The difficulty I have with Pinker’s approach (in this chapter that I’ve read) is that it is reliant on statistics, and mostly US statistics at that. On this topic, having anything meaningful to say about the prevalence of rape in the past (whether the near past or very long ago) is problematic. So Pinker leaps over centuries of past violence with this:The prevalence of rape in human history and the invisibility of the victim in the legal treatment of rape are incomprehensible from the vantage point of contemporary moral sensibilities. But they are all too comprehensible from the vantage point of the genetic interests that shaped human desires and sentiments over the course of evolution, before our sensibilities were shaped by Enlightenment humanism. A rape entangles three parties, each with a different set of interests: the rapist, the men who take a proprietary interest in the woman, and the woman herself. (p. 395)See, I have a problem just with this paragraph. Why is the woman placed last in that last sentence, eh? And there’s a curious slide in the logic:*rape is hard to understand now that we have contemporary moral sensibilities*rape is not hard to understand from a genetic/evolutionary PoV*we have outgrown those desires and sentiments since the Enlightenment*but now I, Pinker, using the present tense ‘entangles’ include the men with a proprietary interest in women, as if we have not outgrown those pre-Enlightenment views…Hmm.

Although I thought parts of the history and analysis were fascinating, the book's topic is fairly disturbing (death, murder, torture, violence), which I found depressing to dwell on at such length. The author has a great sense of history and makes a compelling case that humanity's past was much, much more violent than the relatively peaceful world we live in today. I felt more appreciative of the present after this book's thorough detailing of all the progress we've made in several aspects of society. Pinker offers interesting examples of violence and conflict from different historical eras, but I felt too much was drawn from European Middle Ages and onward, and I wished the book had included more stats and examples from Roman and Eastern civilizations. The most interesting concept I learned about in the book was the ""Republic of Letters"", which was a term for the Enlightenment authors that corresponded across great distances of time and space. Pinker describes how intellectuals during this period used letters and books to exchange and refine their thoughts, which led to new ideas about governing nations, and eventually those ideas were used to create a more peaceful world. I found this description of the power of sharing ideas to be very inspirational, and it made me think of the great potential we have today with all the idea sharing tools made possible by the internet (Twitter, blogs, podcasts).One aspect of this book I found enjoyable, but challenging, was the author's constant questioning of data sets and theories. Pinker starts describing several trends and a theory about why violence decreased in one area, only to discuss at length why that theory may be incorrect. It was a good reminder about why we should be very skeptical of theories and rigorous with our data analysis, but I often impatiently wondered, ""What does the author believe to be true? How many ideas do we need to explore and reject?"" I enjoyed this historical overview in the first half more than the list of behavioral studies in the second half for this reason. Many of those same studies (e.g. the Stanford prison experiment) come up in so may books I read, like ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" (which was published around the same time), so I'm less excited to read about them yet again.In the last chapter the author finally divulges his conclusions, and it feels like a closing argument to a long court case. Rewarding, but a lot of mental work along the way. Overall, I enjoyed the intellectual work out, and am left with a new perspective on human history (the path of decreasing violence) and several interesting ideas I'd like to read about more."
194,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112254080-chaithra-mailankody,5," I had finished reading Factfulness just a few days before starting this book . It was a book I loved very much. But after reading the first few pages of The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence has declined , I almost concluded that I would probably not enjoy the book much. Very soon, I realised I was wrong.Being accustomed to reading fictions and having just started with Non-Fictions, I found it difficult to comprehend some phrases and had to re-read them to understand better. Every now and then I had to find out meanings of words used in the book I had never heard of. I got past that struggle after the first 100 pages or so. Even though I had to look for meanings of words and re-read phrases used throughout the book , it didn't seem like a struggle after the first 100 pages. That is when I started enjoying the book. I discovered many new concepts and facts. When I hear about certain incidents and altercations from people around, my mind starts wondering if it is a Hobbesian Trap kind of situation!! The baby boomers influencing the rise in the number of homicides from the 1960s to the 1990s and why they did was something that I found really interesting.I really liked the fact that the book mostly had quite a balanced and unbiased take on most matters.As explained in the book, statistics has proven that a country where women are better represented in governments and other professions are the ones where violence has declined and the country's economy shot up . It felt great to know that the feminist movement has done good to the world and the undermining of the movement by some people is usually uncalled for. I was fascinated to know that the phrase ""Try not to look with rose tinted glasses"" is not just a phrase but a natural and biological phenomenon experienced by human beings.Why Reason more than empathy has led to a significant fall in violence is beautifully explained with real-life examples.I recommend this book to everyone who wants to understand a little more about human beings and how our instincts played a part in the history of violence."
195,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829466-sara,3,"Oh boy... this one is hard to rate. There are certain sections that were REALLY interesting. I really liked the first quarter of the book and STRUGGLED with the middle half. That's why it took me so long to read. Some of my favorite sections were about how utterly brutal the Middle Ages were and so-called Biblical times. I also liked the bits about how the United States has gone through cycles of violence and peace. Some parts of the chapters were very fascinating, morbid, and surprising at times (the Wild West... oof.). The sections The Long Peace and the New Peace, especially the New Peace, were absurdly long chapters and for me they really dragged. There's a too-long section about European conflict which seems odd in that only the U.S. and Europe have really been highlighted in this gigantic tome, while Latin America and to some degree Asia have a more reduced focus. I suppose the historical pieces were not all that interesting and I got tired of looking at endless graphs. However, a long chapter needn't be horrible. I did like the Rights Revolution bit quite a lot and I was glad that the author included both homosexuality and animal rights. Inner Demons later on was kinda... eh. The psychological effects behind evil have been done to death and honestly been written more impressively by other authors (sorry!). I definitely feel that this book could have been a lot more enjoyable with a lot more editing. It's just not necessary for a book to be this long nor to have 100+ page chapters. Overall, I would say that I enjoyed this book, I definitely learned new information, and I agree with his overall thesis and think it holds up. It's kind of a shame that some of the book has already aged in that it doesn't cover school shootings (now a huge omission) or the Trumpian era or even Russia and Crimea. I would think the author would have something to say regarding the shootings (maybe should look that up...). I would say that it's better to digest this book in chunks (unless you have a compulsion to do a book challenge... *cough*) and to skim over some of the denser, slower chapters. I would say I still recommend this if the topic piques your interest and you do not mind the formatting."
196,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,3,"This book is too long and overanalyzes its topic. The topic, decline of violence is a worthy subject and worth discussing. The pace is terrible, it’s slow and each chapter groans under a weight of detail and charts and too much argumentation. The book suffers from bad editing, not so much bad writing, but too much writing. The book could have been half as long and still made a good argument. The length of the book actually weakens the argument. It does seem that a culture of physical violence, assumption of violence occurring and official government violence have all declined. But, the author argues so much and so long that I wondered if his argument is really weak and he’s trying to hide that fact under a weight of data and authority. He also doesn’t seem to address the possibility that people are just channeling violent impulses into safer less physically violent actions, such as aggressive social media trolling and the like. I guess the book met my expectations as it did outline why the author feels physical violence has declined and supports his case. That said, I give this book a 3. It’s interesting, and proves to the author’s satisfaction that physical violence has decreased over the centuries. But, the book is too long for effective argumentation and doesn’t address two critical areas, first, whether physical violence is merely being transferred to other channels of what might be called non-physical violence and second address the fact that cultures tend to oscillate between ideas. It’s possible that an event or culture might bring back physical violence to earlier levels…it’s a fallacy to assume as this book does that physical violence levels will keep decreasing especially given that it’s human nature reacting in culturally approved manners.

197,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1161667-shel,4,"This is a fascinating and informative book, which I should never, ever have given to my Dad as a Christmas present.Firstly, although father is not adverse to fact dense books, he is a slow and careful reader and this book is a long slog.Secondly, while this book has an uplifting premise and the word ""angels"" in the title, it's filled with gore, vileness and gruesome records of atrocity.Dad, I read this book so that you wouldn't have to.Pinker expects his readers to be resistant to the idea that violence is on decline (just look at the news!), so he bolsters his position. His argument begins with the idea that far from being angels now, we have forgotten the devils we used to be: murdering children, torturing women, and likely to stab each other over dinner.It's a history of homicide, democide, genocide, ethnocide, politicide, regicide, infanticide, neonaticide, filicide, siblicide, gynecide, uxoricide, matricide, and terrorism by suicide. Ugh!Also, people in the past (use say 1910 as a barometer) were morally stupid, and even, by today's standards, somewhat retarded.Cold comfort. All this is depressing, as Pinker admits, ""After reading eight chapters (the book is 10!) on the horrible things that people have done to each other and the darker parts of human nature that spurred them, you have every right to look forward to a bit of uplift in a chapter on our better angels.""It's accurate to say that the final chapters are ""a bit"" of an uplift. Pinker says he wrote this book as an answer to the question, ""What makes you optimistic?"" Judged by this book, he is unlikely to be accused of being a Pollyanna.He does, however, counter some of our factually mistaken and scientifically unsupported pessimism.• There's not an inevitable cycle towards war and catastrophe. It's even statistically improbable and there's a trend away from it.• We're not ruled by a violent bias toward predation, dominance, and vengeance. Human nature also includes peaceful traits, which evolution seems to be selecting for, of compassion, fairness, self-control, and reason. • Things aren't getting worse. They are getting better. ""The forces of modernity — reason, science, humanism, individual rights — has brought us benefits in health, experience, and knowledge as well as a reduction in violence.""The data is coldly reassuring, while Pinker assesses, ""The decline of violence may be the most significant and least appreciated development in the history of our species.""  Pinker cautions against forces that favor violent outcomes such as ideological and utopian thinking and warns us of the dangers of pluralistic ignorance, when people, ""...endorse a practice or opinion they deplore because they mistakenly think that everyone else favors it,"" and punish dissenters.He suggests forces that favor a pacifying effect: art and literature (fiction, satire, first-person accounts, and reportage); democracy (electing smart and open-minded leaders, establishing policies, norms, and taboos); feminization; and ""rights"" movements (human, civil, homosexual, women's, and animal and, in general, ""...a commitment that other living things, no matter how distant or dissimilar, be safe from harm and exploitation."") as well as, ""conditions of democracy, prosperity, decent government, peacekeeping, open economies"".His approach is rational, moderate, and a counterpoint to authors who find that humanity's increasing traits of empathy and compassion are a source of improvement and inspiration. Rather, Pinker points to our increasing powers of abstract reasoning and understanding of the economic benefits of cooperation. He's quite enthusiastic about this in his way.Pairs well with: The Expanding Circle by Peter Singer, The Empathic Civilization by Jeremy Rifkin; The Age of Empathy: Nature's Lessons for a Kinder Society by Frans de Waal; and Twelve Steps to a Compassionate Life by Karen Armstrong.

198,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596550-jill,4,"Very thorough (long!) and meticulously researched, this book, with its message about the decline of violence over many millennia is surprising good news for humanity--I like that, and I think we all need to hear that. ""Better Angels"" is not for everyone--it reads like a text book, albeit an interesting one. I found the second half of the book especially hard to get through--all the talk about lobes of the brain, psychological experiments, etc. I think I'm a fairly educated person, but some of the big words and explanations were a little over my head. My one complaint about the book was his negative treatment of religion. He spent a lot of time talking about all the awful things that had been done in the name of religion (especially Christianity) throughout history, but very little time on any of its positive contributions. That is because he believes there are very few positive contributions. I realize that this is a popular opinion nowadays, especially among atheists (Pinker admits he is one), but I think an argument could be made (and has been made by certain theologians and religious historians, as a quick search on Amazon can show) that many of the teachings of Christianity--the love of God for all people and forgiving those who have done wrong, for ex.--have greatly influenced the Western governments and culture that have contributed to the decline in violence. I can overlook this bias, however, as this is a monumental, important book, and Pinker deserves credit for that."
199,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2875383-xavier-shay,4,"Highly engaging through the first half then I steadily lost interest as it progressed. Like many books of this type: I'm really glad someone wrote it, but I didn't necessarily need the whole thing personally.Also somewhat obvious trigger warning: it deals with a lot of violence :/""In an influential article called “Crime as Social Control,” the legal scholar Donald Black argued that most of what we call crime is, from the point of view of the perpetrator, the pursuit of justice.""""The Old Testament tells us to love our neighbors, the New Testament to love our enemies. The moral rationale seems to be: Love your neighbors and enemies; that way you won’t kill them. But frankly, I don’t love my neighbors, to say nothing of my enemies. Better, then, is the following ideal: Don’t kill your neighbors or enemies, even if you don’t love them.""""Perhaps the least contentious claim about human nature is that humans are apt to have sex under a wider range of circumstances than those in which they are capable of bringing up the resulting babies.""""The art of politics, Tetlock points out, is in large part the ability to reframe taboo tradeoffs as tragic tradeoffs (or, when one is in the opposition, to do the opposite). A politician who wants to reform Social Security has to reframe it from “breaking our faith with senior citizens” (his opponent’s framing) to “lifting the burden on hardworking wage-earners” or “no longer scrimping in the education of our children.” Keeping troops in Afghanistan is reframed from “putting the lives of our soldiers in danger” to “guaranteeing our nation’s commitment to freedom” or “winning the war on terror.” The reframing of sacred values, as we will see, may be an overlooked tactic in the psychology of peacemaking."""
200,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24847694-timo,4,"After a few false starts a few years ago, I finally powered through this book. And I'm glad I did.Pinker has made a persuasive case, bolstered by the breadth and depth he gives the topic. I understand Pinker has his critics (Noam Chomsky comes to mind) but it seems to me that one cannot gloss over this work with a soundbite here or there. It's a serious work that if it is to be refuted, requires serious engagement. I am cautiously convinced that Pinker has proven his theory that violence has decreased significantly across the human species.That said, Pinker makes what I think of several common mistakes that don't affect the central thesis. First, he false into the ""We"" trap much too often, speaking of ""humanity"" as a universal platonic ideal. He fails to significantly grasp the differences in values that can exist among humans, though he dances very close to the topic several times.Additionally, he lumps the ""tribes are bad"" meme into much of his discourse without recognize that all Tribe is, at core, applied communal love. It is a communal technology that can be used for good or evil. Most humans remain tribal, long for tribal relationships, but our modern world has banned them. I often think that Pinker and many other academics really mean to criticize religious viewpoint when they say ""tribe"" because it's more politically correct to condemn tribes.That said, this book is a must have on the shelf of those who would seek to understand the human condition. "
201,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534250-dino,5,"This is a big book, but despite it's length, the writing is so clear, and the ideas in it so provoking, that I didn't have any trouble completing it. Pinker writes beautifully. Here's but one example. When explaining how murder is very often the actualization of fantasies that we all harbour, Pinker writes:“The small number of premeditated murders that are actually carried out must be the cusp of a colossal iceberg of homicidal desires submerged in a sea of inhibitions”. Pinker accomplishes an enormous task: he uses a mountain of data and graphs to make a persuasive case that violence has declined massively throughout the ages. Thus the first part of the book is a history of the world and a shocking exposure of its barbarism. In non-state societies, pre-civilizaiton, the average annual death rate in warfare exceeded 500 per 100,000 people. Pinker does an excellent job of putting perspective around this statstic, and the many others that he uses. For example, Germany's average annual death rate from warefare in the 20th Century was 144. And the median national homicide rate among the world's countries is 6, with modern Western Europe enjoying a rate of 1. The worst decades of U.S. history (70's and 80's) in the most violent U.S. cities had annual homicde rates of 10 to 45.Why were ancient people's so violent? Pinker provides many explanations. One is that they put a low value on other people's lives becuase pain and death were so common in their own. Life had lots of nasty surpises, such as famines and plagues. With so much suffering, people may have reasoned that God was sadistic, and they were therefore quick to sacrifice others using brutal, bloody means such as burning at the stake, breaking on the wheel, or Judas's Cradle. Indeed, a belief in temporal bodies but eternal souls justified some of the worst violations of human life. With life being short and uncertain, people were rationally less willing to sacrifice present pleasure for future pleasure. Pinker supports this hypothesis by showing a sharp decline in interest rates, while controlling for other variables such as inflation. Modern people are willing to accept a lower rate of interest since they can be reasonably assured about living long enough to enjoy the benefits conferred to their future selves, enhanced by modern institutions for saving. Self-indulgence, or a lack of self-control, led people of past eras to steeply discount the future, and thereby ignore the longer-term consequnces of seeking immediate gratification.In Pinker's telling of the civilization process, it becomes astoundingly clear how disgusting our ancestors were to our eyes. Their habits and hygiene were completely unregulated by the self-restraint, social norms, and taboos to which we are all inculcated from a tender young age. It is clear, therefore, that what we take as our 'second nature' is aptly named; it is not our first, animal nature and had to be learned. Pinker makes the interesting point that much of our culture's norms, such as table manners, swearing, dressing modestly, have their roots in the civilizing porcess. Now that we are civilized, and do not need to fear being harassed or assaulted, some of these norms (such as women showing a lot of skin or men cursing in public) may have outlived their purpose. Another explanation for our violent pasts center around the lack of a state, or Hobbes's Leviathan. For example, in non-state societies, people are left to pursue their own justice. Without a state to pursue justice blindly and using the principle of proportionality, people are vulnerable to the ""Moralization Gap"", whreby they interpret the ""harms they inflict to be mild and forgettable but the harms they suffer to be unprovoked and grievous"". In contrast, the law can weigh harms without the self-serving distortions of either the perpetrator or the victim.Yet another reason for our ancestors endorsing torture is a fascinating and convincing case made by Pinker that torture is an acquired taste, like our taste for dry wine, aged cheese, or hot peppers. The pheonomenon describes the way that ""neophytes must overcome a first reaction of pain, disgust or fear on the way to becoming a connesieur"". Having provided a full account of our violent past, and the reasons therefore, Pinker sets about to explain the extraordinary decrease in violence beginning around the 18th Century. Pinker identifies many exogenous forces that led to this decline, such as an effective state and judiciary, gentle commerce and the opportunity for positive-sum games, the feminization of society and a shift in culture from honour to dignity, the perspective-taking enabled by the spread of books and travel, and the force of reason in dispelling any basis for privileging one's interests over others.In his discussion on morality and taboo, Pinker makes the interesting point that no societies build their moral underpinnings around the Golden Rule or the Categorical Imperative (universalizable principles). Morality in practice is a set of relational models consisting of Communal Sharing, Authority Ranking, Equality Matching, and Market Pricing. Morality then consists of respecting or violating the models. Over time we have shifted our moral framework toward the values of personal freedom and autonomy, displacing the role of the first three models in our moral lives. In fact, for Pinker, morality seems to consist of the interchangability of perspectives and the opportunity the world provides for positive-sum games. This leaves us with a moral evolution that stops at Market Pricing, essentially the language of formal contracts and the workings of the modern economy. Pinker's account of the decline of violence clearly privileges the world of commerce and markets. A free market respects people's freedom (it it not value-laden), puts a premium on empathy (becuase the yardstick of business is satisfying human needs in markets), and keeps people peacable in order to preserve the networks of cooperation and trust that facilitate trade.

202,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15475791-helen,4,"Bill Gates recommended this book as the most inspiring book he's ever read, so I ordered it from the library without knowing anything else about it. When I saw it was 800 pages (700 + notes, index, etc.), my first thought was ""maybe not."" This book is a one of those that takes the long view--as in it encompasses the entire history of humankind--to make the point that violence of all sorts has declined dramatically. The point is supported by many graphs and illustrations and is quite convincing. Certainly we have come a long way in terms of what's considered acceptable treatment of heretics, prisoners, women and children, so there is reason to be optimistic about the future. However, it is scary thinking about the fact that the long peace we have enjoyed (at least here in the United States) could come to a sudden end via nuclear button pushing. Unfortunately, the book is about 400 pages more than I was interested in reading on the subject, so full disclosure: I did not read it all. However, what I did read was quite interesting and well written. I enjoyed Pinker's explorations into human nature (are we basically violent/bad or peaceful/good?) For the record, he says the most violent human beings are 2-year-olds. Somehow most of us grow out of that stage. "
203,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3960665-ryan,5,"Pinker makes a bunch of arguments in a variety of ways generally pushing the argument that violence has declined over the centuries through a variety of things which could broadly be called “progress”. The book is so wide ranging that there isn’t much more of a central argument than that, although there are some individual interesting arguments.What he seems to fail to take into account is the increased potential via technology and interconnectednees to let smaller groups (and eventually individuals) essentially wage large scale violence against the broader world. I will accept his broad arguments for decreasing desire by individuals, groups, and societies to violence, but this only really applies to “mainstream” society; it doesn’t matter if 6.5b people are increasingly successful and peaceful if a sufficient minority (which may someday consist of a single individual) decides to engage in mass scale violence."

His treatment of the topic is so thorough that it's virtually impossible to come away from this book without a little more faith in humanity, as well as an understanding that many of the world's trends are in the right direction, and it is in our hands to keep them on track.I believe the book carries a very important message for our times, and does a wonderful job of delivering it."

It has interesting/enjoyable parts, when the reading was seamless, and dull moments, when I had to put it away for a few days/weeks. Probably this is why it took me almost 8 months (!) to read it. Not everyone will enjoy the aforementioned different genres equally. It is at least 3-4 books shoehorned into one. It is an interesting book, with a huge amount of (invaluable) information, and research behind it, but the wide range of topics won't be suitable for everyone's taste."

While effective and thorough, this could have been condensed quite a lot, as after a while I was just waiting for the author to move on.After that, the second half of the book picks up and delivers its title: explaining why violence has declined.A variety of fields of violence are covered, from the decline of deaths by war right up to the decline of violence against minorities, with statistical evidence for the decline and possible reasons and theories. In the end, the book leaves the reader with a feeling of bitterness towards the past and optimism towards the future."

Steven Pinker's almost over-researched, diligently supported conclusions are impossible to dismiss or ignore. And the reasons he provides for the measurable decline in violence are made more vivid in light of the apparent efforts of the current political ""leadership"" in the US to reverse each and every one of those trends. This book is essential reading not just to see in detail the long-acting forces that got us here, but to appreciate just how amazing ""here"" actually is and work to continue to accelerate the rate of positive change in the face of reactionary resistance."

The structure is excellent, well laid out, and easy to follow. The first section is the history and analysis of human violence, followed by the statistical explanation that violence in society is decreasing. This alone could be one book. The quantity of sources is astounding. It would almost be easier to cite who Pinker doesn't cite. Once this premise is established the next sections deal with the whys and hows. He also discusses some common misconceptions about what isn't responsible for decreasing violence. He does this with quotes from citations from Kant, Locke, and Hume, to Darwin, Dawkins, and just for fun George Carlin. The vocabulary may cause some folks to struggle, and the source references are clearly that of an academic but with all that said there is a great deal of humor added to lighten the otherwise heavy topic. If you enjoy the application and analysis of statistics, application and analysis of philosophy, or the explanation of modern scientific findings in relation to anthropology and the human condition you will enjoy this book. All that said it is a heavy lift. It is very much a non-fiction, science/data/history/philosophy nerd's book. "

Either at the end or by chapter. Sure, you can have the world's history of violence broken down in a couple dozen chapters, but you don't get a bird's eye view when you're deep in it, nor do you get it at the end. But not a ""bad"" thing per se. Complementary, maybe.The good: an excellent (if at times depressing) compendium on the world and its history of violence, as well as the main causes and attenuators of violence throughout the ages. You get to understand a different side of humanity after you read this book. This should be required reading."

So far I had looked at evolution from features and intelligence perspective. How to survive was the key driver for us. But here we look at evolution from emotional lens. Compassion, empathy, relationship, anger, revenge etc. And the author gives a very clear trend of each of them. Being from an analytics background I thoroughly enjoyed the numerous charts which gives a very factual indication of how the world is turning out to be a less violent place by each passing year.

He makes the case that we in the 21st century live in a World that is far safer and less violent..He not only makes a case based on data, but also analyses the reasons as to why this reduction of violence has happened. A lot of it is very logical. One can only hope that this trend towards peace continues to get better and World become very safe for our children"

That slavery, torture, women and child beatings were considered the norm for many thousands of years is striking evidence of how far humans have ascended in.just the last few hundred years.That many of these accomplishments in reducing violence have not entailed violent revolution is also of note.Critically, I might have done with less interpersonal psychology and discussions of the prisoners dilemma."

Pinker outlines a history of violence to show how violent the world was and establish a trend. Once established, he then starts to look at why this downward trend of violence has happened. He explores a number of social, political, and economic factors that could explain why humanity is moving away from violence. Along the way he debunks many well-established myths about why violence happens in the first place. This is broken down further by examining many different types of violence. It is a wonderfully optimistic read about where we, as a race, have been able to bring our society. "
216,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24500625-michael-shaw,5,"Pinker's tome is the most provocative and optimistic thing I've read all year. His data is a compelling argument that violence really has decreased by orders of magnitude, that the human condition is simply better than it was before. I found the history more resonant than the psychology--if you can't read the whole thing, read the introduction and the chapter on murder.He argued that as we civilize, as strong states grow a monopoly on violence, and as people look to those states rather than to themselves for justice, that we become less violent. It gives me newfound hope for the power of government to truly change norms, and a different perspective on modern, often left-wing attempts to wrest justice back from government."

Example: ""Integrative complexity is related to violence. People whose language is less integratively complex, on average, are more likely to react to frustration with violence and are more likely to go to war in war games. Working with the psychologist Peter Suedfeld, Tetlock tracked the integrative complexity of speeches of national leaders in a number of political crises of the 20th century that ended peacefully (such as the Berlin blockade in 1948 and the Cuban Missile Crisis) or in war (such as World War I and the Korean War), and found that when the complexity of the leaders' speeches declined, war followed.""Read at your own risk."

The idea is counter-intuitive (especially about the century that saw 2 world wars and the use of nuclear weapons), but Pinker provides the statistics that back his claim.

It's a long book (nearly 700 pages), but if that's not intimidating I recommend this addition to his work."

This is not just a book about why violence has declined. This is THE book on history of violence in its many ramifications, with history, psychological, philosofica, politica ties.

Of course that's exactly what's important for a great majority of people and it can be very helpful to know the details in a debate for example.

"
245,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,5,"This is one of the most important books in years. The author (a noted Harvard social scientist) collects an enormous body of statistical and historical facts in support of his thesis that human society is slowly becoming more and more averse to violence. This is a conclusion that will be hotly denied by many, but they such persons are going to have to confront the huge body of facts that Pinker presents in this monumental 802-page book.Here are a few highlights of the book:1. Ancient primitive societies were hardly the Edenic paradises that they are often pictured to be. Careful analyses of skeletons from archaeological sites have confirmed that roughly 15% of these individuals died a violent death. Among more modern pre-state societies, similar analyses show 25% violent death. 2. In a list of the 21 ""Worst Things People Have Done to Each Other,"" which ranks the wars and massacres with the highest death tolls, the 20th century indeed is well-represented: WWII tops the list, following closely by the Chinese cultural revolution. But when these episodes are normalized by world population at the time, then WWII drops to #9. Number 1 on the normalized list is the little-known 8th century An Lushan Revolt, which resulted in the loss of 2/3 of the Chinese empire's population.3. The ""long peace"" among major powers since WWII has confounded the predictions of many that large-scale war is inevitable in our time. Pinker emphasizes that perhaps the most interesting post-WWII statistic of all is zero: Zero is the number of times that nuclear weapons have been used in combat; zero is the number of times that the two Cold War superpowers fought each other on the battlefield; zero is the number of times that any of the top 40 great powers have fought each other (since 1953); zero is the number of wars fought between any European nation (prior to this there were an average of two armed conflicts per year going back to at least 1400); zero is the number of developed countries that have expanded their territory by conquering another country; and zero is the number of internationally recognized states that have gone out of existence through conquest.4. While the modern world, especially in the West, agonizes over even remote chances of harm to today's children, for much of human history little ones faced a much greater risk: infanticide. Anthropologist Laila Williamson found until very recently, between 10 and 15 percent of all babies were killed shortly after birth. 5. The U.S. crime rate rose during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s until about 1992, but has declined since then. By 2010, the homicide rate had fallen to just 4.8 per 100,000 residents, down by more than a factor of two from its peak. Other measures of violent crime, and even property crime, have followed in unison. In the wake of the 2008-2011 recession, with millions out of work, losing homes and in desperate economic straits, crime rates have fallen even further, confounding criminologists who had predicted sharp increases.6. Pinker points out that by today's standards, even great statesmen of recent history would be considered hopelessly bigoted and violence-happy. Theodore Roosevelt excused the decimation of Native Americans as necessary to prevent the continent from becoming a ""game preserve for squalid savages."" Woodrow Wilson blocked black students from Princeton, praised the Ku Klux Klan, and declared that any hyphenated American ""carries a dagger that he is ready to plunge into the vitals of this Republic."" Franklin Roosevelt jailed 100,000 U.S. citizens in a concentration camp because they were of the Japanese race. And Winston Churchill declared that the Aryan stock ""is bound to triumph,"" and that India is ""a beastly people with a beastly religion"" [Pinker2011b, pg. 658].Also of considerable interest in Pinker's analysis of the factors behind these changes. One major factor is the rise of large, effective systems of democratic government, which Pinker terms the ""Leviathan"" effect, named after the title of a book by 17th century philosopher Thomas Hobbes. Others include the Civilizing Effect and the Pacifying Effect, wherein people have begun to see other societies as cooperating partners capable of trade and mutual enrichment, instead of loathsome aliens that must be eliminated. It also seems that society as a whole, perhaps through improved education, is better able to see the world from the eyes of others. Whatever the reason, it is a trend that we should cherish and understand better. Pinker's conclusion resonates with both hope and gratitude: ""For all the tribulations in our lives, for all the troubles that remain in the world, the decline of violence is an accomplishment we can savor, and an impetus to cherish the forces of civilization and enlightenment that made it possible."""
246,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27443578-john,3," Steven Pinker’s The Better Angels of our Nature attempts to explain two main points. The first point is that violence has decreased from the Paleolithic hunter-gatherer age to the modern era. This theory should be anecdotally evident to any student of history or pre-twentieth century literature. The author stated, however, that this theory may be contrary to popular opinion. The second, and more important, point was an explanation of this decline in violence. Pinker posits that this decline in violence was caused by both exogenous historical factors and psychological factors. The historical factors were the establishment of state governments and the predominance of classical rationalist liberalism that fostered such notions as individualism and human rights. These historical and philosophical developments, in turn, created an environment where the psychological capacity of man for self-control, skepticism, and reason (and perhaps even empathy) triumphed over his darker psychological impulses such as aggression, revenge, and sadism. 	Some of the author’s conclusions as to the “whys” of this decline in violence often may be considered off-the-cuff, unsourced speculation, and many reviewers have gleefully taken the author to task over this in arguing that this work was the biggest waste of time and resources since Ishtar. The importance of this work is that this is, to my knowledge, the first comprehensive work that attempts to catalogue this historical decline in human violence with an explanation of why such decline occurred. This work may not be perfect, but is a solid first step that other researchers can build upon, or attempt to debunk, in a way that furthers our understanding of the subject matter. That some of the author’s mini-conclusions in various subsections of this work may appear odd or appear to be bald speculation is no reason to write this book off as total rubbish.	Other reviews have commented that this book is disorganized and/or hard to follow. I could not disagree with those assertions more. The work is extremely well-organized. The preface tells the reader exactly what Pinker is attempting to prove, and why, in very simple English. The preface then summarizes each chapter. The first six chapters deal with the historical decline in violence over different eras, and chapters seven and eight deal with the psychological aspects of violence and non-violence. Each chapter is divided into sub-sections, which present a sub-issue and sub-conclusion. The conclusion then basically re-states the preface with a few examples from the psychology section thrown in to further buttress the author’s theses. In fact, this book is so well-organized and clear that a reader could probably understand about 90% of it by just reading the preface and conclusion only. (Which is perhaps what many reviewers did. I’ve never seen so many reviewers –including professional reviewers -- baldly state they didn’t finish the book, or didn’t read the whole book. Since when is this acceptable?) In addition, each chapter is well-sourced, with clear endnotes, along with a voluminous bibliography. The book also has a detailed index. 	For those of you that have been worried that the book is “too long,” consider this: of the 802 pages in the hardcover edition that I read, over 100 of those pages comprise the endnotes, bibliography, and index. The actual text of the book is only about 700 pages, and a good portion of that space is filled with graphs, charts, and pictures. Therefore, the book is quite a bit shorter than it appears.	The tone of the author was at times off-putting. The author often drops into a snarky, overly casual tone, for instance calling the Bible “a wiki,” making unnecessary and silly pop-culture references such as to the 1970’s group The Village People, and frequently writing in the first person and about his own personal experiences. The author’s tone nevertheless does not detract from his arguments or research in any tangible way.	In conclusion, whether you find the author’s conclusions well-supported, or unsupported rampant speculation – or whether the author’s thesis re-affirms what you always innately thought about society, or whether his thesis completely offends every belief that you formerly possessed -- there is no denying that The Better Angels of our Nature is an landmark work in its field. On a side note, the controversy that this work has generated should also show that as a society, Americans aren’t being “dumbed down” like many media pundits like to claim. The fact that an 800 page academic work of this nature is being widely read and discussed goes to show that people on the whole are probably better educated and more intellectual than ever, no? "
247,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30597556-travis-tucker,5,"Even though this book is seven years old, it rings as especially relevant in these days -- when everything you see / read in the media makes it seem as if the sky is falling and we on the brink of anarchy. This book takes a step back and gives a broader view of the history and decline of violence (of many types, from wars to domestic violence to animal rights). It's a great reminder that we have, in fact, made a lot of progress even if things aren't perfect today.Don't be put off of this book by the one and two star reviews -- mostly blowhards that want to debate one or two of the many points (and there are many debatable things in an 800 page book) of the book and claim that the book is worthless if those are shown wrong (missing the point, in my opinion)."

This is in places both one of the darkest and also the most uplifting books I have ever read. It gives you a true appreciation for the horrors that humans have done to each in the name of Justice, Religion and in places just for entertainment. At the same time it shows you how and why we have improved as a species and why hopefully these trends will continue. This book isn’t complacent it don’t pretend or brush over that awful things still happen all around the world and that all of the trends recorded may go backwards but the author gives reasons to hope the world will continue to improve. It was very satisfying to see references to other things I have read pop up throughout. Unlike many other big idea books that I’ve read which throw down a massive, controversial, theory and then cherry pick evidence which supports it, I felt reading this that the author had given all theories a fair hearing and dealt with counter arguments effectively, rather than just pretending that they didn’t exist. It’s a shame that the 850 page word count will put many people off. Probably would have put me off if I’d known that before I ordered it!"

For example, Pinker makes the claim that free-markets value empathy, when this is a highly questionable claim, given that monopolies which market forces lead to often cannot be overthrown by consumers, meaning that empathy is hardly necessary on the part of corporate executives, and consumers themselves may not care about the actions of companies. For example, consumers of fossil fuels and of companies which avoid taxes simply don't take the perspective of the people the companies affect negatively.He also seeks to defend modern ""liberal democracies"", in my view, far too often. For example, on p.156, he shrugs off modern torture by democratic governments by first rationalizing them on the basis that they are carried out in ""interrogation and counter insurgency operations"", implying that they have something akin to a 'just cause', and then claiming that the use of torture by countries such as the United States is ""universally decried"", which is patently not the case, given that some US Government officials continue to be unapologetic about it, never mind some media pundits.He writes that 'fascism and communism view opponents as irredemably evil and are expansionist', but the same can easily be said of liberal democracies, which have quite openly engaged in a number of usually illegal wars to ""spread democracy"" and rid the target country of evil, for instance in Iraq when the United States and the United Kingdom did so. In fact, social democracies seem to be the only societies which aren't expansionist.On p.295, Pinker writes that ""the occasional socialist"" opposed war, which is just a blatant slander, given that socialists have been integral to antiwar movements throughout the centuries. In fact, many of the antiwar pioneers who he cites - Bertrand Russell, Leo Tolstoy and George Bernard Shaw, just to name a few - were all socialists. In fact, socialists have been integral to all of the Rights Revolutions he lists as well. He also claims that Israel has ""acceded to international pressure to relinquish most of the territory it has occupied"" on p.312, when in fact it continues to expand its occupation and annexation of Palestinian territory.On p.318, Pinker notes that the US supported ""anticommunist forces in several proxy wars"", but they were not so much anti-communists as fascist and capitalist juntas and terrorists. Later on in the book, he again adds an unnecessary political line, when he talks about capitalism leading to peace, believing arguments in favour of this hypothesis to be ""sure to leave leftists speechless"". Apparently, he doesn't know that many, if not most, ""leftists"" are not opposed to capitalism playing a role in the economy.He also says that ""communal sharing supports the mindset behind genocidal ideologies"", which, again, may have been true in some cases, but certainly isn't true in every case. He states this as if it is necessarily the case.Other than that, Pinker occasionally makes other illogical arguments. To support his contention that civilian deaths as a proportion of the total deaths in war have not increased, he notes that WWII ""decimated civilians with a holocaust, a blitz, firebombings of cities in Germany and Japan, and not one but two atomic explosions"". Yet, just because these things occurred, all it shows is that civilian deaths were high in WWII - it doesn't really support the claim that civilian deaths as a proportion of the total number of deaths has not increased.His statistics on hunter-gatherer societies have also been powerfully challenged by the anthropologist R. Brian Ferguson, although his other statistics hold up when subjected to scrutiny. All in all, the Civilizing Process (apart from the questionable link to 'gentle commerce'), Feminization, the Expanding Circle, the Humanitarian Revolution and the Rights Revolutions hold up very well. His section on 'Reason' in the 'Better Angels' section of the books was excellent, in my view, although the correlation between IQ (including tests that had nothing to do with abstract reasoning) and (classical) liberalism does not prove that abstract reasoning causes classical liberalism which causes a decline in violence. "
253,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893735-joseph-sverker,4,"What can one say about a book like this? It covers such an immense amount of material and moves of vast periods of time and I can't say that I have the expertise to evaluate the details and references of Pinker's argument that violence has decline over the time of human history. I do think that he argues his case quite well though and I particularly likes two of his points, firstly that we often become forgetful about the violence of the past so that we think that what we have experienced must be worse that what has been before. Secondly, he argues for the fact that reading, education and knowledge has been a key factor for the violence to decline. This is not surprising if one is acquainted with Pinker's writing, but what is very surprising is that the reading he advocates is that of fiction! His argument is that the introduction of the printing press and publication of novels meant that people were forced to take a first person perspective in another person's story. This meant that people became more inclined to see also real people's perspectives from their own standpoint.A further interesting point here is the argument that it is the change of culture that has been the cause for the decline of violence. Pinker uses much sociological research to support this claim. That is a further surprise considering his view of sociology. He doesn't, of course, use the most ""poststructuralist"" theorists, but still. In my view Pinker would for example really appreciate the writings of Christian Smith. Pinker's argument that culture is the force that has caused the decrease is in a way not surprising since he argues that the human nature is one and the same since the pleistocene era. But, to argue for such a strong influence of culture is still remarkable in view of his previous writing. It should be said though that when it comes to morals Pinker, in my view, has always been very close to a social constructivist.So, to the sources then, his use of them comes across as trustworthy and impressive, and Pinker's writing is of course excellent. However, when it comes to the areas where I have a little knowledge I start to be a little suspicious, say his sources for his interpretation of the Old Testament, then he refers to a journalist for example, rather than a biblical scholar. His argument about the violence in the OT certainly forces one to think about what type of source for religious faith that is, but there is not much indication that there might be another side to the interpretation of the OT.Having said that, The Better Angels of Our Nature is really quite a breath of fresh air in terms of the view of religion presented in it. Pinker argues that faith in a higher power is a bad solution if one wants to decrease violence, increased individualism and a reliant Levianth is the solution!, and a belief in a higher power is simply superstitious and stupid in his view. But, having said that Pinker does not argue that all religion is bad. Rather, he points out that some religious expressions, quakers and anabaptists!, for example, have played a significant role for the decrease in violence. A very contested argument though is his view that Martin Luther King Jr acted the way he did NOT because of this Christian faith, but because he deviated from his Christian faith. That will certainly be provocative for many.Anyway, Pinker's conclusion is that not all religion is bad, rather particular religion is bad as well as particular religious movements are good. His conclusion from this though is a little strange I think because he argues that this means that we should try to move away from all religion because the overall all idea is bad. But, is this not exactly the same with his view of the need for a strong leviathan? Surely some leviathan is bad ans some is good (liberal democracy with individualism). That does not mean that the idea of leviathan should be done away with? Yet, still, the fact that Pinker is a little nuanced in his view of religion is certainly to be praised and it is one of the reasons for why I would not want him to be included in that movement called ""New Atheism"". His writing is simply too good for that I think."
254,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12730961-illimar-kaasiku,5,"I must admit, as an integralist and evolutionary (mainly influenced by Ken Wilber’s work), I enjoyed the book very much. It was a delight to walk these long 800 pages in Pinker’s shoes and see the world fully through modern rational scientific perspective—in its dignity and disaster. It was interesting to see how far can one highly praised mainstream academician reach (in explaining the important matters of our world) until the objective truths reach their limits.All the empirical research and his charts were just on spot and well presented, but the subjective truths and soft sciences could be much better represented. Pinker is not a pioneering genius trying to give something staggeringly new to the world, but rather telling the same old Darwinian evolution story in a slightly new way. But he's a good story teller and throws many fascinating facts on the path—good food for the thought. Did you know that Louisiana became the last American state to ban cockfights in 2008?„...from where we sit on the time line, most trends point peaceward. We may not be entitled to a theory of everything, but we do need a theory that explains why so many somethings point the same way“.Unfortunately Pinker is not integrally informed—which would give him a beautiful (AQAL) map that represents nearly a theory of everything, exactly what he’s looking for—and that’s why he struggled with many fallacies, dilemmas and contradictions. Here is a good example as any:„It’s long been known that mature democracies have better educated and smarter populations, but mature democracies have more of everything that is good in life, and we can’t tell what causes what. Perhaps more democratic countries are also richer and can afford more schools and libraries, which make their citizens better educated and smarter, rather than the other way around.“Pretty often he reasons: „What was before? Egg or chicken? Education or democracy/schools? Nature or Nurture? Exogenous or endogenous? Inner or outer? Individual or collective?“ In integral aperspectival philosophy it’s OK to embrace multiple perspectives and there is no need to waste time and paper on this kind of debate. Inner and outer, one and many, are rather co-arising—one cannot exists without other. Or like we say in integral theory these four basic dimensions or quadrants are tetra-arising. Fixation only on one, or some of them, is called quadrant absolutism (where Pinker finds himself pretty often).Also, not being fully aware of inner subjective dimensions of life (and corresponding methodologies and studies), Pinker doesn’t use developmental studies as thoroughly as he could (though he mentions Piaget and Carol Gilligan). That’s why he’s stuck in the ‘myth of the given’, assuming that everyone should see the world as a rational scientist—ignoring the fact that there are also pre-rational and trans-rational views to the world. Hence, he mixes up higher trans- (or post-) stages with lower pre-stages and makes a classical pre/trans fallacy—putting all the excising higher stages (e.g. postmodern and integral) in the same camp with lower stages (e.g. magical and mythical). That’s also one reason why he totally ignores great wisdom traditions—dealing with phenomenological world, mind states, flow states, reducing pain and suffering tremendously—and mixes them up with mythic-literal religions.In overall, for integralists, this book gives a great deal of objective facts that help to carve out the right quadrants even more in details and to help to bring integral maps (e.g. AQAL—all quadrants, all levels, all lines, all states, all types) even more closer to the mainstream thinking and academia. What I also enjoyed was the general overview about history and its important stages: The Pacification Process (nonstates), The Civilizing Process, The Humanitarian Revolution, The Long and New Peace (inc. The Rights Revolutions). But yes, it doesn’t come even close to Ken Wilber’s magnum opus 'Sex, Ecology, Spirituality' which gives much clearer, more complete and coherent presentation about history, violence, suffering and love."
255,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7825346-shay,4,"In The Better Angels of Our Nature, Steven Pinker offers up a thesis which, for some, may seem wildly unbelievable. Pinker contends that we are currently living in the least violent period ever known in human history. Using the number of violent deaths relative to the population of the time, Pinker examines trends in murder, war, terrorism and violent crime, and charts a consistent decline in their prevalence in cultures around the world. Having established this decline, Pinker sets out to find the psychological and sociological factors which contribute to the trend. The structure of the book is predicated on the idea that people will find the thesis difficult to swallow, as Pinker explains in the introduction. He spends six exhaustive chapters—well over half of this 800 page tome—in extensive statistical demonstrations of the decline. While the trends themselves are interesting, the constant barrage of statistics will likely wear thin for the reader who doesn’t find the thesis as difficult to believe as the author assumes. Overall, these statistics are well-explained for the average reader, and clearly illustrated in numerous charts and graphs. However, an understanding of statistics would undoubtedly be beneficial to any critical analysis of Pinker’s findings. Once he has established the statistical decline of violence, Pinker spends the second part of the book examining the sociological and psychological factors that encourage and inhibit violence, as well as identifying a number of popular culprits which are not actually borne out by the numbers. For example, he found that weaponry, affluence, resources and religion, while sometimes significant, were not consistent factors. The explanations rely heavily on neurobiology and the history of governance, necessitating numerous detours into the basics of these disciplines, and their relevant principles. Pinker finds extremely strong correlations between government and commerce, and the decline of violence. Not unexpectedly, The Better Angels of Our Nature makes for heavy emotional, as well as intellectual, reading. A discussion of the nature and history of violence necessitates the inclusion of a variety of stomach-churning examples, such as the burning of cats for public entertainment in medieval Europe. However, these examples prove instrumental for demonstrating the extent to which we exaggerate contemporary violence and discount historical violence. Pinker has a deft hand for defamiliarization, a technique he uses to draw historical violence in perspective with its modern counterpart. For example, although we accept the cross, a historical instrument of violence, as the symbol for Christianity, Pinker points out that our modern sensibilities would likely be offended if a group of Holocaust survivors adopted a showerhead as their symbol, or if survivors of the Rwandan genocide rallied around a machete logo. This unusual comparison forces the reader to examine the familiar, even ubiquitous, symbol of the cross with fresh eyes. These numerous violent examples are not trotted out gratuitously, or ad nauseam, but always to illustrate a particular point about how we perceive violence, or why we commit it. Despite the difficulty of getting through this book—it took me over six weeks to read—I would rate it highly, and strongly recommend it for those interested in the subject. I agree with Bill Gate’s assertion that it is “one of the most important books I’ve read—not just this year, but ever.” We need both the optimism and the insight which Pinker’s work provides since, as he points out, the decline of violence is not ineluctable—it could be reversed at any time. That being the case, it’s probably a good idea to understand what we’re doing right, and how we can do better. From http://shayshortt.wordpress.com/2013/..."
256,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,5,"This book may explain why the zombie apocalypse has been a common horror genre of late. Not that this is dealt with directly, but the book is so expansive in its explanations of other things, why not this as well? More on that later.According to Pinker, in just about every facet of violent behaviour that one can think of, the numbers, certainly in per capita terms, and often in absolute terms? I have pondered the question in more local terms over recent years: are my children safer now than I was at their age, despite, or indeed because of, the increased perception of risk? This book is full of fascinating insights into the reasons for violence and of course, why it has decreased over time. Who would have thought economics is a fundamentally moral social activity; or that the USA is such a violent nation because of a bipolar settlement and premature initiation of democracy; that some US states have an equivalent homicide rate to Papua New Guinea? This is a long book for something this technical, so the wit interspersed amidst its prose (elephant repellent) is welcome. Such is its breadth, that the parallel reads (shift and les Miserables) find an easy fraternity, whilst Life is almost specifically mentioned!Of course, Pinker is dismissive of religious belief and at times overly simplistic in his criticism; however, it is also true that religion has done itself many disfavours by its treatment of others, approval of torture and murder, and justification of such practices long after they should have been disavowed. However, there are areas which I think deserve more balance. Jesus' revolution, derided because of the violence of its climax, represented a radical departure from the violently enforced Pax of the Romans, including the attitude taken toward slavery. The humanitarian revolution was empowered in part by the reading revival inspired by Protestant churches wishing individuals (a second influence) to read the bible for themselves. More recently, scholarship has shown that Christian missionaries in Africa have been a key influence in the civilization of those countries (despite the progress that remains to be made).But these omissions do not detract from the surprising story of how we have ended up living in the remarkable time that we do, the lack of violence perhaps more remarkable than the technology revolution we are experiencing. It is painstaking in its analysis, and a long read as a result. But this is necessary I think. Each chapter generally begins describing some aspect of violence and some of the reasons that are thought to be behind it, then following this with statistical evidence before seeking to find the exogenous factors behind the trends. After looking at the social and historical externals, Pinker then looks at the internal neurological factors that might be affecting and affected by the declining violence. In the end, a few factors turn out to be common in the decline, and not necessarily the ones you might think. Reason gets a nod, religion and wealth disparity do not. For these and other factors, a simplistic opinion is not enough.Without question a must read book which will challenge the preconceptions most of us have. Take a deep breath and jump in!Oh, and the zombies... It turns out that a factor in the decrease in violence is the increase in intelligence from generation to generation, at least for the last two centuries. My theory on horror is that the bad guys speak to some primal fear, in the case of zombies senseless violence. So in some way the genre may be speaking to the fear of the violent and senseless brutality of the past. Sure, not everyone would have drawn that insight, but I'm sure there are plenty there for others to find also."
257,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31870613-leonard-armstrong,2,"This book reads like the PhD thesis from a student who knows he has selected way too broad of a topic for his dissertation. Its goal is to convince that all manner of violent crimes and interpersonal actions have diminished over the years since... well, pretty much since the start of recorded history. Additionally it throws in the kitchen sink to make its point using everything from logistic regression to neurological biography to clips from The Honeymooners and lyrics from John Lennon. (Yes, I did say clips from The Honeymooners.)Honestly, I should have known better. This audio book made its way to my reading list despite violating my rule of no books over 30 hours. In my experience, *any* audio book over 30 hours (approximately 600 pages) needs a better editor. And this one was not an exception. With good, editing this book could have come downs to its base positions with probably a 40% reduction of content volume. It gets 2 stars because behind what I saw as the self-indulgent facade of the author, there are a few good points and interesting positions taken.But the real failure of this books comes near the end when a position is taken that, after the George W. Bush administration, non-intellectual leadership, nationalism and other forms of isolationism is a thing of the past. (My words, I don't recall the author's exact words.) In the Trump era this shows itself to be not only incorrect, but laughably so. In a mere 8 years of growing partisanship and tribalism, the complete antithesis of intellectual leadership is back is a way no one but a satire such as Idiocracy could have imagined. (If this book can site The Honeymooners in its text, I can site Idiocracy in my review.) Furthermore, the leadership of Donald J. Trump and the modern GOP is making quite obvious that worse angels of our nature can take forms of oppression to a more modern high."
258,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4251182-david,4,"""Violence has declined over long stretches of time, and today we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species' existence."" (Location 128) This is, perhaps, the primary sentiment of this latest work by Prof. Steven Pinker. And for all my reservations with his ideology (progressivism) and his lack of critique surrounding statistical analyses I cannot help but feel this is a brilliant, insightful, and profoundly optimistic book. Optimism is something which has been, intellectually, in short supply for a great many decades. Though this seems odd because between the Long Peace (since the end of the second world war) and the New Peace (the end of the cold war) this is something we should all be feeling about our collective future. However, pessimism seems to be the general sentiment: from Climate Change to the geopolitics of China and India. Back to The Better Angels of Our Nature. The book is not without its faults-An out of control Progressivist ideology -Feminization theories which are deeply suspicious-Left Wing political agenda...as read by Americans-A mostly uncritical attitude to statistical analyses (some is suggested but mostly as a sop)-The inherent `squishiness' of the Social Sciences-An aggressive atheism which discounts all the positives attributes of Religion in favour of Old Testament blood thirsty hyperbole (and some from the New Testament). Personal note: I'm an atheist. -A rather hostile discounting of conservatives and conservatism (again, American in perspective): see page 662 and following for a sample of this. Note: I read the Kindle Edition on my iPad.For all of the above weaknesses and others, this is still a timely, important, concise, and articulate peace of optimism...with provisos (Pinker's not mine). Perhaps some of Prof. Pinker's most interesting observations are why he believes the world remains pessimistic about violence. One of my favourites is why the world, generally, feels violence is getting worse when it is actually declining: ""The decline of violent behaviour has been paralleled by a decline in the attitudes that tolerate or glorify violence, and often the attitudes are in the lead."" p. 155Our tolerance for violence appears to have fallen faster than violence actually has. This, perhaps, could force a greater decline in violence or it could have unforeseen negative consequences. At the moment this remains uncertain...to my way of thinking. This is a book which deserves several book length reviews and much closer analysis than I have given it here but it is brilliant and articulate while occasionally slipping into arrogance and ideological myopia (see progressivism and atheism amongst others). I did not give this book a full 5 stars because of the problems I have cited above, but it is a brilliant and important work that is both accessible and comprehensive (if the reader is willing to put in a little time). Highly Recommended AddendumThere are two other reasons I only gave this book 4 stars and that has to do with the book's formatting. 1) References/Endnotes are not activated 2)The index is not activated either. These are two very serious problems for readers of the e-Editions of this book. Some may feel this is not the place for this criticism but I would, respectfully, disagree because it makes looking up sources, so that I may engage more fully with the text, very very laborious. This is the typical way that publishers handle ebooks...haphazardly at best. Then they over-price them...which only promotes piracy."
259,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"This made me think of a passage in A Canticle for Liebowitz by Walter M. Miller, Jr., published in 1959: [The world has been destroyed by nuclear war, and monks are preparing to go to space to flee the clear threat of a repeat]: ""The closer men came to perfecting for themselves a paradise, the more impatient they seemed to become with it, and with themselves as well. They made a garden of pleasure, and became progressively more miserable with it as it grew in richness and power and beauty; for then, perhaps, it was easier to see that something was missing in the garden, some tree or shrub that would not grow. When the world was in darkness and wretchedness, it could believe in perfection and yearn for it. But when the world became bright with reason and riches, it began to sense the narrowness of the needle's eye and that rankled for a world no longer willing to believe or yearn.""This book argues the opposite: that an increase in reason (if not riches -- he says privation does not necessarily lead to violence) has led to a reduction in violence across the board and an unprecedented period of peace. I think it has an important, critical message. Violence has declined and for most people life is safer and more secure than it has ever been. We are amazingly amnesiac about history, even the recent past. When I mention this book to people, they raise their eyebrows at the title. The media is so good at promoting anger and fear that people don't even notice the safety and freedom we do enjoy.There were so many interesting things here that I never thought about before, such as ""mission creep"" -- activists keeping up the pressure by denying that any progress has been made. I hear this all the time in the negative comments about the current state of things. People really don't know how hard life was for our ancestors, even a couple of generations ago. This book made me feel more hopeful, not easy for a lifelong pessimist.I am a bit skeptical. It's a long, complex argument covering a lot of ground. Due to incomplete data, Pinker has had to fill in a lot of blanks and interpret much data to come to his conclusions. I have to wonder how much motivated reasoning he used. Did he have the final title in mind when he began his research? (I read that he wrote the book in response to the question, ""What are you hopeful about?,"" which is rather a leading question.) I am his age and lived through the same cold war and the humanitarian revolutions. And I grew up in North Dakota, practically a suburb of Canada. It was easy to nod along, thinking it all makes perfect sense, but then I read a negative review and realized I was employing my own bias as someone who was raised in a conservative place and time. I've read Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman and have been viewing Steven Novella's ""Your Deceptive Mind"" lectures on The Great Courses, so I keep second guessing my own thinking. Pinker is careful to acknowledge the gaps in the data and human bias, including his own. He's certainly not promoting a Pollyannaish or a Panglossian view, but he's cautiously optimistic.I can only look at the world through the eyes of classical liberalism, as that is all I've experienced. And as I recently spent some time in my home state, I'm aware of just how parochial my views could be. And correlation does not equal causation -- maybe it's a coincidence that countries with liberal democracies are the best places to live. However, in spite of these misgivings, I think Pinker makes a very good argument indeed."
260,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69508827-jeff-childers,5,Likely the most important book written in the last 50 years.
261,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100481557-skallagrimsen,0,"I never quite finished this massive tome, despite often finding it interesting and even exchanging emails with the author about a picayune error that I found in its pages. Its message is hopeful, and I hope it's true: despite the impression you might get from the news, human life in the 21st century is improving across a wide range of metrics of well-being. Globally, lifespans are increasing, diseases decreasing, education and literacy are more common, war and crime less frequent and less deadly. From the criticism of Pinker that I've read online, you'd think he was claiming that there is some mystical force moving through history nudging us in the direction of paradise; that our progress is inevitable and irreversible; that no-one anywhere has any cause to complain; and that we ought to just sit back contentedly on our laurels. The criticism is unfair and can be refuted by simply quoting the book. Pinker knows that plenty of people are still suffering as much as anyone has in history, and that there's much work yet to be done. He knows that any progress is fragile could be reversed. His point is to make more people cognizant of the progress that has occurred and to cultivate a greater appreciation of the reason (he believes) why: the spread of science, technology and the rational ideals of the Enlightenment. Still, I'm less optimistic than Steven Pinker. Even granting his data (which is disputed), the world is still filled with planet-annihilating weapons, with ethnic, nationalist, religious and economic animosities, with endless reserves of human ignorance, arrogance, malice, stupidity and greed. Any and all progress can be undone almost overnight. Technologies that can improve human life generally have the power to harm it, and can do so regardless of intent, in ways that cannot be predicted or controlled. If I live to be a very old man, I suspect it will be long enough to expose Pinker's thesis as disastrously naive. (I'd be happy to discover I was wrong. That's the one good thing about being a pessimist: surprises are pleasant things.)P.S. 4/5/20 Perhaps it's still too early in the Covid 19 crisis to say for sure, but millions of deaths, the collapse of the global economy, and the rise of new totalitarianisms doesn't seem improbable. The thesis of The Better Angels appears weaker than ever. I wish it wasn't so.5/30/20 Covid so far doesn't seem to have been nearly as deadly worldwide as the worst initial projections, even with social distancing, feared. The world appears to be on the verge of opening back up again, how wisely no-one can yet say. We'll find out, I suppose, if there's another outbreak, as some experts claim likely in the winter. It may be a long time before we eradicate or cure the disease, if ever. Covid is part of our world for at least our near future. Other pandemics will also emerge. On the geopolitical front, civil unrest across the U.S. over police brutality could be the prelude to a full scale civil war. We may be witnessing, or soon witness, a John Brown moment. The Communist Party of China meanwhile moves against the quasi-independence of Hong Kong. The party faces insurrection at the same moment that ties with the American government are extraordinarily strained. Trump talks about resuming nuclear testing. During an election year, with record setting unemployment. To me it looks like a powder keg.  Pinker's thesis seems even weaker now than in my last update. Stay tuned."
262,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070851-jakub,5,"Steven Pinker seems to have a habit of writing important books (previous topics: language, in general; human nature, in general, ""How The Mind Works"" for God's sake!), and though this is the first one I've actually read, I doubt it will be the last. Whereas other authors (Malcolm Gladwell especially) seem to be going after the Least Publishable Unit, Pinker wants to tackle the big questions, and provide them with big answers. Notice the plural there. This is not a book about a ""tipping point"" or the ""wisdom of crowds"", but about the trajectory and trends of the entirety of human history. What Pinker is arguing for goes against every popular media trope and man-on-the-street bit of common sense that we've accumulated over the past 100 years. These are the most peaceful times that we have ever lived in. The 20th Century was, despite what we've been told, probably the most peaceful century of human existence. There is less assault, rape and murder now than ever before in human history. To prove his point, Pinker uses findings from anthropology, psychology, politics, history, and economics, amongst other subjects. This is a big book that definitely needs to be big.This quickly leads me to the first tiring thing about this book, which is the 300-400 pages of graphs, and the concomitant discussion of data collection and statistical analysis. Getting through this was definitely a chore, and I know some people who never managed to get through it. But this is a necessary evil, I think, because many people certainly disagree with his thesis.  However, because it's so big, there were few detractions and criticisms that I could find in any review that weren't in some way pre-empted in the text. In fact, it seems like many reviewers' criticisms resulted from an incomplete reading, or an incomplete rememberance of what Pinker actually wrote. That being said, for a book with this wide a scope, there are some things that he glosses over, or mentions only in passing. Some of these are forgiveable, but others are not. For example, he argues weakly for the effectiveness and necessity of the rise of prison-culture in America, which now imprisons a greater percentage of its own population than any other country on Earth. As far as I know this has not been effective, and Pinker did not say anything to change my mind. An example of a more forgiveable flaw is that the book is centred largely on Europe and North America, though he explains that this is because much of the rest of the world had non-existent or spotty record keeping before the last couple hundred years, and I think this is an understandable excuse. It is definitely written from a point of view, as one review put it, it is ""more discursive than deductive"", but the point of view is backed up by literally hundreds of pages of footnotes and citations, so unless you disagree with entire fields of inquiry or schools of thought (reductionism, evolutionary psychology, liberal humanism), you're likely to find his argument persuasive.This is a very important book for anyone who is interested in warfare, history, culture, psychology or sociology. I think for many people it can, and will, fundamentally change the way they look at the world and the people they share it with. And is there really any more that you could ask for from a book?"
263,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77278659-neil-hunt,5,"This is really about three or four books in one - it’sa big read! The theme is that humans have civilized ourselves to dramatically lower levels of violence over the centuries.While our warmaking technologies have gotten much more deadly, and two of the most violent wars ever were in the last century, nevertheless the number, violence and duration has inexorably declined. Pinker cites lots of quantitative history to demonstrate this fact, and it reads well.In addition, violence between individuals, humans and animals, and even out groups, has demonstrably declined. The book was written before George Floyd, but I believe Pinker would make the case that the magnitude of the public response, world wide, is an illustration of how violence, when it happens, is less and less tolerated by the norms of society.Progress is not monotonic, but the trends are clear.Pinker brings in a lot of scientific ideas to explain and motivate these changes, from evolution to psychology, and is eager to see where these forces take the race in the future!"
264,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11752529-kiki,4,"Overall I have to recommend this book, despite the fact that it's heavy and full of horrific information. I recommend it because it's eye-opening. If you have any doubts that the world is a much, much, much more peaceful place than it has ever been (and most of us do, because that's the opposite of the picture presented in daily media) then just steep yourself for a while in this book and its statistics. They are Legion. They are also depressing. Except, of course, for the fact that the world is so incredibly much better than it used to be. That's hopeful. And so I recommend it. 	I would actually have given this book five stars, despite all its horrific-ness, if it weren't for the author's smug fundamentalism in his own belief system.	He's on a tear against all religions except his own, which is scientific materialism. In the midst of the enormous mounds of research he presents, showing that all the institutions of mankind have been horrifically violent throughout the vast majority of history, he picks out religions as somehow magically causative of violence while presenting the others as merely reflective of it. And he insists that this violence is somehow endemic to religious ideals, not perversions of them. But when addressing the fact that his own religion inspired the murder of twelve million people he claims that that was not at all the same thing -- the perversion of his belief system is fundamentally different from the perversion of others'.	He also goes out of his way to attribute negative cultural norms to religions, such as when he locates female circumcision as a Muslim practice rather than a cultural one which is deeply imbedded in a broad spectrum of sub-Saharan African cultures, regardless of religion. And as the cherry on top he demotes the Reverend Dr. King from a Christian to a vague secular do-gooder, claiming that this man who studied both religion and philosophy and then did great things must clearly have been motivated only by the philosophy because... well, he can't think of a reason, but he's going to assert it anyway because it makes him feel more comfortable in his worldview.	He also suffers from a peculiar cultural bigotry that refuses to consider the worldviews of others as sincere. The man is not stupid. When he lists, for example, the persecution of people who refused to worship the local deities or who practiced witchcraft as being irrational persecution of people committing ""crimes that have no victims"" he shows a willful blindness to recognize that members of those cultures honestly believed that an insult to the gods could bring disaster on the whole population or that evil magic actually existed and could be used to cause assault and murder. Whether the author agrees with these beliefs, or even whether they are ultimately true, is irrelevant to the question of whether the people in those cultures were convinced that they were and were acting rationally. 	This book is definitely problematic. But, overall, the facts which it brings to light and the implications they make about the history and future of mankind so greatly overshadow the author's personal weaknesses that the book is well worth reading."
265,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239063-john,5,"This book was really interesting, long, and full of many ideas. I’m not ready to give it a full review or rate it yet. I think I may need to read it again."
266,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9505272-nassir,3,"I gone through the “Better angel of our nature” by Steven Pinker; professor of psychology at Harvard university. The central thesis of the book is that we live in a less violent, less cruel and more peaceful era compared to the world that our ancestors lived in. Prof. Pinker recounts humanitarian revolutions, the long peace, the new peace and the democratic peace and their role in reducing violence. He stress that enlightenment, the rights movements, reasoning, civilizing process are the major modules which led to reduction of violence. The book with more than 850 pages may be difficult to digest for young non-Western readers, me included, but I still recommend it to my fellows. Cheers!Note: Unfortunately, I don’t have a PDF version of this book."
267,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1659159-edward,2,"Pinker in his preface makes his thesis very clear: ""This is a big book but it has to be. I have to convince you that violence really has gone down over the course of history, knowing that the very idea invites skepticism, incredulity, and sometimes anger. Our cognitive faculties predispose us to believe that we live in violent times, especially when they are stoked by media . . ."" But what about the 20th century and its wars that were responsible for the deaths of twenty million people? It's this kind of question that Pinker might say invites skepticism. He answers it by pointing out that in terms of overall population, the number of deaths from the wars of the last century are actually statistically small.  Violence of all sorts, according to Pinker, has in fact declined, whether it's societal, as in war, or individual, as in crimes of all sorts, not only in of assaults on individuals, particularly women and children, but in assaults on animals and lower forms of life. The causes are many and complex. Generally, they have to do the powerful forces of modernity - reason in the form of better education, and coexistent with that a greater emphasis on individual rights. Science and t technology play a huge role, making it clear that violence is disruptive, especially to economical development, a yardstick by which modern industrial societies measure themselves. Geographical mobility is important as individuals are no longer constrained by irrational village and tribal customs. Pinker goes to great lengths to discuss any number of subtopics that in one way or another stem from Thomas Hobbes' theories about why humans ae violent. At the heart of them is always something that has to do with what humans hope gain from violence, rational or irrational Some of the topics that Pinker discusses that stood out for me were religion, notions of morality, self-control, revenge, honor, cruelty,authority, the list goes on and on, and concludes, finally, by Pinker stating, ""I hope that the numbers I have marshaled have lifted your assessment of the state of the world from the lugubrious conventional wisdom [that violence int he world has gotten worse]. Okay, Pinker convinced me, but reading this book was like being choked to death by a python. Pinker backs up his points with endless graphs, statistics, summaries of behavioral experiments - to the point of tedium and these are what squeezed the life out of this reader. While I didn't disagree with much of what he had to say, it was mind-numbing reading. I gave up and did something I seldom do, just skim-read and relied on summary statements at the end of chapters.  "
268,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12276922-jaana-pipke,4,"Many profound insights. Only took me two years 😬 But seriously, an important, if at times dense, book. Sort of like a Guns, Germs and Steel but more of an irreverent (less textbook-like) tone. The breadth of data is pretty mind blowing and he makes a compelling argument. His definition of violence may be a bit narrow, and some parts have not aged well (even in just 9 years!) He comes across as a bit pompous at times, but I do feel like I learned a lot and found many of the anecdotes, quotes, studies referenced as good springboards for further investigation. "
269,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/705887-broodingferret,4,"Once again Pinker has produced another great book (though I think ""tome"" has the cadence to better convey the work's sheer size). Exhaustively researched and cogently presented, Pinker makes a convincing argument for the decline of violence in the world over the past few centuries. As with his other books, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined reveals Pinker to be one of the modern day's great thinkers and polymaths, as he demonstrates a greater-than-passing familiarity with disciplines as diverse as history, philosophy, neuroscience, psychology, and literature. Starting with a brief tour of the history of human cruelty, Pinker then dives first into the sociohistorical events that he views played the largest parts in pacifying (and continue to pacify) our species. He then follows up with a wonderfully thorough treatment of human psychology and neuroscience, illuminating clearly and point-by-point how our own wiring and heuristics can influence us towards the path of angel or demon, depending on the context. Pinker wraps up his work with a concise summary of how he views that his previously enumerated sociohistorical trends have been playing the right way to the right parts of our brains, helping to gear us away from the senseless brutality of our past.Pinker's recognition of the fact that the overall decline of violence in the world is likely due to multiple factors is refreshing, given that most who have tried to tackle the subject attempt to explain our historical pacifying trend as the result of only one or two causes. Pinker brings up many of these alternate views, describes their reasoning in detail, and then meticulously explains why he doesn't see them working (in particular, he does a wonderful job of deconstructing the idea that legalized abortions lowered violence in the U.S., which was first popularized by Levitt and Dubner in Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything). Pinker also doesn't shy away from saying he doesn't have all the answers to all the details of violence's decline, though in such cases he still puts forth numerous hypotheses. An excellent book for anyone to read."
270,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16616412-nandita-damaraju,5,"I don't think any review I write will do justice to the book, so I'm not going to attempt it. The book covered a wide range of topics (really really really wide) to make a VERY eloquent case for why violence has declined. Because of the breadth of topics, I would encourage everyone to read this book even if you're not particularly interested in the decline of violence. "
271,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26201058-mbybee,2,"Let me save you a huge amount of condescension and repetition:Mr Pinker is a sort of neo-Hobbesian whose entire argument hinges on 2 concepts:1) Per-capita/percentage (he frequently alternates between percentage and percapita) death is markedly less under a 'leviathan' model where a centralized State controls the absolute authority to mete out punishments.2) Any exceptions to this rule are to be elaborately explained away, but essentially comes down to claiming individuals or groups involved are somehow 'stateless'.I happen to largely agree with point 1, yet still can't stand the methods and tap-dancing he uses to arrive at it.Onto the book itself:Steven Pinker wanders from point to point like a drunken squirrel. He believes that the plural of 'anecdote' is 'data', and that using wildly inaccurate statistical samples and methods is perfectly fine as long as they support his underlying world view. He cherry-picks quotes, data, and models, and fails to apply basic scientific methods to the data. Instead, he applies confirmation bias to it.The writing is condescending, dull, full of wandering and side-tracking and virtually guaranteed to offend as many people as possible - even people like me who actually *agree* with most of his point.Hiding casual ethnocentrism like his claim that England is the source of all modern civilization behind vague anecdotes and stories (then excusing away the Scottish, Irish, and Welsh, British Imperialism, and anything that might inconveniently disprove his assertion) all the while ignoring entirely the Scandinavians, all of Asia, and even the Middle East is just plain foolish.I find it amusing at best that he uses the *bible* as his source for 'ancient barbarism', somehow deciding that works of fiction are a reliable source for a society. By that same yardstick, Greeks and Romans would have engaged in massive amounts of incest (since their mythology has so much of it), and modern Westerners would be the most violent vigilante culture in history (since our videogames, books, and films revolve largely around one or two people killing scores in some form of 'against the system' narrative)Just avoid this pile of pulp. He may claim to be a 'Cognitive Scientist', but he seems to have long since fallen into the trap of soft science - ""if you can't dazzle them with data, baffle them with bullshit""."
272,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5669954-taras,4,"Good:Pinker is an extremely engaging author. He has an amazing talent for finding interesting quotes and facts. Pinker's linguistic background surfaces in random explanations of origins of words such as rape, dandelion, etc. His language is casual and non-uptight, there is no pussyfooting around taboo subjects such as religion. In this book he has a lot of fun at the expense of: circumcision, old testament, ""anthropologists of peace"", chivalry, American south, small government proponents, German military, intellectual property, Ukrainians, Jeremy Rifkin, Russian peasants, American presidents, vegetarians.This may be the funniest serious book I've read, but if you feel strongly about superiority of your culture or religion, you may not like this book.The first part of the book is spent discussing various macro-level subjects: conflicts, casualty figures, influence/evolution of social norms and how it all points at the world becoming less violent. This is all very engaging and convincing. If the book ended 2/3rds of the way through, I would rate it 5/5.Bad:After building up my expectations with interesting historical figures, funny quotes, etc Pinker unexpectedly[1] dives into micro [individual] level violence. This part feels like pop-science. It consists of a lot of neuroscience, evolutionary biology, psychology and other soft ""sciences"". Nothing makes me sadder than suffering through someone drawing conclusions on human behavior based on the poorly understood structure of our brains. It gets worse, Pinker then embarks on business-book/self-help style advice on how we can control human vices. The last 3rd of the book essentially lived up to my worst expectations for this book. Pinker tries to balance out wishy-washy science by beating up on some of the worst examples of neuroscience-gone-wrong, but that still does not excuse the literary crime committed.Conclusion:The first part of the book is amazing and outweighs the kick in the balls that is the last 3rd of the book. Negatives aside, this is the most intellectually stimulating, yet approachable book I've read.[1] After writing this I learned that Pinker is a 'Cognitive Science' bigwig. "
273,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17107877-justin-covey,5,"While I was reading in a park in Sarajevo a little kid tried to steal my Kindle. Being 6'3"" I caught up to him in just a few steps, he quickly handed it back, and we went our separate ways. There was absolutely no violence in this little incident and the thought of perpetrating any didn't even cross my mind. In fact, I would have been appalled if anyone had suggested I should have. But why not? Anyone with a knowledge of history, or who has ever read a Dickens novel, will know that until recent times someone in my shoes would have almost certainly employed violence without a second thought. The natural question is, what changed?Coincidentally, when my kindle was snatched I had been reading a book that tries to explain exactly that. Steven Pinker offers four reasons why the violent option didn't even occur to me:1) I grew up in an effective government which punishes all but the most necessary violence, and furthermore, a good enough government that I respected and thus internalized its mantra of self control.2) I grew up without any rigid system of manly honor/dominance where minor slights are grounds for violent retribution.3) I grew up in a society committed to free communication of stories and ideas, which have taught me how to take another persons perspective and therefore taught me to sympathize with a kid trying to profit off an over-rich foreigner. 4) I grew up learning to practice calculated reason in all things, which not only tells me there is nothing to be gained in such violence but that everyone deserves the same rights to fairness and justice, and striking a child is neither fair nor just.(The fifth reason Steven Pinker gives for the reason violence has declined in the world, that commerce between states allows for peace to be more profitable than even successful war, didn't really apply to this situation.)I find these reasons, and the book entire, convincing. This is an indispensable book to better understand the age we live in now, and even people in general."
274,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12458184-trish,2,"I've been listening to this book since February. It is painful-- partially because the torture section is graphic and mostly because pinker is tedious. My goal is to finish the first CD--it's like 8 hours long--and abandon it. Great title, interesting thesis--too damn long. "
275,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301768-judith,4,"This is a very intelligent, well-documented new book which claims that we are living in the most peaceful, least violent time in our species' existence. It is truly the ultimate ""glass half-full"" book. I guarantee you will be challenged when you bring up this topic of conversation anywhere you go. But Pinker has all the documentation, charts, graphs, studies, and evidence you could need to prove that statistically speaking,this is truly the ""best of times"". And it is important to know this because every time violence erupts there are those nay-sayers who shake their heads and long for the ""good old days"" and pity the poor children growing up in this era. So it is good to have evidence to the contrary. My only problem with this book is that I couldn't read the whole thing because in making his case, the author reviews the violent history of the world and I got to a point where I just couldn't bear to hear one more crime against humanity. For example, we all know that ancient Romans in their glory days used to feed Christians to the lions for entertainment. But did you ever know that they used to act out myths and stories in the coliseum using slaves to act out the parts of the doomed? One such story involved chaining a live slave to a rock and having a trained bird fly out and eat the liver out of him like the story of Prometheus. I also learned the the word ""genocide"" was not even in use until around 1944 when it came into play to describe Hitler's plans. The reason it wasn't used was that warring nations frequently attempted to demolish whole societies or groups of people, and since that was the point of wars there was no crime. So, I fast-forwarded to the chapters on conclusions and was able to gather enough information to feel like I got the gist of the book. I realize that's not the ideal way to read any book, but I am glad to have read it at all. "
276,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26224194-jim-knight,4,"I found this book to be very enlightening. It's the kind of book that tends to stay with you and gives you some insight into the history of ""un-civilization"".Our lives are very short and it leaves us feeling like today is the same as tomorrow which was the same as yesterday. When you read a book like this, you come away realizing that we are living in a bubble of current time and place. The point of the book is in a nutshell that over time, humanity has gotten better and less violent. And it does so very well primarily by engulfing the reader as to how bad things really used to be. Going back to biblical times reveals a people who view barbarism as par for the day and genocide as a good way of dealing with enemies. War with swords was a pretty horrible way to fight and just as deadly as mortars. Over time we graduated to having more technology and we used it to torture people and enslave them more efficiently.As a parent, you often hear that back in the day kids could run around town and be safe from predators. But statistically, children are very unlikely to be kidnapped by strangers. Of course it happens and when it does we have the technology to beam it all over the place. But it isn't as often as you think.The book makes a point that there are still horrifying acts committed by humans - no one can plausibly deny that. However, it makes the point that we see them as horrifying acts. The biggest difference I noticed in the book was that our empathy has increased and we know have a more honed conscience when it comes to acts of violence. We don't tolerate what we used to.It's not perfect but it's hard not to read a book like this and feel more optimistic about the future, not less. Over time, it does seem like humans can become better toward one another and it's nice to have a book like this to at least have a historical and data driven reason to believe so.PS - It's way too long. Needs an editor."
277,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27493200-joel-murray,5,"This is an amazing read. It goes through violence throughout history, how it has declined and it's likely causes. Despite what we're hearing through the news and what feels right, there is very strong evidence that violence is decreasing at a very significant rate and the world is becoming a safer place. The latter third of the book goes into some of the psychological explanations behind this and people's desires to do bad and good things.It is a big book and it took me a few months to get through, but it's understandable as the topic is a big one. His writing style is very conversational and, on the whole, easy to read. There were very few moments that dragged. For a non-fiction book, it was quite a page-turner.There is some criticism of Pinker's work. One issue is that it is largely western-focused, which it is, but this is what we have good evidence for so you can't blame him for reporting on it. The other criticisms seem to be regarding the potential inaccuracy of historical data. I don't think anyone doubts that the further back you go, the bigger the errors are, but this is acknowledged and the evidence still seems to support Pinker's conclusions. It seems like the main reason for criticism is that some people (for some unknown reason) just don't like the conclusion.It's really heartening to see that we, as a human race, are learning and constantly improving on the past. War, violence and suffering is becoming more abhorrent and we're more inclusive of people different to us and further away from us. Each data point is a tragedy on its own and we still have a long way to go, but it is good to know that trends are generally heading in the right direction. It is a reminder for anyone who is nostalgic about the past to really consider what they think it was like. There is no ""golden age"" to revert back to. It's also a reminder to question what ""seems right"" and to look at what the data say."

When listening, if the discussion gets beyond me I can just keep on doing what I am doing until it comes back to my level. And it always did before long. So, ok, it went over my head at times, and the audio version does not come with the charts and tables, but these are minor and not even annoying. The fact is that it kept me coming back because I always knew there was more that I would find interesting, that would make me glad I stuck with it. There was always another moment when I'd say to myself, yes, this is worth coming back to.The narration is perfect. I could believe it was the author speaking to me. Without sounding like a Harvard professor, he sounded like someone I can like. It would be all scholarly-like for a while and then I’d hear a quote from Bruce Springsteen, Woody Allen or my personal Woodstock favorites, Country Joe and the Fish. There were also plenty of references to current pop culture but I just don’t remember them as much as those from my boomer culture.I don’t think I would have appreciated this book in my twenties but after many discussions and disagreements over the question of where our society is headed, are we getting better or worse, I love that steven Pinker has done the work for me. Because I have always believed it in my heart, I accept his research as the confirmation.  I am considering buying a print or ebook version to reread sections that were particularly enlightening. There is no table of contents in the audio version so I used an ebook preview to see how the book is organized and I find it is quite perfect, very descriptive so that I can find my way back easily enough. A very satisfying experience, it will not be my last from Steven Pinker."
279,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078550-robert-bor,5,"This could well be the most important book of the last decade. The author explains clearly that violence has decreased in our day and age, contrary to popular opinion. He then goes on to eviscerate the arguments against this view and proposes a number of reasons why this might be so.He comes up with five:* the force of the Leviathan and how it disincentivizes violent behaviour for gain* gentle commerce, and its role in seeing others not as potential victims to be robbed, but trade partners instead, making the peaceful option have a better payoff* increasing feminization of a society, reducing the urge for honor and glory, and making the pursuit of this strategy have less payoff* an expanding circle of sympathy, beyond ones one tribe, family, country, letting others be viewed as humans, partners instead of dehumanized targets for aggression* the rise of reason and how reason favors a fair, humanist and non-violent approach to mattersThe author uses the concept of the Prisoner's Dilemma to construct a variant, called the Pacifist' Dilemma. In his variant, he shows how previously (without the afore-mentioned 5 factors) aggression would trump pacifism as a strategy. He then creates an adjusted matrix, with adjusted payoffs, accounting individually for each of the five factors. This is his coup de grace to demonstrate abstract concepts into tangible payoff considerations for a potential aggressor.Besides the excellent presentation of his evidence and the construction of his case, one cannot help but see that mr Pinker has his heart in the right place and deeply cares about the human condition. A heart-warming book that made me realize we are not doing so bad, despite the best efforts of our media to make us believe the opposite."
280,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19264794-dimitris,5,"After finishing this book, I can share in the gratitude that Pinker expresses in the final chapter and even dare to indulge in some optimism that he, most wisely, explains that he tries to refrain from (per scientific correctness, not because I for one cannot feel that there are reasonable causes to be optimistic).And it is a gratitude for the people and their ideas and even chance that has so made it that we live in what, I am now convinced, is the best of times as far as violence is concerned. Pinker arguments following a scientifically honest course of trying to analyse the plausibility as well as the validity of primary hypotheses so that he can have a better chance of explaining situations in their appropriate statistical magnitude. He approaches the grail of causality in each case efficiently, carefully presenting data, and providing valid observations and references that present different points of view. The language is exquisitely refined, proof of his mastery, and makes for comfortable reading that helps one focus on complex ideas and arguments than trying to decipher what the writer says.This is a must for every person interested in crucial philosophical arguments as well everyone with the patience for a long book (Pinker himself tries to explain the reasons for the length and I thought he was right).The scope is vast and many pleasant surprises (unknown unknowns and unknown knowns) made this a purifying, pacifying, stimulating experience. And it was at the same a ton of fun! This is a fantastic book I enjoyed so deeply that I wish the experience upon others who have yet to read it. I 'm quite confident many who have read it would agree. Recommended with hands, feet, fingers, toes and all!"
281,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,2,"Steven Pinker is known for his wide-ranging advocacy of evolutionary psychology and, as the expression goes, “when you’re a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined (TBAoON) purports to show just that. That over the ages of human history, violence has declined. Pinker is an acknowledged authority on such subjects as language and cognition. TBAoON is not a book on any of that. Pinker stretches his argument over 800 pages with research data, graphs and tabulations. Unfortunately, what he suggests is at best, open to interpretation. Statistics are like that. As is often done, the author uses a highly selective interpretation of data. He appears to select what supports his hypothesis and disregards the rest. Further, while there might be more evidence to support it, he does not present it and his extrapolations seem to be weak at best. Statistical sample sizes seem at times to be small and Pinker makes no apologies for this and fails to proffer its limitations. In fact, we are even sometimes asked to ignore some of the data. Ahhh, me thinks not.A tome this size perhaps warrants more of a review however, when the scientific method is totally mangled and evidence-based science is completely ignored, it’s probably time to stop reading let alone spend the time reviewing a book like this. I thoroughly enjoyed The Blank Slate. It was my introduction to Steven Pinker. I thought that I could not wait to read more by this author. I should have become suspicious about one who writes on subjects seemingly light years removed from his field of expertise. However, I took a chance and unfortunately, I was disappointed. "

From regional skirmishes, wars and your neighbor sticking a knife in her husband’s eye, our world seems drenched in mayhem. However, your neighbor’s sudden loss of depth perception aside, Stephen Pinker contends we live in a historically pacific age.Taken from a historic perspective your chances of meeting a violent death is up to 30 times less than previously. In days of yore small city states would go to war and the best way of settlement an argument was by hitting your opponent with a rock. Even when taking into consideration cataclysmic events, like when Germans begin poking about for lebensraum, centralized governments that can keep peace within larger borders result in a safer and happier world.Consider when Mongols were rampaging and the various internal Chinese conflicts going back 800 years. As a percentage of world population these conflicts were much worse that World War II – and this was done with just people with pointy sticks making holes in people.On a much smaller level, individuals in civilized societies are more peaceable. My gosh, you can’t even spank children any more – even when the little bugger is really asking for it. We tend to treat others more civilly and law and order generally prevail.So keep an optimistic thought and be grateful that a Mongol is not bashing in your front door, putting an arrow in your forehead and looking with uncomfortable favor toward your significant other.Well researched and readable.

But the subtitle is WHY violence has declined, so the rest of the book is, presumably, a detailed account of all the myriad changes that various societies underwent over the course of history. For sure there are good points made, but they are embedded in a never-ending stream of statistics and references to scholarly articles, which makes this more of a reference text than anything.It could easily be condensed to about a third of the size for the casual reader; as it is it's not worth the time investment."
284,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2256347-robert,4,"Pinker's message is compelling: the world is a safer, less violent place, and our attitudes as well as our actions have shifted. He is less than compelling when he rails against organized religion, occasionally twisting things just a bit to fit his bias, while seeming to have a blind spot when it comes to the identical behavior done by governments. This is, I believe, because he sees governments as an essential civilizing force, justifying the excesses they passed through. Since he fails to see such a vital role for religion -- and possibly holds some level of personal animosity for religiosity -- he forgives none of their excesses. I prefer the explanation that religion, like democratic forms of government, starts out with noble aims that are always at risk of corruption and the hands of those who hold power. The other main complaints I have with this book is it's exhaustive length -- 800+ pages. However, its length is also its strength – I’ve always believed in progress, and this book buttresses and fortifies that belief in this dimension so securely that it is hard to imagine changing it.As an aside, it is odd to read how many “progressives” are such skeptics of progress. It makes one wonder about the traditional labels “liberal” and “conservative” – aren’t conservatives supposed to be always looking backwards to an older and better era? It seems that if you look far enough back, to the cultures of indigenous peoples, than you cease being a conservative at all, I suppose since those values were preserved and thus can’t be conserved. "
285,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27886539-derrick,5,"My one question going into the book was, “What makes people violent?” “Why do some people just want to fight?” Two questions I guess. I’ve been asking those questions since first seeing a bloody bar brawl. It seemed so stupid to me. I don’t think I’m above it in any way. I’m just a coward, I don’t like confrontation, even when drunk. So what makes some people want to fight, murder, rape, pillage, or carry out genocide? Pinker answers these questions thoroughly enough. My theory that American men in southern States are more violent because their balls are always sticking to their legs, was not confirmed.I learned some interesting things and failed to learn some uninteresting things. When Pinker talks brain hardware for instance, I’m lost. I’m just not smart enough to understand everything he’s writing about. Fortunately, much of the book covers history and the evolution of law, economy, science, humanity, and reason to make us a less violent species. Encouragingly, every section of the book manages to confirm that the human species is becoming less violent. Good news for wimps like me. I wouldn’t have seen my second birthday had I been born more than 100 years ago. This is a good book. It’s another confirmation that things are getting better. We’ve had a few hiccups like WW1 and 2, but overall the trend is towards a safer and more intelligent society. Even violent groups like ISIS tend to be their own worst enemies and I’m convinced they won’t last. The vast majority of the world is more reasonable than they are; reason will win. Good book."
286,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"Original review in 2015:This is one of the longest books I've read so far (800 pages, 36 hours as audiobook), but I will try to convince you it was worth it. For some people knowing that the author is Steven Pinker is enough, but for the rest of you, read on.The main thesis of the book is that violence has decreased in the World. In fact it has been decreasing for hundrends and thousands of years. Does this sound outrageous in light of the daily news reports on wars, terrorism and other forms of violence?Well, Pinker didn't just waste these 800 pages on nothing. He cites numerous statistics and studies on a vast variety of topics to demonstrate that violence has truly been declining for millennias. He then investigates what has caused this trend with similar deep resesrch based on studies and statistics. This book will probably convince you that we're very lucky to live in this relatively peaceful era which the author calls The New Peace.Pinker presents all of that in a wonderful, easy to understand style that will keep the reader turning one page after the other. Recommended.New comment on 30 August 2016:I think the findings are correct for the known recorded history, however it is speculative for much of human history which we only little of. I remember Chomsky once said that the book was inaccurate for 95% of human history (190 thousand out of 200 thousand years). Also some have criticized it for using percentages rather than raw numbers for deaths. Nevertheless, it is a great book."
287,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12682721-benjamin-pennington,5,"I'm giving this book 5 stars because I learned a hell of a lot from it. I haven't cross referenced everything or checked all the facts or plunged into the bibliography and checked sources, but I found it quite persuasive and well argued. There were some spots that seemed a little shaky fact wise, but the overall picture of a less violent world made sense to me. I can see people who are far left/marxist/etc. not liking this book just because of what he is arguing. That being said, it isn't a right wing book at all either. I would recommend simply for the amount you can learn from it, the bibliography, and facing the argument that the world is less violent now than it was before and challenging your belief if you see it otherwise. I think if you are personally invested in the idea that the world is very unjust, which it is, you will hate the fact that he is arguing that it is less violent than it has ever been, because you have so much personal investment in that viewpoint and you feel that saying it is less violent minimizes that atrocities that do still take place, which isn't what the author is doing. Rather he is just painting of picture of what has caused violence to decrease and therefore use this knowledge to further decrease it in the future and continue down that path. He could be wrong, but I hope he isn't and hopefully we can continue this downward trend. "
288,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7842903-lane,5,"Few books truly qualify as ""must-read"", but the evidence Pinker marshals for the historical decline in violence is so massive that it simply must be seen by a serious student of history, society or psychology. Pinker begins with the obvious culprits of war, genocide and murder, but persuasively links these declines with equally striking declines in things like spanking, rape and animal cruelty. Perhaps most interestingly for Pinker's career, he is an ""innatist"", believing that the human being has many permanently imprinted bits of human nature that make us the way we are. So this book is a departure from books like his ""Blank Slate"", since he's arguing here that our human nature can be slowly steered towards historical -- and in this case, very benign -- change in how it manifests in the world. His evidence may be overwhelming, but Pinker's explanations of cause will cause controversy. He is basically a Hobbesian, saying that the growth in powerful states (for example) was one of the key factors in the decline in violence. Those who think that states and governments are the source of all bad things will naturally disagree. But Pinker is persuasive, and as always the writing is gentlemanly and elegant. One of the best books I've read in years. I should mention that Pinker and I are friendly acquaintances, but I'm not praising ""Angels"" because we're friendly. We've gotten to know each other because our interests overlap."
289,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"There are some serious points to make about the content of this book:1. The validity of the author's analyses is at best doubtful. As he mentions himself, there's not much reliable data on violence before we (read: Western countries) started to measure this phenomenon. This leads me to conclude that a serious portion of his data is a best guess, itself based on the best guesses of historians (for the years before the 20th century) and of social scientists (for the 20th century onwards).2. Long term trends - even based on fully accurate and reliable data - are very hard to detect and even more difficult to predict. This means that any model or conclusion based on these trends is a (serious) simplification of reality. This is a major issue in ecnonomics, but pops up in these sorts of studies as well. 3. Both aforementioned points lead to the conclusion that the message of this book has to be taken with a grain of salt.4. At times, the author doesn't shy away of letting the reader know his political convictions. It makes the reader wonder about the objectivity of the author, which is unnecessary in my opinion.But apart from these points, it is an exhaustive book, covering a huge amount of time and space and it brings a positive message, written in an attractive and easy-to-follow style. Nowadays it is easy to get carried away in the biased news broadcasts and social media moments, so this was definitely a refreshing read."
290,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7507435-marie-phd,3,"I have heard excellent reviews about this book.Not normally a fan of Pinkers, I have read some of his brain stuff and wasn't really impressed but I was prepared to read this cos I was curious to see what he has to say on violence.The big problem with this book is that its written like a PhD dissertation and as such it is repetitive. Constantly repeating assumption, evidence for the assumption, restating the theory & demonstrating how the theory works with the data or evidence. Hence it is excruciatingly long and somewhat tedious. Why he does this is because he believes we're gonna laugh at him for stating that us humans are becoming less violent. So he is demonstrates how our society is becoming less violent in various aspects, such as our penal code, our treatment of children, women, animals, war... in religion and the catalyst for the change. And I think he is right. But when I have discussed this with people, they refused to believe it was true so perhaps Pinker was right to bore nonbelievers into submission. I kind of think I know how he thinks we have achieved it but he is hinting at the method and I would like to know how he thinks it was achieved. Anyway why we have achieved it served as the big reveal but it got weighted down under so much material that the message got lost under the premise. "
291,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2044073-john-schwabacher,5,"This book is a long challenging read, but definitely worth the effort.He traces violence throughout human history (and prehistory!) and demonstrates convincingly that the present day is less violent than it ever has been. Murder, genocide, war, torture, cruelty to animals: all are at the lowest level ever.Pinker is a rigorous scientist. Read this book and you'll be less satisfied with the fuzzy minded handwaving offered by other writers. He'll give an argument that seems reasonable, then points out that it's not conclusive, and offers more evidence, then points out any problems that remain.Readers of The Righteous Mind will be interested to know that he discusses Jonathan Haidt's moral classification scheme, along with related ones.Steven Pinker's writing is very clear, even playful. This is the second of his books I've read and I will certainly be reading more.I should probably try to summarize some of the major points, but wanted to get this out right now. If you want more, remind me to flesh this out."
292,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8433803-jason-modisette,3,"The first half of the book, in which Pinker tries to prove THAT violence has declined, is very well put-together. That violence has declined is somewhat surprising and opposes the implicit world-view of almost all of the media, so it's important to document it thoroughly. Pinker does so.Then he gets into WHY it has declined. I found this part of the book much less satisfying; fewer statistics, and parts of it feel like he has a bunch of cool factoids he wants to jam in regardless of their relevance to his arguments. Many of them were indeed cool and were news to me, but some of the pieces that I know a little bit about (specifically, the game theory parts) were very cursory overviews that overstated the certainty that the results of these very simplified problems were applicable to the real world. This made me doubt that entire part of the book.One thing I can say in Pinker's favor about the ""why"" part: since this book came out, it's been in the news that the surge of violence in the 60s through the 80s was highly correlated with leaded gasoline use, 20-year-time-lagged (presumably because the resultant large amounts of environmental lead caused brain damage in children that led them to be more violent adults.) At the time of writing, this wasn't known, and Pinker both pointed out this surge and didn't claim to have a good explanation for it."
293,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20608652-oakley-merideth,2,"I think it's best to just let David Bentley Hart share some thoughts here:""In his latest book, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, he devotes over seven hundred pages to arguing the case that modernity, contrary to the common impression, has seen a steep decrease in every kind of violence—domestic, political, criminal, and martial—as a result of a variety of causes, but principally because of the triumph of “Enlightenment” ideas. It is a simple narrative, and at many points a painfully simplistic one, but it is clear and bracing and merits sympathetic consideration.Whether Pinker himself does the tale justice, however, is debatable. He is definitely not an adept historian; his view of the past—particularly of the Middle Ages, which he tends to treat as a single historical, geographical, and cultural moment—is often not merely crude, but almost cartoonish (of course, he is a professed admirer of Norbert Elias). He even adduces two edited images from Das Mittelalterliche Hausbuch as illustrations of “the everyday texture of life in medieval Europe,” without noting that they come from a set of astrological allegories about planetary influences, from which he has chosen those for Saturn and Mars rather than, say, Venus and Jupiter. (Think what a collection of Saturnine or Martial pictures he might have gathered from more recent history.)"""
294,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54064697-nikhil,4,"In this veritable tome, Pinker presents the argument that over the last millennium, multiple dimensions of the human experience have been trending toward a less violent state. To do this, he takes us on a rich journey through the historical record, demographic and cultural trends, punctuated by well-qualified statistics and inferences from a variety of sources. Pinker draws on theories and examples from fields as diverse as anthropology, evolutionary and social psychology, neuroanatomy, cognitive science, and behavioral and rational economics to build a case that there are knowable signals and milestones which indicate when a given society is disposed to lower or higher levels of violence, including violence towards other states, its own citizens, and marginalized classes. There are a few areas which were difficult to get through, such as Pinker's graphic depictions of medieval torture, cruelty to animals, and child abuse, and if there's any legitimate knock against this work, it's the sheer amount of theory, data, and argumentation brought to bear on this topic. But it's hard to imagine the conclusion making as much of a dent in the conventional wisdom without it all. All in all, ""The Better Angels of Our Nature"" is a worthy effort that strives to combat the doomsday pessimism that pervades modern sociopolitical discourse."
295,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5266981-smund,4,"In this book Steven Pinker somehow surprisingly argues that the world is getting better and better - at least when it comes to the declining rate of violence in the world. At the beginning of the book I was rather skeptic, but after some pages I realized that this is a book based on evidence and real science. And yes, I am convinced. Generally the relative rate of violence in the world is declining. Actually I was convinced after just 3-400 pages. The book is more than 800 pages, and the last 400 pages was not needed for me to believe the authors claim. Nevertheless it was indeed interesting to read.Specially I found the parts describing the rights revolutions, and how the society has developed its views on what is regarded to be unfair and cruel to be interesting. It has been big changes just the last 50 years in most developed countries.The book is big, fact based and impressing. However, it is also a bit too long sometimes and tend to be a bit boring at the end. But this is just a detail in the big picture. Because the thing about this book is that it makes you believe in the good of humanity and that the world is going in the right direction. Reading it made me think positive about our shared future!I hope it will have this impact on you too."
296,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2882673-john-vibber,4,"The 24 hour news cycle serves a stream of blood and chaos that shapes our view of violence. It makes us resistant to the suggestion that past human history could have been far worse. What if you could find a well-documented source of information that shows a historical progression toward a less violent world. Could it really be that our increasingly populated, frantically busy modern world is an improvement over times past in the harm that humans do to other humans.Stephen Pinker’s book argues all of the above. The data he sites is vast and persuasive. It shows how rates of murder, slavery, animal cruelty, torture, and other behavior we now consider grossly perverse plummeted over a dozen decades under the influence of the Enlightenment, literacy, and republican governance. Better yet, he documents how in a few more recent decades the definition of human rights rapidly spread to include women, blacks, gays, and even animals. And his analysis of wars past and present is just and radical and interesting.While this is a bit of a tome with lots of graphs and theories, it will be highly informative for the patient reader who would like proof that the world is a bit better than he or she thinks it is."
297,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30222559-kirk-macleod,4,"Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of our Nature: Why Violence has declined is a really good example of why I try to read non-fiction on a regular basis. The thesis of the book is simply that as a species, humans are less violent now than we were in the past, regardless of what the news, politicians, or anyone else says.The book, although a little dry and hovering at just over 700 pages, works to prove that historically, we had a much higher tolerance for violence than we do now, and that if you take into account the percentage of an effected population rather than the simple number of people killed, people are killing each other a lot less now than they did in the past.This doesn't mean that no one is killing anyone else, or that all violence is going to disappear sometime soon, it simply means that on a societal level, we aren't being as violent as we used to be.The book is definitely one that opens up conversation, and the reviews all seem to either love it or hate it, but for me it was an interesting look at our history of violence towards each other, with an optimistic look to the future (Pinker does not suggest a perfect future, but a much more tolerant one).A Fascinating Read."
298,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16227449-jason-keisling,5,"Popular opinion suggests that we live in dangerous times. People of all ideologies believe that the world is more dangerous than ever and media is constantly consumed with fears about terrorism, shootings, child danger and kidnapping, rape, abuse, murder, etc. Yet all categories of violence are on the decline and have been for a long time. That's not to say that we should ignore any current violence or downplay atrocities, but Pinker provides a great grain of salt to put the world in perspective.This book challenged me in many ways. It makes a counter-intuitive case that the world is the safest it has ever been and has been improving in just about every metric. It's also a very long and dense book, which takes a lot of commitment to finish. This is a book that I think is worth reading twice, though due to the commitment of 800 pages, i doubt I'll be re-reading it anytime soon. If the length is intimidating, I highly suggest that you at the very least skim the book to see the graphs and trends for various types of violence and perhaps read some of his articles online or watch his lectures on YouTube. There's much to be optimistic about in the world. There's plenty of atrocities in the world to focus on but overall we live in wonderful times."
299,0143122010,http://goodreads.com/user/show/702622-joshua,5,"In order to talk about the history and present of violence, this book had to cover a lot of other ground digging into the mysteries of humanity itself. Why do we do bad things? What is bad, and how do we decide what good and bad is? What are these forces inside us, why did they get there, and how are they being composed over time to make these (measured and measured and measured) effects?I found each of these building blocks to be as interesting as the thesis as a whole. Over the few weeks I read the book I kept saying to my wife ""so I was reading the violence book, and did you know...""It is a large, large book. I felt like I'd been reading for quite a while (on a kindle app, which made it hard to appreciate the book's heft up front) and was a little shocked to see I was less than 5% through. But, it was worth it. I particularly appreciated the jokes and humor sprinkled throughout, which nicely leavened what could easily have been a dense loaf of facts and findings.Recommended for anyone curious how our world and cultures actually work, or anyone looking for some relief from the relentless ""hell in a handbasket"" messages we're fed by media/religious leaders/government."
