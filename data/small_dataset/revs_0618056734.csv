0,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69589444-jen,4,"Have you ever, while sheltering in space-time under threat of a belligerent snippet of information enclosed in a flimsy lipid membrane, sat on your porch during the rain and tried to derive from first principles how it is that a rainbow forms? Trying to discard all the things you’ve learned about droplets of moisture and the refractive index of light? Imagining how you’d interpret the phenomenon from a position of scientific ignorance? For me, this brought to mind two things. First, that Keats should’ve had his testicles artfully tied into a balloon animal and smacked across the forehead so hard that his shoelaces exploded. Second, this conversation that I had recently with a friend who was thinking about attending a large social gathering.Me: Don’t do it.Them: I feel like everything will be okay.Me: Well, I’m glad you FEEL like everything will be okay. That’s little consolation for those of us who choose to engage with reality. Facts don’t care about your feelings.Them: Actually...Me: Oh god...Them: You’re proceeding off the assumption that facts exist as free floating rationales, independent of human minds, and that we are creatures primarily motivated by reason. When, in fact, research indicates just the opposite. So, in a very real sense, facts do care about my feelings, and if they can’t cohabitate then guess what gets jettisoned?Me: Alright, wiseass. You agree that reasoning backwards is not good. So this is another one of those pointless exercises you’re so fond of.Them: But the data has been politicized. If you think those numbers are inerrant, then I have a bridge to sell you. And, listen, it’s a trade off between economic loss and loss of life, and I think feelings have a great deal to say about proper governance in that situation. Score another one for feelings!Me: I didn’t say we shouldn’t have fucking feelings! As a matter of fact, I’m advocating against loss of life by telling you not to attend that meeting on Klingon and its applications to erotic role playing! I’m only making a case for responding intelligently to a situation of extreme uncertainty. I don’t think we have perfect information. But what information we do have makes very clear that you’re a dumb shit if learning how to say: “Can I play Pterodactyl when I’m about to go?” In Klingon is more important than slowing the spread of this virus!Them: Well, here’s the thing...Me: I’ll kill you.Them: What?Me: I will artfully tie your testicles into a balloon animal and smack you across the forehead so hard that your shoelaces explode.Them: ...what?Me: I made myself perfectly clear.Them: You know how I feel about String Theory.Me: Wot?Them: I thought of hidden dimensions when you mentioned balloon knots.Me: ... WHAT?Them: A Calabi–Yau manifold, specifically.Me: Wait a minute... This is me isn’t it?Me: What?Me: I will use your Fallopian tubes as an N95 surgical mask if you try to step out that door.Me: ...what?Me: You know how I feel about Giraffes.Me: Wot?Me: That Dawkins book was great, yea?Me: I loved it.What’s this book about? Well, if I had to encapsulate it in a flimsy lipid membrane, I’d say it’s something like ATCG. But if I felt oddly compelled to share my thoughts with strangers on the internet, I’d say something like: There is deep beauty hidden within the seemingly mundane aspects of our daily reality that most of us fail to apprehend due to what Dawkins calls “The Anesthetic of Familiarity” an intense beauty that makes the ramblings of mystics and untethered romantics look embarrassingly quaint by comparison. It is all around us and available to anyone motivated by genuine curiosity to utter perhaps the hardest phrase in the English language: “I don’t know.” And from there you can begin to learn a bit about the natural world, the scope of its complexity, and the thrill of knowing how shit works. As an added bonus, an appreciation for the time and effort it takes to actually ‘know’ something, will help you better prepare for existential shocks in the form of pissed off proteins. With any luck, your willingness to combat dumbfuckery will spread exponentially and lead to a more informed society, less enthralled by smoke and mirrors, and more savvy on the nefarious schemes of microorganisms and garden gnomes.This book is about how the splendor of the natural world beats all that Mickey Mouse Bull Squash people produce out of ignorance, prejudice, superstition, and doing too many whippets, so badly that its shoes go flying off with tangential force equal to a supersonic centrifuge filling with enriched pain precipitating out of liquid regret. Have you ever seen someone take an ass beating so bad that their shoes ended up on a nearby roof? Well, let me tell you about the first time I took the Lord’s name in vain. Actually, no.. Let me share this bit with you from my Science Daddy (Richard Feynman)“I have a friend who’s an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don’t agree with very well. He’ll hold up a flower and say “look how beautiful it is,” and I’ll agree. Then he says “I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,” and I think that he’s kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is … I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it’s not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there’s also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don’t understand how it subtracts.”Retrieve your shoes with this book!"

Learned heaps about the workings of light and colour, sound and hearing... was even reminded that the idea of ""superstitious behavior"" in animals is attributed to Skinner (and not, sadly, my own idea). Much geeky excitement experienced all round by yours truly. Dawkins does a fine job of explaining complex ideas clearly and well.That's what was good about Unweaving the Rainbow.Sadly, what feels like way more than half of the book was spent painstakingly trying to argue people out of believing in astrology, ghosts, remote viewing, etc. using logic and scientific fact. Its starts about one third the way in. My problem with this is threefold:1) Dawkins is assuming that logic and scientific fact would have persuasive power for anyone believing in what he calls ""superstition"" or ""ad hoc magic"". (And really, why would it? I think believers would be the first to point out that this sort of thing is beyond the purview of science.)2) Dawkins assumes that these ""deluded"" people are reading his book. I can't say for sure, but personally, I would be surprised if a diehard believer in ESP or astrology would be interested in reading Dawkins' explanation of Fraunhofer lines, the electromagnetic spectrum and other fairly hardcore sciencey topics that fill the first third of this book. Seems like a different sort of audience. So he ends up ""preaching to the choir"" -- and there is something rather uncomfortably self-righteous about this. Not to mention dull.3) Dawkins (I don't mean to be unkind, but I can't think of any other to state the fact) embarrasses himself when he wanders out of the world of science and into literature and the humanities. Critiques of the scientific accuracy of Wordsworth poems or a fantasy story by Mark Twain are cringe-making.What Dawkins doesn't understand about human psychology is a lot. I think his whole crusade against religion has been a waste of a good scientific mind and has done a lot of damage to the discussion. His aggressive, dismissive and disrespectful approach has only put people on the defensive and set an unfortunate example.I was hoping for a lot more ""wonder of science"". Instead, I felt like I was getting lectured at length for something I didn't even do. What do I care about astrology??Anyhow, I was hoping for more wonders-of-science and less railing. Disappointing. Better books on science and wonder that I'd recommend:

2,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3784227-amanda,4,"The first half or so was amazing, and the rest was still really interesting (especially the end), if not quite as exhilarating. At the same time, you have to remember that even that powerhouse of scientific poetry, Carl Sagan, had some dry chapters every now and then. Some dryness definitely doesn't make it any less worth the read, and its mild anyway. Overall, this book was extremely enjoyable, and a breeze to get through. 4.5 stars, will probably be 5 on the reread."
3,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4331887-steve,5,"Written a few years prior to The God Delusion, this book serves as a useful bridge for anyone familiar with Dawkins's atheist output but unfamiliar with his more scientific titles. His critics often like to portray him as arrogant, hectoring (or that other old chestnut: 'shrill') and overly absorbed with the cold clinical application of the scientific method. Well he may not be cuddly, and I may not agree with his approach to everything, but for the most part I find him genial, honorable and good-natured, and this book - essentially a non-religious celebration of life and the scientific method - displays his warmth and humanity in bucketloads as it reveals how a greater understanding of science enlarges - rather than diminishes - our sense of wonder. This was enlightening, beautifully written and highly recommended. I know I will read it again."
4,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/179565-krista,2,"One of the Goodreads reviews on this book relates, simply, that the writer of the review had been on a cruise ship with the author prior to reading the book. When she DID read the book, she regretted that she didn't ""do some kind of small violence to his person"" while on the cruise with him.In many ways, that sums up my take beautifully. This was the most interesting book I've ever despised. Certainly, I have a brain not suited to the exigencies of science. But when he wasn't losing me in a web of convoluted explanation, he was was looking down his nose at me like a curmudgeonly professor who is inordinately piqued that an average undergraduate had the audacity to drop by during office hours and ask a stupid question.That said, I learned a lot and, while I did not become a convert to his thesis that science can be as beautiful as poetry, I will admit that, were my brain more suited to the beauty of, say, probability, I would have been in ecstasy while perusing the pages of this tome. In discussing how we discover our world; ""... we arrived by being born, and we didn't burst conscious into the world but accumulated awareness gradually through babyhood. The fact that we slowly apprehend our world, rather than suddenly discover it, should not subtract from its wonder."" And maybe that's where he lost me. I haven't accumulated enough awareness to see what he sees. And to believe what he believes. But condescension does not encourage me to become more aware. It encourages me to shrug and go back to my music, or my poetry, or my philosophy. All of that said, there were several ""aha"" moments; some ""I-never-knew-that-before!"" aha, some ""I-never-thought-about-it-that-way-before!"" aha and some ""I-had-totally-forgotten-about-that!"" aha. Like his analogy about how expansive the earth's past is; ""Fling your arms wide in an expansive gesture to span all of evolution from its origin at your left fingertip to today at your right fingertip. All the way across your midline to well past your right shoulder, life consists of nothing but bacteria. Many-celled, invertebrate life flowers somewhere around your right elbow. The dinosaurs originate in the middle of your right palm, and go extinct around your last finger joint. The whole story of Homo sapiens and our predecessor Homo erectus is contained in the thickness of one nail-clipping. As for recorded history; as for the Sumerians, the Babylonians, the Jewish patriarchs, the dynasties of Pharohs, the legions of Rome, the Christian Fathers, the Laws of the Medes and Persians which never change; as for Troy and the Greeks, Helen and Achilles and Agamemnon dead; as for Napolean and Hitler, the Beatles and Bill Clinton, they and everyone that knew them are blown away in the dust from one light stroke of a nail file.""In my opinion, that qualifies as scientific poetry. But that's because it takes an idea and sketches it with metaphor and examples that are accessible and understandable to my way of thinking. And Dawkins, too often, refuses to ""stoop"" to ""that level.""For example, consider this quote from astrophysicist Chandrasekhar; ""... beauty is that to which the human mind responds at its deepest and most profound."" Indeed. Of course, I left out the beginning of the quote which talks about math and how it relates to nature. That's not beautiful to me. I understand why it's beautiful to those whose brains process math differently. But my brain does not work that way. My mind responds to a different beauty. Does that make my idea of beauty any less valid? Dawkins would undoubtedly say, ""Yes."" Then he'd kick me out of his office and grumble discontentedly as he adjusted his suspenders and wandered back to his desk.But when Dawkins DOES lower himself to my level and speak my language, he pulls me right in; his discussion on coincidence and how, in our multi-media age, we are more likely to see a pattern where there is none, was eye-opening. And his fascinating riff on the fact that science is an affront to common sense made me smile in satisfaction; ""For example, every time you drink a glass of water you are imbibing at least one molecule that passed through the bladder of Oliver Cromwell ... there are many more molecules in a glass of water than there are glasses of water in the sea ... solid matter, even a hard diamond, consists almost entirely of empty space."" Another riff that gave me pause was Dawkins' take on God's covenant with Abraham; ""He didn't promise Abraham eternal life as an individual ... But he did promise something else. 'And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly ... and thou shalt be a father of many nations ... And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.' Abraham was left in no doubt that the future lay with his seed, not his individuality. God knew his Darwinism.""That is what I was looking for in this book. Someone with the title "" Professor of the Public Understanding of Science"" should really like average, thoughtful humans a bit more than Dawkins seems to. And if one is going to celebrate the diversity of life, one should also celebrate the diversity of ways of looking at life. We can't all think like Dawkins. It is hubris of Dawkins to expect all of us to try. And to belittle us when we fail. Rather, he could have made his case for why his way of thinking is a valid and valuable addition to the layers of awareness that allow us to continually find beauty in our universe. But to discount and belittle the other ways of finding beauty was a mistake. He should have calculated that in some sort of equation before he published."
5,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1833413-michael,4,"As a person unlearned--well, okay, let's be honest, frankly ignorant--in science, I enjoyed this wide-ranging book. Dawkins largely achieves his aim: to show that an understanding of the science of phenomena can create a sense of wonder equal to mythic or poetic metaphor, with a concomitant gain in understanding and an increased desire to know still more and to look askance at delusions that are unsupportable in light of what we know and continue to learn. Not every chapter is strong. The part on bad science metaphors is not as interesting as the rest and serves simply as an attack on a view of evolution on which he disagrees. Those well-versed in science might find passages to carp at. For the interested non-scientist, this book is engaging and a useful primer on many topics. Keats, no mean explorer of knowledge, in spite of his dismissal of Newton's optics as an unpoetic unweaving of the rainbow, would, I would bet, enjoy this book mightily once he became current with the growth of scientific understanding since his time. "
6,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1660832-kevin,0,"Enjoyed this book a lot especially the chapters on how humans delude themselves or allow others to delude them, including newspapers that include astrology columns. That seems very fitting for todays world where politicians yell fake news if they don't like the story about themselves. The final chapter is really great as well about memes and language. "
7,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/940772-mark,4,"Dawkins makes a strong case for those of us who believe that scientific literacy not only does not have to come at the price of aesthetic appreciation, but can actually enhance it. Put another way, good science inspires good poetry. The sense of wonder we feel when watching the sun set should if anything be enhanced if we are aware of the physics of light reaching our retina, the 93 million miles the light had to travel to reach us, the ability of the light to at times be refracted into a rainbow, etc. Science can also correct bad poetry or metaphors; he does a good job of showing why an understanding of the arbitrary position of stars' light as it reaches us should argue against astrology, and is as unrelenting against numerology, postmodernism, and religious fundamentalism. Anyone who appreciates Bill Bryson will enjoy this book. The author gives one of the most cogent explanations I have read for our propensity to overweight anecdotal, statistically insignificant events.My only gripes about the book were his tendency to assume the reader has as much knowledge of and fondness for Keats and Byron as he seems to have, and his apparent impatience for those who lose themselves in their metaphors, looking for meaning in random physical events. I believe only a minority of people can tolerate the anxiety that comes from confronting their smallness in the universe, a universe that if it is ruled by a deity does not apparently need to be (as Stephen Hawkings so aptly illustrated in a Brief History of Time)."
8,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8184722-gustavo-vazquez,1,"A weak book from Dawkins. Regardless of his ideas being right or wrong, he is a bad writer, and here he is worse than ever. He stumbles from the banal to the sublime, to the complex to the simple, to the popular to the academic without even noticing that. One page you are reading a very important theory and in the next paragraph he goes on telling you about a trivial thing that has happened to him the day before. Sometimes pages and pages are spent trying to explain something not important, and then when the important thing comes, Dawkins treats it as ""already explained"" and leave it as that.Other thing he loves to do, and it's just plain bad writing, is comparing things one with another. As a first step to understand the problem, it's ok, but he dwells too long on metaphors. I.e., comparing the human brain to a computer. He goes on and on and on until there's no more use using the metaphor; it becomes harder and harder to believe in him, and things become ridiculous. The worst part is a link he makes between the evolution of the human brain, memes, and a tango he cannot forget. There's a lot of guessing in this book, too. And some theories are not that credible. His criticism of astrology and other spiritual stuff are more or less correct, and it's something important that must be adressed, but he can't write a coherent chapter to express his ideas. He criticises a bit, then talk about other thing, then comes a very complex but short paragraph, then it's a trivial thing again, etc.There are some good moments, very few, but in short: very badly written. "
9,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/538517-alissa-thorne,3,"﻿I would love to praise Unweaving the Rainbow Science, Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder as a layman's introduction to the wonders of science. The premise of the book is that the scientific view is not the bleak and cold perspective that it has a reputation for. In support of this, the book is chock full of little tidbits that demonstrate the beauty, the elegance, the chaos and the awe-inspiring complexity of the world around us. Dawkins endeavors to make science real to us, to seduce us with its simplicity, to floor us by making the massive tangible, and to tantalize us with the beautiful intricacy that can be seen if you just have the understanding.Sadly I can also describe this book as a long and rambling rant about the bountiful and varied thorns in Richard Dawkins' side. Sure, I share the pain of many of those thorns. But even to me, his litany of complaints eventually started to feel like the mean-spirited nit-picking of a cantankerous old man.It is tricky to strike a balance between providing harsh criticism of bad ideas while still being respectful to the people who believe them. And yet this is a challenge that skeptics should be uniquely well suited for. I never cease to be amazed when a skeptic work explains the natural human fallacies that tend to lead to a particular faulty conclusion and the mechanism in our brains that make the belief appealing and intuitive... then in the next paragraph, have the audacity to call people who have made these entirely reasonable mistakes idiots or charlatans!Excepting perhaps the small choir of skeptics that Dawkins is preaching to, we all know someone who holds a scientifically unsound belief. Even most generally pro-science people hold one or two personal superstitions. Nobody appreciates their friends and family members mocked or accused of malicious intent, and they take it even less kindly when the name-calling is pointed their way. It is a tragic irony that this is what leaves people with a bad taste in their mouth, leading to the very anti-science sentiments that Dawkins is trying to prevent.I wish I could recommend this book to friends. I would love to be able to say, ""Read this, and maybe you will begin to see why being an atheist is not depressing as you are imagining, but in fact wondrous and hopeful."" But I would be ashamed for a friend to read this book, and be subjected to witnessing the cruel ridicule dished out by Dawkins."
10,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,3,"Hmph. This one has me all over the place in terms of how much I was liking it at any particular juncture. The final chapter is a solid 5 star essay on its own, an ode to the depth of the human brain, the (probably uniquely human) use of language, metaphor and representational graphics to advance our species' knowledge and create durable memes. My wording, not Dawkins'. At times I forgot myself and thought I was reading Stephen Pinker. If you start reading this book and find yourself bored or irritated, at least read the last chapter. It redeems itself.As far as the rest of the book, some of it is the usual pompous argument for atheism that I've come to associate with Richard Dawkins. He bogs this reader down with blather regarding ""good scientific poetry"" vs. ""bad scientific poetry "" and then proceeds to inflict upon us his own brand of the latter. And not surprisingly (if you've read much Dawkins) he snipes at Stephen Jay Gould (""bad poetry in his hands is all the more damaging because Gould is a graceful writer"") Nevertheless, between Dawkins' preachy drivel this book contains rich veins of mesmerizing science writing, spanning topics ranging from characteristics of light (hence the name of the book ) to audio perception to DNA evidence. A treat for those of us who love reading about science. Then back he goes to verbally pummeling astrology and other such superstitious nonsense. Really, Richard, you're preaching to the choir here. Chances of the avid consumers of headlines such as ""Marilyn Monroe Comes Back as a Lettuce"" and ""Statue of Elvis Found on Mars"" are not lining up to buy your books.Dawkins shines when he abandons attacking idiots and picking on colleagues and focuses on actual science: Evolutionary biology, symbiosis, the strategy of cuckoos who duck parental duties by manipulating other kinds of birds into raising their kids, our minds' perceptual tricks and so on. Dawkins manages to pack a bunch of intriguing science into this book, which makes it well worth reading. No one writes more lucidly or entertainingly than Richard Dawkins when he is not on his high horse. As noted before, the last chapter alone is worth reading the book for."
11,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8676317-a-man-called-ove,3,"3.5/5 ""The feeling of awed wonder that science can give us is one of the highest experiences of which the human psyche is capable. It is a deep aesthetic passion to rank with the finest that music and poetry can deliver. It is truly one of the things that makes life worth living and it does so, if anything, more effectively if it convinces us that the time we have for living it is finite.""Sometime ago, I liked a book by Dawkins wrote for children - The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True. In each chapter Dawkins beautifully explains one phenomena in a very lucid and loving way. This book is ""The Magic of Reality"" for adults.Dawkins is acerbic and elitist and nihilist, until you finally pick up and read one of his books. His passion and love for science make it such a joy to read. And as for the ""elitist"" tag, his language is lucid and he comes across as honest. But this book was actually about answering the ""nihilist"" tag and celebrating science as something that makes life worth living.Some of the chapters are spent debunking astrology and other pseudo-science in a very logical way. The chapters explaining DNA, light and sound were superb. I have read a few of his famous books on evolution before, and so the content of some of the chapters were very familiar. Perhaps I would have rated this book higher if it were my first book by him."
12,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies,4,"Initially this was slightly infuriating. Though Dawkins does make a lot of sense, though I agree with a lot of his views and respect his scientific expertise, though this book does address a very interesting subject (the criticism of science by non-scientists that the detailed logical breakdown of how/why everything works is robbing the world and life of the mystery and magic), at times I felt that the author himself fell in to the trap he was criticising. So I had no problem with what Dawkins was saying (some parts - using Fourier equations to estimate the penis size of elephants on musth based on the sine wave of piss stains left on the ground, and the role and evolution of Mixotricha inside termite guts, intracellular parasites of parasites within an insect that operates with a hive mind - particularly interesting) but more with how he was saying it. At times he came over confrontational and like he was ramming his point home (unnecessary for me as a reader who already understood and agreed with his conjecture), and at times he seemed to be throwing in italicised quotes of little relevance (and in doing so appeared more like the flawed misinterpretators of science he was seeking to separate his and most other scientists from).Nevertheless, certainly a thought-provoking read - for all that I couldn't stomach reading Dawkins exclusively."
13,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18393139-elizabeth-rhea,4,"In this mindblowing science-based philosophical text, Dawkins invites the reader to see wonder in a world which, though often counter-intuitive and surprising, invites deep understanding.Though Dawkins is a skilled scientist, this text shows that he is equally impressive as a philosopher. In his case, science and philosophy are closely linked-- before beginning this text, I described my anticipation at reading ""this Athiestic firecracker of a mind"", and my hopes were not disappointed. Dawkins skillfully navigates several areas of science, probability, and new knowledge of human perception to show that we should be in constant awe-- not because of mystery, which may soon be dispelled, but because so much is knowable and percievable. As a person of religion myself (Christian, mostly Protestant), I found that this read closed the gaps to which I'd relegated my God--and caused me to question whether I'd built a faith paradigm that was dependent on and argued from a point of ignorance (how-else-do-you-explain...).* Over all, this was a superbly written text, and I'm thankful for every bit of it.A few notes on reading Dawkins: He is a great philsopher, but arguably an even better rhetorician. As a fan of rhetoric myself I was impressed with the deliacy with which he `wooed' a possibly religious audience-- not just with logos, but with ethos and pathos too-- positively quoting C.S. Lewis and sharing a deep concern for his fellow man (languge was usually male, unfortunately). Though to his credit, he seeks to free mankind from the confines of magial religious thought, some of his jabs at religion were neither scientific, fair, or mature. Implicitly equating Elvis sightings with Christian claims of Christ's resurrection; listing off Santa and Baby Jesus in the same category of quaint childhood belief; implying that religious education systems have been intentionally, nefariously designed to exploit the credulity of children-- all of this seems a little beneath someone of his apparent intellectual/philosophical capabilities. I generally avoid Christian literature because of these not-so-subtle jabs at those with opposing worldviews; it is good to know that committed Athiests can be just as underhanded and preachy! However, this was not excessive (Don't want to make your target audience throw the book!) and if you are aware of it and have a good sense of humor, you won't find it too hard to read through. Dawkins also had some problematic moral conclusions whenever he ventured outside of his scientific field. For example, he seemed to imply that races had evolved seperately enough to make intermarriage a less-than-ideal situation and didn't clarify oherwise, and declined to address the white-male dominance within science when it would have been only natural to do so (he was lambasting those who completely reject science for that reason, dismissing their concerns almost entirely.) He's great, but keep in mind that this text should not replace readings in ethics or sociology.A few quotes:(On the Usefulness of Science) ""If everything is judged by how `useful' it is-- useful for staying alive, that is-- we are left facing a futile circularity. There must be some added value. At lesst a part of life should be devoted to living that life, not just working to stop it ending."" (5)""We can't actually fly to another planet. But we can recapture that sense of having just tumbled out to life on a new world by looking at our own world in unfamiliar ways."" (7)""There are, of course, genuine philosophical difficulties. Is a truth just a so-far-unfalsified hypothesis?... Is anything ultimately true? On the other hand, no philosopher has any trouble using the language of truth when falsely accused of a crime, or when suspecting his wife of adultery."" (21)""Good science fiction has no dealings with fairy tales, but is premised on the world as an orderly place. There is mystery, but the universe is not frivolous or light-fingered in its changeability.... Science fiction may tinker with the laws of nature, arguably and preferably one law at a time, but it cannot abolish lawfulness itself and remain good science fiction."" (29)(On Astrological Signs): ""...isn't this a form of discriminatory labeling rather like the cultural stereotypes which many of us nowadays find objectionable? I can imagine a Monty Python sketch in which a newspaper publishes a column something like this: `Germans: it is in your nature to be hard-working and methodical.... Spaniards: Your Latin blood may get the better of you...."" (119)""Skill in weilding metaphors and symbols is oneof the hallmarks of scientific genius."" (186)""We are alone among the animals in forseeing our end. We are also alone among the animals in being able to say before we die: Yes, this is why it was worth coming into life in the first place."" (313) *The curious reader may want to know that the answer was yes--this was, in part, the nature of my faith, and to that extent, it has been shaken-- not stirred-- but I also find God to be dynamically present in the elegance of the natural, in the known, and I found my paradigm of God and God's engagement with the world truer for having read Dawkins. I also think my God rather enjoys Dawkin's mind too-- and might even thank him for knocking over a few of the He-shaped dummy-idols we have created over time."
14,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5803820-martin-pribble,5,"This month, while in a Twitter hiatus, I managed to get around to reading a book. Yes, a real book, with paper and pages and a cardboard cover! The book I chose to read is by Dr Richard Dawkins, and this is one that is overlooked in terms of its importance and place in society, having been overshadowed by his more groundbreaking and most famous publications such as “The Blind Watchmaker”, “The Selfish Gene” and of course “The God Delusion.”“Unweaving the Rainbow” was originally published in 1998, and apart from some unforeseen advances in science and technology, is as relevant today’s it was when written over ten years ago. The premise of the book, and the origin of the title, stem from a claim by the 19th century poet John Keats, in apparent dismay at Sir Isaac Newton for his discovery and documentation the separation of white light into the visible spectrum, or the rainbow as it is commonly known. Keats claims that Newton destroyed the wonder and poetry of the rainbow by “reducing it to prismatic colours.” Keats’ claim, and claims like it, are often employed as a last ditch attempt in refuting the importance or relevance of science, saying that the deep study of the beautiful can only reduce a wonderful thing, a thing of reverence and astonishment, to a mundane and dull object once fully understood. The extrapolation of this claim seems to be the mystery of the unknown in the form of god, souls, magic and spirituality will be destroyed by the understanding of the underlying principles that create these phenomena within humanity. Of course, this claim stems from a fear that science is, in fact, often correct, and may eventually rid the world of superstition and dogma.Dawkins goes to great lengths to “unweave the rainbow” in it’s many guises; From the specific story of Keats and Newton to the charlitanism of new age mysticism, from pseudoscience to bad poetic communication, Dawkins has successfully constructed a case for the wonder and majesty of the natural world, the way things really are. He intersperses the book with pieces of prose and quotes from the arts and science, and shows that superstition and bad judgement do not lie solely within the confines of religion. Of course we knew this to be the case, but to analyse it in this manner really puts a perspective on who we are as a species, and why we believe the unbelievable.Much like Michael Shermer’s book “Why People Believe Weird Things”, “Rainbow” gives numerous examples of how the human brain sees the world around it, and how our development as a species is sometimes hindered by our evolution, the very thing that brought us here. Biologically we are riddled with age old hangovers from times past, and socially we are told that science is devoid of wonder. The combination of these two aspects of modern society is that science is seen as a cold and soulless reduction of the universe to just a bunch of numbers on paper. While science can (and I believe will) explain away many of the aspects of life that we see as indescribable or mysterious, as Dawkins argues, this can only enhance our wonder at nature’s intricacies.Dawkins, I feel, is always at his strongest when he talks of topics of which he is an expert; biology. When he speaks of religion, he all too often gets caught upon a personal battle of will and wits, and can come across as a less than savoury character. In “Rainbow” however, he successfully walks a thin line between scientific facts and the criticism of the human condition, without entering the territory of ad-hominem insults or personal attacks on individuals. He is neither too critical nor soft on the idiosyncrasies and quirks of human nature. He balances the rightful claim that science can only enhance our understanding of the universe and all it contains with the need for the poetic and the beautiful. This is a point that is all too often overlooked, and this message can only help to move forward any attempts by science to regain its place in the minds of modern humanity, without being seen as a threat to the beauty and appreciation we have for the natural world."
15,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/904335-abi,3,"Hmmm, I have mixed feelings about this one. On the one hand I agree with him wholeheartedly that science and a scientific understanding of natural phenomena is a source of wonder. BUT, I think Dawkins throws the baby out with the bath water to a certain extent. To think of the rainbow in terms of water drops and light waves evokes one sort of beauty. But to think of the rainbow in terms of mythology, as something mysteriously wonderful, evokes quite another, one that is infinitely more suited to literature. Because all literature is, in one way or another, about human beings. Dawkins argues that literature would be much greater if it approached the rainbow in terms of its literal truth. Well, I certainly don't agree with that. Perhaps Keats was foolish to criticise Newton's 'unweaving of the rainbow', but he would have been equally foolish to write a poem devoid of humanity. A myth about a rainbow isn't about the rainbow at all, it's about the people that created the myth. It is perfectly possible to know what a rainbow really is and wonder at its complexity, whilst still being able to switch focus and approach it from a poetic angle, in which the rainbow will mean whatever the author wants it to mean. And that absolutely doesn't mean believing a myth to be TRUE in a real sense."
16,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51560629-rebecca,5,"I love that Dawkins wrote this book. I wish more people would read it, especially the majority of people in the world who still believe that our life is governed on earth by a supreme omniscience. In this extended essay, he puts forth the idea that science - knowledge after all - is beautiful and poetic. ""It is science that can solve the problems of hunger and poverty, of insanitation and illiteracy, of superstition and deadening custom and tradition, of vast resources running to waste, or a rich country inhabited by starving people...Who indeed could afford to ignore science today? At every turn we have to seek its aid...The future belongs to science and those who make friends with science."" (August 1998 - Jawaharlal Nehru) There is absolutely nothing dry and horrible about knowing and searching for the real reasons for things we experience in life, even though we can never be sure our understanding is perfect. I think that Dawkins should have said what he said in fewer words, because I found myself skimming over sections once I understood his point. The book is peppered with great quotations and the final chapter was my favorite. Genes and memes/nature and nurture....I am glad I stuck it out to the end!"
17,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3336993-chris,4,"Dawkins has done it again with _Unweaving_the_Rainbow_. After reading _The_God_Delusion_ I was left with a sense of wonder about science, reason, and a need for clarity of the meaning of life. A popular criticism of atheism is that it the power to turn anyone into a narcissist, and I can see the reasoning. It takes a strong-willed person to accept that once they die there is nothing waiting on the other side; there is no other side. Nevertheless _Unweaving_the_Rainbow_ has elegantly shown that this world, with all its beauty and wonder, is meaning enough to satisfy the insatiable thirst for knowledge and understanding that someone with the desire for the meaning of life possesses. He has shown that there is much we do not know about our universe, but we are working on it; and combining good poetry with science, we may have a deeper understand of our surroundings and ourselves.There may not be a universal meaning of life (if fact life is a simulation in of itself), but the infinite loop of discovery-learning-understanding-new discoveries can provide a great stand-in.This was an excellent book and highly recommended."
18,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2254118-denise,4,"Dawkins takes his title from John Keats, who decried Isaac Newton's explanation of light as ""unweaving the rainbow."" Far from robbing the wonderment of light by revealing some of its mysteries, Dawkins maintains that the greater understanding can only increase one's sense of wonder at a commonplace phenomenon, that we have, indeed, become immune to the wonder of the commonplace by not looking too deeply into it. Starting from Newton's discoveries on the nature of light, Dawkins works his way through spectroscopy, the anatomy of the eye, color, on to the electromagnetic spectrum, and DNA. He discusses pseudoscience and the capacity for credulity–which he sees as childish–among the adherents of various forms of pseudoscience. He takes a few wide swipes at Stephen Jay Gould and his idea of punctuated equilibrium, though this he classes as bad science, rather than pseudoscience. Finally, he discusses evolution and the nature of consciousness. Please read rest of the review here."
19,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"In Unweaving the Rainbow Richard Dawkins argues that, rather than taking the mystery out of nature, science leads to a deeper and richer understanding that also has the capacity to generate awe and respect in its adherents. He then uses this as a jumping off point to discourse on a wide variety of topics including astronomy, light, sound, genetics, superstition, statistics, cognitive errors, pseudo-science, evolution and the mathematical formula that would describe the swinging of an elephant’s penis (no, I did not make that up … consider it a peak into the inner workings of Dawkins’ brain)."

26,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10979968-sarah,3,"I was happy to appreciate the inside reference for Chapter 8's title, (all you Brief Encounter fans out there, etc.) In reading through, I had the feeling that somewhere in the editing process someone said, ""Please add more sign posts at the beginning and ending of all your chapters. Please continue to remind your reader what your point is because your reader is probably stupid."" From that advice I'm imagining Dawkins was made to make those written reminders against his will because it makes the writing very chunky in places. I found most of these markers completely unnecessary. In the third quarter of the book, it felt like the ambition to show the real beauty and provide poetic examples lost confidence. The first several chapters, especially Barcodes in the Stars, were my favorite. I am always most easily enchanted by the poetic possibilities of the universe, in part because of the incredible distances being covered. After further discussion on genes with David, some of the chapters became more clear. I should have revisited some Khan Academy sections on genes before diving into this, but it was still a good science read. "
27,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22249197-tomas,2,"Premise of this book is wrong. Why search for link between scientific evidence and poetry ? Poetry is not going to persuade anybody about scientific facts. The person who doubts relentless efforts of scientists to discover truth about life and universe because it is not poetic is an idiot. It almost co-relates with the religions views on life. Everything must be pretty, non-chaotic and explained in one or two sentences. Truth about almost everything is complicated and there are really no simple answers to anything. Therefore the facts will not be pretty enough to put on the wall or read out loud in Hide park. Plus poetry will not help improve our society, will not cure any disease. And in my opinion is highly overrated.I have read many books written by Mr. Dawkins and every single one I liked except for this one. Book itself is not bad and there is a lot of interesting stuff mentioned here as well. But you have to go through a lot of poem being quoted."

I think the kindest thing I can say it that it was a mixed bag. I think he uses the phrase ""tiresome pedant"" and even though he has written some great stuff, parts of this one were brutal and he comes across as a tiresome pedant. Part of it is simply taste - I don't care about arguments one should use with those who believe in pseudo-science and I am not worried that if someone watches The X-Files that they will abandon scientific thought (hint: fiction and non-fiction are not the same thing). Some other parts were just tedious- either overdone or rehashes of things he covered better elsewhere. The bright spot for me was the discussion of perception and virtual reality later in the book. Bottom line: if you can't get enough of Dawkins go ahead and read this one, otherwise, look to his other stuff instead."

I will not deny the fact that Mr. Dawkins is brilliant, however his writing certainly isn’t. I enjoyed his book “The God Delusion” but even that was border line dry and I would consider that to be his most entertaining book. This book is certainly filled with solid information hence why I gave it the benefit of the doubt and gave it 3 stars. If I wanted to simply learn the information I would buy a textbook and learn these concepts in much more depth that he is able to do within a 350 page book but people like me buy books by him and other science educators in hopes of being entertained along the way, in which he fails miserably at doing.

Now whenever I walk outside I think about the world in a more ""pleasantly informed"" way. You shed the common stigma science holds, being cold and uncaring. Obviously, being Dawkins, he really makes you want to go out and just learn - learn anything find out how not why and improve yourself, all the while remembering learning and understanding is actually art. It really is poetic to think of any living thing on the planet almost as your ""sibling, far removed"" for example. It's also VERY applicable to the present; it's not the mystery, but the explanation and knowing that brings beauty to anything in life."

In earlier chapters Dawkins discusses realms where he is not a specialist. In chapter eight he takes down some of the more absurd evolutionary ideas promulgated about the Cambrian explosion by Stephen Jay Gould in that era. Here Dawkins brings his deep knowledge of evolution to bear. He also tips his hat to Daniel Dennett's criticisms in Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life. Raised rating to four stars.Chapters 1-7 are OK. From eight on, Dawkins writes about realms he really knows, even tipping his cap to the meme. Skip to that part if you think the beginning is a drag."

Sadly Dawkins then goes on and follows it with an entire book on the subject. OK, that’s unfair. Some bits of the book are first class, particularly (as you’d expect) the section explaining the true nature of natural selection when looked at from a genetic point of view. Other parts are more mixed and Dawkins just can’t seem to prevent himself from occasionally being a bit of dick in places, as seems to be his nature.

So in this book he talked like a godfather in the area of poetry, language origin, physics, media, astronomy, and of course evolution and biology. Again, what I like most and maybe like only by reading this book is his ideas and examples of selfish genes and memes, which are a repeat of his best book selfish gene. And it is refreshing to read these great ideas again and think about that ""I am nothing but just a secondary phenomenon, a survival machine made by genes"". Then, I don't really enjoy his various talk shows about art and other spaCes of science. I can't say he is wrong in them, it is just that I am not a fan when he talk about too many things and get lost from time to time.

I’m always incredulous that the same author can write so differently and pitch at different intellectual vantage points. The whole premise of this book is to defend scientific enquiry from the viewpoint of blunt realism and posit it as poetic and romanticised curiosity in the natural world. I suspect this is in response to the criticality to his believed determinism of life, as demonstrated in works such as The Selfish Gene. Unfortunately Dawkins is very conversationalist in this book and quotes heavily from Literature to provide some support for his arguments which are weak at best. This is a book where obvious science is alluded to with apparent parallels drawn in literature. If you were to remove the heavy use of quotations you would be left with very little scientific substance and I found myself bored throughout reading. "
55,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45781981-clarence-cheong,5,"That this book proclaims to be about 'delusion and the appetite for wonder' is puzzling, for Dawkins devotes only a few sections to ridiculing mystics and offering slightly demeaning explanations for our naiveté when faced with an authoritarian account of the unaccountable. Dawkins spends more time elaborating on another considerable obstacle towards public acceptance and appreciation of science: our tendency to see science as cold, calculating, and devoid of poetry. This book is rife with examples of how science introduces us to worlds stranger and more mystical than we could have imagined, and of reminders that our everyday reality, as illuminated by science, hums along with miracles at every turn - miracles that we, unfortunately, have taken for granted. Dawkins' exhortations to gaze at the wonder of science - peppered with quotes from Romantic poets for good measure - can get a little pedantic, like the canned laughter in a sitcom that tells you how to respond at every moment, but as a whole I think he makes his point pretty well.Beyond this overarching theme of the poetry of science, Dawkins introduces disparate scientific concepts - it seems - with no rhyme or reason. First we learn about light, then waves, then DNA evidence, then we break for a section on statistics and 'poetic science', before continuing to learn about genes and the brain's capacity to understand the world. I can't find much meaning for why Dawkins is telling me about this concept at this point of time, which reduces somewhat my motivation to understand everything he's saying. But fortunately, though the concepts can get technical and a bit complex, Dawkins explains things pretty clearly, so there weren't many moments when I felt completely lost. Dawkins' rambling about scientific concepts is also redeemed by the fact that the ideas being presented are often genuinely fascinating. Although the content was more thought-provoking than comprehensive, I walked away feeling like I had learnt something new.The best thing about this book is probably the writing; in fact, I picked it up after reading an excerpt from it in a book about good writing by Stephen Pinker. The opening line - 'we are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones' - is one of the best I've read in all of fiction and non-fiction, and Dawkins brings this idea full circle when at the end of the book he concludes that science's contribution to humanity lies in allowing us to say 'yes, this is why it was worth coming to life in the first place'. Simple, 'masculine' language - striking and effective. Dawkins writes with economical grace, as befits a man of science.But there are moments when he falters, offering faulty and underwhelming logic. For instance, he argues that if we were to reject DNA evidence in court, we would be forced to reject all evidence from less reliable sources - such as from eyewitnesses. I'm not too familiar with exactly why people want to ban DNA evidence in court, but I suspect it is because DNA evidence is inaccurate in a different way than eyewitnesses, possibly because it can be contaminated. In any case, there could be objections to the use of DNA evidence that are entirely unrelated to its reliability.Additionally, Dawkins spends quite a few chapters explaining the difference between good and bad 'poetic science'. I expected a more profound point, but it turned out the difference lay solely in whether the analogy made was scientifically accurate or not. Dawkins himself takes significant poetic liberties, tracing tenuous connections between concepts to bridge chapters, and at times I wonder if he may be guilty of the same 'bad poetic science' he rails against.As a whole, this was a great read, and would definitely recommend to anyone with some background in science or who, like me, has always harboured a suspicion that science contains great poetry."
56,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6384410-cory,4,"I believe that Animal Farm's best paragraph is its last, and the opposite can be said of Unweaving the Rainbow; the best writing is found on the first page. Not to say that the rest of the book isn't worth reading, just that it begins brilliantly. ""We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born""Dawkins has said that he plans on having Unweaving the Rainbow's first paragraph read at his funeral, and I hope he doesn't mind that I do the same. Arguable the beginning of the book can't be topped, but every few pages or so there will be another line that strikes the same emotional chords. It's science writing that makes your spine tingle. In part, Dawkins is sharing his love and fascination with the ""poetry"" of science. The truth about how rainbows form doesn't at all diminish their beauty, if anything, it adds to it. How wonderful is it that the right combination of sunlight and rainfall can cast a whole spectrum of colors upon the sky? But Dawkins is also making a small plea to the other science writers of modern times; he is asking them not to forget their feelings of wonder and amazement when they go to write their books and papers. If metaphor or simile can be used to enhance the readers understanding, it is wise to use them and contribute to the poetry of science. After The God Delusion (life changing, by the way), this was the second book by Richard Dawkins that I read. I must admit, it gets pretty dry at times, but don't give up on it! There is some of the best science writing out there in between those covers, and it very well could change how you look at the world. Every time I look at the night sky I feel as if it's the first time I've seen it, and that is the kind of feeling this book is trying to pass on: sheer amazement at the workings of the cosmos. Read Unweaving the Rainbow with the curiosity of a child and an adult's appreciation for literature and you will not be disappointed. "
57,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"Richard Dawkins is clearly a man of some considerable genius - his overall knowledge of physics and biology (and evolutionary science in particular) shines through in everything he ever does. Here, he refutes Keats' famous accusation - the poet accused Newton of destroying the poetry of the rainbow by explaining the origin of its colours, dispelling nature's great mystery.Dawkins goes on to argue that, in fact, science makes the world even more beautiful, because when you start to understand exactly how the world works, you can appreciate it for all of its genuine scientific beauty. And he's got a point.Now, I'm not the most scientifically-minded guy, although I try to approach things logically - I just don't necessarily know my quarks from my quasars, like Dawkins does. Nevertheless, his special brand of science is approachable and easy to understand and, in Unweaving the Rainbow, he explains how the world works in a way that enhances its natural beauty. And boy, is nature beautiful.Sure, it's not exactly easy-going, but Dawkins communicates his point with authority and aplomb, drawing from a long line of poetic and scientific thinkers to convey his message, a reminder of power of science to open minds and to educate the uneducated.This might not be the best book to read if you're superstitious, religious or otherwise inclined to use that spurious word 'faith' to defend whichever system you believe in, although it might just change your mind about a few things. You'd be better placed to read Unweaving the Rainbow if you prefer to rely on solid facts, as the compelling concepts it contains will only enhance your appreciation of the world that you already look at objectively.Dawkins' explanation of statistics and probability theory is also a highlight, and there are some true gems hidden inside the manuscript. Well worth a read, it's truly mind-expanding."
58,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10050710-scott-hicks,4,"Wow. This was my first ever Dawkins literary experience, and all I can say is, wow. I was compelled to pick it up after watching some discussions with Dawkins on a variety of issues and topics. I'm happy to say that his eloquence in speaking is incredibly similar to his clear written-form prowess. What always seemed to impress me throughout reading Unweaving the Rainbow: Science, Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder was the way Dawkins made even the most complicated of subjects in the science world interesting and intriguing, and, most importantly, understandable. While there were certainly many ideas that flew right over my head, be assured it was at no fault of Dawkins, who still managed to make them compelling and engaging to me. He possesses a large arsenal of knowledge and wit that challenges you to think critically along with him as he tackles areas such as astrology, bad poetic science, the power and intrigue of genetics, uncanny occurrences all of us can relate to, and so much more. For me, it increased my awareness of the world and gave me a perspective I am certainly grateful to have. The first few pages alone shocked me with just some simple statistics and reflections on the universe.I encourage anyone to read this book. Go into it with an open-mind and remember that Dawkins' has written it to persuade you, and Dawkins himself even reminds you to think critically for yourself. I think you will feel satisfied from the experience just as I was, and enlightened with new perspective on many topics we encounter every single day of our lives. While Dawkins' has the reputation of being a ""chief Athiest"" of sorts, this book is much more focused on science rather than religion, and science stretches into all aspects of our life, so what do you have to lose?"
59,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1664750-connie-kuntz,4,"Hal J Daniel III wrote an excellent collection of poetry entitled Animal Behavior. In Daniel's collection, he references Richard Dawkins. That is why I decided to read up on Dawkins; so I could further understand and enjoy Daniel's dynamic poetry. I do love the poetry that ignites my inner dramaturg.Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist, among other things, is revered by some, loathed by others, respected by moi. After reading this book, I now know I have no choice but to read at least one science book per theatre or film gig. If I had read this book prior to writing the narration for The Emperor & the Nightingale, I guarantee my script would have been totally different. I probably would have spent more time focusing on why the Nightingale (a female, alone) really sang. This book is filled with detail. The three concepts I'll ""take"" from this book are:(1) The more one thinks, the more coincidences one will experience. I never thought of that before and now I'm quite sure I'll never forget the concept. (2) Dawkins debate of Jung's collective subconscious. This is a concept I used to rely on for, oh, nearly every aspect of my craft. After reading this book, I can't help but think that my relying on the collective subconscious was a way of merely leveling the artistic expectation, instead of lifting it. (3)DNA has its own alphabet: G,C,T and A. When I learned that, I kind of got spooked. Then I suddenly remembered we only have 26 letters in our alphabet. Then I got spooked even more. This book isn't preachy, but it is instructive. I think I'll read The Selfish Gene next. Great bibliography in the back and a very helpful index for looking up interesting facts. This is a book to buy, not borrow. "
60,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25108-andy,4,"Like all of Dawkins, this is good, although this is the fifth book of his that I've read, and having moved roughly from greatest to least renown (The Selfish Gene, The Extended Phenotype, The Blind Watchmaker, The God Delusion, and now this), I may be at the point where I'd gain more by re-reading what I've already read than tackling his other writing. This is a decent book for people new to Dawkins, and it's gentler on scientific detail than usual, for those worried about getting lost in the material. It is expressly targeted at a non-scientific audience and has the stated goal of communicating the wonder and beauty of scientific discovery. Consequently it's the lowest-content book of his that I've read; many of the ideas and examples from nature can be found in his other books. Towards the end I thought there was a bit of a loss of focus as well; Dawkins starts writing about a subject that interests him (memes, cognition, the reflection of environment in our genes and brains, and parallels between the gene pool and the brain) without specific concern to beauty as revealed by the scientific method. The prose is clean and elegant as his prose always is, and reading this book was a pleasant way to spend time, but I'd point most readers to his other stuff. "
61,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1850370-lawrence,3,"I wanted to read this book because Mr. Dawkins --- in my mind at least --- has a reputation as an enemy of religion and rough apologist for atheism. Indeed, as I recall, Mr. D. wrote ""Unweaving the Rainbow"" as a softer, sweeter book given the distress that an earlier book (""The Selfish Gene""?) caused a number of readers. Mr. D. wanted to show that science without God can make us feel how wonderful the universe is in all of its complexity and magnificence.At any rate, the book, particularly in its three beginning chapters, is marked by good style and fascinating subject matter --- as in the description of the phenomenon of the rainbow and the explanation how the interpretation of the ""breakup"" of distant light by a prism leads us to know the elements that make up stars --- at least as they existed when the light began its long journey to our eyes. The remaining chapters drag, however, as Mr. D. necessarily goes into detail on the genome.Is Mr. D. successful in presenting ""wonder"" revealed by science without God? Well, yes, because, indeed, the makeup of the universe is wonderful and learning its details is a delight. But, of course, this wonder exists, and perhaps even more pointedly and expansively, when revealed by a science with God.Is Mr. D. successful in comforting the earlier readers who suffered the ""meaninglessness"" of a universe revealed by a science without God. Well, no. A universe without a pre-existing ethics or morality is still a universe that, in a second, can turn red in tooth and claw. In this respect, revealing the wonder revealed by science without God is a form of cheer leading. When the game is over, it is simply over. "
62,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7991468-jack,3,"I first heard about this book while initially reading The Selfish Gene. Advertisements easily accessed (http://www.amazon.com/Unweaving-Rainb...) will state that this book was written by Dawkins to respond to readers who asked him why he bothered to wake up in the morning, referring to the 'dehumanizing' theory of biology explained in The Selfish Gene. It follows that Unweaving The Rainbow was created to show people that there is beauty in science, perhaps more beauty than a scientifically-illiterate person has access to.The point I'm getting to is that this is an inaccurate portrayal of the book. While the book has some solid examples of beautiful physical phenomenon, large portions of the book are dedicated to dismissing (sometimes attacking) bad scientific poetry and ill-conceived perceptions of science. This is not to say that they were added clumsily. Each example and argument is well thought out, logical, and convincing.If the book has any faults, it is that it is allotted too much to highlighting bad examples of scientific poetry and perceptions of science rather than giving good examples of the awe-inspiring beauty of nature that science can permit us to view. This whole problem can be chalked up in the end to false-advertisement, the book would have been far less off-putting had it been said that gave both good and bad examples.In the end, Unweaving The Rainbow is informative and interesting but not the kind of book to get you out of a scientific slump."
63,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,4,"Another book read in my quest to either read books added to my ""to-read"" list in 2008 or get rid of 'em!This book was getting dated in 2008 and now reads even more so, but not necessarily because of its ideas. Dawkins thinks big and gives examples, leaving room for future research to fit into his theories. No, it seems dated because today's pop-sci authors seem to have better editors; Dawkins' ramblings sometimes come off as indulgent. I feel like I say this about a lot of books, and maybe it's because I'm an editor myself now, but it could really lose 10 to 20 percent of its material and be a much stronger book for it.But anyway, the ideas in this book are what's important, and what will stick with me: Unweaving the rainbow, the good/bad poetry of science, the discussion of whether it diminishes the beauty of science to understand it more fully. The idea of memes as ""software"" paralleling the ""hardware"" of genes has only become more prescient. The idea of gene ""cooperation"" is fascinating and new to me, though it seems a bit defensive in the context of Dawkins' book ""The Selfish Gene"". A lot of the book seemed defensive, actually. The parts I wish he would have left out were the parts with excessive explanations about why certain concepts relating to natural selection were true. Maybe he's just preaching to the choir, but for me, he could have said BECAUSE NATURAL SELECTION and skipped a lot of the BS. "
64,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2104670-bethany,3,"This is a strange one. I am a Chemistry student at University currently, and this book grabbed me not only because of the sciency content but also Richard Dawkins is considered to be a bit of a science know-it-all in non-scientific circles and the general public.The man is smart, no doubt about it.I think he should stick to what he knows though. There were some good snippets and at first I followed his thought process. Yes, we as a species are dumb. We can be fooled. This does not take away from us as human beings though.What's wrong with being fooled every now and then. Why do we need to think of numbers all the time - so what if a so called coincidence is actually not that coincidental. Can't we let it touch our lives and talk about it to others. The example used of the watch with the initials I think is vastly underestimated. I still think if that happened to me I would be amazed. And I would tell people if it came up.If little like this pleases us, then why not let it. Reducing everything to numbers takes away the enjoyment which is surely what we're craving. If I dabble in horoscopes it may not be because I'm so ignorant and narrow minded but because I genuinely enjoy reading the admittedly soppy and weak few sentences just as a break from harsher reading such as bills and missed appointment letters. This does not make me a twit or any less intelligent. I'm still a scientist who wants to have a little bit of frivolous low brain activity once in a while."

Some of it did go over my head but overall I found it to be fairly accessible.I came away wondering why we as humans are generally much more comfortable believing in gods, the paranormal, astrology and clairvoyance than believing in the things that have been scientifically proven and the beauty of the world around us and the astounding fact that we even exist here on Earth at all despite the odds that are against that happening.This book shows the reader that there is enough wonder in life, nature and science to keep even the most inquisitive of us going for longer than the average human life and it's there to be experienced by those of us who are willing to open our eyes and minds to it all."
66,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4854227-rin,3,"Richard Dawkins wrote this book to add some poetry or meaning to the world that his previous books tore down for most people. I didn't notice, until Dawkins, that a lot of people's realty relies on a bunch of fiction. Not just about ""god"" but the purpose and wonder that ""he"" gives them. I even, very often, hear athiests say that atheism made them depressed. I don't think this is because of lack of artistic prose, but a lack of imagination and appreciation for science in the sense of how things are. Science makes things sterile to people because they do not understand it. They have not developed the patterns of thinking that make answers to very difficult questions beautiful. If it were, there would be ""magic"" everywhere. There would be ""miracles"" everywhere. Alas, we live in a culture where science is synonymous with school so we have to tie in entertainment (like poetry) with reality in order to make it beautiful again. It's sad to me. I'm withholding two stars because Richard Dawkins wasted his time trying to reach out to the people who needed this book. All the talk about how deluded people are is played out. And I know this book isn't recent, but after reading him make the same arguments over and over using mental gymnastics, I probably won't look for another book from this guy. I get it."
67,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4631512-kirsty-darbyshire,4,"Fascinating ramblings on various bits of science (physical science as well as Dawkins usual biological science) that basically come down to how the wonders of science aren't appreciated as much as they ought to be. I found myself nodding my head and agreeing with Dawkins at about just about every turn. Questions like why people find astrology fascinating when astronomy is so much more amazing bemuse me too. The title refers to Keats claiming that Newton has destroyed the poetry of the rainbow by explaining how a prism splits light. Keats was talking rubbish and Newton just made rainbows even more fascinating. Dawkins keeps coming back to how science ought to be better at creating good poetry (and vice versa) , he comes up with lots of examples of people being misled by 'bad poetic science'.On the whole I can't believe it's taken me so long to actually read one of Dawkin's books. I wouldn't have read this if Darren hadn't have had it out of the library and kept reading bits of it out to me. It's that kind of book. In the early chapters at least nearly every sentence encapsulates an idea that you want to talk about and keep in your head to explain to other people. Definitely an author I'll be reading more of."
68,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2390727-lindsay-trulybooked,4,"This is probably the Richard Dawkins book that I have enjoyed the most. The first book I read from him was the God Delusion and while it was enlightening, there was an element of the preacher to it that I couldn't get past. While there is still that element here, it has changed from the pastor speaking to his flock to that of a mentor or a guide. It makes me look more favorably upon Dawkins and his message and helped to get me thinking about the way that we view the world. The idea that science would make the world less beautiful or less fascinating is a strange one for me. My mind has always been captured by the possibilities of science and more than that, the strange wonder that it can instill in a person. For anyone who is unsure about science or on the fence, this book probably will not convince you. Dawkins isn't the most approachable writer when it comes to reading comprehension and there are many ideas that he'll expect you to know. Still, it's a good read and I'd highly recommend it. Especially to those who aren't very fond of Dawkins after the God Delusion."
69,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1937339-s-p,3,"Not Dawkins' best book. It is a transition, when Dawkins was first awarded the professorship for the public understanding of science. Not yet a rabid atheist (very entertaining) and not quite the neodarwinist. Dawkins strays into areas he is not fully conversant with, while trying to balance the justification of the scientific method and the poetry of symbolism. I think this results in some awkwardness in the narrative and at times he gets stuck in a subject, straying into refuting the symbolism of other evolutionists with which he disagrees.Still the revelations about the Y chromosomes in birds and the particular consequence with reference to the cuckoo are both fascinating and enlightening. How can one doubt the power of the gene when presented with an animal which changes its egg design depending on the ancestral mother? Completely compelling."
70,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1984278-andrew-skretvedt,3,"It's good enough to be worth your time.Dawkins takes great care through the middle of the book to enumerate various examples of what he terms, ""bad poetic science,"" or the idea of using metaphor to explain aspects of some scientific knowledge and carrying an imperfect metaphor too far. The potential for misunderstanding or misapprehension engendered by this ""bad poetry"" could lead the novice student as well as the experienced investigator astray.In the last fifth, Dawkins takes us into a theory of mind in some ways, showing that the world our senses bring to us is not quite the world we percieve, but that our mind is integrating this sensory data to construct a real-time simulation of the world, and it is /this/ world which feels real to us.I'll stop there and leave you in the hands of this book's other reviewers, almost certainly better than I."
71,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28816458-elizabeth-humphries,5,"This book deserves a great rating on the strength of its first and last chapters alone. In them, Dawkins delivers the best explanations on why scientific explanation expands the world and our wonder towards it, instead of stripping away the ""magic"" and beauty born of ignorance. He also makes a clear and compelling case as to why science is a far more satisfying way to understand the world instead of relying on superstition and the supernatural.If you read nothing else, read the opening and closing.(I'll admit I was so taken by them, and by Dawkins' clear love for science, that I used a quote as the basis of my father's obituary. I suspect you can use Dawkins' words in the obituaries of most scientists.)In the chapters between, Dawkins explores specific examples of how science clarifies and explains natural phenomena. "
72,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4706292-adam-wiggins,4,"Science seeks discover the mysteries of the universe. In doing so, some claim, it destroys the mystery and poetry of the world. For example, when Newton used a prism to unweave white light into the rainbow, thereby showing how raindrops (acting as tiny prisms) create rainbows.Dawkins argues that the opposite is the case: science is a source of inspirational beauty. One example: Newton's pioneering work in optics (e.g., unweaving the rainbow with a prism) has unlocked many new wonders, such as our ability to measure the age of the universe by using the red-shift of distance galaxies.Unfortunately there are a lot of weak sections in the middle, but the early chapters and a fantastic final two chapters make this a great book for the science enthusiast."
73,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6909726-benjamin-smith,3,"Good read over all. Some very insightful things about evolution. The first part of the book was a bit slow, but it is written (I assume) for someone without a degree in physics or a real understanding of light and sound waves. The only thing I really had an issue with was Dawkins' bitter views on religion. It always surprises me to find really good scientists who believe that it is religion vs science and the two cannot coexist. I guess he has written an entire book dedicated to religion (or anti-religion). Perhaps his argument is more thorough there, but in 'Unweaving the Rainbow' it seemed a bit harsh and out of place. Overall, a very interesting and informative book filled with historical advances and naysayers of current technologies and theories."
74,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2909608-paul,2,"I'm not sure what the overall theme of the book is. There is a certain weakly argued suggestion that science and understanding the natural world (i.e. the ""rainbow"") is beautiful and that it should be admired like poetry. However, I find this is poorly realized. Instead I find the book highly skewed towards evolutionary biology and full of ramblings on details that seem too much for the purposes of the book. These tangents get pretty irritating at most points.Dawkins does a far better job in The Selfish Gene and the Blind Watchmaker--books on the topic of evolution. I absolutely loved them. But this one is a miss.Carl Sagan did a much better job on the ""science as poetry"" idea."

I found his explanations of scientific reasons for events fascinating and easy to understand especially as someone who is not particularly knowledgeable about Science. I thought the book got weak around the end when he attempted to explain the evolution of language. He admits that he was unaware of some British words not being translated well across the Atlantic(I'm not British or American, I knew what a mug was but had no clue what a patsy was until I googled it) so I'd be more inclined to look to a linguist like Chomsky for this information. A lot of the facts in the book are fascinating. I had no idea the extent of damage termites do in Australia. "

Dawkins makes a strong case why there is awe in science and the natural world, an awe that does not need superstition, paranormal activities, astrology, magic, and pseudo-science. He provides good explanations of what science is, isn't, and should be. Readers may disagree with some of his ideas, but overall his point that there is poetry, and sometimes ""bad poetry,"" in the scientific process is well-made. There are mysteries solved and more mysteries to be investigated, but mysteries of nature and the cosmos do not need strange beliefs or religion to be sacred (or poetic)."

His discussion of probability spaces are better handled by other authors and his riff on ""bad poetry"" comes across as a sequence of non-sequitors. Steven Jay Gould enjoyed playing with ideas and re-arranged systems almost constantly. Gould's ""what if?"" methodologies were taken as a bit too damaging."
78,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7698879-bas-kreuger,4,"Inspiring book, but not an easy read. The first few chapters and specifically the last two are intriguing (at least for me) where Dawkings describes the way we have developed our human brain and how we view the world.In the first chapters he describes the beauty of science in such a way that you want to be a poet and write poems about particles, atoms, neurons, gravity and all other wonderful natural phenomena that are the basic building blocks of pure science.More in line with the God Delusion is the way he treats astrology, mind-readers, mediums and like persons, less fitting in this book, but valuable against all pseudo science that is presented in the media."

The argument may at first sound Counter intuitive, but the book makes it clear through many good examples that although the mystical explanation may also be beautiful, the reasoned one more so. This book will nourish the mind with a great many scientific teachings, and I recommend it to anyone with a thirst for wonder.Full of Rich and compelling arguments against the 'Pseudo-science' that is so prominent today, this has been the one of the most entertaining books in my reading experience yet!"
80,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1689981-eric,4,"This is not Dawkins at his best, but it is a good, easy read that any skeptic should definitely get through. The book discusses, or attempts to discuss, the wonders of learning and science, and how they can be just as poetic as fairy tales. The title refers to charge leveled against Newton that he had destroyed the poetry of rainbows when he explained the mechanics of them. Dawkins' basic premise is that understanding rainbows, and other mysteries, enhances their majesty rather than destroys it."

The writing was condescending at times and far too simplistic at others. This book really needed a better editor and about 150 pages lopped off. I appreciate all he's done in fighting the quacks and crazies out there, but that doesn't stop me from not enjoying this book."
83,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142366-hans,3,"I think what Richard Dawkins was trying to attempt was noble however I am not convinced that he acompolished what he set out to achieve. Essentially the thesis of this book was a persuasive attempt to convince the reader that science can be very poetic and awe-inspiring, which I agree with. I even cheered him on hoping to find some new way of looking at science through a new paradigm. But, instead it felt more like a book of what science is and isn't and that didn't really inspire me much because that wasn't what I thought his original intention was. "
84,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215097-john,5,"In my opinion, Dawkins best book. After Newton published his scientific explaination of the technical color spectrum in the rainbow, the poet Keats famously acused Newton of ""unweaving (the mystery and majesty) of the rainbow."" Dawkins traces the huge volume of scientific advancement and understanding of the workings of the universe begun by Newton, to demonstrate that Newton, in contrast to his critis claim of destroying mystery and majesty, has only replaced it with the beauty of reality-based understanding and the majesty of science. This is an especially good book. "
85,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241024-joe,3,"Richard Dawkins explores science and its social implications. He compares and contrasts science to art and poetry: how they're similar, how they can each grow larger by having a better understanding of the other. Dawkins goes on to explore a number of pseudosciences, attacks on science, and misinterpretations of science.Unfortunately, the book is somewhat flat. Some of the discussions are interesting, but none of them seemed especially fresh to me. Dawkins clearly loves this material, but sometimes that leads to digressions that aren't almost seem like work to get through."
86,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4547012-erika,0,"Some passages of brilliance, and also some incredibly tedious (to me) passages that I could not even comprehend. When I struggled to sleep, this was the book I turned to - I only ever needed to read a page or two to fall asleep.Too much of the book was devoted to making counter-arguments to other people's ideas, which grew tiresome.Dawkins is at his best when he is not arguing against someone else, but writing about human lives and history, and talking about the amazing natural world.I really enjoyed certain parts of the book, but rather a lot of the book was hard to get through."
87,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10425041-bill,5,"An exceptional explanation of the world around us. Dawkins has a style of writing while explaining one of the most challenging ideas ever, that science (which is generally somehow considered to be anti-poetic) can inspire poets much deeper than the unknown they are inspired by. Coincidentally, I'm a fan of Richard Dawkins and having read three more books of him, it's true to say he always finds a different way to catch your attention. A great opportunity to understand some of the miracles of life, written and crystal clearly explained by one of the biggest skeptic scientists ever"
88,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6166956-gabe-hawkins,3,"This was beautifully written and the closest thing to a modern-day poetic masterpiece I have ever read. Reminiscent in many ways of Thoreau if he were a secular humanist scholar, one could consider this ""the softer side of Dawkins,"" and while his disdain for organized religion and anything remotely questioning of science still shines through in several parts, the poetic ways in which he explains his genuine wonder at the beauty of the Earth, the universe, and life makes one wish religions followed this sort of philosophy."
89,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/688965-sean,2,"It's not that this is bad, so much, but that I didn't much enjoy it. Dawkins is so much better when he's writing about the biological matters he's an expert in. This book is too vague in subject matter to be very engaging. The point of the book is to argue that science and knowledge make the world more poetic, not less. I agree. He supports this argument by discussing a seemingly random array of topics. I guess this book is for someone who likes the idea of things scientific, but hasn't ever read about it at all. In which case it might be quite good."
90,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8870705-warren,4,"Pretty much what any Dawkins fan has come to expect. Intricate, imaginative, and intellectually stimulating, or author walks us through the idea that science is a beautiful thing to be celebrated in the arts, and that while good poetry can enhance or scientific experience and understudying, bad poetry can misguide us (intentionally or unintentionally. You'll learn a lot of wonderful things about the natural world and roll your eyes at embarrassing bastardizations or misapplications of science like the dreaded astrology."

The book covers many interesting and challenging topics, however not all are well argued and the author’s prejudices do show through. On saying that the book is very readable and worth the 313 pages of narrative. Readers will find much to disagree with, much to agree with, and many things to reflect upon. I felt that the book was interesting and challenging in many parts, however due possible to its length, a little repetitive and heavy in some place, but overall a good read."

I don't know how often it is of him to make jokes like these, but this one is filled with with similar moments. Gentle and at ease in his explanations, swiftly transitioning from seemingly disconnected phenomena and scientific principles only to ""reweave"" everything back into a beautiful web stretching its soft threads before your eyes.Light, entertaining, and very touching at times.

In this book Dawkins roams freely over lots of interesting areas, delves deeply and explains the concepts with great clarity. He builds it all around a theme that poetry can confuse or illuminate science which leads rather neatly to his last chapter on how and why the brain and language evolved in humans. Along the way he diverges into some very long winded swipes at all his pet hates, religion, superstition, etc."

Admittedly, I didn't finish it for the paper, but I did get an ""A"" on it. I just dropped this book, not wanting to finish it, or just lacked the drive to is more specific. It turns out that I really liked this book. There were a few chapters where it seemed to drag but overall, I would say that it is a real information-packed read for the mind as helium to a balloon (and yes, I just made a lame reference to the title of the last chapter; don't judge me.)"
95,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/706735-brian,3,"Not Dawkins' best, IMO. He fails to see the magic of storytelling ... yes, knowing how the refracted light results in rainsbows is interesting, but it's not nearly as fun as the stories that spring up to explain them. I'm a scientist at heart, but Dawkins is just a bit too cold for my taste in this book. I prefer when he sticks to explaining science; when he tries to explain why the beauty of science is superior to alternatives, he strikes a sour note with me."
96,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/718577-evan,2,"I share Dawkin's views as expressed in this book, but I don't think this book was as well written or as well conceived as some of his others. It's somewhat disorganized and badly paced. Further, I got bored with many parts of it because they are so elementary and I come from a science background (this is forgivable, though, because his audience clearly includes and even targets those without a science background)."
97,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2044060-blake,4,"I thought this an interesting somewhat provocative book, which Dawkins gave good strengths through classical poetry and his own effulgent writing style. It's perhaps this, his light touch and graceful word, which I value most in the man.My only complaint was I would've like more of this poetry, more lines dedicated to grand thoughts. It did seem afterall to be his stated intent in early chapters."

I have an engineering education and didn't find it condescending or having too much attitude- I think he is just expressing his wonder at the universe and finds it hard to understand why others don't share that. "
99,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5970457-dave-powell,0,"I've wanted to read this book for a while and had heard Dawkins use some of the material from this book in various talks over the last few years. The driving idea behind this book is that just because we understand certain things about how the world works, this doesn't diminish our sense of awe and wonder in it. I found the first half of the book more compelling than the second which was a bit dry in parts but it was a worthwhile read."
100,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/711519-richard,4,"  As others have said, this is a love letter to science. Each chapter is focused on one aspect of science and explains why it is so amazing. About 2/3s of the way through the book he goes on a bit of a tirade clarifying points from the selfish gene and refuting some other authors books. He sounds a bit bitter. After he gets that out of his system, the book picks back up and is again enjoyable."
101,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56710-ariel,0,The list of books I'm not finishing is growing as I become more comfortable moving on when something is not what I wanted. I expected more stories about science and less of a story of why science is important and how scientists should tell their stories. I expected less pondering so on the intersection of poetry and science and frankly I didn't feel like I wanted to wade through the rest of it so I stopped on the second chapter.
102,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1299389-rachelfm,3,"Pretty accessible, would be good for people without much science background. The detour into debunking hucksterism got a little long, and I just about busted a gut laughing when, in the chapter on perception and probability the author used the phrase ""random order."" Parts are certainly though-provoking, and I feel I have a clearer understanding of several phenomena in astronomy and optics than I had before."

Along the way, he shows that the knowledge which science can bestow on us can be as poetic and awe-inspiring as anything that Romantics (modern-day or otherwise) have to offer."
104,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45113256-louis,5,"This is one of those books that I reread once a year or so, not just because it's smart, interesting and full of essential ideas, but because it's a fantastic work of literature as well. It contains fascinating insights expressed in beautifully poetic language; a rousing defense of reason and rationality and it makes the case that science, like art, can and should be enjoyed and celebrated by everyone. This books is a master class on how to write about science, or any topic really."

There are more efficient and more entertaining ways to learn about the world."

This is particularly good for me as I often read more than one book at once which doesn't work with science books that are all about the same thing because you forget things which makes it really hard to understand what's going on when you come back to a book. In comparison to other Dawkins books that I've read, this is my favourite so far. It just seemed more readable than the others. "

109,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2786537-will,4,"Another good book, this time focusing more on the magic of science, rather than Dawkins' now more renound diatribes against religion (which I don't oppose). I think I read this at a similar time to reading various other Dawkins books, as well as philosophy of science books; October 2006, I think (since I was in France at the time, and think I finished it there)."

Keats believed that Newton specifically, and Science in general had killed the beauty of the rainbow by explaining it. The mystery is gone! Yet, the truth is far more beautiful than any story about leprechauns and pots of gold. The truth about Snel's law and the equations of Snell's law. Even with the mystery revealed, the rainbow is still beautiful."

Reading them (although I understand about 1/3 of what he is saying) gives you a complete new perspective. He is so darn intelligent and has a very scientific way of looking at our universe. I learn a lot. He explains science really well and uses language that stuns a reader like me. I will definetely read his books again.

150,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/330043-chris-lawnsby,4,"I only gave this 4 stars on the ""Richard Dawkins"" scale. Everything he writes is freaking amazing. This is as well. It's basically a bunch of more or less unrelated essays. It's really good."
151,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1493821-tony,2,The worst of Dawkin's books. His other books are excellent. this one is just satisfactory. 
152,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1580989-emma,5,If I could give this ten stars out of five I would. It's my favourite book. I would recommend this to everyone to read. Beautiful.
153,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1637270-rosie,5,I found this book to be very inspiring and a great pleasure to read. It gives so many examples of the amazing nature of the world and universe around us.
154,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858336-john,0,"One of the greatest books I've yet read. The opening lines alone are, without exaggeration, life changing."
155,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,3,I must admit to being somewhat disappointed with this book. It's a collection of essays that vary considerably in both interest and quality. 
156,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7964603-mensch,3,Dawkins declares his love of science and goes on to explain this to his reader. The book itself is a convincing argument of why the demystification of the world by science isn't a bad thing at all.
157,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2344676-neil,3,"Dawkins has interesting insights and numerous exciting passages, but they come sporadically and it doesn't cohere too well. "
158,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1088579-richard,0,Richard answers his critics that complain atheism is cold and sterile. Awe is in the eye of the beholder. 
159,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2674867-lynn,4,"Dawkins shows that science is beautiful. Not one of his best books, but still 4 stars."
160,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2970232-adam,3,It was thought provoking. You gotta be in the right mood for Dawkins though. I had to set it aside for a while and take another swipe at it.
161,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1258538-ann,3,"It was a good, interesting, thought provoking book. But it seemed a little meandering...more like a group of good essays instead of a coherent book. "
162,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4057184-joel,4,Quite touching and provides a strong empirical basis for merging an understanding of science with discovering the beauty of the natural world. I was impressed by his command of literary figures.
163,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906769-d-j,5,Like all Dawkins books--clear and interesting. I always learn something I'd never before heard of when I read Dawkins. This book was a delight.
164,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2490747-jeremy,3,"Not the best of Dawkins' work to be sure, however I did learn a few fascinating tidbits. I suppose I was left yearning for more."
165,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4555501-rob,5,I want the opening para of this book to be read at my funeral.
166,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069092-brad,4,Always worth re-reading the brilliant Dr. Dawkins when the winter is long and cold and bleak; the good professor never fails to eloquently deliver the full beauty of the natural world.
167,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4001825-irene,3,"Not the best of his books, but still interesting and intriguing."
168,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2413543-greg-collver,4,"I enjoyed the book, it was easy to read. I did not make as many notes as I did on his other books, but I did make about 3 pages of notes on chapter 11, ""reweaving the world""."
169,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6485-elizabeth,0,As heard on Point of Inquiry.
170,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4122501-chris-davis,3,This is very much like other general science books I have read. It is still enjoyable. He makes some great points on eye witness evidence.
171,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5958547-andy-turner,5,A book generally reflecting on the endless search for scientific explanation.
172,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4117805-james,4,Like devil's chaplain but slightly more cohesive.
173,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3113322-fran,3,"is somewhat disappointing, it lacks scientific depth, recommended for popular science readers without sufficient training"
174,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7247043-jodip,4,I liked Dawkins' very personal approach to this subject matter. I have always been moved by scientific discovery and he does a great job of laying out the case for this in this book.

176,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3735884-stephen-cranney,3,"First half of the book is really good, but then he starts to wander a bit. Also, some of his information about genetics is out-of-date. "
177,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9641743-dawn,2,"I was expecting a little more ""wonder"" and didn't find it. I couldn't finish it, for it just wasn't what I thought it would be. Certainly not the author's fault."
178,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10116040-baran-demirok,3,  The book loses its integrity after chapter 10 
179,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4586546-pippa,4,If Richard Dawkins could stay off the religion debate he would be a superb writer. As it is I find it well worth putting up with the diatribes for some very well explained science.
180,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10687005-dave-steinbrunn,2,"Very sympathetic to his thesis, but it was like reading molasses "
181,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10863356-simon-gildea,0,My favourite book. Life affirming.Written with real passion for science and contains the meaning of life - which is so simple when thought about
182,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13581115-eduard-horak,5,"  This is a classic. The book opened my mind substantially. My favourite parts are Chapter 1, 6, 7 and 12 "
183,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15563179-mateusz,4,Nice explanation for our desire to assign supernatural meaning to weird things happening in our lives.
184,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15973429-cherry-martin,3,"Some fascinating points raised in this book, but as I can't help but feel with Dawkins, he occasionally strays from the point he's trying to make with unnecessary information."
185,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17835663-luke-funnell,5,"What an Amazing book, it puts the poetry into science and leaves you wondering in wonderment at the magic of reality."
186,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,2,This is the first book by Dawkins that I found disappointing. It is really just a series of random musing by the author about this that and the other thing. 
187,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10200804-joseph,3,"Some good material, but lacking in direction and cohesiveness. I think it reads more like a conversation he wanted to have, rather than an eloquently executed argument. "
188,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7913813-carlo-estadilla,5,This book was very inspiring. I'm now reframing my life into pursuing and advancing science as much as I can with my lifetime. 
189,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7115424-clorush,3,"I never want to do what the scientists do, but I do want to know what if feels like to be a scientist.And this book do just that."
190,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15649908-dalia-ismail,4,Now that I've parted with this book I'm not sure which feeling predominates the other: the lightheadedness from the poetic style or the dizziness of added weight of information to my brain. 
191,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17899448-sara,3,"I wanted to like this more, but I just couldn't get into it for some reason. It was kinda dry and a touch repetitive. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either."
192,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27890430-russ-bottari,5,Great
193,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34898636-vivian,1,Book ReviewThe book is so fancy. It is da business. It makes complete and utter sense. It was like an ephiphany. If only everything else in my life was as interesting as this book. Boom!
194,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19379200-subham-saha,3,"Same....if ne1 has read the selfish gene(audio version), he should not read other Dawkins works; they become very monotonous after that...:("
195,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21158516-ron-joniak,3,Richard Dawkins is an excellent author. This book was enjoyable and presented the debate between poetry and science and whether or not science hinders or helps humanity's love for life. 
196,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31302406-lori,3,"The author focuses on how the evolution of sight, and its biological, and physical underpinnings. Hence the name. It is not as insightful—at a fundamental level—as the author's other books."
197,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5292078-kathy,3,"one incredibly excellent chapter on bad poetry in science writing, otherwise, well, I guess i'm glad I read it all."
198,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28000871-mohammed-alshehri,3,"lots and lots of redundant and irrelevant information , other than that it is a great book ."
199,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43011397-matthew-wilson,4,"I'd give this 3.5 starts if Goodreads let me. Some chapters were excellent, others just ho-hum. However, I think each reader will have a unique opinion regarding which are which."
200,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/158884-kapila-chandran-sengupta,5,Excellent Book! I wish I had majored in Science in school instead of flaking ;) The marvels of our universe are breathtaking and I hope all my friends grab a copy of this. 
201,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60470657-johnathongis-1,0,its a good book I have nothing bad to say. 
202,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1199899-john,0,Learning about how nature works doesn't detract from its beauty and awesomeness.
203,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1737114-juliusnajab,5,I love science books that reveal the beauty and wonder of science.
204,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,5,In a word: brilliant!
205,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26224701-mac,1,"Richard Dawkins is a smug, obnoxious ass."

209,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4995129-richard,5,Q: How do you do science writing? A: Like this. 
210,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27332154-caleb-greenwood,5,"I haven't finished this cover to cover, but I can say I loved what I read and hope to revisit. Unweaving is the poetics of science, managing to inspire the pre-scientific version of me into reforming how wondrous nature can really be. Anyone who views the natural world as paling to the innovation of technology would due well to read this; in many ways the complexity of the natural world is the inspiration for innovation. Seriously, this book gets you thinking...and smiling at just how much is out there to see and discover."
211,0618056734,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4605502-david-melbie,0,Excellent. I really enjoyed this book. I wouldn't begin to know how to review this one yet. I must read it again.
