0,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Thirteen things that don’t make senseI worried about starting this book – worried much more than I ought to have worried – but worried nonetheless. I mean, things could only be bad. Here was a book that was going to tell me about thirteen things that required a ‘paradigm shift’ in science. It was the number 13 that bothered me more than anything else. The world is full of morons and one of the surest ways of spotting such a moron is via numerology. Crystals are also good, well, as is homeopathy. There will be more on homeopathy later.So, I started this one through gritted teeth. And then he started off by discussing good old Thomas Kuhn – one of my least favourite philosophers. I was caught on the horns of a dilemma, either this guy was going to be some fruit-cake with a pocket full of god, or crystals, or vials for aromatherapy or he was going to be an irrationalist of the modern philosophy of science types (see Popper or Kuhn or their monster child Feyerabend) who see all science as devoid of objective reality and awaiting a great and new story-teller (such as a Newton, Einstein or Copernicus) to provide us with the next great paradigm in the endless sequence of shifts in the partial truths that scientific theories inevitably turn out to be.But this book was nothing like this – and I can only recommend it whole-heartedly. Okay, so he does go on a bit about Kuhn’s Structure of Scientific Revolutions and is quite uncritical of the whole notion of paradigm shifts – but I guess it would be asking too much for him not to do this. Anyway, it is hard to argue that this idea does not fit nicely with his theme.Taken at the biggest picture level Kuhn’s idea is that we tend to create a ‘scientific orthodoxy’ that determines what is worth investigating and what is beyond the bounds of legitimate scientific research. Science builds up a system of interconnecting theories and ideas and these become the landscape of the accepted. Within that landscape individual scientists in the community of science look at ways in which they can expand our knowledge of that landscape – what they don’t do and what there are real disincentives for attempting (according to Kuhn) is to restructure the landscape to such an extent that we have mountains where we once had planes. However, facts are stubborn things and now and again our investigations throw up something that simply doesn’t fit with accepted theories. In such cases the scientific community has one of three choices – ignore the fact (always a favourite), get it to fit into the established paradigm (tweak it) or jettison our established theories and start again (always the last choice – and a bloody good thing too!).Well, not that we ever actually do the last one, not anymore. Whatever Einstein did to Newton it wasn’t starting over again. Which is my major criticism of Kuhn, but enough of that already. What are we to do if stuff we observe in the real world just doesn’t fit with our theories of how the real world ought to operate? I’m not talking about supposed problems with our theories – you know, how they don’t account for auras or Feng Shui – but stuff real scientists have found and can’t explain.For a long time I’ve been an on again / off again reader of New Scientist. The problem is that it comes out too frequently for me to read anything other that it – so I have stopped subscribing to it. I had exactly the same problem when learning to speak Italian – learning Italian was all I could do and that was simply asking too much. Over the years I’ve read innumerable articles on all manner of interesting things. But one of the articles that I read years ago that fascinated me and that I never heard about again is discussed in this book – the problem with the Pioneer missions. In the 1970s we sent the only man made objects ever out of the solar system. You remember, there was that gold disk with music and photographs of people and the man and the woman waving – oh, and the fact the woman didn’t have any indication that she had genitalia was to protect the project from being cancelled by the incredibly prudish I read somewhere. But I digress, for a bit of a change... When they sent these probes they decided that they might as well try to test Einstein’s general theory of relativity at the same time. And why not, indeed? The problem was (and is) that the damn things aren’t where they are supposed to be according to either Newton or general relativity. People have done everything to try to explain the discrepancy – thinking that there was something that had gone wrong on the probes themselves or such – but all of the theories have turned up nothing that would explain the problem. Now, when I read about this years ago in New Scientist I was quite excited by it. Not because it might explain why the Pioneer probes were slightly off course, but because it might explain that other slight inconvenience – where someone has hidden 90-odd percent of the universe. If ever we needed a paradigm shift it is in cosmology. As Oscar Wilde might have said (if given the chance) losing over 90% of the universe just looks like carelessness.But what if gravity does not work as we think it does over interstellar distances? Might that help to explain where most of the universe has gotten to while we weren’t looking? I don’t know enough about science to say. I generally don’t buy every edition of New Scientist, not even most, but one thing that will get me to buy a copy is if there is a cover story about dark matter, dark energy or gravity. Something is seriously wrong and I’m looking forward to seeing what better minds than mine come up with to help explain it.And that is what this book is about. There are a great many things in science that simply do not make any sense at all and they are calling out for someone to make sense of them. Not by ‘turning to God’ or holding crystals – but by coming up with a new way to explain the world. I for one am looking forward to learning how these problems described in this book are resolved.I’ve only found out after reading this book that the author writes for New Scientist and based this book on an article he wrote in New Scientist called 13 Things that Don’t Make Sense. These really are some of the issues that any thinking human ought to be keeping an eye on. These are the issues that every thinking human being ought to know actually are issues. A while ago I started reading a book called I Don’t Have Enough Faith to be an Atheist and stopped because, well, the people who wrote that book just didn’t know enough about science or atheism to make any competent assessment of what they were talking about. It was a book written to counter Richard Dawkins by people who hadn’t bothered to read Richard Dawkins. Those issues are done and dusted – these thirteen are the real issues facing modern humanity, not whether some boy God dressed in blue skin is the Lord of the Dance, or however that fairytale goes again.Brooks does warn that most people won’t be very happy with him including Homeopathy as one of the things that don’t make sense. And he is right – I’m not happy with him including Homeopathy. But then, the book wasn’t written to make anyone particularly happy and I’m prepared to admit that it is possible that the final death blow is yet to be delivered to this most bizarre of alternative medicines. That said, if Homeopathy is proven to work it will be the one that will most shift our paradigms – and then some.The New Scientist article this book was based on can be found here:http://space.newscientist.com/article..."
1,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin,3,"Fairly interesting account of certain anomalies in science. Dark matter, Cold Fusion and some others. A lot of what comes out here is the fact that the scientific community is as human as the rest of us. So often if findings fly in the face of ""established scientific fact"" the person making the finding or following up on the research is completely ruined. As in a researcher with a doctorate ending his days as a clerk in a stockroom or a Nobel laureate forced into retirement.I got this out of curiosity and was drawn in quickly. The statement that the statement which leads to or presage more scientific discoveries is not ""Eureka"" but ""that's funny"".The book is very readable and interesting. I suspect it will seem very elementary to any among the readers who are actually functioning researchers (Sheldon Cooper would surly make fun of it). While it does draw the reader in at times it draws it's stories out a bit much and it is possible that by the time you move from one subject to the next you'll be more than ready to do so (I was). Still enjoyable and if this is something that interests you it's a good book for the intelligent layman.  "
2,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/825885-mazola1,3,"In 13 Things That Don't Make Sense, Michael Brooks takes a brief look at 13 thorny problems which science has no good solution to. The problems are explained in simple terms, and include such things as death, sex, life, dark matter, and the placebo effect. What Brooks shows is that despite the best efforts of generations of scientists, and all the marvels of modern technology, we are far from understanding even such basic things as what the universe is made of and what it means to be alive. A related, and far more interesting, topic which runs through the book is the way scientists do science. Although we tend to think of science as fact or evidence based, in fact, scientists too have their preconceived ideas and prejudices to which they cling even in the face of contrary evidence. And these can be surprisingly hard to change.Brooks refers to Kuhn's idea that science changes by paradigm shifts. And he shows why often the paradigm doesn't shift until most of the adherents of the old one die off. In other words, scientists, too, suffer from the herd mentality. As proof, he cites the fact that Einstein couldn't get a job teaching physics even after publishing papers which radically altered the structure of physics. Biologists hesitate to report findings that many species of animals engage in homosexual behavior, fearing the consequences. Because of the career demolishing impact of the first report of cold fusion, most researchers now won't get anywhere near cold fusion, despite the fact that there is probably something there worth looking into. And the list goes on and on. So add to the 13 things in Brooks' book the curious timidity of many scientists to do research into or to report facts in areas which seem outlandish or contrary to conventional wisdom. "
3,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1450485-buck,3,"Consistently mind-blowing - until about the halfway point, where the focus shifts from the cosmic to the prosaic. Now granted, I'm a scientific ignoramus, but I can't be alone in feeling that cosmology is just way sexier than biology, so to go from heady speculations about a multiplicity of universes to - of all sublunary things - the wonders of homeopathy -- well, it kind of killed my buzz.Highly recommended, in any case, especially for those who, like me, are impatient with the nuts and bolts of science but take a dilletantish interest in the big questions.Oh - and here's a fun little tidbit I picked up from Brooks. It turns out that when Einstein made his famous remark about God's not playing dice with the universe, Niels Bohr was there to deliver a brilliant slapdown. 'Einstein,' he said, 'Stop telling God what to do.' How did I not know this? Over the years, I could have confounded a lot of physics geeks (and Jesus freaks) with that one."
4,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,4,"I really enjoyed this book. In a world where most geographical frontiers have already been explored it's inspiring to read about the wild west of science where our knowledge is small and great discoveries are still to be made.The author did a good job of interweaving the 13 things so the book felt like a single work and not 13 distinct essays. There are interesting humans elements to the book. It's fascinating how the careers of so many scientists were affected by their 'discoveries.' The final chapter on homeopathy, the one I almost skipped because the topic seemed like an open-and-shut case, surprisingly turned out to be the most interesting. I also really enjoyed the discussion on dark matter and the way that single topic was interwoven throughout the book. "
5,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"Some of these things are sort of covered in Brooks’ other book, At the Edge of Uncertainty, while others weren’t. There’s a bunch of interesting stuff about extraterrestrial intelligence and the experiments looking for microbial life on Mars, for instance. As with the other book, Brooks gives clear explanations. In fact, reading both books illuminated more about the topics that were in both. Each topic leads to the next in a very logical way, too.The topic selections are all interesting: life on Mars, the ‘wow’ signal, discrepancies about universal constants… It may not all be of interest to every reader, but it’s a good selection of scientific mysteries and frontiers. It explores them quite well, without going into too much detail.Very much a pop science book, suitable for readers of New Scientist and similar publications. Which isn’t surprising, since he was an editor for that magazine!Originally posted here."
6,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1652898-karen,0,"14th thing that doesn't make sense: Covers on public toilet seats. I mean no-one ever puts it down, and if they do, do you want to touch a public toilet seat cover to lift it up? I don't. 15th thing that doesn't make sense: Most people have two feet, thus two socks. Most people put two socks into the wash, there surely can't be many who sniff their socks and decide that one of them could go another day. So what happens then? It is a complete mystery to me how the collection of single socks comes about, and indeed continues to grow. Are there single socks orbiting the Earth somewhere? Does the washing machine in the cellar eat them?16th thing that doesn't make sense: my trying to read this book at the moment. I checked out some reviews here at GR and found that it goes from the cosmos to the human, so I started reading it backwards, going t'other way about, and virtually giving up when I got past sex and death. I'm sure that Mr Brooks is very competent at explaining physics stuff to science-challenged people like me, but I just couldn't summon the concentration when there is so much that I should be reading for school, for work, to justify my subscription to Die Zeit. It's all quite fascinating, but worryingly inconclusive. That is the message: there's still lots we don't know, but I for one certainly don't want to hear that there might actually be something in the quackery that is called homeopathy. I mean that friend of mine whose son had a stiff neck, and dashed off to the homeopath for 'globuli'. They were sold to her at some inflated price with the wonderfully cynical advice ""If he doesn't feel better after five days, then come back"" FIVE DAYS??? A stiff neck will go away by itself within three days, so these 'globuli' must have been SLOWING THE PROCESS DOWN!!! And here I read that there is a chance that the structure of water might be in some way significant. Ammunition for the quacks. Tsk tsk. "
7,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"I realized, before starting this book, that some of the topics might be ""old hat"". I've read about the dark matter/dark energy mystery in a number of books. But I wasn't ready for the other fascinating mysteries, that truly surprised me. For example, I thought that the placebo effect was well understood. But evidently not. For example, the common drug Valium (dizaepam) has a strong effect; but only if the person taking it understands what the effect should be. Tests have shown that the drug is no more effective than a placebo, when subjects are not told that it should reduce their anxiety levels. The FDA and the entire pharmaceutical industry relies on double-blind tests against placebos, but the author wonders if this may be a relatively meaningless test for some types of medicines.Other questions also surprised me. Why do organisms die? Still unknown. Is there life on Mars? The experts have waffled on this question, as the equipment/sensors on board the Viking spacecraft have been shown to be orders of magnitude less sensitive than originally thought. Why has sexual reproduction evolved through natural selection? Also not understood. Is there such a thing as free will? Recent experiments have shown that our actions are not as self-induced as one might think. I thought that cold fusion was dead; but apparently not--research has been stymied by the career-breaking consequences that it has had on reputable scientists."
8,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4528663-bandit,3,"Behold the Socratic paradox. Socrates said I know that I know nothing. Well, allegedly he said that, at least according to Plato's account of Socrates life. But it does sum up how one can walk away feeling after reading this book. It's a feeling that I've long contended with the more I read and learn about sciences, particularly astronomy. Several classes and many books on the subject later and there is still so much supposition and guesswork and uncertainty. Virtually 96 percent of cosmos is comprised of dark matter and dark energy (of which everyone's pretty much in the dark about), what we know is infinitesimal, what we don't is daunting. And that's only one of the subjects. Brooks in this book highlights some of the things we don't know and/or that don't really makes sense. At least as of yet, until the paradigm shift enters into it. So it's a humbling kind of a reading experience, but it's interesting enough in a reader's digest sort of way, it provides some good basic information for those who are not familiar with the subjects and a nice refresher for those who are. It's fairly educational, concise and written in an easy to process manner. While personally I prefer nonfiction written with more personality and a humorous approach if possible, Brooks' MO is a more serious, personality free (until the epilogue) approach, but it still made for a pretty good read about our ineffable mysterious world. Sense shall be made."
9,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1066467-bob,4,"The further into the book I read the more I got into it as it progressed from the cosmological to the physical to the biological. Most intriguing to me were the looks at cold fusion, free will, the placebo effect, and homeopathy. With thirteen areas examined, including life, sex and death, there is probably something here for everyone. Everyone, except those who are unwilling to challenge their assumptions."
10,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27047099-allison,4,"Such a cool read. All of the chapters on astronomy caught my full attention -- from space probes to physics to dark matter to aliens -- it's all extremely COOL!The chapter on Free Will was also pretty neat. Do we really have free will? Looks like we may not. What!? Cool!The other chapters are interesting too -- Life, Death, Sex, Placebo Effect, Microbiology, others -- and I really can recommend this book to anyone who gets a massive kick out of science reading, like I do. Loved it. I wonder if an updated version of this book would change much..."
11,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3359025-jigar-brahmbhatt,2,"The purpose of this book is to show, by 13 different examples, how science has a long way to go before it can assure us that ""all is under control"". Somehow, we are aware of this limitation. I am still unsure of the writer's stance. Is he in favor of science? He explains one set of difficulties scientists faced in a certain area of research, before moving on to another. There are interesting bits of information peppered in, which is all this book has to offer in my opinion, so that you can sound a little smarter if a related conversation sparks up among your friends. This is not a science book with a vision to theorize or bring under an umbrella varied separated notions of reality. It has no such scientific goal as such. Neither it aims to illuminate with great clarity the complex theories of science for the laymen (the way books by Feynman or say Brain Greene are written). What I mean is, if you have read a great deal of pop-science, then you already know most of what is discussed here. Because this book is what its title suggests, and if that's what you look for, it will work for you. I particularly enjoyed the sections on Dark Matter and Free Will. "

Secondly, because it prods us to keep asking questions: What are we taking for granted? Is this bit of knowledge reached by consensus or established by conformity (or worse yet, complacence)? What other approaches are there to it? What facts do not fit the picture? How do we adjust our goggles?(That last one reminds me of a saying I first saw in The Broken God by David Zindell: Beliefs are the eyelids of the mind.)More ruminations to follow."
13,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/983193-peter,2,"Michael Brooks only really had about 11 interesting things that science has trouble explaining. ""Homeopathy"" and ""Free Will"" seemed kind of tacked on in order to reach 13. ""11 things that don't make sense"" being the far less catchy title."
14,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"13 Things That Don’t Make Sense: The Most Baffling Scientific Mysteries of Our Time by Michael Brooks“13 Things That Don’t Make Sense” is a provocative look at 13 scientific wide-ranging mysteries. Michael Brooks holds a PhD in Quantum Physics, editor and now consultant for New Scientist magazine, takes the reader on the wonderful journey of scientific mysteries. Since the publishing of this book a few of these mysteries have been resolved. This provocative 256-page book includes the following thirteen mysteries/chapters: 1. The Missing Universe, 2. The Pioneer Anomaly, 3. Varying Constants, 4. Cold Fusion, 5. Life, 6. Viking, 7. The Wow! Signal, 8. A Giant Virus, 9. Death, 10. Sex, 11. Free Will, 12. The Placebo Effect, and 13. Homeopathy. Positives: 1.	A well-written, well-researched and entertaining book.2.	The writing is fair and even-handed almost too much so. 3.	The fascinating topic of scientific mysteries in the capable hands of Dr. Brooks. “The future of science depends on identifying the things that don't make sense; our attempts to explain anomalies are exactly what drives science forward.”4.	Excellent format! Each chapter is about a specific scientific mystery and the author cleverly leads the end of the previous chapter into the next one. 5.	Interesting facts spruced throughout the book. “Color is our way of interpreting the frequency of—that is, the number of waves per second in—radiation. When we see a rainbow, what we see is radiation of varying frequencies. The violet light is a relatively high-frequency radiation, the red is a lower frequency; everything else is somewhere in between.”6.	Profound and practical practices in science. “They won't embrace the extraordinary until they rule out the ordinary.”7.	Provocative questions that drive the narrative. “Have the laws of physics remained the same for all time?”8.	An interesting look at cold fusion. “To get energy out of atoms, you either have to break up their cores—a process called nuclear fission—or join different atoms together by nuclear fusion.”9.	One of the deepest concepts, the concept of what constitutes life. “If creating life is ""simply"" a matter of putting the right chemicals together under the right conditions, there's still no consensus about what ""right"" actually is—for the chemicals or the conditions.”10.	It never hurts to quote some of the greatest thinkers, consider the late great Carl Sagan, “We live on a hunk of rock and metal that circles a humdrum star that is one of 400 billion other stars that make up the Milky Way Galaxy which is one of billions of other galaxies which make up a universe which may be one of a very large number, perhaps an infinite number, of other universes. That is a perspective on human life and our culture that is well worth pondering.”11.	Is there life on Mars? Find out about some of the attempts made. “One of the strongest arguments against life existing on Mars has always been the harshness of the environment: low temperatures, a wispy thin atmosphere, and the lack of liquid water all count against the development of living organisms.”12.	A look at Occam’s razor applied to aliens. “Occam's razor, and it says that, given a number of options, you should always go for the simplest, most straightforward one.”13.	A fascinating look at the Giant Virus. “There were the eukaryotes, the advanced organisms like animals and plants whose large and complex cells contained a nucleus that held inheritable information. The other branch was the simpler prokaryotes, such as bacteria, which have cells without a nucleus.”14.	A look at death. “Over the years, though, evidence mounted up supporting Kirkwood's idea that aging is due to a slow, steady buildup of defects in our cells and organs.”15.	Why the need for sex? “In general, the random genetic drift due to chance variation offers the best hope of explaining the apparent advantage of sex.”16.	Homosexuality in the animal kingdom. “Bruce Bagemihl's ten-year labor of love, Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity, reports that more than 450 species have been documented engaging in nonprocreative sexual behavior—including long-term pairings.”17.	A fascinating look at free will. “The lesson we learn from all this is that our minds do not exist separately from the physical material of our bodies. Though it is a scary and entirely unwelcome observation, we are brain-machines. We do not have what we think of as free will.” “In the illusion of free will, it seems we have been equipped with a neurological sleight of hand that, while contrarational, helps us deal with a complex social and physical environment.”18.	So what about the placebo effect? “The general conclusion here, it seems, is that the placebo effect is due to chemistry.”19.	Why is homeopathy still in existence? “According to the World Health Organization, it now forms an integral part of the national health-care systems of a huge swath of countries including Germany, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Mexico.” “An assessment of homeopathy using the criteria of known scientific phenomena says it simply cannot work; no wonder Sir John Forbes, the physician to Queen Victoria's household, called it ""an outrage to human reason.”20.	Notes and sources provided.Negatives:1.	Since the book was released in 2008 some of the anomalies have been resolved if not really not taken seriously. As an example, the Pioneer Anomaly was resolved; feel free to look it up.2.	I felt Dr. Brooks was a little too generous toward the wrong side of scientific consensus. As example, the discarded homeopathy.3.	Lack of charts and diagrams that would have complemented the sound narrative.4.	Though immersed to various degrees here and there I would have liked to see Dr. Brooks be clearer on what the scientific consensus is for each chapter.In summary, I really liked this book. The book holds up quite well despite being released in 2008. My only gripe is not making perfectly clear what the scientific consensus is for each mystery, also, I would have discarded homeopathy as a scientific mystery. That said, a fun book to read, I recommend it! Further suggestions: “At the Edge of Uncertainty” by the same author, “The Big Picture” by Sean Carroll, “Now: The Physics of Time” by Richard A. Muller, “13:8: The Quest to Find the True Age of the Universe and the Theory of Everything” by John Gribbin, “Know This: Today’s Most Interesting and Important Scientific Ideas, Discoveries, and Developments” by John Brockman” and “The Island of Knowledge” by Marcelo Gleiser.

15,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10655649-odhran,2,"This is, all in all, pretty weak. There are certainly some interesting things raised in the book - good summaries of some of the alternative theories raised to explain things like the prevalence of dark matter, and so on. At the same time, science has moved on a fair bit since the book was written. The Pioneer Anomaly, for example, has been explained, to the apparent satisfaction of scientists. The experiments supposedly debunking free will have, possibly, been shown to be deeply problematic and perhaps not saying what they were thought to have said. (Although, as a hard determinist and philosophy-hater, I don't think that the concept of free will is actually in any way meaningful, at least how it's usually expressed.)Now, perhaps it's a bit unfair to criticise a book for stuff which has only come to light in the past few years. However, the fact that these things have gotten simple explanations - the roots of which have been around for a while - means it at least needs to be raised. I wouldn't be so churlish as to mark down the book for it, however.The real problem, I think, is Brooks' willingness to accept odd fringe theories as having equal validity as established ones. Yes, Kuhn, renegade scientists, paradigm shifts, blah blah blah. It is quite obvious that the standard theories do not adequately explain the universe, at least in quite the way we want. But that doesn't mean that the fringe stuff is right. After all, Newtonian physics are still, as a basic approximation, valid for most things, even after the development of Einsteinian physics into the standard model.And then there's the ludicrous stuff. Cold fusion gets a remarkably sympathetic treatment - we are led to believe that there's something important there, because the US military have invested money in it. Presumably we're meant to ignore their distance viewing experiments, and MKUltra, and whatever else. The military has lots of money, it can afford to throw cash at the fringes just in case that might be advantageous. The explanations for cold fusion which propose experimental errors or odd conditions (such that it might be a function of the palladium samples used, for example) are far more convincing, but they are, if not dismissed, certainly tainted by implication.And then there's homeopathy. Seriously, by now surely we've realised that it's probably best explained by a combination of placebo, regression to the mean, a good bedside manner, and perhaps a few other things? I mean, it's not like every study ever hasn't confirmed this. But no, Brooks is talking about the structural memory of water and BLAH BLAH THIS IS STUPID.No."
16,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28760185-ken-cramer,4,"This book offered a fascinating glimpse into the world of science – with all of its successes and still all of its lingering mysteries. It is engaging, well-written, and leaves you above all else – thinking! The author however makes two mistakes (hence one less star): one grave, and the other… More grave.Early in the book, the author explains how science is not about people, it's about nature. This is a likely conclusion from someone ingrained in physics, which is what the book is mostly about. The truth is that ALL of science – physics and psychology and geography and chemistry – is about people, because it's people -- with all of their bias and all of their backgrounds and experiences -- who formed those theories. It may be the case that across the universe, some alien world has also derived the idea that energy equals mass times the speed of light squared; but this isn't inevitable, not like discovering the property that 2+3 = 5. Science certainly does not have to study people, as physics doesn't; but science is about people, formed by people, tested by people, embraced by people – in short, WE are science. But the second more grave error is more fundamental, by taking on a topic like free will that does not belong to the playground of science – this is philosophy's baby (grandfathered by religion), and the very idea that science will take this on and arrive at a conclusion to either accept or dismiss it is almost perverse; like practicing philosophy without a license! It truly is irrelevant that we can identify the brain mechanism that results in a finger twitch, and then conclude that we can circumvent your free will by activating that circuit. This is akin to our eye blink response, largely under the control of the autonomic nervous system which regularly regulates this for you – – but you can override the system, if you so CHOOSE. The author also may be confusing free will with thoughts or actions outside of awareness, as showing that the brain mechanisms are at work well before one's decision or intention toward a particular goal -- a related question, and perhaps more deserving of science's consideration. BOTTOM LINE: read this book! Every consumer of science needs to realize we have come a long way and discovered some amazing things but we are far from done. However, as any good citizen we have to be a watchdog for science too, and not let the tail wag the dog..."

I enjoy that, it is defiantly on my track of thinking. He took on a number of controversial topics and some of them (homeopathy for example) I don't think I will ever agree with given the current state of affairs but the author doesn't really ask you to agree with anything. He just says there are things that don't make sense and that is it. I am ok with that. He didn't seem to have any hidden agendas so the rest I can let pass as just interesting brain candy. I like thinking about different things and I am not the type to want to get so caught up in what ""is"" that I can't postulate other scenarios. I would never have homeopathy as a remedy on my list though nor would I recommend it for family or friends. That aside, (also the space probe thing was missing a few well known refutes). Anyway as long as their is no view pushing I can swallow it. It was still a fun read. "
18,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry,4,"Michael Brooks' survey of anomalies in contemporary science (2009 - UK Edition) might be regarded as a riposte to the 'end of science' thesis promoted by John Horgan in the mid-1990s. He makes a very good case although one has the suspicion that it is not that there is nothing else to know (which this book shows would be an absurd proposition) but perhaps that there are things that, because of the limitations of ourselves as human observers, we may never know.Brooks adopts a systematic approach, taking us from anomalies in cosmology and physics through those in biology thence to evolutionary studies, neuroscience and medicine. However, it might be better here to separate out the one-off nagging anomalies, which may or may not be important. They may, of course, be of considerable importance IF proven but the broader sets of anomaly that frustrate scientists in their fields and indicate the potential (no more) for a major 'Kuhnian' paradigm shift, equivalent to that from the Ptolemaic to the Copernican astronomical system, are much more interesting. Such paradigm shifts can have significant associated cultural and political effects whereas the one-off anomalies have (largely) yet to be settled even as anomalies and imply rather than state major paradigm change. Let's dispose quickly of these 'one-offs' - cold fusion, a navigational anomaly with the Pioneer spacecraft, disputed evidence for life on Mars and the freak alleged 'ET' signal received in 1977. These are fascinating but inconclusive. We are just going to have to admit that, as of today, we don't know whether cold fusion is possible, whether there is life on Mars or there are signalling aliens - not until more experiments can be mounted (at considerable public cost), possibly not even then.The anomalies that imply paradigm shifts fall into two general areas - the nature of physics and of the universe and the nature of life and of matters affecting the relationship of mind and body. Perhaps the anomalies in the first zone (which relate to serious problems with the current consensus derived from Einstein's revision of Newtonian mechanics) might impact on the latter, but, at this point in history, such a leap would be so speculative as to be scientifically meaningless.This book is mostly an easy read by a science journalist and consultant with considerable skill in explaining complex matters to the lay reader but, be warned, you will have to keep your wits about you. The general reader is going to have to take many claims for granted. Nevertheless, he feels reliable and the only 'wobbly' section is that on free will which we will come to in a moment.The cosmology and physics anomalies are interesting but hard to make relevant to daily life. Our model of the universe works near to us but does not quite stack up the further that you move away from our immediate locality - issues of dark energy, dark matter, possible unknown gravitational forces and 'varying constants' suggest that some of the finest mathematical minds and some significant astronomical resources are going to be puzzling away at these issues for a good time to come.What may be more relevant to us as persons on this planet is the complex of debates surrounding some very basic questions about human existence that have hitherto been left to philosophers but into which scientists are now intruding:* what exactly is life? - to which there still appears to be no clear answer* what is the role of the virus in evolution?* why death? and why sexual rather than asexual repoduction?* whether we have free will?* and how the placebo effect and homeopathy work (or don't work) in medicine?Brooks is effective in outlining, without (except in one case - free will) prejudice, the contrasting scientific theories and the inconclusive evidence in each case and he is not shy of making a subsidiary point of considerable importance about the flaws in scientists rather than in scientific method. Scientists themselves are not objective machines but are human beings dependent on their own perception, expectations (both group and their own) and prejudices and (my opinion and not his) on measurement and analytical tools created by humans for humans. Even peer review can be unreliable, although the track record of scientific method in uncovering reliable facts remains, on balance, a good and effective one - if a lot more long-winded and cumbersome (and so expensive) than some lay people think.Towards the end of the book, Brooks get a little less sure-footed. His account of the free will debate is not very convincing. In this area, many scientists are missing the point about free will and the human condition - or rather about the impossibility of measuring 'intent in the field'. One might concede that, for most of the time and in most conditions (especially under conditions of both stability or extreme emergency), the human mind is much more on auto-pilot than we like to think. Free will is possibly meaningless insofar as actions undertaken on auto-pilot involve a suspension of will and a body and mind losing themselves to cause and effect. It is this phenomenon that the scientists are clearly recording.However, it is an unscientific and dangerous assumption to believe that a mind is not capable of setting the autopilot in the first place or of taking charge and making decisions, including positive decisions to reconform the mind to meet internal needs. Whether this proposition is true or false, it is also untestable for all the reasons noted by the philosopher Heidegger and others that each instant of consciousness is unique for each person - no instant can be held down and quantified without the fact of it being studied becoming part of the equation. Once observed in ways that meet the needs of scientific method, the 'will' may well disappear in the very decision to concede to the process. The answer to the riddle may be that the binary absolute of free will/determinism is absurd in itself - much of the time we are on autopilot but we have developed a consciousness capable of exerting will which most do not use very often but some do. The quality of free will is its uniqueness. Scientific method is not good with highly contingent or random effects and consciousness deals in complexity, the contingent and the randomness of external inputs.The danger here (given that the case is not proven either way) is that experimental evidence will create, much as early Darwinism did, an inappropriate model of human behaviour that might meet the paradigm of what can be observed but cannot embrace what cannot be observed (a similar problem to that of cosmology). A sufficient to academic or commercial purpose 'working model' of the mind, based on autopilot behaviour, might become integrated into cultural and political policy and so into social and economic regulation - the path to a state- or community-directed 'soft' tyranny. History has a precedent - the use of evolutionary studies in Rassenpolitik in the first half of the last century. We might see new attempts at social control which seem scientifically appropriate but which become massive perversions of the human condition as they are integrated into ideological presuppositions about human nature. However, before being too harsh on the neuro-scientists' potential political naivete, the research has one good side benefit - the destruction, even amongst scientists themselves, of any pretensions by humanity to ultra-rationalism or objectivity. The book could be seen as a running commentary on the lack of full rationalism in scientific treatment of anomalies but the point is a much bigger one and raised by Brooks himself - rational decision-making is an illusion. However, this does not tell the whole story. Decision-making is not rational by any external standard (such as that of scientific positivism) but it is perfectly rational from the point of view of the organism itself (which fact irritates many rationalists). It is just that an outsider does not understand the base assumptions of the person making the decision - what appears irrational to an outsider is not to the insider. The issue then comes down to assessing why particular individuals have a 'will' to accept 'incorrect' assessments of their environment (from the point of socially constructed reality) that lead to (apparently) irrational responses and why this may have survival benefits (or not). For example, if you are a victim of external power but cannot change things for the better, a decision to take up magic or religion might be a rational act (a sort of social placebo effect amongst other things) in order to avoid despair, to aid survival and to build community cohesion that offers survival advantages. This apparent irrationality is perfectly rational and may even be 'willed' - Sartre's famous case of the waiter who 'becomes' a waiter rather than a person is the type of all strategies of survival through inauthenticity. But it does not mean that persons are not capable of being authentic. It may also mean that neuroscientists are only investigating inauthenticity - some subjects decide not to be investigated and these may be the very persons who need to be investigated to make any progress in understanding free will (say). Scientists, indeed all rationalists, have had real difficulty understanding these practical points of living in the world. It is good to see psychologists and neuroscientists beginning a journey towards understanding the counter-productiveness of pure 'objective' rationality even if (unlike us 'existentialists') they still have a way to go yet and may blunder into politics along the way.Very different problems arise with the placebo effect (where 'not-knowing' is part of the effect) and with homeopathy. In both cases, there seem to be real effects. Yet the difficulty of proving or disproving these effects divides scientists into sceptics and those who are more open-minded in debates that can get increasingly bitter. One solution for some scientists in understanding the first effect is to allow doctors to turn into shamans and keep patients in the dark for their own good. Another in relation to homeopathy is to postulate that water has structural qualities that permit the phenomenon and that, one day, homeopathy might indeed be 'tamed' and introduced back into allopathic (conventional) medicine. The common denominators here (sociologically) are the desire of the 'expert' positivist-minded scientific community to accrue power to itself and to systematise any effects into what is acceptable on positivists' own terms.However, just as with the problem of free will, it may be that science is reaching the limit of its ability to know and is seeking to create boundaries beyond which there can be only 'magic' (with magic's negative connotations). In fact, true scientists (and there are many magnificent examples in this book) remain open-minded about all anomalies at all times and remain determined to push scientific method to its limits. They know what they do not know. It may be that the human mind will not be able to know or grasp the true nature of the universe for a number of technical perceptual and measurement reasons and that the modelling will have to move from science to art - or rather to the art of increasingly sophisticated but ultimately untestable mathematical modelling that may pull cosmology back to the domain of belief i.e. belief in the most cogent mathematical model where the components may not be tested, in fact, against real conditions in the world. At this level, science really does revert to religion but the religion of the 'most reasonable belief in the circumstances', certainly not as experimentally verified truth.A similar process may be happening at the 'mind' level too but under conditions which may be more dangerous for human social development and survival. Experimentally, it is impossible to know all actions or thoughts or all responses and feelings within a conscious human community but neuroscience and medecine may try to do precisely this - creating 'laws' that enter into consciousness and become self-fulfilling as socially constructed reality rather than as true representations of what is the case.This is important. A physical or cosmological law does not (unless you believe in magic) change the conditions of the universe through enunciation but a psychological or social 'law' changes the conditions of society when people with power decide to take it on and impose it throughout a culture. The power of 'incantation' is understood in the context of the placebo effect and probably applies to many more social conditions than health provision. Social Darwinism came to include racist nonsense but its acceptance by elites resulted in the masses adopting and believing in racial science as if it were true and many (though not all by any means) then became racists with conceptions of inferiority and superiority that may have been technologically true but were biologically idiotic (regardless of morality).Given that scientists do not KNOW how either the placebo effect or homeopathy works (or otherwise), they should continue to work in good faith and with a bit of humility to establish the mechanisms (whether psychological or physical) for the phenomena but they should not allow politicians and bureaucrats to purloin these studies at the expense of human freedom - nor state as law that something is not so when persons clearly experience it as so. Though Brooks would undoubtedly not agree (given his status within the scientific community as one of its interpreters), it might be argued that, just as free will can never be known not to not exist in a human community amounting to several billion, so the public has a right not to trust scientists absolutely and to demand the right to homeopathic treatment even if it should be 'proved' to be wholly placebo in effect. If it works, don't knock it!Similarly, if a placebo works in many cases, as it clearly does in pain relief, then this fact should permit the public to accept guidance from people who are not in white coats but can also provide relief and comfort - even real shamans if necessary. What Brooks points out is the real danger that over-enthusiasm for placebo effects will result in a drift away from rational medicine to quackery that causes real damage to persons with severe and very real organic illnesses. He is absolutely right and the way forward is probably an easy tolerance of the self-healing within the mind (thanks to a bit of TLC) in order to ensure that patients continue to get checked up and take white coat advice where it matters. Whether free will, placebo or homeopathy, the men in white coats should continue to investigate and theorise but should not deny phenomena too eagerly from what amounts to ideological distaste or class self-interest.Where we may get to is a bad scenario or a good scenario. The bad scenario is where the new consensus is that we do not know our own minds and others must take care of us, perhaps by lying (placebo effect) or by controlling and limiting grey area therapies through massive regulation and integration into the mainstream. This is where some would have us go and I suggest that this derives from a personality type that is attracted into bureaucracy and politics.The second scenario is the good one. It allows persons to make choices as if they had free will all things being equal (even if some neuroscientists might argue against it), is open and transparent about techniques (including the dangerous new zone of neuro-marketing and political 'nudge') and allows, where not harmful, the public to find their own structures of coping that make may use of science and belief, even what positivists might dismiss as magic. In the meantime, if society wants rational behaviour, it can do its part by creating a society of equals with access to full information, power over their environment and sufficient resources.This review has gone off at a tangent because the book does not raise these questions directly itself. It stops at the science and avoids philosophy - and certainly politics. Whether we understand or do not understand the nature of the universe is unlikely to affect us directly (unless resolution of anomalies such as cold fusion or new particles gives us new energy sources or weapons of war) but any scientific theory about our minds has enormous import for the turn of our culture and our society.This book is worth reading if you are scientifically curious but it is also worth reading if you like to think of yourself as an educated citizen. You will learn two big things amongst the many small things - that science is far more complex than the establishment of simple truths (a fact worth bearing in mind in accepting any standard view of climate change) and that important work is going on now on anomalies related to consciousness that we, as free individuals, must get a grip on lest others with power take them up and adapt them to purposes that end our freedoms with cataclysmic speed. Educate yourself or others will educate you to their requirements.[For an associated comment, making use of the cold fusion case study in the book - http://asithappens.tppr.info/journal/... ]"

When I read the title, I was expecting a discussion on things like: Why, after 200,000 years of evolution, our politicians are getting more stupid? Why do globes have the North Pole up the top? Why can't Australia be the Land Up Above? Who decided that light should travel at 186,000 mps? Why is gravity the strength it is? Why can't I read faster than my sister? No. This is way more esoteric than that. That doesn't mean the book is all boring - just some bits. Brooks has explained things in a manner that you don't have to be a Sheldon Cooper to understand them. It's just that most people will find at least one chapter (or more) boring. Even so, I learned a hell of a lot from this book. You might too. Have your Wikipedia handy.So here we have a bunch of cosmologists, astronomers and physicists all sitting on the discoveries of Newton, Einstein etc, and all looking smugly at each other as they think they've figured out the meaning of life, the universe and everything, only to discover to their horror - they haven't! Why are those damn galaxies we see in our telescopes not behaving like we told them to? Hmm. Must be dark matter, or maybe Darth Vader. Nope. Maybe gravity isn't what we thought. Hrrumph! (How do we tell everyone - we don't know?) As it turns out, all those universal constants aren't as constant as we thought.Has SETI actually heard from aliens? And who really cares? It's not like they're going to come a-knocking wanting to sell us their new-and-improved alien Tupperware any time soon.The placebo effect? More common than you might think. And more effective too.Homeopathy? Well I'm an evidence-based science man myself, but Brooks, to his credit, takes a very open-minded position on this.In chapter 3, I detected a mild anti-Australian sentiment, but I guess us ""Colonials"" aren't known for our astrophysics prowess. Apparently we should stick to wrastlin' kangaroos and avoiding dangerous drop bears.  There's no doubt, Brooks has done a truck load of research. 15% of the book is dedicated to telling us that. His writing style is easy to read, but I did find my eyes glazing over occasionally. On the whole though - a pretty unbiased work, and dare I say, interesting."
20,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3960665-ryan,5,"An amazing book about what science should be (and too rarely is) -- the exploration of results that don't make sense, and finding the actual reason why something is the way it is.

22,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7282692-harold-smithson,3,"A while ago, I read an article on Yahoo (Almost always a bad idea, but it happened nevertheless) about a scientist who claimed that we were an inch away from completely disproving god from a purely objective standpoint. I was unimpressed with the article, but I found the comments on the article to be great reading.Namely because the article was universally reviled by atheists and agnostics as much as the religious. Though they did not believe in god, they claimed that our grasp of the universe was too narrow to objectively disprove any possibility of a god. (Note: It is not my intention to argue for or against the existence of a god. Please do not assume that it is) It speaks entire volumes that Richard Dawkins and Carl Sagan consider (and in the case of Sagan, considered) themselves agnostics because they did not have any clinching proof. The same way that is speaks leagues of that scientist's arrogance in assuming that humanity had the definitive answer to one of the most persistent and controversial questions in human history when there are so many simpler mysteries that we have yet to solve.The more educated one is, the more one realizes how little we actually know. To say that science has all the answers is a ludicrous claim and one that is, quite frankly, egotistic. But to claim that we will never understand the universe is just lazy. The human race may not ever completely understand everything in the universe, but even if we don't we'll die trying, damn it!That is why this book, 13 Thing that Don't Make Sense, is a success and is something that I, personally, recommend: because it rides the fine line between humility at our knowledge of the universe and a love for the search of truth. Michael Brooks is not content to simply say that something is unexplained and foreign to our current knowledge. He does not simply stare into the darkness but probes it, offering light where he can and always maintaining an enthusiasm for the progression of science as opposed to stagnant appreciation for what we've already learned. A large part of the book is spent examining not just the anomalies themselves but also the people who uncovered and attempted to solve them, and revealed facts that I found shocking.To me, the notion that scientists' reputation are ruined by some faulty experiment or association with a faulty idea is repulsive. That the scientific community, which is defined entirely by keeping an open (though skeptical) mind outright scorns the people who propose a new, reasonably logical, idea is a great injustice to science itself (scorning an idea is not the same thing. Scorning an idea that has been proven false is a key part of science. Scorning a legitimate scientist who proposed a faulty idea should not be). To err is human. We're allowed to make mistakes. Certainly a scientist who refuses to see his or her mistakes has no place in science, but making an error is not such a crime. Nor is testing a phenomenon that is generally not accepted to see if there is some kind of truth behind it.13 Thing That Don't Make Sense is a book that epitomizes, at least to me, what it means to be a scientist. Always searching, always looking for new answers to problems that vex us. I recommend this to anyone who desires to go into science and anyone who wants to learn a little more about our universe in general.P.S. I would appreciate feedback or corrections. Perhaps I made mistakes in the review. Perhaps some of my observations are incorrect. Either way, I'm trying to improve and it would be most helpful if any of you could help out."
23,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6857911-ryan,3,"A decent overview of some the unsolved questions that modern science is currently puzzling over (how to explain all the ""missing"" matter in the universe) or lacks the data to answer conclusively any time soon (is there life on other planets? do we really have free will?). Then there are a few chapters concerning what might be described as fringe science (e.g. cold fusion, the placebo effect, homeopathic medicine). While I appreciate the spirit of inquiry, I suspect that homeopathic medicine is probably not one of the great mysteries occupying scientific minds today.Unfortunately, the author's style is a bit fragmentary -- he drops a lot of names and technical information, but doesn't make the core controversies quite as clear as they could be, or provide the satisfying overview one might get from a book focused solely on astrophysics, space exploration, or biology. Regarding the ""fringe science"", the author's discussion of the side making the incredible claim is extremely lightweight. Sure, maybe the cold fusion people are somehow right, and the mainstream scientific community will be proven wrong, but this writer has elucidated anything compelling about that particular mystery, if it even is a mystery, for me.Still, the book expressed an interesting theme: the scientific community has always had trouble accepting anomalous data that suggests that current theories on something might be flawed -- those who have staked their careers on an existing model aren't eager to see it overturned, and those who might try to explain the data using a new framework must put their own reputations on the line. Thus, it takes a while for ""hey, the galaxy isn't expanding the way Einstein's theory predicts"" to become an issue scientists are willing to talk about. For this somewhat disquieting revelation and the fact it'll probably whet your appetite for other science reading, this book's certainly worth a library check-out."

It’s a popular science book that opens with the above quote and discusses thirteen things that are “funny” about modern science. I really enjoyed this book.Each of the chapters in this book describes something that’s a little (or a lot) off when described by the current best theory. Why does sex exist when asexual reproduction is so much simpler, more efficient, and less error-prone? Where is 96% of the universe? The author explores the current thinking on these questions and shows where scientists are working on the gap between theory and reality. The book itself is well written and lays out the problems in relatively easy to understand terms. Some of the transitions between chapters are a little awkward – this is more a collection of essays than a continuous narrative. This book reminded me a lot of Borderlands of Science without being quite as fringe. I hope that Micheal Brooks updates this book in five or ten years to show how things have or have not changed.

The role of the book is important in that it nicely outlines a few areas of our ignorance but I feel that some things were skipped while others were played up. I also feel that the book succumbs to a bit of false equivocation but does so in the spirit of ""everything's not quite solved"".The section on the dark matter problem gives excess weight to modified newtonian dynamics while ignoring other options which are a bit more technical. MOND has some interesting personalities involved in ways that coformal gravity doesn't so I can see why they've weren't as heavily pursued.The section on life and death makes a critical error of focusing on the health of the individual and not the health of its genes, which can help resolve some of the group selection issues the author raises.Finally, I was very edgy about the section on homeopathy but I think it was well done. I don't think it belongs in the book but the review of ""pseudosciences that have admitted problems"" would have been a better home for this chapter.The author also misses a chance to talk about a very fundamental problem of 21st century physics, that of comprehensibility. I think questions like ""is the random nature of quantum mechanics resolvable to a strictly predictive model"" and ""should cosmic inflation be taken at face value"" are much more important than some of the other questions raised and were probably excluded because bringing the reader up to speed would take considerable time.

Unfortunately, in the nearly ten years since its first publication, many of the ""mysteries"" presented in 13 Things That Don't Make Sense have been solved, rejected or outright dismissed, particularly with respect to the physics topics. What makes this book worth a read are the stories it tells about the scientists themselves. Just like everyone else, scientists make mistakes, have petty arguments, hold grudges, and seek admiration and affirmation from others. It might seem that when the stakes are at the highest, when our foundational understanding of the natural world is at stake for example, these personal shortcomings would be set aside, at least temporarily, but as Brooks notes again and again, these tend to be the moments where all aspects of our humanity, positive and negative, rise to the surface. 13 Things That Don't Make Sense is worth a read for anyone looking for deeper insights into both the people and the processes that shape our understanding of the universe we live in."

35,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65013189-giles-burrows,1,"Holy cow, this book annoyed me. There are some interesting questions raised but he gives undue prominence to fringe theories and ideas in trying to answer where the solutions may come from. Ultimately, I just didn't trust him to be objective. I don't normally give up on books but after I'd read half I decided I'd had enough."
36,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"In 13 Things That Don't Make Sense, Michael Brooks investigates some of the mysteries that are currently baffling scientists. For the most part the discussions are informative and interesting, but Brooks loses his way repeatedly, giving undue weight to fringe positions where none is due. 1 & 2: Dark Matter, Dark Energy and the failure of Newtonian gravitation - Brooks does a good job outlining the subject, but gives far too much weight to the view that the expanding universe may be due to errors in the theory of Newtonian gravitation. It's possible this is the case, but it's a fringe view at the moment with dark matter and energy being the most widely accepted explanations. Brooks oddly fails to mention the Large Hadron Collider, which provides the current best mechanism for answering this question once and for all. This is a huge miss.3: Physical Constants that may not be Constant - There's very little evidence to support this claim. What evidence exists lies within the error bars and the theory that fundamental physical constants have changed over time is not one held by physicists. It is true, however, that physisists do not have a compelling explanation for why the universe is the way it is or why the physical constants are what they are. The anthropic principle coupled with the theory of the multiverse remains the best theory ... and is one that is completely unsatisfying.4: Cold Fusion - Cold fusion is to physics what astrology is to astonomy, in other words it's pure nonsense. Maybe cold fusion doesn't ""make sense"" because to Brooks because it doesn't exist. By that line of reasoning bigfoot doesn't make much sense either. Brooks also is incredibly sympathetic to Pons, Fleischmann and the University of Utah who were incredibly unethical in their claim of achieving room temperature fusion. They were completely and deservedly disgraced for their bald-faced dishonesty.5: Life - No working explanation exists for how life got started. There are many theories under development and efforts underway to test these hypothesis. It's likely we'll never know exactly how life originated on Earth, though it may be possible to eventually explain one or more possible pathways.6: Life on Mars - One of the experiments on the Voyager landers in the 1970's hinted at bacterial life, but subsequent tests have not provided any validation. Brooks gives this test undue weight, seeming to believe it provides conclusive proof of life on Mars. That isn't the way science works. Conclusions are based on a preponderance of evidence. With the more recent Mars landers and orbiter, the evidence is continuing to mount, but a concrete conclusion is, as of yet, premature.7: Have Aliens Contacted the Earth - No. But SETI shouldn't give up the search.8: Giant Viruses9: Why Do We Age and Die - Because you can only eat so many bagels.10: Why do most Animals Reproduce Sexually - There's an evolutionary advantage.11: Do We Have Free Will - Yes and no, but a lot less than you think.12: Does the Placebo Affect Exist - Probably not.13: Homeopathy - Bizarre, homeopathy is utter quackery.

37,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1842160-courtney-williams,5,"The book: 13 Things That Don't Make SenseThe author: Michael Brooks, English science writer.The subject: As the title suggests, Brooks discusses thirteen anomalies in science.Why I chose it: My A-Level Physics teacher once bumped into my mum in town and gave her the name of it, saying he thought I might enjoy it!The rating: Five out of five starsWhat I thought of it: I have loved everything I've read by Michael Brooks so far. (Granted, that's only two books, but still.) He writes the sort of books I wish I could write. Over the past year and a half I've struggled to enjoy science as I didn't enjoy my degree or the environment I was studying in. I wish I'd read this book sooner, because it's really helped reignite my interest. I'm moving onto a different type of study soon and I anticipate that things will only get better.Anyway, moving onto the actual book. It covered a wider range of topics than I'd envisaged, from dark matter to homoeopathy. The idea of ""things that don't make sense"" was interpreted subtly differently as well. The chapters were each distinct, but also formed a cohesive book. For me, Brooks gets the balance just right between science and story; I find both interesting and they play off each other wonderfully. I highlighted a lot of passages, but this was probably my favourite:
No one knows how or why the universe might have started blowing up as Guth suggested. Or why the inflation suddenly stopped. It’s hardly an explanation, really, but it is the best explanation we’ve got. Indeed, it is now so mainstream in cosmology, so unchallenged as a hypothesis, that you’d be forgiven for thinking that inflation was part of the well-documented history of the universe, somewhere just above the Battle of Waterloo on the scale of historically credible events. We may not know every detail of inflation, just as we don’t know exactly how and when each of Wellington and Napoleon’s soldiers died on that muddy Belgian field, but we now have good evidence that, just after the big bang, the universe did go through a phase of ultra-rapid expansion. It is a very neat solution to a very big problem.
I even got ideas for what to read next. At one point while reading it I told my boyfriend, ""I may as well just highlight this entire book!""This is definitely a good book for those first exploring popular science as well as enthusiasts like me. Even if you don't like some of the topics on offer, a range of fields are represented in both a rigorous and entertaining way. If nothing else, you'll learn a lot about the interesting stories behind scientific progress.Just one more thing: I've read one other book by Brooks that's also brilliant, Free Radicals: The Secret Anarchy of Science. You should go pick it up even if you think science isn't interesting. I actually prefer it slightly to 13 Things..., though that's because it fits my interests a bit more closely. Both are certainly worth a read."
38,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2559542-pete-jones,3,"I was told that I should be reading boring books before bed; this seemed an obvious choice. The problem with that is that in many places this book reads like some of my classes in my senior year of statistics—the type where the whole class was devoted to proving a theorem. The prof would start on one blackboard and continue around the room erasing his earlier writings to make room for more. At the beginning of the class you understood what was to be proved and you followed the proof step-by-step—it made sense. When the prof got to QED, not only couldn’t I remember the theorem, but I couldn’t even reproduce the proof. This doesn’t help when you’re tired unless you don’t mind reading the same chapter over and over again. So who is the intended audience of this book? The reviews on the dustcover should help you decide if this book is for you. You won’t find anything from the New York Times; instead look for quotes from the New Scientist, Seed Magazine, Richard Ellis, and Anahad O’Connor. The author is compared to Carl Sagan and Stephen Jay Gould. Looking at the first couple of chapters (for examples: “The Missing Universe,” “The Pioneer Anomaly,” “Varying Constants,” “Cold Fusion”) you might correctly infer that the author has a doctorate in quantum physics. But then the latter chapters slide a little close to the humanities with chapters such as: “Death,” “Sex,” “Free Will,” “The Placebo Effect,” and “Homeopathy.”This might tempt those with degrees than end in “of Arts” instead of “of Science” to skip the earlier chapters. This is possible, but the author assumes that you’ve read the book in order. Each chapter introduces the work of15 to 20 scientists and mathematicians who he not uncommonly refers to in later chapters only by name. I didn’t find this a real impediment even though I had read the previous chapters. Like with the statistics theorems I couldn’t remember who they were or in which chapter they had first been mentioned.In all, it must have worked as a sleep aid because I know I read the book, but I can’t remember most of it. What stands out most to me was the discussion in “The Placebo Effect” about experiments dentists performed on their patients. With their pain-wracked patients they substituted morphine with saline solution without the patients’ knowledge and found the patients still reported pain relief. But then while the patients were on the saline solution the dentists put naloxone (a drug that blocks the action of morphine) in the drips again without the patients’ knowledge. The patients then began to experience pain again. It seems to justify people’s fear of dentists and makes me wonder about my dentist."
39,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6149613-marcus,3,"Once again, I will probably be unfair in a review of a book because it turned out not to be what I wished for it to be. In this particular case I had great hopes that I found something similar to one of my all time favourites, namely Bill Bryson's 'Short History of Nearly Everything'. And indeed, I wouldn't be surprised if these two books shared the same shelf in a library. But while Bryson strikes in my opinion the perfect balance between learning experience and entertainement, Brook's approach is a bit too ponderous and preachy for my liking.Perhaps my problem with this book lies in selection of topics selected by the author. As the title indicates, Michael Brooks gives the reader thirteen 'riddles' that seem to baffle today's scientific community. Some of them are 'purely' scientific - in the field of astronomy, there are chapters about dark energy, dark matter and seemingly unexplainable deviation from predicted course for the two Pioneer probes. In physics, the author discusses the 'constants' which seem not to be as constant as we'd like them to be and cold fusion. Other topics are almost meta-physical in their nature - life, death, free will or rather it's apparent non-existence as well as phenomenon of placebo are all given their own chapters. The selection is rounded of with somewhat surprising topics such as the WOW-signal and the mystery of homeopathy. As can be seen, the 'spread' in this book is very wide, which makes it feel a tad disjointed at times.Or perhaps the source of my disapointment comes from what's in my opinion one common denominator for all individual chapters in this book - it is my impression that the author considers today's scientific community as closed-minded and resistant to ideas 'outside of the box' and uses his selection of topics to illustrate that fact. He may very well be right in his observation! But... I picked up this book under impression that it was a popular science work, not an input in what I consider a political debate and I must admit that I was a bit annoyed whenever the author glided over into 'preachy' mode.Nevertheless, it is definitely a book worth picking up if you're interested in modern science and challenges it faces. It illustrates perfectly how little we still know about a lot of fundamental stuff."
40,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508114-mary-warner,5,"The topic that attracted me to this book was homeopathy, and wouldn't you know, it was covered in the very last chapter of the book. I do, however, enjoy reading about various topics in science, so it was no chore to read the entire book. In fact, Michael Brooks does a fine job of describing what can be very complicated scientific subjects in such a way that the lay person (me!) can understand them.The book is targeted at explaining 13 mysteries of science and the stories behind why these particular things cannot yet be explained. All of the topics chosen are fascinating and touch on our very existence as human beings.What quickly becomes apparent, and can easily be described as another theme of the book, is that many scientists don't particularly care to have their paradigms shifted. In my estimation, they tend to behave like a pack of wild dogs, taking down whoever comes up with a new theory or better scientific explanation with viciousness.I appreciated the author's balanced approach to the topics presented, showing the pros and cons of the various theories that have been put forth to explain these as-yet unexplainable dilemmas. I was particularly pleased with how he covered homeopathy, which most doctors and scientists would dismiss as pure hokum. His analysis of homeopathy being a hit-or-miss affair within the realm of scientific studies squares with my experience with homeopathy. I've taken some remedies to great effect, and others that had no affect whatsoever. Plus, his suggestion that the Materia Medica (a book that lists all the remedies with their supposed effects) may be part of the problem in proving homeopathy's efficacy is dead on.All in all, this is an excellent book and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in science. There's a little something in this book for everyone, no matter what scientific discipline you are attracted to."
41,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5709501-dean-wangerin,4,"Overall I enjoyed this book. I feel that the early chapters about the mysteries of physics seemed like the ones in which the author was the most familiar. This would make sense, as the author is a PhD physicist. I particularly enjoyed learning about the mystery of the Pioneer spacecraft, which is drifting ever so slightly too close to the sun on its 6-million mile journey out to the edges of the solar system. It may turn out to be nothing, but it's interesting to think that we could be just a tiny bit off on our calculation of the pull of gravity, or one of the other major constants of the universe.The set of chapters discussing death, sex, and alternative theories around evolution were the ones I found the most interesting. The idea that social selection, rather than sexual selection, may actually be the dominant force... it is as profound as it is confusing. If that's the case, how do group-optimizing traits get passed on through the genes of individuals? Does sex somehow optimize for groups, rather than individuals? Maybe that's why it crops up again and again, in a world where asexual reproduction is so much more efficient, and so much better at guaranteeing that you pass on your traits to your children. ... Anyway, these chapters were the ones I found the most interesting, and they seem to be the most ripe for further study.The last two chapters, which focused on placebos and homeopathy, were the least convincing. I feel like the author didn't really get to the bottom of the placebo mystery, and homeopathy still sounds like quackery. Also, I asked my mom (who is a pharmacist) a few questions to validate what the author was saying about placebo's, and she said that what he was describing was not only false, but unethical and illegal. So, I take these chapters with a grain of salt. Or, a grain of salt diluted to non-existence, yet still somehow tasting so very salty. (dun dun dun!!)"
42,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3936007-steyn,4,"Very interesting book! makes for a good complimentary read to a book such as ""The Grand Design"". Whereas the grand design starts from a perspective of ""this is what we can explain"", this book starts from the opposite side of the coin - i.e. ""this is what we can't explain"". Why i quite liked the book, is that the perception (of a layman such as me certainly) when reading a book such as Grand Design is one of ""wow, we've pretty much got it all mostly figured out, now we're just filling in some minor details here or there - for neatness' sake"". A book such as this helps clear up just how wrong that perception is. i.e. that there are still huge chunks of unknowns (or even BIG inconsistencies), any of which could fundamentally change a lot of what we believe we know to be correct (e.g. dark matter - a lot of the math and other observations of space only make sense if it exists - however, we have as yet had 0 success (apart from one incident in which there is a 1/4 chance that the results are incorrect) in actually detecting the stuff). But it has to be there, otherwise there is WAAAY too little mass in the universe.One critique (which i have seen in other reviews of the book), is that 1 or 2 of the chapters feel ""slapped on"". i.e. a book called ""11 Things that don't make sense"" wouldn't sell as good as a book called ""13 things that don't make sense"", so chapters such as the one on Homeopathy feels a little thin, and not as well thought through as some of the others (e.g. dark matter etc). Although i tend to agree to a large extent, i stil found these ""thin"" chapters quite informative, and as such did not have an issue with them being in the book, even though they did have a different feel to the rest of the book's style.Definitely worth the read!"
43,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3705706-david,4,"I didn’t expect to like this book. With a title like “13 Things that Don’t Make Sense” I assumed that Brooks was simply going to throw out 13 mysteries that we all wonder about. What I read was a well thought out treatment for every one of the 13 “Things”. That said, there were parts of this book that I liked, and parts that I did not like. There are clearly objective mysteries presented in the area of particle physics where it is clear that nobody currently knows the answers to certain basic questions. That is a good part. In another section Brooks lambastes those who had claimed that a brief pulse of electromagnetic radiation 40 years ago was egregiously ignored. Apparently, SETI is pet project for Brooks. What I didn’t like is the implication that we are completely ignoring the possibility that intelligent life is out there and may have already been detected. I don’t dismiss the claims that these experimental observations MIGHT have detected something, but I do say that it is not a fact that intelligent life was detected. Brooks also felt that the data from the early Mars “test of life” experiments proved life had been on Mars. So, this book is a mixed bag but I must say that even when I disagreed with Brooks, he still makes a logical and well thought out argument for why each of his topics has parts that really do not make sense. For that I give this a good read. "
44,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5891627-jo-green,4,"This book probably would have gotten 5 stars instead of 4 if I understood more of it, but what I got was a lot of fun. This is stuff that is consistent but why? The expanding of our universe, and when they got to the equations, I just duh-ed out! Dang though this stuff is cool, I wish I was smarter in physics. They really could have put more in this book and it would have been fine, because the stuff that I did get it was well presented and fascinating. We've come so far and then something just flips the whole process upside down. Not that the Newton theory of gravity is wrong, or that Einstein wasn't onto something, but the massiveness of the whole idea I just couldn't wrap around it. I'm gonna have to give my head a break with the energy thing and try again. I felt so bad for the scientist that were working on ""cold fusion"". They were a laughing stock and disgraced in their day, but that story kept me riveted. I really feel like I rambled through this, the ideas feel like they are so close to catching, even though they're mysteries, the parts I didn't get are scratching at the edge of ""you can understand more of this"". I think it's because of how well the book was done. If I listen again once or twice, I might just be a little smarter, about what I don't know. LOL. Don't let my complete incoherency divert you from this book, my mind runs its own goofy track. This is a keeper!"
45,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8761466-james,4,"I liked this book a lot. Complicated, but accessible discussions of dark matter, dark energy, changing universal constants, life, death, sex, free will, giant viruses, the placebo effect, homeopathy, and three other things I can't remember at the moment. I listened to this as an audiobook, and the British narrator brings a dry sense of humor to his narration that makes the book easier to follow. The title of this book could have been ""!3 Things That Don't Make Sense if God is Taken Out of the Equation."" I had never heard sexual reproduction used as an argument against evolution, but it was fascinating. Brooks makes the case that asexual reproduction would be far more efficient from an evolutionary standpoint. It would be faster, there would be less likelihood of inferior genes being introduced into the pool, etc. So why would we ""evolve"" to reproduce sexually? Well, if the creation story is put back into the mix, then we get a God who created male and female to be joined together. And this is just one example. I found most chapters had at least some support for an argument from design for the existence of God. And that fact that this wasn't the author's intention makes this a great starting point for believers and non believers to have an intelligent conversation. Non-believers won't be put off by a heavy-handed apologetic; believers will find confirmation that there really is room in a scientific worldview for a Creator. "
46,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5983551-neil-pearson,3,"What I enjoyed the most about this book was the discussion on the politics and personalities in science and how despite our (I'm a biologist) claims of the facts guiding the way there are so many examples of revelations being buried because the proponent has poor social skills and the antagonists have previous merit on their side. If anything, it seems worse in the cosmological fields with people's careers ending in disgrace. The other thing that surprised me was that I was more familiar on the whole with the mysteries around physics than biology which suggests the media covers those topics more and/or I'm more drawn to topics outside my own knowledge base. As it was I found the segments on mimivirus quite new and it was nice to hear some observations I'd never heard of regarding death and sexual reproduction. The homeopathy segment is the toughest segment to take seriously which maybe highlights some of my own bias but the author does do a decent job of explaining why the field has so much scorn because the vast majority of it is mysticism. Free will is a topic I also find frustratingly circular in the sense people continue to treat our brains as separate entities from ourselves. It's well worth a look as it does a commendable job of showing people it's in trying to understand what we don't know that leads to the big breakthroughs. Scientists should check it out because of the poilitics of discovery."
47,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81994-sean,2,"The book covers a number of interesting topics, but from the beginning that coverage is a little too breathless, a little too quick to dwell on the hypotheses and speculations of folks who challenge current scientific thought, and a little too inclined to merely gloss over the reasons why these ideas have failed to gain more popularity among the scientific communities to which they are relevant. Throughout the book I couldn't escape the suspicion that I wasn't being told the whole story, and was instead being given only enough juicy tidbits to paint a picture of a scientific controversy that was in all likelihood overblown or perhaps even manufactured. By the 13th thing, homeopathy, it's hard to not feel that the book tipped its hand when it proceeded to devolve into rank tooth fairy science. This chapter rapidly glosses over the question of whether homeopathy is a real effect that merits explaining (with its sketchy coverage of the Benveniste study's failings being particularly disappointing) in its rush to dwell on wild speculation about how such a thing could possibly work and a few homeopaths' attempts to try and make it more respectable through exercises in obvious cargo cult projects. Two stars for being very well-written and entertaining, but since I can't be sure whether it actually taught me anything or not, I can't in good faith give it any more than that."
48,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1954307-dietrich,3,"'13 Things' gives layman descriptions for 13 anomalies in modern science, which I thoroughly enjoy because I happen to be of said layman type. This book is a good read for those of us who loved science class, but have never had the time to acknowledge (or even care about) today's top questions in science.This book will NOT allow you succeed in a scientific debate with an actual scientist.This book will however introduce you to some interesting topics, which then allows you to go back to your life, and periodically scan the news headlines for possible breakthroughs. Another interesting side effect of this book: When you find yourself at a Cool-Kids-Only party, the opposite sex always find the following topics extremely attractive ""Relativity"", ""Cold Fusion"", and ""We don't really have free-will, so lets go back to my place and have some 'coffee' ""I did have some disappointment in the book though, while Michael Brooks did a good job of presenting many theories to each anomaly, I frequently found myself more interested in a theory that he only mentions as kind of an afterthought. Now, he did list plenty of references that I could easily do my own studying up on the stories that really interested me, but remember, I'm just a layman."
49,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1510959-william,4,"A thought-provoking and very readable tour of thirteen questions that many scientists would like to see answered. Among other things we discover that the 1970s Viking Mars landers did find some evidence of microbial life (not as conclusive as NASA wanted and compromised by equipment failure, resulting in an official report that did not mention it), that there may be something in cold fusion after all, and that sex and death are not as easily explained as you might think.I found some of the topics less convincing than others - the argument that free will is an illusion didn't really add up for me, and the case for not quite writing off homeopathy yet seemed to consist of a number of studies that had failed to prove its worthlessness conclusively, together with some speculation about allotropy and epitaxy. However it is all interesting and very much pro-science (it is certainly not saying science doesn't know everything therefore science knows nothing and we can make up whatever the hell we like, a popular line of reasoning in some quarters), and a reminder that we should keep asking the questions and not assume, as Albert Michelson famously did in 1894, that we know it all."
50,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4399511-holly,4,"Great topical look at 13 anomalies we can't explain or reason yet in science. There is an overriding theme--taken from Kuhn about how science deals with anomalies that sometimes lead into giant paradigm shifts. I appreciated how Brook went after each topic both objectively but definitely with narrative--making sure to include the naysayers and bandwagon folks in each topic to give a really thorough outline at what had been tried on that specific anomalyBrooks starts out in the cosmological, then moves to physical and into the biological. I was always bummed when one chapter closed and sure the next chapter wouldn't be as captivating, but I was mostly wrong--as in the end, they're all enigmatic in their own way. I think the ones I was most surprised by were homeopathy, cold fusion, death (and the virus) and aging. The others I had either known partially of or didn't find as compelling. However I still think of each one quite a bit---I actually listened to the audiobook on mp3 (in my car usually) so it's something I go back to every once in awhile--which says quite a bit about it.  Highly recommend it. "
51,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/607994-steven,2,"Brooks gives a quick set of examples of things science doesn't have an answer for ... yet.I found it difficult to quantify Brook's thoughts towards science and scientists. On the one hand, he seems to be mocking them, pointing out that nothing can be wholly explained, even to the smartest people in the world. He also likes to regale the reader with tales about how these smart people have difficulty doing things that would befuddle the rest of us - like a counter intuitive control for an elevator.On the other hand, he also proclaims science as a wondrous process, and sings its praises at every opportunity. There's an undercurrent of optimism and hope throughout the book that the answers to these puzzles are only a few years of research away.In general, it's an interesting read. It's a small checklist for the accomplished scientists to go through and answer each question in turn, eventually rendering it obsolete. I wonder at times how much it was dumbed down (and the author does occasionally adopt a tone that indicates that's what he's doing), so it's probably meant as a starting point for the eminently curious to begin their own research."
52,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/157313-alene,4,"I don't like science, but I do like the idea of science, if that makes sense. This book is basic enough to explain some scientific anomalies to me without overwhelming me, but totally opening my eyes to some very interesting flaws with our current worldview, which I love to find interesting things to consider. It's so amazing, the knowledge, technology and means we have today to do so many things and how fast that is expanding to include being able to do so many more things, yet, so baffling how little we still understand about things we thought we would master long ago. It's sad that so much pioneer work gets ridiculed by those more entrenched in scientific explanations of another time. I liked the book because I agreed so entirely with its main argument; that answers can often come from wrong guesses, from taking a leap and trying it, that sometimes outlandish ideas will get you to what you are looking for. You never find what you're looking for if you don't try anything, even if it sounds stupid, or completely wrong, it could be right or help you get to the right answer. "
53,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,3,"I got this as an audiobook, and I almost stopped listening to it because it begins with astrology and goes straight to quantum physics--my two least favorite fields of science. My friend advised me to continue listening, and I'm glad I did, because the narrative segues beautifully into the origins of life, the origins of death, and the origins of sex. It even talks about medicine (the placebo effect and homeopathy), which always fascinates me.I can't really summarize the points made in this book because they won't have as much impact without the author's explanations. Readers who have a good scientific foundation will get much more out of this book. Brooks provides enough explanation that astute readers will understand it, but not so much that you'll get bogged down in formulas and latin names. It's not fluffy, so perhaps it wasn't the best choice for a ""listen to on my commute"" audiobook. I think it would be better in paper.If I liked astronomy and quantum physics, I would have enjoyed this book more. "
54,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3959348-ru,3,"A highly-scientific read that will likely leave you asking more questions than it attempts to address. It's incredibly well written, but be forewarned that it is often weighed down by its own jargon and examples. The two sections I found most compelling were the cold fusion study, and the discussion on homeopathy. If you've ever followed the case of cold fusion some years ago, even on the surface, it is quite a story. This section also probably humanizes its participants the most, especially surrounding Fleischmann/Pons and what they went through.Homeopathy, as this book suggests, should not work, because in a scientific sense, no medicine is involved. As the example goes, millions of medical studies should not be invalidated just because of ""some"" cases of homeopathy being successful. An curious question is posed: is homeopathy a placebo? I was left with the sense that there are certainly cases where this is true, but it's impossible to declare it a universal truth.Somewhat of a dry read at times, but the topics it covers are far from boring."

First I downloaded and installed Adobe's Digital Editions reader. Then I selected ""13 Things"" from the top of the science list as a trial. I did not expect to actually finish reading the book, but once I got started I found that it was the most interesting book that I had read in quite a while.It was very interesting and fun to read, spellbinding science, history with a dash of pure non-sense and fiction.Each chapter was cleverly crafted with a leading story that got you hooked and a ending that produced just the right cliff hanger effect for the next chapter.At times MB seemed to miss some arguments I might have made. The story about Bharatan's matrix pointing to similarities between homeopathic cures and conventional prescriptions, it seemed obvious to me that homeopaths would copy preexisting proven drugs."

I definitely don't agree with some of the items on his list, like homeopathy for example, but I did agree with many of the others. Dark energy and Dark matter are very fascinating to me, but my favorite portion of the book was on the origin of life. This has been a topic that I find incredibly interesting as of late. I have been reading many books with different theories and ideas as to how life began on this planet. Most of the theories seem plausible, but most, if not all, have no evidence to back them up. So that leaves the origin of life a mystery.The only topic I wish he would have brought up in this book is the rise of consciousness in humans. I've read many theories and hypotheses on this, but again, not a lot of evidence creates quite the mystery in how we are self aware."
57,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163039-kevin-hanks,4,"A fascinating read, and every nerdy part of me that loves science went nuts! The book is all about scientific mysteries that we have yet to explain or understand fully. It delved into everything from black holes, dark matter, cold fusion, giant viruses, evolution and natural selection, even asexual reproduction. It was wild. Now granted, it wasn't the most fast-paced book in the world, but it still managed to hold my interest and made me appreciate what we DO know. I will say also that while I was pretty fascinated by the scientific aspects of the book, I was equally fascinated by the people and characters surrounding these scientific phenomenon. No one can look at the history of man's scientific achievements and think the scientific community is devoid of irrational behavior and emotional decision making. This book is a testament to the statement that ""people don't make decisions based on facts, they make decisions based on how they feel about facts"". Very interesting. "

I remember reading the article that is the nexus of this fun to read book. The original article from New Scientist was one of the most widely virally distributed document. I could never quite get it but I think deep down it is the very human element that science is done by humans and it delights to be able to the boffins that there's 13 things they haven't quite figured out. Michael Brooks does a smashing job of glossing over many fields of science. It is a captivating read without resorting to dumbing it down. There were many stretches of the book where I would be completely that I couldn't set it down and in one instance actually missed my stop. If you know of any young minds or if your mind continues to be maleable it is definitely worth a read.

Some parts about the missing universe, cosmology and the viking exploration were ok. I found the descriptions and study of death probably the most interesting. It discussed parts of your cells that regenerate to a point and then stop reproducing and die, this being part of a preprogrammed genetic code. Homeopathy was also very interesting as I've never researched this topic before or given it a second though. Still don't know if I believe it or not how succussion and dilution may or may not physically alter the structure of water and potentially the meds for a more impactful treatment is out there.Overall good insights shared and thanks for educating me on some new topics."

I was wrong. It really is not. I don't like listening to essays because it takes me an hour to get into a topic while listening, but for this book each chapter flowed into the next chapter and seemed related to the preceding chapter.

Brooks takes you through thirteen different scientific problems that don't make sense given our current understanding of how the universe works. For example, he explains how there appears to genuinely be something weird going on with cold fusion that nobody can explain.My favorite was his description of the experiments that illustrate we don't actually have free will. Neurologists are in general agreement these days that our bodies and brains constantly make decisions to do things without bothering to consult our consciousness. Instead, our brains basically lie to us non-stop and make us think we (as our consciousness) are making decisions instead of just fixing things up after the fact to make ourselves believe that. Ponder that one for a moment."

A class above the usual Bermuda Triangle/Alien Visitations associated with this kind of books, but still the emphasis on maverick science against the current accepted models gives an impression that today's cutting edge science is dead, maverick scientists are persecuted and such, while the actual facts as presented even in the book are ambiguous at best. Show clear proof of MOG, VSL, Cold Fusion or other edge theories and everyone will jump on the bandwagon - until then as the saying ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof"", the onus is on the claimants."

The reader should have some minimal background in science, especially biology and physics. This book is a few years old, but not yet out of date. In fact, some of these mysteries will never be solved. His discussion of homeopathy does not go far enough, in my opinion, because homeopathy is no longer a mystery to me. I figured it out! See my essay titled ""Does Homeopathy Work?"" on my profile page. In a larger sense, the whole world is a baffling mystery that does not make scientific sense."

However - fascinating read about an eclectic range of topics. I don't necessarily feel much wiser, but was quite smug when I knew what an ""eukaryote"" was on Mastermind the other day... Only annoying thing (and I am being petty here) is that my copy was clearly an American imprint and so not only had the spelling been Americanised, but also the phrasing.

This book was a lot more science-filled than I was expecting, so I was pleasantly surprised when the first chapter ""The missing Universe"" was a bout dark matter and dark energy, and how most of the known universe is comprised of mysterious stuff that we don't understand.Wikipedia outlines the book chapter by chapter, so I'll post it here to give an idea of it's topics. It's a great read.From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_Thing...OverviewBased on an article Brooks wrote for New Scientist in March 2005, the book, aimed at the general reader rather than the science community, contains discussion and description of a number of unresolved issues in science. It is a literary effort to discuss some of the inexplicable anomalies that after centuries science still cannot completely comprehend.Chapter 1The Missing Universe. This deals with astronomy and theoretical physics and the ultimate fate of the universe, in particular the search for understanding of dark matter and dark energy and includes discussion of: the work of astronomers Vesto Slipher and then Edwin Hubble in demonstrating the universe is expanding; Vera Rubin's investigation of galaxy rotation curves that suggest something other than gravity is preventing galaxies from spinning apart, which led to the revival of unobserved ""dark matter"" theory; experimental efforts to discover dark matter, including the search for the hypothetical neutralino and other weakly interacting massive particles); the study of supernovae at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Harvard University (under Robert Kirshner) that point to an accelerating universe powered by ""dark energy"" possibly Vacuum energy; and finally the assertion that the proposed modified Newtonian dynamics hypothesis and the accelerating universe disproves the dark matter theory.Chapter 2The Pioneer Anomaly. This discusses the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 space probes, which appear to be veering off course and drifting towards the sun. There is growing speculation as to whether this phenomenon can explained by a yet-undetermined fault in the rockets' systems or whether this obliges us to rethink theories of physics such as gravity. The lead investigator into the progress of the rockets is physicist Slava Turyshev of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California who is analysing the data of the rockets' launch and progress and ""reflying"" the missions as computer simulations to try to find a solution to the mystery.Chapter 3Varying Constants. This chapter discusses the reliability of some physical constants, quantities or values that are held to be always fixed. One of these, the Fine-structure constant, which calculates the behaviour and amount of energy transmitted in subatomic interactions from light reflection and refraction to nuclear fusion, has been called into question by physicist John Webb of the University of New South Wales who may have identified differences in the behaviour of light from quasars and light sources today. According to Webb's observations quasar light appears to refract different shades of colour from light waves emitted today. Brooks also discusses the Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor, in which the natural conditions in caves in Gabon 2 billion years ago caused the uranium there to react. It may be that the amount of energy released was different from today. Both sets of data are subject to ongoing investigation and debate but, Brooks suggests, may indicate that the behaviour of matter and energy can vary radically and essentially as the conditions of the universe changes through time.Chapter 4Cold Fusion. A review of efforts to create nuclear energy at room temperature using hydrogen that is embedded in a metal crystal lattice. Theoretically, this should not happen, because nuclear fusion requires a huge activation energy to get it started. The effect was first reported by chemists Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons in 1989, but attempts to reproduce it over the ensuing months were mostly unsuccessful. Cold fusion research was discredited, and articles on the subject became difficult to publish. But a scattering of scientists around the world continue to report positive results, with multiple, independent verifications, making the evidence difficult to deny.Chapter 5Life. This chapters describes efforts to define life and how it emerged from inanimate matter (Abiogenesis) and even recreate Artificial life including: the Miller–Urey experiment by chemists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey at the University of Chicago in 1953 to spark life into a mixture of chemicals by using an electrical charge; Steen Rasmussen's work at the Los Alamos National Laboratory to implant primitive DNA, Peptide nucleic acid, into soap molecules and heat them up; and the work of the Institute for Complex Adaptive Matter at the University of California.Chapter 6Viking. A discussion of the experiments by engineer Gilbert Levin to search for life on Mars in the 1970s as part of the Viking program. Levin's Labeled Release experiment appeared to conclusively show that life does exist on Mars, but as his results were not supported by the other three Viking biological experiments, they were called into question and eventually not accepted by NASA, which instead hypothesized that the gases observed being generated may not have been a product of living metabolism but of a chemical reaction of hydrogen peroxide. Brooks goes into detail on some of Levin's other experiments and also describes how NASA's subsequent missions to Mars have focused on the geology and climate of the planet rather than looking for life on the planet.Chapter 7The Wow! Signal. Brooks discusses whether or not the signal spotted by astronomer Jerry R. Ehman at the Big Ear radio telescope of Ohio State University in 1977 was a genuine indication of intelligent life in outer space. This was a remarkably clear signal and Big Ear was the largest and longest running SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) radio-telescope project in the world. Brooks goes on to discuss the abandonment of NASA's Microwave Observing Program after government funding was stopped by the efforts of senator Richard Bryan of Nevada. There is no public funding for similar observations today while the SETI Institute, which continues NASA's work is funded by private donation, as are a number of other initiatives (see SETI).Chapter 8A Giant Virus. Brooks describes the huge and highly resistant Mimivirus found in Bradford, England in 1992 and whether this challenges the traditional view of viruses being inanimate chemicals rather than living things. Mimivirus is not only much larger than most viruses but it also has a much more complex genetic structure. The discovery of Mimivirus has given weight to the theories of microbiologist Philip Bell and others that viral infection was indeed the reason for the emergence from primitive life forms of complex cell structures based on a cell nucleus. (See viral eukaryogenesis.) Study of the behaviour and structure of viruses is ongoing.Chapter 9Death. Beginning with the example of Blanding's turtle and certain species of fish, amphibians and reptiles that do not age as they grow older, Brooks discusses theories and research into the evolution of ageing. These include the studies of Peter Medawar and George C. Williams in the 1950s and Thomas Johnson, David Friedman and Cynthia Kenyon in the 1980s claiming that ageing is a genetic process that has evolved as organism select genes that help them to grow and reproduce over ones that help them to thrive in later life. Brooks also talks about Leonard Hayflick, as well as others, who have observed that cells in culture will at a fixed point in time stop reproducing and die as their DNA eventually becomes corrupted by continuous division, a mechanical process at cell level rather than part of a creature's genetic code.Chapter 10Sex. This chapter is a discussion of theories of the evolution of sexual reproduction. The common-sense explanation is that although asexual reproduction is much easier and more efficient for an organism it is less common than sexual reproduction because having two parents allows species to adapt and evolve more easily to survive in changing environments. Brooks discusses efforts to prove this by laboratory experiment and goes on to discuss alternative theories including the work of Joan Roughgarden of Stanford University who proposes that sexual reproduction, rather than being driven by Charles Darwin's sexual selection in individuals is a mechanism for the survival of social groupings, which most higher species depend on for survival.Chapter 11Free Will. Discusses the experimental investigations into the Neuroscience of free will by Benjamin Libet of the University of California, San Francisco and others, which show that the brain seems to commit to certain decisions before the person becomes aware of having made them and discusses the implications of these findings on our conception of free will.Chapter 12The Placebo Effect. This is a discussion of the role of the placebo in modern medicine, including examples such as Diazepam, which, Brooks claims, in some situations appears to work only if the patient knows they are taking it. Brooks describes research into prescription behaviour which appears to show that use of placebos is commonplace. He describes the paper by Asbjørn Hrobjartsson and Peter C. Gøtzsche in the New England Journal of Medicine that challenges use of placebos entirely, and the work of others towards an understanding of the mechanism of the effect.Chapter 13Homeopathy. Brooks discusses the work of researcher Madeleine Ennis involving a homeopathic solution which once contained histamine but was diluted to the point where no histamine remained. Brooks conjectures that the results might be explained by some previously unknown property of water. Brooks supports the investigation of documented anomalies even though he is critical of the practice of homeopathy in general, as are many of the scientists he cites, such as Martin Chaplin of South Bank University."

78,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48319145-clive-f,5,"What a fascinating book! Michael Brooks surveys thirteen areas of enquiry - some narrow and deeply embedded in science, such as the search for dark matter and dark energy, others already discarded by mainstream science but still refusing to completely lie down and die, such as cold fusion and homeopathy, and a few that are broader and don't naturally fit into a single narrow field of study, like sex, death and free will. He looks at where we are in investigating them, and then pokes and prods at the challenging questions, and the possible explanations. Why do most complex living things die, for example? Not all do, and it's possible to significantly extend lifespans, in some cases apparently indefinitely, via mechanisms such as gene editing. So why would it be there in the first place? If genes just wanted to propagate themselves, then surely best to do it from the existing host, rather than risk killing the existing host and chancing that there are enough progeny out there to pass on the genes themselves?Other questions explore areas that just appear to have been made up by science to create convenient explanations for things. Dark matter and dark energy are like this. From the way stars rotate around the centres of a galaxy, we can use the laws of gravity as we understand them to estimate the total mass in the galaxy. And, based on what we see, there isn't nearly enough visible mass there. Hence the need for additional dark matter. But we can't detect it in any wavelength. Which means it must have very specific properties, in order to remain hidden. And we don't have any explanation for the existence of such matter. So maybe it's our understanding of the laws of gravity that's wrong? Right now, we simply don't know! And so on, across thirteen fields of such broad range that it's hard not to be captured by many of them. Underlying them all is the theme that science as a field finds it hard to change its mind. In part, this is a very good thing: any new explanation can't discard all the data accumulated so far, it must explain all that we already know, plus these additional observations that are currently unexplained. And that's a very hard test. But this is also about how scientists are people, and people don't like to have their world models turned upside down. So it's a book about how we practice science itself, as much as about these particular mysteries.I enjoyed it very much. Well written, with some mind-spinning thoughts in it. Many paper books that I read get released back into the wild after their first read, as perhaps interesting but not worthy of a re-visit. This one, I shall be keeping, and opening up on a winter's evening for a quick browse, and a follow-up online to see where we are on some of these mysteries."
79,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75005592-dmitry,2,"As you'd expect of a book on such topics written more than 7 years ago, some of its sections are already outdated. Turyshev's thermal explanation of the Pioneer anomaly for example was published in 2012 and is now accepted by most scientists. The Mimivirus is no longer the biggest virus ever found - the Pandoraviruses discovered in 2013 are twice as big. Fleischmann died in 2012 and never saw any acknowledged evidence of cold fusion. Though the reason for that last one is that there is actually none. And that is the biggest problem of the book. It spends too much time describing groundless theories and disproved speculations. I understand the message: scientists can be biased and the human factor does play its role. Sometimes facts may be ignored and worthy ideas may be overlooked by the scientific community. But is putting the dark energy problem and things like homeopathy in one row really necessary to make that point? While I was expecting a discussion on something like ""13 greatest scientific mysteries of our time"", instead for half of the book I was supposed to go through speculations and various claims of different specialists in fields that aren't even accepted as scientific. The book makes no attempts to prove those things are actually worth our attention, the arguments the author gives us mostly are ""some people are still working on that"" or ""the guy who did that controversial experiment twenty years ago still believes there is something to it"". And personally, I need a bit more that that to really consider the possibility of most scientists being wrong about cold fusion, homeopathy or life on Mars.Although the author does give a good overview of some problems, like the problem of aging and death, and impartially describes different approaches and scientific opinions on them. Besides the book is rather easy to read, the explanations of complex scientific concepts are clear and surprisingly precise. And despite everything I said above the book's tone is in fact inspiring. One just needs to remember there is a fine line between being a rebel and being a freak."
80,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2224950-kathryn,5,"I finished reading this non-fiction book today via Kindle on my tablet; it is a very readable exploration of things that science both can and cannot prove or disprove, and I very much enjoyed reading this book.After a Prologue, we move to the thirteen chapters:  1. The Missing Universe: We can only account for 4 percent of the cosmos; 2. The  Pioneer  Anomaly: Two spacecraft are flouting the laws of physics; 3. Varying Constants: Destabilizing our view of the universe; 4. Cold Fusion: Nuclear energy without the drama; 5 Life: Are you more than just a bag of chemicals?; 6. Viking NASA: scientists found evidence for life on Mars. Then they changed their minds.; 7. The  WOW! Signal: Has ET already been in touch?; 8. A Giant Virus: It's a freak that could rewrite the story of life; 9. Death: Evolution's problem with self-destruction; 10. Sex: There are better ways to reproduce; 11. Free Will: Your decisions are not your own; 12. The Placebo Effect: Who's being deceived?; and 13. Homeopathy; It's patently absurd, so why won't it go away?Essentially, the book shows that science is by no means an unbroken path to ultimate knowledge. It is a discipline that is affected by bias (conscious and unconscious), by politics, by preconceived notions by individuals, the discipline as a whole, and the world at large, and the fact that a given fact, even if correct in itself (by no means a given) can fit into wildly varying theories. What may be needed in science is a Paradigm Shift: not reworked theories, but startlingly new theories that eventually become part of What Everyone Knows.The author's Epilogue notes that it is quite possible that in many areas (not confined to the thirteen anomalies explored in the book), what will advance science is scientists of the future, but of course they may end up either visionary or hidebound as well.I very much enjoyed reading this book, and recommend it to those who love science."
81,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111500954-anna,3,"This book opened my eyes to the problems that science face. I can understand how incredibly frustrating it would be to not be able to solve these problems scientifically. However, maybe I read this book with an expectation that instead of discussing the various studies surrounding each issue in a very scientific way, Brooks might have approached some of the issues with his own, more philosophical conclusion and debate. My mind was not prodded and challenged when reading this book. Each chapter justifies why the particular problem is a problem, but I think there is a resistance to explore the possibility that maybe not everything can be explained by science, and this book had the perfect opportunity to do this. Not so much the beginning chapters about space and planets- I think it's perfectly reasonable to assume we have more to learn about outer space that may explain these anomalies, but, a more philosophical approach to the placebo affect and homeopathy would have been appropriate since to me, with some background knowledge about these issues, it is clear that science, however complicated, is unable to comprehensively explain these phenomena's, and maybe, instead of siting the research and experiments that have contributed to the current scientific conclusion about these issues, these chapters would have benefited from a more philosophical approach. "
82,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25058918-patrick,3,"Very interesting read, with some pretty upsetting ramifications.The basic premise of this book is pretty innocuous: There are things that have baffled science for many years. Let's discuss! Sounds great, right? Sort of an ""Unsolved Mysteries"" in book form. What I wasn't prepared for was 13 stories of how far the intelligentsia will go to shut up scientists that don't believe what they believe. And I do say believe, because many of the topics of this book are outside what is provable or repeatable with science. If you and your colleagues actually want to investigate the unknown and come up with some new theories or results that disprove the popular beliefs, there's a good chance you'll be blackballed before you can publish your results. It's a good read just for the discussion of the injustices that have been perpetrated by scientists against the scientific method. Once, it was the Catholic church that was burning scientists at the stake for stating something against the prevailing beliefs. Now, science will burn scientists at the stake for findings that point a different direction."
83,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,3,"Most of this book told me nothing that I did not already know, although I had not previously heard of some of the anamolies that Brooks cites as baffling scientific mysteries. I had not for example previously heard of the ""Wow"" message, which might have been sent by an alien civilization, or the odd course deviations of the Pioneer spacecraft in the outer reaches of the solar system that may imply that gravity works differently at great distances. But there wasn't enough here to give any basis for the reader to form a reasoned opinion as to whether the cited anamolies are nonsense or true indications of a need to revise scientific theories. I guess that was part of the point because if we had explanations, they wouldn't be anamolies, and even if they are thought by many people to be bogus and indicative of nothing, a casual dismissal of unexplained phenomena could be a lost opportunity for scientific advancement that can happen only if the inexplicable is taken seriously. I just wish that Brooks had been more convincing in persuading me that his baffling mysteries are truly baffling and worthy of concentrated scientific effort to explain."

The case that it belongs in a book with the placebo effect and dark matter is shaky to begin with; homeopathy is patently false and its history clearly points to such, however sincere its current advocates may be. The chapter on it pretty much leads to the book falling apart, and I'm forced to wonder if Brooks is either being contrary for the sake of being contrary, or if this whole thing has been yet another attempt to ""just ask questions"" about a pseudoscience.Granted, the other chapters have a somewhat similar problem: Brooks doesn't push hard enough against his own premise. As a light read, or listen, it's fun until the final chapter, but I'd borrow this one."

There is a lot of interesting stuff in here and I found it quite enjoyable. If you do like that kind of thing, I recommend ""What If: serious scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions."" It's similar but more fun. That said the info in this book was very enjoyable, but only if you are interested a book NOT told in the form of a story.The reader was British and therefore perfect for book.The message wasn't particularly political or religions. I'd say it was ok for young adults, although attention span is important here. I had trouble listening myself sometimes, hence 4 stars instead of 5."

Things like dark energy is still a dark side of science that will take more time to figure out what it exactly is. Like the quote that goes for Software Programming, ""When you fix a bug, you introduce ten more"", when you make a breakthrough in science, you open up more uncharted avenues to research. A very interesting and intriguing read, some of which I have thought about as well, but at a very naive level and left them for either the loss of interest or didn't know how to look further.

Among these are why most astrophysicists think dark matter and dark energy exist, why scientists think Einstein's theories need to be modified and the controversies surrounding cold fusion. All of these I've read about before but until now never in terms I felt comfortable with. If the title of this book tempts you to read the book, read it! I guarantee you won't regret it. "

The topics discussed in this book have been unsettled for years and probably will remain so for years to come. The book also shows how brutal scientists can be to those who don’t follow the herd. Money is taken, careers are ruined and lives are shattered because someone is diverging from the mainstream. And yet, divergences have led to our greatest advances in knowledge.

As Brooks states an answer either way would be extraordinary. In this section he brings up the “wow” signal from space and that its origin has still not been determined. The scientific community found that the radio signal was generated by two comets. With any luck the others will be answer as well. Cheers!

134,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20947171-yates-buckley,5,"This book is great, but not for the reasons many reviewers describe. This book takes the reader along a quick trip to cover a number of areas where science is either undergoing a shift or where the phenomenon poses puzzles that are paradoxical. While doing so the book sets an accessible dialogue about how science and knowledge production works. The book is an educational piece for people that are not involved in science or the production of knowledge by experiment. I have not found other books that are as effective at bringing lay insight participation into the process of science."
135,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10089604-ethan-armstrong,5,"An accessible and entertaining read, despite the level of complexity in some of the scientific discussions. Brooks covers a wide spectrum of scientific befuddlement; including cosmology, medicine, chemistry, biology, psychology, and philosophy. Thomas Kuhn would be proud."
136,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7580305-charles,4,"This is an interesting book. I was expecting a science book, and this is, but in addition to sciency stuff like gravity and quantum physics, they also cover life, death, sexual reproduction and free will. It was really the science behind why we can't explain what life is exactly, and the experiments that seem to prove that we DON'T have free will that were the most fascinating to me. There is so much mystery in our lives that we've grown extremely good at overlooking because we don't have answers for it. This book points those things out and what scientists have done to try to prove or disprove various theories around them. All that being said, most of the book is fairly light science and accessible to most everyone I would think."
137,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2265851-doug,2,"The book presents itself as an exploration of issues that sort of ""defy explanation,"" or at least are hard to nail down. The early part of the book was devoted to things that one would normally expect, such as the nature and age of the universe, presence and effects of dark matter, varying constants, the Pioneer drift and the Wow signal from space. A good beginning, as based on current undserstandings and theories, as well as our current ability to measure such things, all of these issues are somewhat nonsensical. The center of the book started to diverge a bit from the beginning, and Brooks talks about things like the the origin of death, origin of life, and whether or not human beings actually have free will. He closes by discussing the placebo effect and then homeopathy. He spends a lot of time in each chapter going over current theories, then cites specific data that either refutes what we think is the case at present, shows it to be lacking in its ability to explain the subject, or casts large enough doubts upon it to make it worth talkking about. My problem is this...any person who holds even a single drop of skepticism within his or her body, will take it as a given that there are things, even things we have to take for granted at the present time, that aren't quite right, so the book itself isn;t really as shocking or surprising as Brook made it out to be in his introduction. Maybe I read too much into his opening, but when someone tells me that science is wrong, my usual response is ""well duh!"" Science isn't about answering...it's about exploring and questioning. We expect to be wrong...and as our tools improve, our theories are bound to change.What Brooks seems most fond of pointing out, even more than scientific wierdness, and as he does at almost every opportunity, is that the scientific community, by and large, is resistant to altering the way they think about whatever they are currently studying. This seems to be the real axle of his book, the thing that all of the other sections revolve around. So as a poke at the established scientific community, and as an exploration of how new discoveried can radically shift or even obliterate current scientific beliefs about phenomena, the book succeeds. It does get confusing and technical at tiomes, as Brooks throws in new jargon whenever he can, and uses it heavily.Overall, worth a read, but I was not blown away by anything. Save yourself the time and read the article that was inflated to become the book.And I still think homeopathy is a load of crap."
138,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8629281-rohit,4,"Michael Brooks is an engaging writer. In his commentary on thirteen scientifically unexplained things, (the list by the way is not exhaustive) he touches on subjects as diverse as chemistry and astrophysics, biology and psychology and even medicinal sciences. In each of them, he mixes the profound with the mundane with such effortless ease that his readers are compelled to keep up with him for the entire ride. He knows how to make the reader think and also to keep them hooked chapter after chapter.He begins with the much familiar dark matter and impresses on the reader just how unfamiliar it is, in reality. That we don't have much clue about something that by rights, should be constituting 96% of the universe should humble any man proud of human achievements in the sphere of science. Then there is the case of pioneer probes 10 and 11 which seemingly deviate from Newton's laws of gravity, even when the theory of relativity is incorporated into the picture. Then there is the prospect of varying constant values and the much famous Cold Fusion. Then Brooks examines the ultimate mystery of life and what it means to be alive and follows it up with the old Viking probes sent to Mars to detect life. Then there is that 1977 extraterrestrial signal which we can't make neither heads nor tail of. The giant mimivirus with more than half its genes unknown is an exciting anomaly in biology. Brooks then goes on to explain why death is as mysterious as life is and the possibilities of extending one's lifespan. Then he tells us that biology has no explanation why sex or rather sexual reproduction should be so popular when there are other better ways of reproduction. Perhaps his contention that we in reality might not have free will is the most disturbing anomaly among his collection. Then he shows how science can't explain the placebo effect and the science, if there is one, of homeopathy.The most important thing while writing about science or the boundaries of science is the need to be rational and never get carried away. Here Brooks lingers on the possibilities of things that could well be beyond the scope of contemporary science but he never loses the rationality in his voice. The thirteen things he has listed in the book could very well be Kuhnian anomalies, the explanations of which could trigger revolutions in science and radically alter our understanding of the cosmos and ourselves. Brooks has indeed done a very good job of presenting the anomalies, collected from diverse branches of science."
139,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7852031-annie-kate,4,"When experimental results don't make sense is when there is a golden opportunity for learning. Some of the topics in this book may eventually lead to great strides in understanding, and at least one has been solved.As a physicist I was especially interested in the first four chapters and am somewhat qualified to comment on them.1. Most of the energy and mass in the universe are unaccounted for, according to majority opinion. Some disagree. In either case, there's a lot we don't understand about the universe. 2. The Pioneer rockets are not moving as the theory of gravity predicts. Reasons for this have been diligently hunted down, and since the publication of the book the problem has been solved: http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/as... or a bit less technically: http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclop...3. There is experimental evidence that one of the fundamental constants of the universe, alpha, seems to have changed over time. Since the times discussed have been challenged, the theories involved are not completely understood, and the philosophy involved is debateable, there's all sorts of room for discovery here.4. Cold Fusion: I recall the excitement and then the enormous backlash. Because the backlash was so extreme and personal, I've always felt a bit sorry for the scientists involved. I was intrigued to read here that the MIT data were changed to show no excess energy production, and that other research has found some excess heat production. Currently, research is ongoing: http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Cold_f...11. The only other chapter I want to comment on is the one about free will. Because electrical impulses can give people urges to do things as well as make them do them, it seems there is no free will. However, in one sense, because of the concept of neuroplasticity (Nobel prize 2000, Kandel) one can argue that people can chemically restructure their brains. Perhaps that concept should impact this discussion."
140,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58181332-simon,4,"What is the moon doing there? Where did it come from? You don’t know, do you? You’ve never even stopped to think about it. I found out when I read this book.Actually, that’s a bit of red herring because the book is about the things that we can’t currently explain, the evidence that doesn’t fit, rather than the things we can (and we can explain the moon). Spanning physics, cosmology, chemistry, biology and medicine, and with an explicit nod to Kuhn’s ‘The Structure of Scientific Revolutions’, the book is a useful lesson in how science happens and how, occasionally, the paradigm gets shifted. The author has a PhD in quantum physics and is a well-established science writer but I thought the book was a refreshing corrective to some of the ‘absolute science’ I’ve been reading recently. For example – and this is a real pisser for an arch-sceptic like me – it turns out that there might, just might, be something in homeopathy. All the New Age hocus pocus is total rubbish, obviously, but there is data that suggests it might not just be all about the placebo effect. The properties of a substance can be related to its structure rather than its composition, and structural information can be transferred from one substance to another without the direct transfer of material (epitaxy, apparently). From that flows the possibility that the molecular structure of water (a substance about which we know surprisingly little) might be changed by a substance that has been suspended in it, even when that substance has been diluted to the point of statistical invisibility. Wouldn’t it be really f*cking annoying if the homeopathy morons were right?Best thing about the book, though, is Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky’s description of his colleagues as ‘spherical bastards’ (bastards whichever way you look at them). Excellent sciencey joke in an excellent bit of a popular science writing."

There is some overlap, but the two disciplines are seeking to answer completely different questions.  Science wants to know how.  Religion is better at answering why.  Further, science isn’t even capable of answering why.  That’s just not what science does.  - It’s funny how hard it has been  for science to create life.  The theory is – if the conditions are right – it just happens.  Yet scientists (who are intelligent designers, by the way) haven’t been  able to make it work.  - Come to think of it, if life just kinda pops up when the mood is right, how come it doesn’t happen all the time?  I was a pretty lonely teenager, but never once did a cheerleader spontaneously materialize in my lap.  - I also find it entertaining that many scientists will bend over backward to avoid any conclusion that involves God, but then turn right around and invoke aliens.  Even if it does turn out to be aliens responsible for the universe, they would have to be pretty similar to the common conception of God to be able to do it.  Might as well call them God.  Is it because we don’t like a God that holds us responsible for stuff like bending over backward to avoid Him?  - A popular subject in pop science has been whether or not we have free will.  Isn’t it ironic that studies are conducted (some of which deserve credit. They definitely require consideration) and books are written to persuade us that we don’t have free will?  Yet, if we don’t, then the authors couldn’t decide to write the book.  We couldn’t decide to read it, and we couldn’t change our minds about having free will because remember - we don’t have free will.  It’s a self-defeating proposition. "
142,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072527-nicholas,3,"A great introduction to the problems facing modern science, but I felt like it could have been so much more. The great thing about 13 Things is that the chapters can stand alone, and a reader can delve into the mysteries that interest them while avoiding some of the others that may be boring. Some chapters are definitely better than others. The best of them include: Free Will, the Placebo Effect, the Wow Signal and the chapter on the Pioneer anomaly. The long and short of it is that Brooks uses Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions as a framework for discussing how each of the anomalies could have the potential for major paradigm shifts in the sciences. It's an interesting idea, but not one that I think meshes well with ALL of the topics he mentions. Moreover, while the anomalies are interesting and hint to some tantalizing fact or law just beyond our current understanding, Brooks falls into a pattern-theme of orthodoxy vs. ""real"" scientific work, in which the big names of mainstream science crush the results of scientists whose results make them feel uncomfortable. The implication is, ""If only they'd listen, we'd know the truth."" As I've said, that might be true in some cases, but it starts to sound downright conspiratorial when repeated too often and in so many different facets of science.Anyway, it's a short read, and a great jumping off point for interest in some of the anomalies. If nothing else its a neat summation of different arguments concerning some problems in modern science. The bibliography was disappointingly thin. I was hoping to be able to mine some of his resources for some more information, but so far, there's been nothing beyond what Brooks presents in the book."
143,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7601576-harriet,4,"It is a truth universally ignored, that science knows jack all about the universe. Because, let's be honest, we've only really been looking (properly) for the last 500 years or so, and for most of that we've been wrong. It makes sense, right? The universe is huge. Everything in it is super complex. How can we have learnt all there is to know in the last half a millennium? Well, we can't.Brooks attempts to address this assumption in 13 Things That Don't Make Sense by highlighting the fact that, not only do we assume our knowledge is far greater than it is, but also that what we do know is unerringly correct. Also not true. There are many examples - most listed in this book - of times when a paradigm shift has caused scientists to see the world in a new and wonderful way. But this isn't without a lot of umming, ahhing, pushing, shoving, and general stubbornness. Brooks main point throughout is that there are many areas of scientific thought that are about due for another massive switch-up - and I have to say, I agree.I'll leave the specifics for you to uncover for yourself, but I'd definitely recommend giving this book a go. Alongside lots of things you probably didn't know already, Brooks presents a new way of thinking about things, as well as being well-written and thoroughly researched. Admittedly it's not a conclusive argument, but he does set the stage for more detailed work to follow up. I have more qualms about the book, but these are due to my disagreement with the topics covered, rather than the book itself, so I won't go into those here. Suffice it to say that if you're in need of ideas for heated debate topics, look no further! Free will and homoeopathy have been the biggest talking points in my house so far..."
144,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23687449-jokers,3,"“13 things that do not make sense”, by Michael Brooks, is an informative non-fiction book. It’s overall good to read because it explains scientific anomalies that the smartest men and women on the planet cannot agree on or figure out. Brooks wrote in a simplistic way when describing the material, and gave a brief definition that explained the meaning of any word or phrase that would probably only be used in the scientific community. The inclusion of definition and the use of vocabulary that the general public would understand make the book easy to understand and follow along. I recommend individuals who have an interest in science or happen to like finding out about confusing things about the world. Reading and later reviewing the book, I took notice to Brooks’ style choice. Michael Brooks gives a brief history on the scientist responsible for the uncovering of the anomaly. Later describing his or her experiments pertaining to it, and the affect it causes to the community. Then he moves onto other scientist who shared in interest in the anomaly, be it that they disagree or agree with what the previous scientist. The subjects presented in the book include: the creation of life; cold fusion; sex; and the placebo effect. Each subject is given their own in individual chapters that go into detail about why they are considered anomalies. My favorite section was chapter 4 “Cold Fusion”, in which brooks explains scientist reluctance to accept it. This chapter talked about how many scientists who studied or showed interest in cold fusion were usually shunned and ostracized. The Navy hid their cold fusion experiments, and scientist who were known to work in it, lost credibility and many of the other discoveries were overlooked. "
145,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2763719-john,3,"Should probably be titled 13 THINGS THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE TO MATERIALISTS WHO BELIEVE IN MOLECULES-TO-MAN EVOLUTION. The first big chunk of the book, which mainly focuses on cosmology, is supremely fascinating. The author explores each question as though it were a mystery story, offering up an abundance of clues and red herrings. But I quickly lost interest once he started delving into questions involving Darwinian evolution. Questions like, how did death evolve? And why do most Earth creatures reproduce sexually rather than asexually? As a proponent of Intelligent Design, I consider such questions to be fundamentally flawed. Besides, the significance of these questions pales in comparison to questions like ""How is it that evolution can subvert Pasteur's law of biogenesis? How can coded information (as found in human DNA) possibly evolve naturally? How is evolution able to thwart the second law of thermodynamics? Why does the long-disproved theory 'ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny' still find traction in modern society?"" And so on and so on.There's also a chapter on ""free will"" that bugged me quite a lot. The author says stuff like, ""You know how you get out of bed in the morning sometimes without making the conscious decision to do so? This demonstrates that people don't have free will."" Uh, I can only speak for myself here, but I can honestly tell you that I have NEVER gotten out of bed in the morning without deciding to do so. Sure, I sometimes leap out of bed without giving my brain a chance to reconsider, but I've never found myself standing next to my bed thinking ""How on earth did I get here?"""
146,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57219645-fog-aether,4,"Honestly I was hoping that this book would be more... out there. While I do enjoy science, I enjoy science fiction far more. I was hoping for some theories about aliens already being here or, I don't know, elves or something. hahahahaha But it wasn't like that. It was still a very good read though and I don't regret it at all.We as a species have not yet learned from our past. History is overflowing with examples of people who have made a new scientific discovery only to be shut down by the community and in some cases put to death. It doesn't matter how much the new discovery makes sense or how much better it fits the evidence than the current theories. Humanity is loathe to reject the things they think of as common knowledge or fact - the things that humanity has held on to as the best explanation for years. Michael Brooks chooses 13 topics in modern science in which our current beliefs do not line up with the evidence, but in which the majority of modern scientists are far too wary to dismiss their commonly held beliefs. He does not offer definitive answers to these problems, but rather points out that the current understanding in these areas does not reflect the evidence very well. He offers the best solutions that we have come up with so far, most of which have not received enough funding to be studied sufficiently enough to know whether or not they might provide some insight. I found this book extremely interesting and enlightening and find myself wanting to further study a few of the topics he discusses. This book was well worth the read and I intend to keep it in my library as I slowly become more of a minimalist."
147,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3103295-mina,4,"My only complaint about this book is that its title is misleading. Brooks does present a thorough and interesting exploration of thirteen things that don't make sense - but nearly all of them are things that the majority of general interest readers likely couldn't make sense of at all. The content is not as accessible as, and rather more technical than, the intriguing title suggests. Then again - if the title weren't so simple and direct, I probably wouldn't have looked into the book.The book examines an interesting range of scientific anomalies in an engaging way with credible background information. I'm of two minds about the order of presentation; on the one hand, the early chapters about grand-scale issues in cosmology, astronomy and theoretical physics allowed for useful comparisons in the later topics, but on the other, the latter topics of the purpose of sex, life, and death are rather more relatable. If I'd been reading this book rather than listening to it, the heavy first few chapters would probably have discouraged me from slogging through to the later more scintillating ones. As for the narration of this audio version, I found it excellent. Well-paced and compelling to listen to even when the content swerved to tedium. Overall, though, the book's content was definitely satisfying and informative. If you've any interest at all in the ups and downs and traps of scientific progress, I'd say this is recommended reading."
148,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53651660-volvelle,2,"The physics sections were interesting, but the author becomes way too credulous in the later chapters on free will and , especially, homeopathy.The problem with free will (something I would consider only a philosophical/theological concept anyway) seems to rest solely upon an incredibly shaky experiment that requires test subjects to be able to accurately report (within millionths of a second) when they thought of performing an action and actually doing it.The homeopathy section is even worse, spending time with people who wish to ""rescue homeopathy"" from new agers, yet bottle products made from a ""bee drowned in alcohol"" and ""bat wing"". Even the people who are skeptical of the homeopathic practice of diluting a substance out of existence are still working off the medieval concept of ""similars"". It's patently silly, and not the least bit scientific. Even the researcher who produced a cladogram of homeopathic remedies and their ""curative"" powers managed to discover nothing more than that a certain type of plant already used to treat heart problems is used by homeopaths to treat heart problems. Well, duh. She and the author conveniently forget that nothing in her study shows that homeopathic versions of this plant are effective at treating heart disease.Those two chapters were so bad, it made me question the accuracy of the reporting in the first half of the book."
149,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6022040-camille,4,"The first few chapters of this book dealt with several unanswered questions about the cosmos— the weight of the universe, the concept of dark matter, and the big bang expansion—which is pretty heady stuff. The next several chapters were easier to comprehend and included theories on homeopathy and the placebo effect. The most fascinating chapters dealt with cold fusion, and the discovery of the Mimivirus, a giant virus that may rewrite the tree of life and explain why we age. I did not really get the chapter about free will. The experiments performed didn't really push the argument in any direction, in my opinion. One thing I learned from this book is that quite a few scientists do not forge roads, but merely tread on them. For a scientist to come out with a radical new thought, he runs the risk of being ridiculed (and losing his funding), therefore, nobody wants to upset the applecart. The idea that Newton's laws may have to be revisited due to knowledge we now have about how bodies move in space and the space time continuum seems logical, but nobody will touch it—reminiscent of Galileo's suggestion of a sun-centered solar system. It is very disillusioning, as we like to envision scientists always pushing the envelope, but obviously, that is not the case. I liked the book. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone for casual reading, though."
150,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10324779-christine-zarah,4,"""Whatever the revolutions to come, one thing is sure. Every advance will most likely tell us as much about ourselves as it will about the universe we inhabit. We are collections of chemicals made in the cataclysmic explosions of stars; we are stardust, or nuclear waste, depending on your perspective. But, audaciously, we consider ourselves so much more than the sum of those parts; we declare ourselves to be alive, even though we don’t know what that means. We want to, we expect to, discover other living things in this vast universe, while we also struggle to make sense of the chemistry of a few palladium atoms held in a small tank of water. We can think ourselves out of pain and yet can also prove we do not control even our own muscles. We launch probes into space, but we are unable to explain our most primitive urges and desires. We consider ourselves the pinnacle of evolution while aware we know very little of its true story. All this surely speaks to our desire to frame ourselves, to understand what it means to be a human being in this universe.""It merges scientific mystery with intelligent humor. I mean, who wouldn't like that? It's philosophical and informative and funny. Plus, there's Carl Sagan, my favorite cosmologist, who, according to the book, is ""the face of cosmic exploration and the hero of every space-loving child."" Yes."
151,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40576987-steve-li,4,"The name of this book is misleading. It is really about 13 phenomena that we don't understand. Most of the book is science related and some science background will likely improve your appreciation. The topics are quite scientifically varied and covers astrophysics, physics, chemistry, biology, pscyhology. The author does a good job in presenting a balanced description and history of each of the topics. I am a scientist and found much of what was presented as very interesting and new information.Oddly, my advice would be to read the epiloge first. It is a very good presentation of the wonders of science and why we pursue knowledge and serves as a great reason to care about what is in the book. It is also a good review of the chapaters to come. A few of the interesting chapters include the fact that the cold fusion experiments that were supposedly a bust, are now found to have enough merit to have spurred ongoing research. It also interesting to know that space craft launched into the glaxay decades ago, appear to have inexplicable changes in their flight path. The chapter on the placebo was also very illuminating as it turns our that there may be more to the placebo effect than psychology. Unfortunately, not all the chapters are of equal interest, but I found at least 10 of 13 to be very worthwhile."
152,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8126617-steven-tucker,2,"I'm pretty disappointed. I thought that I would be reading more about the cutting edge of science, but unfortunately that just wasn't the case. The first chapter on dark matter and dark energy was interesting, for sure. And some of the other chapters got me to think. But overall I was underwhelmed. The author had a formula where he would introduce you to the prevailing theory, introduce some research by some scientists who were a bit out there, avoid discussing counter arguments to those scientists theories, and then make it sound as if the majority opinion shunned those scientists. It almost comes across as a conspiracy.Thing is, many of his points rely on the assumption that certain research is valid, despite the fact that no one has been able to repeat it. Also, there are some serious logical fallacies throughout the book. For example, Brooks claims that the WOW! signal must be from aliens because Occam's Razor says it would be so (i.e. the simplest explanation is most likely the correct one). He believes that because we can't figure out what caused the signal, it MUST be from aliens.I don't recommend picking up this book, but if you do stick to a few select chapters and leave the rest alone."
153,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6270476-jonathan-cate,3,"This book was pretty interesting. The author presents 13 subjects that society and science have not come to a consensus on and then he presents the history of each issue and the different aspects of the aurguments about the issues. These issues range from the definition of what is alive, ""giant"" viruses, dark matter/energy, death, immortality, homeopathic medicine, etc. Some of these issues are very thought provoking abd I learned a few things I didn't know before and that's always nice. The author's style is a little snarky and he seems to be pretty annoyed that the faults of the human condition interfere with the advancement of science. I have to say that it annoys me as well. The only reasons this book didn't receive four stars is that some of the writing is very technical and you start to drag in the minutia a bit. Also, it would have been nice if the author had expredded more of his own opinions on each subject. The book raises questions, but provides no real path to answers. Maybe I had a wrong idea of what the book would provide. Oh well, if you like science with a little philosophy thrown in, you give this book a read. "
154,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2782164-kevin,1,"This was a very disappointing book. The author took 11 interesting scientific mysteries/debates (plus 2 others) and applied fallacy after fallacy to them. For example, he appeals to accomplishment and appeals to novelty throughout the book.In the prologue he cites Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions and seems to only think that science only progress through Paradigm shifts.I hoped that this was not a warning that the author would suffer from the appeal to novelty fallacy that this could lead to and was disappointed when it did.The beginning chapters the authors tendency to the appeal to Novelty is largely balanced out by appeal to accomplishment(Nobel Prize) or authority(Government Funding). This balance started to skew more toward the appeal to Novelty as the book went on.There are also some odd jumps in logic. In the chapter on the Wow! signal his arguement can be summed up as, we don't know what caused it, therefore Alien Spaceship.In the chapter about the Placebo effect he Cherry picks his experience and concludes that it is more informative than all the studies into understanding if there is an underlying Placebo effect."
155,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4987429-tara-van-beurden,4,"I can’t quite remember where I discovered this book, but it sounded very interesting and I was in a science mood after all those teen romance novels. It also seemed like it might be a quick, short read. But it wasn’t. Despite it's relatively short length, it's a very dense book - probably more scientific than I was expecting. Brooks really gets into the technical side of the science behind the scientific mysteries he discusses, and though this is certainly interesting, it can be a little more challenging for those of us not quite across our physics. Nonetheless, Brooks covers some really interesting mysteries; some things I’d never heard of, and some things I simply didn’t realise weren’t established scientific fact (or theory, I guess). Moreover, I was really glad I read this book when I did, because it covered some of the science of the universe that I later found discussed when I attend World Science Festival in my home of Brisbane (the only World Science Festival held outside of New York - boom!). So, if you are an armchair science enthusiast (or have tickets to World Science Festival 2018), definitely give this one a read. "
156,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/247371-rod,1,"Disappointing, but maybe I was expecting too much. The author attempts to summarize some fundamental problems facing science (mainly physics) today. He starts with the problems of missing mass and missing energy. Physicists have only recently discovered that (if current theory is correct) the universe must contain a significant amount of energy that we can't seem to detect in any way. I would have hoped this book would summarize our current knowledge and then review on going attempts to resolve the problem. Unfortunately, the author make this search a sort of class warfare exercise where the vested interests refuse to allow the bright underclass (who have the real solutions) access to symposia, grants, etc.This is hammered home in the third chapter, where the author accuses the physics establishment of suppressing the brave cold fusion researchers Fleishmann and Pons. What a laugh. Virtually no serious physicist believes cold fusion was anything other than a scan perpetrated by these two. That's when I called it quits. Not Recommended."

The rest of the book, however, is great. During graduate school I did research for a professor who had me read a book called, Advance of the Fungi. The book enchanted me. For a time I romanticized the beginnings of scientific inquiry (a time well before the events of the book) and I imagined what it would have been like to live in a time when you were pen-pals with other untrained, but inquisitive people - debating and exploring each others observations of the natural world. I even told the professor, ""I'm sad I don't live in a time when EVERYTHING was a mystery and there were ground breaking or earth shaking discoveries to be made. Everything BIG is understood now."" This book did a good job of reminding me that I was so, so wrong. We know almost nothing. There is much out there to be learned. This books gives us a taste of how much we don't know."

In 13 Things ..., however, Michael Brooks reminds us that science is actually a big book of questions and - more often than not - arguments. He takes us through the big holes that science has barely begun to look into: from the dark physics of dark matter and energy, to the search for extraterrestrial life or intelligence, he quickly moves down to the human scale, working his way through life, death and sex and then onto the almost philosophical matter of free will. It’s a very interesting and enjoyable journey filled with the scientists who dare to take on the establishment and are willing to think the unthinkable - and pay the price when they are wrong too.

If you've been reading Discover or Scientific American monthly for the past 10 years, then none of the discoveries will be new to you. However, Brooks presents a more in-depth analysis of the series of academic publications that led up to the current views. He goes beyond the research results that agree with the current most popular theories and examines counter-arguments, and of course data sets still Don't Make Sense. For each topic, Brooks dives into the academic history after first introducing the topic in a succinct and exciting way that will probably grab the attention of lay-readers as well as it does scientists. My youngest son is 12 years old, and it held his attention on Audible in the car. Topics covered include astronomical constants that aren't constant, a virus that not only might be counted as alive but could also have been important in the evolution of many other lifeforms, dispelling the delusion of free will, and the evidence for the placebo effect."

I liked the chapter about Dark Matter & Dark Energy, and how they came to be hypothesized. But then the author says that Vera Rubin retracted her assertions, and that now she believes that Dark Matter/Dark Energy do not exist and their must be some other explanation for cosmological observations and mysteries. This is an intriguing idea, sort of analogous to the Michaelson-Morley ether, but no Einstein has come along yet to provide an explanation, and more important, I looked quite a while on the web, and nowhere did I find any documentation for the idea that Rubin has reversed herself on Dark Matter/Dark Energy. Then he goes on to discuss how Cold Fusion has ruined careers, decrying it, and then suggesting it might be possible. Why even discuss it?But then he goes on to discourse of non-scientific beliefs and practices, and attacks them mercilessly. Why does this go with discussions of scientific theories?Although I gained some value from it, I found this book to be a puzzle."

But, that one doesn't undermines the brilliant work Mr. Brooks has to offer to his readers. He might took the last one just to have the number that has some ""higher degree"" of significance in general publics mind, than it's the case with 12. But, let us leave alone the numbers. Intentionally, I don't want to mention any of these beauties, but all of them has power to torment, to torture or gladden the spirit or both in same time since we, humans made efforts to embark on board of science. Even if lay, thanks to the authors methodology of explaining things, one will easily grasp the entire matter of all the issues that science had never managed to explain or to solve.The book is genuinely entertaining, concepts are easy to extract and acquire despite of complexity of science fields that these enigmas are stressing.

Chapters 1-4 are fantastic, especially if you are interested in theoretical physics or astronomy. The weight of the universe, spacecraft flouting our current model of gravity, universal constants and the ever-popular matter of cold fusion. Chapter 8, detailing a monster virus, is interesting even to those who may not be into biology. But that is where the greatness ends. The rest of the topics range from the mildly interesting to the slow and pedantic; but Chapter 11 is an exercise in sheer stupidity. The author argues that free will does not exist, based upon a single experiment that produced vague (and imprecise) electrical measurements of human reaction. This is supposed to instantly countermand millenia of philosophy, deontology, metaphysics, etc.?! Chapter 11 is one of the most specious arguments I have ever encountered. Considering the hundreds of vacuous arguments I have heard in my time, that is saying something."

If we evolved, sexual reproduction is the most inefficient way to do it. Why is it the preferred method of most of the species on the planet?

Well, at first I did not think that this book would create such a huge impression in my mind, that would make me think about so many things, giving me an unexpected collection of interesting things to comment with my friends and my blog readers.In fact, all the 13 chapters have been actually interesting, although the scienfic formation of the reader can choose some of them as the best ones. Not really, in my case, biological topics were as interesting as physical ones, and I particularly enjoyed those about Giant Virus, Viking and Homeopathy.Regarding to the recommendations, and despite the didactical speech of the author, I find it difficult to suggest this book to a non-scientific person. Some concepts are hard to understand, even for science readers. However, if you have some knowledge and you feel intrigued about what science can not explain now, this is going to be a good activity for you curious spirit."

Many are physics related and require a re-examination of basic assumptions, e.g Dark matter/energy, the pioneer anomaly, varying constants and cold fusion. Some require a simple rethink of our definitions of concepts, like life and the case of the giant virus; where is the line between the living and non-living and is it just a continuum. Then there is the difficult to verify evidence for the existence of aliens from the viking experiments trying to find life on mars and the wow signal that we only received once.

It doesn't attempt to explain much, but rather serves as a great starting point on some thought experiments of science which are still to be determined. From Brooks' explanations you can go on to research more on each topic, and pick poles or figure out where you lie on the spectrum of the argument. I've also read a few bad reviews on amazon for this book. It's not weak on science, he remains open-minded throughout his discussions, and isn't trying to sell you any snake oil as other's would suggest. The way in which he lays out his arguments are indeed prototypical of each other, but there's nothing wrong with that (scenario, setup, sides of the argument, fights for both sides, leads you towards the less popular side in order to play devil's advocate in a case against herd mentality science)."
167,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/987316-thomas-moore,3,"Definitely for the science enthusiasts. I enjoyed most of this book. Hearing a little about all the research that is being done, has been done and the dead ends and unexplained phenomenon that scientists today are facing. Learning about the perplexing problems of dark matter, death & aging, why we have sex, viruses, the placebo effect and more was quite fascinating. In fact, I didn't even know that coming up with a reason about why we (as well as other animals) have sex is a problem. Apparently it is. Apparently no one is quite clear on how we evolved to be sexual creatures or have not evolved to be asexual, since that is much more efficient.However, after a little while it got to be too much science and studies and I felt a bit burned out. Definitely interesting, just a little much for me. "

The book can be boring at times, and I honestly didn't care for some of the names cited. I didn't find the homeopathy part interesting for example. As for the good parts, it brings into view a few issues that people should think about. What do we define as life? why is there death? And some issues that just plain interest me, like why is the universe expanding, what is dark matter/energy, and my FAVORITE one, have physics constants, always been constant?It made me think quite a bit, philosophically, scientifically etc. It was well written, and each chapter was neatly tied into the next one. The material presented wasn't overly difficult (at least in my opinion), but it's by no means light reading. I gave it 5 stars, because I think people really should read this book. "

Lest you think I am scientifically ignorant, I'll share some cool tidbits I managed to glean.1. Goldilocks planet, which is any planet found in a habitable zone; not too hot, not too cold. Clever, no?2. Homosexual swans raise better adjusted families than heterosexual swans. In fact, homosexual behavior has been found in over 300 species, although scientists are almost universally reluctant to reveal these findings.3. Mimivirus, a huge, complex virus straight out of a science fiction novel. Scary stuff.4. Valium (diazepam) works, but ONLY if you know you're taking it. When given to people anonymously, it had zero effect.I realize it's not an in-depth education, but it's a start."

That's this book. It's like ""There are many types of grape. Some are seedless, while others are seeded. Colors range from pale green to nearly black. They can be used for eating, drying, and even fermenting. Bananas are yellow.""

Those of us who are not scientists probably hold science, and the knowledge generated by it, in high regard. The author does a good job of reminding us that scientists, like all of us, are subject to blind spots, ego, and social pressures that interfere with the objectivity of the scientific method. There is still much that science cannot explain. The quest, with all its shortcomings, will go on, and will continue to enlighten us as long as there are minds willing to critically look at the world, and say, with wonder, ""That's funny."""

I think that the author provides just enough information about what is known about the questions that range from ""dark"" matter (what, where is it?) through death (why do some things live longer than others?)to challenge me, but not go into excessive detail.

I really wanted to like this book but unfortunately, after the compelling start to each chapter where an apparent anomaly or re-examination of a previously accepted theory is introduced, too much time is spent bogged down in explaining the various competing studies surrounding that issue. Of course, in a book that is principally concerned with theories that shift the boundaries of science, it is unlikely that there will be a conveniently definitive answer available. For me though, it is enough to know that there is still much that is not understood without needing to examine in detail every thesis that has been undertaken."

Is there really dark matter and dark energy out there, or does gravity just have a long-range component which we can't measure? Is there still something to cold fusion that can't be explained away? Why do living beings die? Is there even something to the ludicrous claims of homeopathic medicine? What is behind the placebo effect? Did the Viking lander really find evidence of life on Mars which was then mistakenly dismissed? Brooks tries for an evenhanded view, and from what I can tell, he accomplishes it, even with the beyond controversial inclusion of homeopathy."

Michael Brooks offers 13 'anomalies' in science that can flip our understanding of any one of several major areas of current scientific understanding, from cosmology, to biology, to medicine.At times the general reader may feel that Brooks goes on for a bit too much, and in deeper than one may desire, but I found it generally quite interesting and thought-provoking. I mean, I had never given it much thought that we really don't have a definitively agreed upon definition of 'life!' Nor that sex and death, while apparently linked (and I don't mean just in movies and novels!) are still quite mysterious."

The question - does free will exist, in scientific terms. People interested in this topic will find a BBC Horizon documentary - The Secret You, quite interesting and informative.This is a book that you can read 10 times and still be amazed each time."

And though there is no conclusive answers to any of these questions (hence the title of the book), it is interesting to see hard-data science behind such questions.

Topics covered range from The weight of the universe (dark matter, dark energy, do we need to reinvent both Newtons and Einsteins theories), cold fusion, Death, sex (maybe the most fun way to reproduce but not the most efficient - so why?), varying constants (is the speed of light the same everywhere- or everywhen?), free will,The Placebo effect and Homeopathy. The author lays out the basics of the anomaly then goes on to explain any history and both sides of the scientific controversy. In several instances it does tend to show the scientific establishment up as being less than welcoming of new ideas that upset the accepted 'rules'."

I survived!In fact, it was very enjoyable to read and the anomalies presented in 13 Things That Don't Make Sense are quite fascinating. Brooks does an admirable job of making science interesting, understandable and even entertaining. Even more, his enthusiasm for scientific discovery helped me to understand why digging into these anomalies is important.What were the 13 anomalies?

The science is a little heavier than some of the other books in the ""science for the masses"" vein, but it's still very approachable. Michael Brooks is a great writer who does a really good job with this material. Some of the mysteries are things that you'd expect to find in a book like this (such as ""what is the true nature of dark matter?""), but others were totally unexpected (like, ""is there really such a thing as 'the placebo effect'?""). Some of the questions seem simple and straightforward at first glance, but you quickly come to realize that the devil's in the details, and when you really try to explain these things beyond, ""well, that's just the way it is"", you can come to some surprising conclusions."

I really liked the message that we may know a lot about science, but there is much more to learn. Our future generation is not in danger of being out of work any time soon.I like the chapters at the end better than the beginning only because I'm more interested in the science of people and of our every day world than I am of the greater universe.

I think it was at its best when it didn't try to draw tenuous connections to popular culture and just told us what we needed to know. Some of the segments, particularly the one on Free Will, also seemed to have too narrow a focus when it came to the evidence; I kept thinking ""what about this?"" and ""what about that?"" but the broad areas I was bringing into it were never addressed.Still, my main reason to read things like this, other than for their own sake because I like to know things, is to be inspired in my creative work, and this definitely succeeded on that front."

I also had a lot of trouble wrapping my brain around many of the details in the book -- dark matter still baffles my imagination. Of course, even more baffling is that dark matter may not be what we've accepted it to be at all. And we might need to revise the theory of relativity? You see what I'm saying.

Sometimes he loses the reader (me anyway!) but generally it is fascinating and well articulated.Although the things themselves are often tenuously linked he moves from one to the other very smoothly. Basically the theme moves from a cosmological to an individual level tackling subjects from Dark matter in the universe to the efficacy or otherwise of homeopathy.

The author is very bright, but uses too many witty paragraph introductions and one-liners. Far too witty for his own good I'm afraid.

However, he maintains the attitude that a lack of answers is not a sign of fallibility and instead a glorious opportunity. Those things which science does not yet know are open windows to a further understanding of our own creation and place in the universe. They are not reasons to surrender or abandon science, but marking of a future trail yet discovered. The bibliography is well-researched and easy to thumb through for further reading. "

I think my problem is that the author equates genuine mysteries of the universe like Dark Energy or the creation of life with homeopathy... those things don't belong in the same book. The efficacy of homeopathy is well documented. It doesn't fare so well in clinical trials. But most of the 13 things mentioned are real scientific mysteries, and they are covered pretty well I think, considering how little space is devoted to each one.

Michael Brookes explores topics such as free will (something, according to scientists, we may not have), the WOW signal (a radio signal from outer space that lasted just 3 minutes) and the missing universe (only 4% of it, apparently, can be accounted for.If you like science and you like mysteries, then this book combines both.

209,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6387965-sally,0,"First thing I want to say is that, its not so much that I finished this book, rather than that I'm finished with it.I pretty much gave up on this book after having read the first paragraph.Once I finished the first paragraph, I skimmed it, and by the end of the first chapter I had read anywhere between 0-20 words on each page. I'm pretty surprised myself that I couldn't get into it so soon because I've been wanting to read this book for a long while now. It was boring. I was hoping that it would have been written in a more entertaining way."
210,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,3,"Stick to physics. Homeopathy? Brooks at least ordered the mysteries from dark matter (if as yet, unexplainable) to, well, homeopathy. The continuum of possible to highly improbable is covered. Not a waste, for Brooks explains his rationale well, but he will certainly fuel and maybe even satisfy the fringe fans (think R. A. Wilson).I had a subscription to New Scientist (Brooks is the tie-in)several years ago but the issues were to frequent and I couldn't keep up. I wonder if they play with fringes now."
211,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3970655-kelly,4,"I really liked this! It made me want to be a scientist again, which is saying a lot. This book is definitely not for everyone. It's fairly dry and very sciency (obviously), but if you're a geek like me and like pondering the mysteries of the universe, then it's great. It got me thinking in a different way than I have been lately - a very good thing. I listened to the audiobook, and wouldn't have made it through if not for 1.5x speed. Otherwise it would have been way to slow and put me to sleep. Any faster, though, and I probably would've gotten lost. "
212,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11313811-michael-connery,3,"Not very hard science but tells interesting personal narratives about some peculiar, troubling, and interesting problems facing the scientific community. While they are loosely tied together, the 13 things each have their own story and it's implied that its solution will require a paradigm shift to accommodate one way or the other. I wouldn't take everything at face value and I'm sure progress has been made since the publication of this book, but it's an interesting take on science and the nature of scientific revolution and accessible to non-scientists."
213,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24043942-gordon-gatiss,3,"This is a good read. The book is well written and full of science facts about “stuff” that doesn’t make sense. It is a book to inform and allow your mind to theorize and reflect. The topics are all explained in a simple and understandable way and includes death, sex, life, dark matter, free will, alien hand syndrome, and the placebo effect. Brooks has done his research well, producing a thought provoking and interesting read which will provide challenging topics of conversation in your social circles."
214,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5720805-tom-schulte,4,"I really liked this overview of mysteries in physics and medicine. Particularly interesting was an overview of The Pioneer anomaly along with research on the placebo effect, counterexamples to the certainty of death (such as Blanding's_turtle), and homoeopathy. I particularly appreciated the author's exploration of placebos and homoeopaths with arguments for and against, such as the weak foundation of a meta-analysis of placebo studies.,"
215,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51505682-jeff,4,"There are some amazing possibilities just beyond the horizon of our current scientific knowledge. Some of these mysteries are widely publicized as mysteries: Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Cold Fusion, the mystery of Life. But many are scientific black sheep, tucked away in a corner. Like what is the evolutionary purpose of death and sexual reproduction. Also, free will appears to be a construct that your brain produces as a side effect of it's activities. This was a very well written review of these mysteries. I wonder how science will look back on these mysteries in the future."
216,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1579589-mark,3,It started out at a fascinating book talking about a lot of mysteries in physics and gave the historical background to them. Then each topic got less and less interesting. Maybe it is because I have a physics degree and appreciate those topics more. It even spoke of cold fusion which I was a part of back in school. I’m glad I read the book and I’m probably being a little harsh only giving it 3 stars but there are so many better books out there.
217,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1504787-aaron,5,"Fantastic overall. He strangely doesn't talk about how quantum mechanics and relativity theories aren't unified at this point - the biggest and most embarrassing problem in physics. A few things that don't make sense I didn't find compelling, like the WOW signal that might be aliens. But overall the book is very much worth reading and explains some major scientific anomalies in a very understanding way. "
218,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1854657-hermann-gucinski,4,"This book discusses what might be the frontiers of science, except that some of the problems have been around a long time. The range from current dilemmas in astrophysics--the missing matter and dark energy to the cold fusion controversy and go on to explore if have already been contacted by aliens, the problem of understanding death and sex in basic biology and end with the placebo effect. Really well written and addressed to the layman the book is a fun read while making you think."
219,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291846-david,3,"This book provides a ""layman's overview"" of some mysteries and anomalies in modern science - the phenomena that scientists still can't quite explain. These include such topics as ""missing mass"" in the universe (dark matter, dark energy), the effects of homeopathic medicines, the still uncertain evidence relating to cold fusion experiments, the meaning of death and of free will, etc. Some of these were more interesting and persuasive than others, but I enjoyed the analysis."
220,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4529-jennah,5,"Very well written and entertaining. The 13 anomalies that the author chronicles are interesting and thought provoking. Each subject is moved through with obviously detailed research of the points for and against and insights into the importance of each. The chapters flow well from one subject to another, highlighting how they are connected to one another. The writing is scientifically detailed but also explained very well for the layman who may not have any prior knowledge of the content. "
221,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1670422-kirque,3,"I'm not sure that the author has countered the orthodoxy of the current explanation of many of the the 13 supposed anomalies with good science or good logic despite his PhD. But as that melancholy Dane said so long ago ""There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy"". Regardless, I always like a well written and well thought out essay that challenges what we think we know.  "
222,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/760700-ray,3,"The title of the book says it all. The author reviewed and discussed a number of areas where science still hasn't progressed far enough to answer all the questions which remain open. Among the areas he discusses are cosmological conundrums, cold fusion possibilities, medical questions involving placebos and homeopathy, and several biological areas. It just goes to prove that the more we learn, the more unknowns we discover. "
223,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2698289-pyrogenesis,3,"Although I have a few issues with the writing and general attitude of this book, most of the material it covers is interesting. I'll freely admit that it would have gotten another star if it had been harsher on homeopathy- such quackery warrants not so much as a second glance, and I was only able to tolerate that chapter with a steady flow of childish name-calling.More like NOmeopathy, am I right? More like homeAPATHY, am I right?"
224,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4633550-arthur-ryan,5,"A fun, well written review of 13 current unansweared questions in modern science that spans from comology to biology. Assumes no previous knowledge of the topics in order to appreciate these quandries, and makes a pretty cogent argument that these unsolved questions are not dead ends but rather doors to the next advance in their respective areas. Includes just enough history of science to give you a background and to entertain you with the petty intrigues of ""rational"" scientists."
225,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5717592-martin,0,"A fun and lively discussion of select items of scientific interest that have - as yet - escaped proper explanation. As with many books of this ilk, the reader can clearly see how the writer stared up at the cosmos as a child and wondered. I am numbered amongst that kind. What's interesting is that science wil eventually fill these gaps, and this book will be ""12 things"" then ""9 things"" until finally it will be obsolete. Enjoy the book before that happens."
226,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5958547-andy-turner,3,"Well written, thought provoking and educational. This asks more than it answers - like science generally. The first chapter is captivating and this probably will lead some readers to consider in depth unusual subjects that they might otherwise not. The choice of topics is well justified and together they broadly challenge how well we know things and how much (or little) we know. Perhaps one to look back on in 50 years to see how we're getting on."
227,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6006061-stephen-wong,0,"I've been away from the state of the science for a while, and this book is an excellent catch up for anyone. Succinct, distilled, well-organised chapters proceed to reveal scale as well as the not-so topsy-turvy anomalies of the universe of dark matter all the way down to your homeopathic cures. Many things to discover in this book, and it is going to be fruitful for anyone to bootstrap where they left off the challenges of scientific discovery and explanation."
228,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4486043-felicia,4,"Rating: 4.25 out of 5This book is one of those which compels one to think and encourages one to learn more, to educate oneself. Being a nerd/geek that I am, the whole concept of these amazing yet baffling mysteries science faces today, attracted me and I wanted to read this as fast as possible. I practically lived with this book while I was reading it.To read more please do visit:http://untitledbyfelicia.blogspot.in"

230,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"Intriguing that I read this book at the same time I was reconsidering re-reading Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolution. The premise is different areas of science where we don't have robust enough theories to support possible contradictory evidentiary findings to current theories.Where do these items take science? Unclear, but lots of yummy food for thought. To quote Hamlet, ""There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy."" "
231,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5286451-walter-hopgood,4,"This book is something anyone who has an inkling of an interest in science should read. It grabs your attention from the beginning, and doesn't let go until the last bit. Even the epilogue keeps your attention! And it's little things tossed in like the phrase ""sperm is cheap and plentiful"" or referring to young bucks as ""little fuckers"" that keeps you laughing - totally unexpected from a scientific book."
232,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10656597-jason,4,"Just listened through the audiobook.Chapters of various scientific study that flirt with fringe, but probably only because they are underfunded, politically hot, or generally unstudied. Makes my Skeptic sense tingle pretty much constantly. But it also seems legit and well researched. It was great. Like listening to a 4 hour episode of Radio Lab, without all the sound effects and goofy banter.The chapters on Life, Death and Free Will were standouts."
233,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13852634-alan-bevan,4,"This is a fascinating book. I'm not sure that all the topics are about things that don't make sense - like the strong evidence that there is life on Mars - but each topic is fascinating. It is hard not to be fascinated by the fact that we don't actually know what life is, questions like why we die and why evolution has supported sexual reproduction or the evidence that we don't really have free will.A thought provoking book - highly recommended."
234,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8491673-lynnette,4,"I would suggest that you feel you have at least a basic understanding of science before reading this book. It's not so technically written that the layperson cannot understand it, but the more exposure you've had to physics, chemistry, and biology,the more sense it's going to make to you. The ""13 Things"" pondered here include cold fusion, life, death, sex, free will, the placebo effect, and homeopathy, among others."
235,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/131205-trevor-parker,4,"While not all of his arguments were sound, and he didn't look at all the possibilities (probably for time and length reasons) these 13 things that don't make sense were pretty cool. It was a well written and engaging book. It got me asking a lot of questions about life and science. And I think the biggest thing it did is instill a sense of wonder and excitement in me. The world around us is far less understood that scientists and schooling makes us believe."
236,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3417428-matthew,3,"I thought this was a good and entertaining book. However, I felt that the material could have worked better as a series of long articles instead of being collected in a book. Additionally, I do think it suffered a bit since it's publication (now 6 years ago). I know there had been scientific finds and breakthroughs which have made some parts of the book outdated. Nevertheless, I learned some things and thought it was a worthwhile read. "
237,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34386498-colin-deisenroth,5,"I didn't realize this book would have such a deep level of science facts in it. The 13 things are all cool and interesting to learn about, but be prepared to have your brain melted by scientific analysis about pretty complex scientific topics. Unless you're a physicist a good amount of this stuff may go in one ear and out the other. But enough sinks in that you can appreciate how complex the 13 things are and how much we've put into trying to figure them out."
238,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4167936-jahan,4,"Nerd alert. Lots of thought provoking concepts to ponder, and of course, it is very humbling to see how little we actually know. We don't know what life is, what death is, why it is necessary, why the placebo effect works and many other things. I am set for my next 10 or 15 dinner parties. This was a good book, that I would recommend to techies, science lovers, and polymaths. Reminiscent of Secrets of the Lost Races, a book I read back in high school."
239,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22189980-belhor,3,"Interesting stuff! Although sometimes it seems the writer is presenting findings and research which is either not peer reviewed or are rejected by the researchers themselves. So it kinda damages that ""mystery"" thing the writer is looking for. For example the chapter on Homoeopathy was filled with this kind of evidence presented in support of Homoeopathy and then all of them were later on rejected or found inconclusive. Homoeopathy is still not very mysterious. It's just pseudo-science! "
240,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44748161-manoj-chacko,4,Not all 13 things were a surprise but its nevertheless a good read. It sure does expose the underbelly of the scientific community when you realise that there are things shoved under the carpet and not everything so much in black and white and how you need to be networked and influential to be taken seriously even though you may have a killing radical discovery. The risk of being an outcast seems so real even in this community! 
241,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1491232-cody-bittle,3,"Overall a good book that explores things in science that a) don't make sense with our current theories or b) make sense, but are still under scrutiny from the science community. The one complaint I have is the author only explores a couple of topics (physics and biology) amongst the 13 chapters. A good read overall."
242,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/622884-rebecca,2,I tried listening to this. It was not what I expected - it was much drier. I found myself making nerd jokes while the narrator was talking about science in a frustratingly not-quite-witty way. The good thing about the talking book is they've split it up so each section is one chapter. I think I'd rather get this in print so I can skim and skip around the topics.
243,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/668250-jessica,4,"I really liked this book because it summed up my experience with science so well. Scientists are incredibly resistant to change, to the extent that they will go to great lengths to ignore, cover up, and deny evidence that might mean that they're wrong about something or that their theories need tweaking."
244,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/806278-sally,0,"The library doesn't have this. It sounds interesting, if only to hear how a ""New Scientist"" journalist treats science's mysteries. I was surprised that some reviewers mocked the inclusion of homeopathy as a subject. Multiple universes are more interesting than the ""energy"" of a substance, in unmeasurably small quantities, that can heal without side effects!? That's amazing, in my book. "
245,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1545393-adam,3,"Hot and cold. Some of the chapters blew my brain. Others were stretches on the theme. I think i would have given this 5 stars if it was ""6 things that don't make sense,"" however they would have had a hard time marketing a much shorter book. The Pioneer Anomaly chapter has to be my absolute favorite."
246,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1598384-jim,0,Like 13 Discover Magazine articles or Radiolab excerpts. (makes sense these are from the New Scientist) The 13 thing are listed here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_Thin...Page 78. A nice analogy. Looking at a car does not tells us anything of traffic jams. More is Different. I am reading this as a book but feel this would be excellent as an audiobook. 
247,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2093319-gerry,2," Sometimes I like science books that arrange material in a curious manner, like different ways the Earth could end. Brooks mysteries are hit or miss. While some subjects I found to be of great interest like how come we can account for only 4 percent of the universe, and what is and how does the placebo effect work, while other mysteries aren't -cold fusion, homeopathy -hence two stars. "
248,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2496732-mark,3,"Building on Thomas S. Kuhn's classic, ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,"" Brooks covers 13 current anomolies in science, demonstrating that no matter how much we think we know, there is always much we don't. So much so, that we are undoubtedly due for as many scientific revolutions in the future as we have had in the past. Very interesting reading."
249,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3958395-harry,4,A great book to wonder by. Michael Brooks does a great job in presenting the great scientific mysteries of our time. You will be surprised and be made to feel a bit uncomfortable with your understanding of reality. My favorite of the 13 things was the intelligent signal from space and section on free will.
250,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1266630-richard-williams,2,"borrowed to read a single chapter-on the mimivirus.shallow, not badly written, popular science.perhaps a bit more speculative than it should be.ok for light breezy reading through fields new to you-introduction.same genre as series of best science writing of 20xx.that i am reading through now.that series is much better.best skip it."
251,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3767458-matthew,4,"This book contains quite a lot of detail for being a series of short surveys. Brooks writing is not overly lively, but the subjects are engaging and he keeps the pace and the interest of the reader. It is great how he manages to tie the segments together, flowing natural from one conundrum to another."
252,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1299547-terry,4,"I found this book very interesting once I got into it. For all of the certainty that science seems to take on a variety of issues, there are some mysteries that defy the so called laws. The topics covered range from astro physics observations that threaten Newton and Einstein theories to life, death, sex and even homeopathy! It was a worthwhile read."
253,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3416571-tim-plona,3,"An interesting topic, may be a bit deep for some. However, as much as this claims to be a science book, it amazes me how much of it is filled with theories, ideas, thoughts, wrong assessments, missed truths and wrong conclusions. I basically learned that very little science is absolute (at least as presented in this book). An interesting insight into the field of theory."
254,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4283618-kitt,4,"Another thought provoking sciencey book (after all, let's face it, science is just so darned sexy). 13 things looks at common events or phenomena that shouldn't work but do. It's written in a very accessible, chatty way. It covers a number of issues from physics, biology, the universe and beyound and is filled with asides and anecdotes. I very much enjoyed it. "
255,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8514061-glenn-capuano,4,"A really good summary of some of the great mysteries left in science. I really enjoyed reading this. Particularly the sections on sex and death, biological mysteries. Not quite worth 5 stars due to the inclusion of the pseudoscience homeopathy in the last chapter - there is no mystery, it doesn't work!"
256,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8421710-dan-smith,3,This was very informative. It dispels many of the scientific urban legends (such as cold fusion) and helps the reader gain a better grasp of advanced scientific topics that are still not understood. Though it was not a riveting book I would recommend it to anyone who is curious about some of the most famous scientific mysteries. 
257,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1684075-michael-emberley,5,"Thought provoking for anyone who has questions about science and how the world works. Not anti-science, but a thoughtful exploration of how we come to so-called laws of science, and how much more we have to learn. Great stuff. This book of unanswered questions, makes science more interesting than any list of comfortable answers. Well written, acessible read. "
258,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343650-mike,5,"Very interesting look into a range of things from what fills the universe, to sex, to medicine in a range of things that science not only can't explain, but which simply contradict some of our most basic and fundamental scientific rules about how the world works. Very enjoyable, well written and well researched."
259,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3890127-borax,4,"The hardest barrier in this book is the pedantic language and scientific jargon...but at the core of it is a powerful message on understanding ourselves...and how fear, arrogance, politics, and erroneous beliefs about things keep us in the dark. I find that the same emotion to understand something is what drives both the scientist and the novelist. "
260,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15807524-ky-nguyen,5,"As a skeptic who reads up a lot of weird things people believe and why, I found that a lot of the stuff in this book are things I've heard and read already. It's still an amazing book to read if you don't know much about free will, homeopathy, placebo, and etc. I would give it a 5 because if someone has never heard about these mysterious items, it'll be a treat to them to read."
261,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"Michael Brooks does the best job of putting all the known facts together is the best possible way. He never fails to give a thorough description while being extremely entertaining. He tackels subjects, like the emergence of life or the evolutionary purpose of death, just as many authors do, but he does not require that you be particularly good at science. He is simply fabulous. "
262,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18992190-devin,3,"The book started out as I expected it to, going over some really thought provoking stuff.But I felt that at times it would wonder a little bit. And it started to lose my attention toward the end, as the subject matter started to lean more on the medical side. Not a bad book, just not as captivating or interesting as what I have been reading lately"
263,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2458971-liz,5,"This book has some very interesting information. I also love the premise. It is not the ""Aha!"" moments that lead to the big breaks in science, it is the ""Well that's odd..."" ones. This book walks you though 13 of today's scientific oddities: cold fusion, free will, life, death, sex and more! Definitely a book worth reading! "
264,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13579830-gary,3,"If you like science you will enjoy this book. Well written and put forward many intriguing ideas and theories. The author Brooks is a scientist himself, who has turned to journalism. He does an excellent job of describing very complicated topics and making them understandable. He covers topics from Physics to Biology with lots and his topics make the busy a quick and easy read."
265,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1723377-david-meyer,0,"Sometimes the most interesting books give you more questions than answers. This book goes through some of the more baffling questions scientists and others are struggling with today.

266,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29665119-virginia,3,"This is a very interesting book, but Brooks' writing is a little muddy, especially in the theoretical physics chapters. These are (obviously) very complex topics and I get the feeling that he has about as much of a grasp on the material as I do. The biology chapters were easier to focus on, but still not the best writing. The topics were interesting enough though to still enjoy the book. "
267,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845711-taylor,2,I just skimmed this one. I didn't find his takes on the topics very interesting. Had a confusing feel when confronting controversy of either being really dogmatic or ambivalent. It seems to depend on which would stir up more feeling. The chapter on Cold Fusion was mildly entertaining. 
268,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1060853-jef,5,"Dark matter, dark energy, the Pioneer anomaly, the third Viking experiment, sex, death, life, cold fusion, constants of nature that aren't, homeopathy and the placebo effect. I think I'm missing one. This was an exciting book in that it poises us on the verge of new scientific discoveries. "
269,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1182284-wendy,4,Knowing that the smartest people on the planet are unsure of so many of the big things is liberating. I no longer need to be concerned that the only thing I know for sure is that I am hungry.I am going to read it again soon. 
270,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/934422-a,3,"An acceptable popular science book. Better than some, worse than others. But a real easy, quick read. Dodges making any claims or decisions in favor of just presenting the evidence on both sides. Though you can tell it really knows what it wants you to think in most of the examples."
271,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1244336-nigel-payne,4,"fascinating and superbly well written, with Witt and insight. Opens up your eyes to the gaping holes in our precious science and the tremendous possibilities opened up by that. diverse topics are tied neatly together.Favourite quote ""Cold fusion is now as popular as pornography in church"""
272,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1232374-sally,4,This book tackles some of the most interesting scientific debates going on right now. This book really makes you think. How do you define life? death? How about understanding the debacle around cold fusion or life on Mars. This is very readable and I enjoyed it immensely.
273,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,3,"Quite interesting if you have any interest in science.However, don't bother to read chapters 11-13 which are nonsense, and not scientifically puzzling. At least not to real scientists.The epilogue is OK."
274,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/300895-leif-erik,4,This is an excellent review of 13 thorny issues in various scientific disciplines. Also a subtle introduction into the philosophy of science. If you think that it is a subject where 'facts' are a matter of black and white certainty then you definitely need to read this. 
275,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/312898-ben,4,"I'm sure a few scientists would be annoyed that some of these chapters were included, but I think Brooks was very honest in describing the data objectively, neither credulous nor incredulous, just describing the dilemmas."
276,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4131565-brian-cleary,3,At times I felt like I would have enjoyed the book more if I had paid more attention in science class but over all it was very interesting.Its a good combination of light reading and heavy thoughts.
277,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3325519-shari,2,"I will be honest, it is possible this book was just too ""deep"" for me. I was only interested in certain portions of it. The placebo part was probably the most interesting to me. I wouldn't recommend taking to the time to get through this book unless you are VERY interested in the subject. "
278,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899477-bryan-higgs,5,"I found this book extremely interesting, and very well written. The topics range from Cosmology (dark matter and dark energy) to the Placebo Effect and Homeopathy. All subjects that raise some interesting questions.Highly recommended!"
279,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76842-rae,3,"The author looks at some scientific subjects that just don't seem to make sense--including a missing portion of the universe, cold fusion, life on Mars and extraterrestrial contacts, sex as a poor form of reproduction, free will, the placebo effect and the ""science"" of homeopathy. Good stuff!"
280,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3161147-jon-allen,4,"I found this to be an interesting book that brought up several interesting anomalies, most of which I'd never heard of or at least found new aspects that I was previously unaware of.I would recommend this as a bit of light reading to anyone that was interested in science and discovery."
281,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058210-kelton-baker,5,"Wonderfully written, enjoyable read, very true to the known facts of science and the mysteries of science, explaining that the unknowns are every bit as important as the knowns in our quest for understanding."
282,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5318344-matthewmartinmurray-murray,4,Very fun read. It easily described currently unsolved problems in science and all implications that go along with them. It is fun to see all the directions people are exploring in several different realms. Quick read not to difficult. 
283,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7781330-patrick-bender,4,"The chapters on homeopathy and the 'inconstant constants' were both fascinating. Overall it was interesting and well written, but the frequent criticism of science (scientists, really) of being clique-ish and unwilling to accept new ideas - while maybe true - detracted from the topics a bit."
284,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4071436-sheldon,3,"Okay book, some interesting perspectives on unanswered questions about our world. As one reviewer before said, the epilogue / ending was probably better to read first then the individual chapters. Overall, decent read and interesting discussion."
285,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1452804-karen,4,"Interesting topics, and a good overview of each in my opinion. I was listening to the audio version, though, and my attention would often wander. Probably better as hard-copy, where the reader can go back and forth over the material to keep it all straight. "
286,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3428303-joshua-berman,2,The book was OK but had to tie in together the 13 things that don't make sense were interested but each of the chapters were disjointed and their was no overall narrative to assist with joining the 13 things together.
287,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10937373-shamela,4,Have now skimmed and dipped into this as much as I am going to. Very interesting. Approachable prose; a good argument about how scientific curiosity should function; cool scientific conundrums; a great intro./motivator for any budding scientists.
288,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1365284-barry,3,"Interesting survey of the 13 or 14 things that are still major puzzles in science today. Good explanations for most, although some of the things and explanations get pretty technical.Nice to know we don't know a lot."
289,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898563-jared,5,"  Great book, great info. I think it will humble those that think we know everything about science. It also shows what science should be, and where scientists fail. It is very pro-science and does not try to demean what we do know, just shows we don't know everything. "
290,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6063882-austin-unseld,0,This book is more of a scientific book than a fiction fun read. It briefly discusses 13 things that don't make sense in science. These range from cold fusion to life and death. Interesting but it got boring at times.
291,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19409736-philippe-r-beauchamp,4,"Good review of across the sciences of current mysteries and contradictions. Slightly alarmist on the inability to describe the phenomena, but at the same time an entertaining read in understanding these limitations."
292,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2002381-mandy,2,"I stopped reading this book a few months ago and only just finished it today. So my rating probably means little. I didn't stop reading because it was boring, I just got distracted and forgot about it. "
293,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15890992-greg-daly,5,"Mind=Blown!Great book, makes you think, and want to research and read more on these science mysteries. Contains some ""science speak"", but nothing too deep that you can't figure it out. Well written with credible sources. Really fascinating book!"
294,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13277003-cantfind,3,"It keeps an open mind about fringe science (and sadly, sometimes pseudo-science) - not critical enough of bad experiments and methods and does not elaborate when saying an experiment was flawed - But it's still a good read."
295,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5939987-leo,5,An excellent book that tells us which are 13 of the misters of the world that have scientist scratching their heads for an explanation. It reminds us of the methodic progress of science and how scientist own biases can also slow down the process of learning. A must read.
296,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2588430-david-r,3,"Brooks evokes some wonder as he surveys a group of questions raised largely in the area of cosmology and biology. It's uneven reading: some of the discussions are a bit pedestrian. Overall, though, some intriguing questions are raised and it's a perspective not often seen with some."
297,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10818131-kerry,3,"A good layman's summary of some of the things scientists are still trying to figure out. I was particularly interested in the chapter on Death, as Mark is now working with a professor on genetic engineering and Telomerase, which was mentioned in the chapter."
298,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12523616-ethan,2,"Kind of interesting topics, but to me it started in on the scientific version of Ayn Randian ramblings quite quickly. There's not enough evidence to even get close to a conclusion with any of the sections, but it seems they drag on forever. A fun concept, but super dry."
299,0385664230,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2494540-colin-bendell,5,A little cooky and off the deep end sometimes (including wearing tinfoil hats). At the same time Brooks is self aware enough to be self critical. I am intrigued especially by the notion that now all substances act equally as a placebo.
