0,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian,4,um...- i read this book- i didn't read this book- i read this book and didn't read this book- i read this book in one universe and didn't in another- this book didn't exist until i read it gribbin's great because he won't dumb down but genuinely wants you to understand this stuff. and b/c he believes in time travel. yay! 
1,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233920-rebecca,5,"this book is f******n awesome.i read it in highschool and then again in college - because while you're reading it it's like having a really good teacher who holds your attention and makes you understand unusual ideas but as soon as you finish and put it down you're like ""wait, how does that work again?"" so for me at least, i have to be reading it to maintain that state of enlightenment. maybe after a certain number of reads it will stick - because i am not naturally good at this sort of subject. this book explains generally the perplexing, mind-boggling, paradoxical principles of quantum physics while relating the history of discoveries leading up to and through it, including the discovery of the X-Ray.I think this book is meant for laypeople, you don't need to understand any equations, but even for an expert, I think having the history laid out like this, and told in such a personable voice, must be interesting and helpful.this book also led me to read other books about heisenberg and einstein.it definitely make you think. yeah, it definitely makes you think."

""Miaow,"" someone said.I looked behind me. A tabby was sitting, contentedly washing herself. ""Hey! Where did you come from?"" I asked.""You can see me?"" She beamed. ""Whew! That's a load off my mind. I thought I might be dead.""I found this rather strange. ""How can you talk to me if you are dead?""""Well, I meant dead in this universe."" She went on with her toilet.I was a bit uneasy. Needless to say, talking cats appearing out of nowhere and speaking in riddles was not usual in my daily routine. I started eyeing my Stephen King collection uneasily. ""Who are you?"" I asked.She winked. ""Guess.""I scanned my bookshelves. Suddenly illumination lit up on me. ""Bulgakov! The Master and Margarita!"" I exclaimed.The tabby's look was contemptuous. ""Oh come on! - Do I look like a demon?""""Okay..."" I tried again. ""The Cheshire Cat?""My companion looked pained. ""I am much better than that grinning idiot from a stupid children's book, I'll have you know.""""Okay, I'm stumped."" I threw up my hands. ""You tell me.""The tabby got up, swished her tail, arched her back and generally preened herself. ""I am the one and only Schrodinger's Cat."" She bowed her head, as though expecting applause.""Schrodinger? I don't think I have met him. Does he live hereabouts?"" I knew I had made a mistake the moment the question left my lips, because the cat's face darkened like thunder.""You mean you don't know Schrodinger?"" She hissed. ""You ignoramus! He practically defined quantum theory. Oh, where do such fools like you come from?"" ""Oh... Now I remember."" I said. (I did only vaguely - but I wanted to save myself from getting scratched, which I seemed to be in imminent danger of.) ""Wasn't he the famous quantum scientist?""""Yes! He practically defined quantum reality. He left me in a box with a poison vial, a radioactive isotope, and a Geiger counter. If the counter detected any radioactivity, the poison vial would break and I would die. If it didn't, the vial would stay as it is I would live."" She beamed.""Oh! How cruel!"" I felt that this Schrodinger guy must be a bounder of the first water, famous scientist or not. ""He must be reported to the SPCA!""""Oh, you are an idiot!"" The cat laughed. ""Don't you see it was an experiment to question the Copenhagen Interpretation?""I really resented being called an idiot, but did not want to aggravate this temperamental feline with the sharp claws. ""What's that?""""Well, it was all these scientists talking about wave/ particle duality - how subatomic particles behaved both like a wave and a particle, and changed into one or the other only upon observation. Schrodinger was dead against it. So he created me in the box - and I am both dead and alive until someone observes me... at what point, either the vial breaks or it doesn't, I either die or live."" She said all this in one breath.""That's stupid! You can't be dead and alive at the same time. In fact, you are very much alive now."" I was indignant.""Precisely."" The tabby washed her paw. ""I am either dead or alive. The same way with subatomic entities - they are either waves or particles. Or they are something else altogether which our puny imaginations can comprehend."" Her vocabulary was getting richer.""Well, you are alive now."" I reiterated.""Hmm... Yes."" My feline friend did not seem too sure of herself. ""I guess so.""""You guess so?"" I was flabbergasted. ""My dear kitty, can't you feel yourself, hale and hearty?""""I can."" She looked up at the ceiling. ""But John Gribbin says that in a parallel universe, I am dead..."""
3,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2131782-bryant,4,"Okay, so to best describe this book, I need to first describe Schrodingers cat. Keep in mind that this an illustration of what Schrodinger saw as the problem with the Copenhagen idea of Quantum superposition. Imagine a box with a cat inside. A vial of a deadly chemical which will instantly kill the cat is placed inside with the cat, sealed so the feline is safe. A hammer is set up with a rig to smash the vial but only if the following occurs. A small amount of radioactive material is inside a geiger counter. If an atom inside decays, it triggers the hammer and the cat dies. If not the cat lives. The probability of the atom breaking down is equal to the probability of it remaining intact. According to the Copenhagen model, this would mean that the cat is both alive and dead inside the box until the atom is observed. It was a thought experiment, produced to ask ""when does a Quantum model cease to be a mixture and become one thing or another?"" If you were able to follow me on that, check this book out. Otherwise, this kind of thing may not be for you. I loved the information but the writing was a bit rough. That is to be expected of a science book. "
4,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/973813-sean,3,"Gribbin seems to have a sound understanding of quantum mechanics, and his writing is rather well crafted, but sometimes I think he'd rather have been a historian than a physicist. The first half of the book is mostly intricate historical accounts of the key players of the story of quantum mechanics over the last century. Gribbin reveals the concepts very slowly, which might not be a bad thing, so this may seem a bit tedious at first. However, by the end, the concepts are clear and complete. At least up to the publication date anyway. Being somewhat new to these concepts, I'm not sure if I'm meshing too well with the opinions on parallel universes that Gribbin states at the end, and the illustrations are badly placed, only moderately insightful, and actually contradict the text in places. However, I enjoyed this immensely and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a low to no math introduction to quantum mechanics."
5,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16803629-hank,4,"4 stars for science nerds, 3 stars for everyone else. An in depth discussion of the birth of quantum physics, where it is now and what it means for the future. Not much math and fairly accessible but not as easy to read as Astrophysics for People in a Hurry. I enjoyed it for the survey of physics giants in the early 20th century from Einstein to Heisenburg. The last 1/3 of the book were a series of explanations of experiments used to prove some of the theorems which were fascinating. I think a great deal of the genius was expressed in merely coming up with ways to prove ideas.A pretty dense book if you aren't a nerd. I am so, lucky me."
6,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24751255-bhavana-kilambi,4,"Physics was one subject i was never good at during High school (not that i was great at any of the other subjects though but Physics was a nightmare). There were concepts which were totally ambiguous to me and went way above my head. This book not only clarified some of them but also instilled in me a deep interest in Physics. In this book, John Gribbin gives a fabulous peek into the magical realm of quantum physics. He begins with an explanation on the very basic unit of life - ""the atom"" and the various evolving attempts by scientists to give an accurate description of the structure of an atom (Including the various experiments leading to the discovery of protons, neutrons and electrons). He then explains the Planck's black body radiation and the famous two-slit experiment whose observations threw the entire scientific community into a state of utter ambiguity and disarray about the nature of electrons. Some more experiments later they discover the ""photon"" and the dual nature (particle and wave nature) of light and particles like electrons. This is followed by discoveries by Pauli (the Pauli exclusion principle), Heisenberg, Born and Schrondinger which strengthen the theory of quantum mechanics. A very interesting part of the book is on ""time travel"" which according to the author is possible (atleast theoretically) though it might have a lot of practical hurdles. He believes that parallel worlds do exist but not the way in which we imagine (in most of the sci-fiction books) where we can hop between the alternate universes but all the alternate universes according to quantum theory branch out based on the choices that the observer encounters. He also writes about the two different theories explaining the way things work in this universe - The ""Copenhagen interpretation"" where there are numerous possibilities of something happening but there is only one reality (in one world) and the rest are just virtual ghostly worlds which all collapse into one result when the observer actually observes the system. The ""many-worlds interpretation"" contradicts the Copenhagen interpretation in the sense it assumes all the possibilities to be equally real and exist in their own worlds with their own observers (us being one of them). All in all the entire quantum mechanics lies on the observer who observes the system. What happens when the observer is not looking is something that is not explained by the quantum theory (and can only be speculated). Finally, the search for Schrodinger's cat ends by the author using the many-worlds theory to testify the fact that the cat is in reality both dead and alive (in two separate, mutually exclusive worlds) but not either dead or alive. When the observer looks into the box, he forces one outcome , which is the cat is either dead or alive and the other possibility still exists in its own world with its own observer (which is as real as our universe). A very interesting theory but this is just the author's personal views i guess.  The author in the end also touches upon the theory of supersymmetry which is the latest field under study within the quantum community and deals with unifying matter (particles like electrons,protons, quarks etc) and force (the bosons like photons etc). The entire book has been an amazing ride through the mindbogglingly unbelievable world of the sub-atomic particles and i cant say it better than Neils Bohr - ""Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not fully understood it""."
7,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1012180-joe,3,"I'm reading this again after a few years so that when I give it to my girlfriend to read and EXPAND HER MIND I will be able to help guide her through it. So far, it has been a great intro to quantum mechanics. It's supposed to be for the layman, and it appears fairly basic, but I have some background, so it's hard for me to judge that.EDIT:Well, it wasn't as good as I remember it. Maybe it was the passage of time and the advancement of science, maybe it was my own further studies in the field, maybe it was own growth and change in preferences, or maybe I just things didn't notice the first time. Don't get me wrong; it's still good, and I don't regret having read through it, but Gribbin is certainly not the best writer out there on these subjects. I would recommend Brian Greene, but he always wants to throw a plug in for the wonders of string theory and how it will solve EVERY SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM EVER; IT WILL EVEN CURE CANCER AND OBESITY!!!! Even so, Greene's description of the basic science is unparalleled. If you want an introduction on these matters read the opening two-thirds of either of his books (The Elegant Universe or The Fabric of the Cosmos). As for Gribbin, he has trouble pacing and keeping his writing consistent. He'll meander aimlessly and point out important subjects he'll describe later. Worst, his level of detail and required scientific background is horribly inconsistent. From a relatively simple, easy to follow, and well-suited for the layman explanation of the structure of the atom to his absurdly obtuse description of the most important experiment to confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, he leaves the reader fighting to piece together his point. The book does show its age at parts but his amazement at PCs and LASERs does not change the fact that they are awesome and stem from the study of quantum mechanics. A larger flaw is his matter-of-fact presentation of certain controversial theories as ""yeah, that's the way it is; don't bother investigating further."" This book does have a lot of good information and does explain some aspects of quantum mechanics very well for someone with little experience, but he kind of unravels at the end."

As a 'non-science' person, I can't say I followed everything but enough to give me a solid understanding for what it is and why it's so mystifying. The 'Many Worlds' theory, however, remains deeply unconvincing. I'm grateful that Gribbin caveats this chapter by acknowledging that it is more opinion than the rest of the book, although he does then proceed to continue in the same 'this is undeniably true' tone for the rest of the chapter."
10,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56494017-shashwat-rohilla,5,"A very well explained journey of quantum science. John clearly tells us why there was even a need for these theories and how, after many weird observations, the concept of Schrodinger's Cat and other theories emerged. I am neither a mathematician nor a physicist. Still, the way he wrote, it's not much difficult for a guy like me to comprehend the book."
11,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6595232-pete,5,This must be the 10th time I have re-read this book. I met the author way back when I was a kid and have always been fascinated with solving the quantum mysteries and physics. This book and others from Gribbin were exceedingly well written in language that didn't require a PhD. It was spellbinding and quite enjoyable to re-read.
12,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2736147-riju-ganguly,5,"Amidst a plethora of books purportedly dealing with ""explaining Quantum Theory to the layman"" this book stands apart, as well as taller, by virtue of two qualities: -1. It's really really well written, even by the high standards of popular science set by the luminaries, and remains deliciously readable even after more than three decades since its publication.2. It's unapologetically forthcoming, and NEVER tries to dumb down things in an effort towards becoming more ""accommodating"" and ""plebian"", which are the more euphemistic expressions for undervaluing the readers.I literally rushed through the first two-third of the book, all along feeling a genuine regret fornthe fact that had I studied this book before embarking on my quest to become a Chemistry graduate, I could have appreciated the things a lot more, in the process picking up much more than a degree.It was, however, the final third that made me sit up, and read & re-read things, only to understand them. That part dealt with actual state of quantum theory, and needs considerable conceptual clarity, which is not so easy to muster at my stage.Nevertheless, if you want to get acquainted with the strange & beautiful world of quantum theory, this is indeed the best introduction that you can procure.Highly Recommended, and happy reading."

19,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/687278-audra,4,"I first read this book when I was a freshman in college (a business major at the time). Until then, I had never given much thought to the sciences, but this book was so fascinating for me that it eventually lead to me changing my major. I thought the book was as easy of a read as physics can be. The author did a good job of making it understandable for the layperson. The concepts in here are so mind-boggling that it's often difficult to even begin to imagine them, but that's what makes the book so amazing to me. That this kind of sci-fi fantasy stuff exists in real life is so exciting!My only real problem with the book was that I felt he didn't make proper use of his figures. I felt there could have been more (except for the Feynman diagrams... I get it already!!) and I felt he should have connected the text to them better. It seemed like the text and the figures were two separate entities, so one didn't particularly help the understanding of the other. I just finished the book for the second time, and I'm realizing now that it's much better as a group read. The first time I read it, our class used a discussion format to go over the material, and it made it much easier to absorb. While I still loved the book this time, I think if you have at least one other person to discuss these ideas with, you get much more out of the book."
20,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69159766-mekhala-pande,5,"Gribbin is lucid and witty in explaining to the largely layman audience the principles of the strange and beautiful world of quantum mechanics. Approaching the book from the perspective of philosophy, was fascinating as well. Schrodinger's cat is reminiscent of Jain philosophy and the working of quantum mechanics and buddhist thought have been compared and debated upon quite frequently.Needless to say, this book really makes you think in abstract ways."
21,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5812864-greg,4,"This was one of the best books I have read on Quantum Physics. It turns out to be a slow read, because it gives you examples, and then to fully understand the examples you find yourself working out the aspects of it. It is only about 250 pages, but it took me the better part of six months to get through. Awesome book!"

23,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8626044-waleed,4,"A really good book that provides a reasonably understandable introduction to quantum mechanics and its history.There is a focus on providing a detailed account of the development of the theory, including a “de-idealisation” of the major figures who won Nobel prizes - for example, it is quickly stated that although Planck jumped to the idea of quantisation he did not do this for any reason other than mathematical convenience so the discovery was more an accident than anything else. Even Schrodinger thought that his idea that electrons should take on distinct energy levels simply because these were the configurations that fit an integer number of wavelengths into the circumference of the orbit was a step towards validating classical physics once again - an idea we know now to be incorrect due to the inaccuracy of the Bohr model (solar system model) of the atom. In fact, many physicists were dead set on validating classical physics and restoring the old ways by finding some “trick” that explained the inexplicable.The book does a good job of demonstrating the confused way in which quantum mechanics and quantum theory (two separate things!) developed and had contributions made by the great physicists of the 20th century.More needs to be read to fully grasp the intricacies or the theory since although Gribbin tries his best, I would still say that the book is not 100% comprehensible to the layman. Maybe this is biased due to my lack of background, but I felt that the end of the book was rather rushed in the way it introduced a maelstrom of new concepts such as super symmetry and the inflationary universe. It maybe reflects the state of physics at the time and the lack of understanding of the scientists themselves of these theories.Nevertheless, this book is a brilliant starting point and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the subject."
24,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33334584-peter-pinkney,5,"WOW!!!!I said that I would read difficult books this year, but I meant things like Infinite Jest, or Finnegan’s Wake. This is way more difficult, but way more important and totally fascinating.When I say difficult, I don’t mean difficult to read, I mean getting my head around the ideas, and the maths (which I don’t really understand), but who cares?? I just took it on face value that the maths is correct, and I went with the flow.I’m more of a poetry reading, literature reading head in the clouds kind of guy who doesn’t really do science, but I wanted to try. I had my mind blown more by this than anything since my heady hallucinogenic youth.A typical statement from this book “nothing is real unless we look at it, and ceases to be real as soon as we stop looking” That is jaw droppingly awe making. There are other mind melting ideas such as ghosts, things that can travel back and forwards in time, alternative realities, alternative universes, and the idea that the universe is only there because it is being observed. I am somewhat of an atheist, but some of the speculations in here make me wonder.Sometimes the blurbs of the covers of books say stranger than fiction. This book is certainly that, and I’ll never look at a cat again without a feeling of awe. Maybe cats have the answers.... "
25,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66086616-fanie-oosthuysen,5,While this book may be slightly dated (luckily physics do not move that fast) it is an amazing work with unparalleled explanatory powers laying bare one of the most difficult concepts of our time. I would give it all the stars. Whilst it started slow for me reiterating knowns I took months to get through the first quarter and only a day or two to finish it. If you are getting bombarded with new interpretations of quantum theory and misconceptions relating to that. This book allows you to travel back in time and strips the concepts back to their basics.

But sadly, the only parts I understood were about things I’m already familiar with. I hoped to finally understand what quantum physics really IS, but just as the author got close, he choked, and came out on the other side, blithely assuming he’d explained it. Of course, even Einstein couldn’t accept its principles, and the legendary Richard Feynman, probably the best physics teacher of all time, said that nobody understands it. So I’m in good company.

Honestly, this book is a great book if you’d like to spend time contemplating the aspects of life that not even scientists have quite figured out how to contemplate. If you do choose to read this book though, be prepared to not talk about it, because the normal part of the population doesn’t understand anything to do with quantum theory.

38,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315458-djpj-oneeightseven,3,"In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat: Updated Edition by John GribbinThe mechanics of a shot-put are easy to grasp. But when you try to look, in the same way, at the mechanics of atoms, the world turns magic. Observably, measurably, inconceivably magic. I’ll admit it, this book, or rather the topic it addresses, is mind-blowing. Gribbin starts with a history of the old physics that brought us to the uneasy precipice of the magic quantum world. This historical tour is comforting and well done. But when it comes to the juicy quantum stuff, while his descriptions were fascinating, I found them frequently lacking in detail and focussed too much on the broad interpretations and too little on the actual experiments and scientific detail. Whether I could understand this stuff is of course a matter of furious debate, but I would have liked to get the chance to give it a shot. It was all too dumbed down and as a result came across like a children’s storybook telling tales of a faraway place but never really taking us there. I suppose the reason I found the explanations lacking solid grounding was because I found Gribbin’s interpretations of quantum physics ludicrous. Gribbin subscribes to the “MWI”, or many worlds interpretation of quantum conundrums, which is the belief that a (supposedly) infinite number of universes just like ours exist and every single time you do anything important, like say pick your nose, you cause the universe you live in to split into two. One where you picked your nose and the other where you didn’t. Like this one, all of the interpretations mentioned by Gribbin were so fanatically anthropocentric that I wished I would split into a universe where he didn’t exist. To think of hundreds of billions of separate universes in which Gribbin pats himself on the back for missing the point is nauseating. Instead of grandly stating as Everett did that every idiotic little action made by human beings splits the universe in two, is it not a more tenable interpretation of Schrodinger’s cat and the Aspect experiment to lay the blame not in the universe but in our faculties of perception? Maybe what is out there is simply beyond what our puny brains can begin to comprehend, and so from the teaming mass of instantaneous potentialities swarming through space, our simple mind chooses one, at random, and delivers it to our senses for construction of a sane vision of the world? Meanwhile potentialities are born and fade away without splitting universes.Anyway enough of that – but this is a good point to digress into religion, philosophy and ontology. Considering the bulk of the science of quantum physics seems to have been done in the 20s I find it almost as surprising as the science itself, that even almost a hundred years later the learnings of quantum physics have not been integrated into mainstream layman’s philosophy. People still equate the philosophy of science to the philosophy of Newtonian shot-puts. Atheism is still seen as an empty, cold, predictable worldview. Quantum mechanics is predictable, yes, but only when you assume that the world is magic beyond our comprehension. Why has some kind of “mystical atheism” not become the mainstream religion? Why hasn’t the magic world that quantum physics exposes been integrated into mainstream interpretations of reality even, maybe, a little bit? I guess it’s because (a) people are outrageously stupid, and (b) religion really has hijacked the entire debate except for a few Sci-Fi writers, who inadvertently act in support of religion by taking the quantum debate into the world of fiction. Anyway I’m glad I read Gribbin’s excellent book and I hope many others do too!"

So, when I saw this eBook on sale, I bought it. And what a journey it has been. If I said I totally understood this book, I would be lying. Science can be tough and some of those concepts were just too much for me. But overall I understood what the author was saying, and what he said was extremely interesting. I thought it this book was really well written and I feel more knowledgeable now that I have read it. I recommend it highly! "
40,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"This is a good history of quantum physics, particularly part one, ""The Quantum."" Part two and part three go into more technical detail and, progressively, become harder to follow. There are a few special gems from this book. Gribbin asks the reader to imagine a pinhead, representing the nucleus, at the center of St. Paul's cathedral, surrounded by a cloud of dust motes, representing electrons, in the cathedral's dome about a 100 meters away. This conveys empty space within the atom. At the speed of light, ""time stands still....A photon, naturally, travels at the speed of light...and this means that for a photon time has no meaning."" Then he adds, ""to the photon...the Big Bang and our present are the same time."" And he writes that all particles and all waves, not just the photon and electron, are ""mixtures of wave and particle,"" and this realization constitutes a ""complete break with classical physics."" Gribbin cites Newton's discovery that in free space ""any object keeps moving in a straight line at constant speed until it is pushed by some outside force."" A question is, in warped space where everything has an influence on everything else, does free space exist and is free motion (straight line) really therefore the natural state of motion? Gribbin states that under quantum mechanics, precision in spacetime coordinates (location) conflicts with identification of momentum ""and therefore of causality. General relativity is a classical theory, in this sense, and cannot be regarded as the equal of quantum mechanics as a fundamental description of the universe."" Does this mean that if one has the intent to get in the car and drive to the store or if this country tends to send an unmanned vehicle to Mars, that we cannot expect that such will be done? Or, more abstractly, that ""A"" cannot be said to cause ""B""?A few key points in quantum theory remain unreachable. Gribbin writes that ""the vacuum is a seething mass of virtual particles in its own right, even when there are no 'real' particles present."" Elsewhere, he writes that 99.99999 percent ""of the universe is ...seething with activity, a malestrom of virtual particles."" There's an irony in the use of the word ""seething"" in both quotes. In reference to Dirac, he says that ""what we call 'empty space' is actually a sea of negative energy electrons!"" and this moves the reader into Gribbin's difficult description of antimatter. We also learn that ""'spin'...is nothing like the behavior of a child's spinning top, or the rotation of the earth on its axis as it orbits around the sun,"" but that leaves the question of what, then, is spin? On a positive note, Gribbin does a good job describing electron jumping according to fixed quantum rules.  "

42,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381993-katia-n,5,"It was the first popular book about quantum physics I've read and I think I was lucky to start with it. As after I've read two more books and they both are much less aspirational for different reasons. This book gives very good overview of the theory and the history of the subject presenting all key personalities and milestones of its development.Overall, probably not unexpectedly, it changes your perception of a huge variety of reality aspects. The most striking for me was thought about the history: ""In this delayed choice experiment something we do now has an irretrievable influence on what we can say about the past. History at least for one photon depends upon how we choose to make a measurement… Philosophers have long pondered the fact that history has no meaning - the past has no existence - except in the way it is recorded in the present."" I think it has become even more relevant in our media savvy days when wars are played and won more on screen than at the actual battles fields. It feels surreal to find the natural phenomenon facilitating such an interpretation of the social reality.Also it was interesting finally to find out what stands behind the overused metaphor of Schrodinger's cat:-)For me now it has become apparent that time travel, teleportation, antimatter and multiple realities are well established phenomena of physics, not of unhealthy imagination.My only gentle complain - I wish it would be a little bit more maths in there. I understand it might spook some audience, but I am sure it might be appreciated by the others. Heisenberg, the developer of the uncertainly principle, said: ""At first, I was deeply alarmed. I had the feeling that, through the surface of atomic phenomena, I was looking at a strangely beautiful interior, and felt almost giddy at the thought that i now had to probe this wealth of mathematical structures nature had so generally spread out before me."" I think this book has opened for me a tiny whole into the world he is talking about."
43,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12856123-sam,2,"I was a little bit disappointed by this book as it’s more a tour through history of all the developments in physics rather than a description of simply the theories which is what I was expecting. It’s a lot about the scientists and who won a Nobel Prize rather than simply this is the accepted theory of this or that. It began with the discussion of light being both waves and particles and the double slit experiment, which I was familiar with from other books I had read and documentaries I had watched and so didn’t really learn anything new. I enjoyed learning about Bohr’s atom and the inaccurate representations of it in most science textbooks and how LEDs work due to superconductors and diodes. Then it got really complicated and I found myself losing interest. I wonder who this book is aimed at as being someone who has only studied Physics to GCSE level and self-taught myself the rest of the things I know, I’ll be honest I found it too complex to fully understand in the way it was presented. It seems in order to understand what is discussed you need foundational knowledge of physics and without this everything just seemed a bit too overwhelming. Terminology was used often to describe other more complex concepts with the assumption that the reader understood it and without this the more complex concept was unattainable. The diagrams contained no keys to explain what all the notations meant and there was not really any explanation of the accompanying mathematical calculations to support the discussion. This made it difficult to understand when in actuality with the right explanation it is likely quite simple. "
44,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2648205-white,5,"This is perhaps one of the best science books I have read and I've read tons of them. The whole point of Schrodinger's cat is to put the misinterpretation of quantum physics to shame. Of course the paradox is impossible and that is the point. Still, it didn't stop the new age fanatics from their mystical thinking. They took the paradox literally and formed a cult from the impossible. I respect the author because he put perspective on the ridiculousness of quantum mechanics as experienced by our limited senses. Gribbin admits that there is another factor which we are unaware of; a factor that would take us away from the nonsense and tie the macro and micro worlds together into one connection. Still accepting the scientific experience of quantum physics, Gribbin keeps reality in sight by focusing on the inevitable; that we have not learned the entire story. Flipping in and out of realities according to consciousness and observation is a fairy tale. Schrodinger's Cat displays that truth with fervor.I love this book...immensely. "
45,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17435739-greg,5,"I have read several books on quantum physics and this one is by far the most accessible to the non-PhD audience. You still need some basic background in engineering or physical science, but Mr. Gribbin takes it from there in a very natural and logical progression from early atomic theory to QED. Critically, this book presents the best explanation of the famous ""double slit"" experiment - not only for the experimental set up and result, but also for the scientific and philosophical consequences.On the scientific side, it is persuasive and compelling. On the philosophical side it is troubling, if not terrifying as Niels Bohr insists it should be. Written in the 80's, it is amazing how well the presentations in this book have aged. Even advanced topics like Einstein's ghostly action at a distance are covered quite well. Other excellent explanations are provided for complicated topics such as gauge theory, strong and weak nuclear forces, Heisenberg uncertainty pairs, Feynman diagrams and much more. This book was very hard to put down despite the complex subject matter."

The author does include a little math - the sum of the squares is not the square of the sums - but nothing too complicated. Besides, the concepts in the book are mind-blowing enough.Gribbin takes the reader on a guided tour of the history of sub-atomic physics, with a brief biography of all the major players along the way. Then he describes the world that quantum theory helped to make, and make understandable: lasers, solid-state electronics, DNA, etc. Then he gets into the nitty gritty of the famous two-slot experiment, and quantum entanglement.This is a great book for discovering the world of quantum physics, find a copy and read it!"

58,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15981563-alteredego,4,"The title of this book probably highlights its greatest weakness. Updated Edition. This is a history/explanation of quantum physics written in the mid 1980s with the subsequent 30+ years tacked on at the end. There are more recent works which form a more coherent whole, for example Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw's Quantum Universe.The other thing to say is that John Gribbin sets out to do something virtually impossible. Given that the most famous quantum physicist if the mid 20th century, Richard Feynman said ""If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics"", to write a popular science book on the subject is optimistic to say the least.Any writer seeking to make the subject accessible to the lay reader must travel along the border between explanatory and comprehensibility. To put it another way, by providing a full explanation, s/he run the risk if tunnelling through the border into the region where the reader is lost and confused. For me Gribbin is a little over conservative, not providing enough explanation. For example, while describing one of the early signs of the need for quantum mechanics, the ""black body problem"" he describes what the problem was - that classical physics predicted an infinite amount of energy - but not why classical physics made this prediction. Linked to this , the early chapters are more about the people involved than the developing theory. That it is a very valid story to tell, but Gribbin almost sits in an indeterminate state between the people and the physics. If you want to read the story through the people, could I recommend Manjit Kumar's excellent Quantum: Einstein, Bohr .....While I have some criticisms of this book, overall it remains an excellent introduction to an incomprehensible subject. While referring to Schrodinger's cat makes for an arresting title, Gribbin seems to agree with another of Feynman's assertions that the double slit experiment is the absolute heart of quantum physics.Having, in previous readings on quantum physics, been troubled by the use of classical terms (e.g. spin"" ) to label features of the quantum realm, I was rather taken by Gribbin's suggestion that use of the language of Carroll's Jabberwocky would be equally valid.This book also gives one of the clearest explanations of the differences between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the many worlds version. In an incredibly simplistic nutshell, the former suggests that the universe sits on a sea of probability waves which collapse to certainty when observed, while the latter postulates that the universe splits every time a quantum ""decision"" is taken.The end of the book, which contains sections referring to developments since the mid-80s, is both tantalising and returns to the main weakness. I wanted to know more about quantum computing, or about why the apparent study of the massive, cosmology, can be viewed as the forefront of the study of the subatomic quantum domain.To finish, if you read this book, you should be able to follow this marvellous joke.Schrodinger and Heisenberg are stopped by a traffic cop.Police Officer: Do you know how fast you were travelling sir?Heisenberg: No, officerPO: 90 mph, sirH: Great, now we're lostPO: and did you know you have a dead cat in the bootSchrodinger: We do now."
59,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55755404-fleur,4,"Picking up this book gives me flashbacks to secondary school science lessons, staring at a poster describing the natural states of matter, in a harshly lit classroom called Rutherford Lab which smelled of vinegar. I wish I had Gribbin as a teacher in that room to explain that mystical, elusive subject known as “science.”Gribbin takes a historical approach, guiding us through quantum physics as it developed into a field. This approach is useful as it highlights not only the triumphs of scientific breakthrough, but also opposing schools of thought. For example, the discovery of atoms versus Aristotle’s four elements. He intends  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  to be a helpful guide for the layman, to make science clear and dispel myths to sort the science-fact from the science-fiction. I apologise for marking the pages with my  Doctor Who  bookmark.It’s amazing to think that such basic information we know now, like how light diffracts, had to be discovered by expert, hardworking scientists, some of whom faced ridicule for their outlandish-appearing theories.This book is readable and Gribbin explains science very well, using simple, everyday-world analogies and avoiding getting bogged down in jargon and abbreviations. I wouldn’t recommend reading it when tired or with a headache, because it does require a bit of focus for a layman like me, and it can’t be skimmed.However,  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was written 35 years ago. I imagine it is now a bit out of date. For one, our TVs do not rely on cathode-ray tubes to produce a picture, as Gribbin suggests. Similarly, sodium-yellow street lamps are going out of fashion in favour of LEDs. Neutron microscopes, which Gribbin sees as a potential development in the field, have already been a reality for several years. I also believe the Many Worlds Interpretation has also gained more traction now than when  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was published. Perhaps an updated version would not be amiss? More recent contributions to the field could also be covered, like Higgs-Boson.Read for: Hebban Challenge, Book #44 A Book from a Genre I Never Read "
60,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24562513-e-c-koch,4,"I think I'm secure enough now to say that the first time I read this (about ten years ago) I was as enthralled with people being impressed by seeing me read it as I was with the ideas I was reading about. I was, then, a physics student in college and thought it my business to catch up on the current theories of quantum mechanics but also didn't mind if people saw me doing it. I subsequently changed majors to English, and though it's no longer my business to keep up with QM for any reason it is my job to keep up with theory (of the literary variety now) and I know of no better compliment to Derridean language theory than QM which is why, ten years on and in the throes of my PhD exam reading, I'm back to Gribbin. The model of the semiotic sign (i.e., a word) that Derrida outlines begins with the arbitrary relationship between the signifier and the signified, but hinges on what he calls differance which refers to the sign's (i.e., word's) perpetual differing (from other signs (i.e., words)) and deferring (its final complete signification (i.e., definition)). The implications of this are myriad, and (in my reading at least) constitute, among other things, the foundation of a language theory that tells us that nothing means anything and that signs signify only because of accidental interactions with other signs. What Gribbin and QM offer me is a grandly articulated analogy of Derrida's theories in the ""real world."" Statistical probabilities and uncertainty and particle-wave duality all seem to work as well for QM as for LT, and when Gribbin gets to his universal models I can't help but think of the prevalence of nihilism and solipsism in the postmodern age. So maybe what's most useful about QM is that it is itself part of the history of philosophy and is as important to the humanities as it is to the sciences. At any rate, it helps to generate ever more questions about the fundamental nature of reality which is what any person in any field wants from a book."
61,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82068179-jessie-hammond,4,"As far as science non-fiction books go, this is by far one of my favourite that I have read so far. I wanted to know a bit more about quantum theory and also get a little into a more physics oriented mind. I was really surprised at how easy to follow it was - though bear in mind I am a second year physics student at university. Though, I think even if you had a more basic knowledge of physics, at least the beginning section wouldn’t be too hard to follow as it is mainly the background and history of how quantum mechanics began and developed in the early 20th Century.However, his use of language is weird to read at times and so it can be quite jarring when you come across a sentence that is phrased strangely. I would have to read some twice or three times to wrap my head around what he was trying to say. But that didn’t take away much from the actual facts and content of the book much as it didn’t happen too often. Gribbin was really great at explaining concepts in a simplistic manner and in a way that was quite logical. It was mainly in chronological order of when concepts were thought of or published in papers, and then in chapters it was where there were connections between concepts, if that makes sense. So, for example, the debate of waves vs particles was in one chapter and the discoveries made related to that subtopic were put into chronological order in the chapter. I feel like I just made that explanation way more complicated haha...At the beginning of the book, he is really impartial in his opinions of the theories and discoveries that he introduces as sometimes quantum theory can have a lot of opinions as nothing is very certain. However, he did write more of his opinions later when concepts became more of like ‘this could probably be true’. But he still gave the reader a description of all the options and concepts out there that people think might be true of quantum mechanics.I gave it a four out of five stars because it was a really good Popular science book, but it did have weird sentence structures at times and could have maybe gone a bit further at explaining some concepts."
62,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66441657-javeria-khan,4,"This has to be one of John Gribbin's best pure science (as opposed to science/biography) books, and has stood the test of time surprisingly well since being written in 1984. Although some of the implications and developments of quantum theory, notably quantum entanglement, have moved on a lot in more recent years, the basics of quantum theory, which this book covers, still apply, as does the historical context which Gribbin does well here.The cat in question is the one used by German physicist Erwin Schrödinger as an illustration of just how strange (and unlikely) the whole idea of quantum theory was. Because of the way quantum particles that can be in two states simultaneously until they are observed and randomly become one or the other, Schrödinger envisaged a cat in a box that would live or die dependent on a random quantum event. The suggestion was that, until the box was opened, the cat would be both dead and alive at the same time.It's probably the best known image from the quantum world, which is rather a pity, as it was intended to demonstrate the inadequacy of the theory, but in practice misrepresents it at anything more than a trivial level. Though there may be arguments about the workings and interpretation of quantum theory, it stubbornly refuses to be dismissed, matching observed effects with impressive consistency.Quantum theory isn't easy to explain in a way that is accessible to any reader, and Gribbin isn't the world's best populariser because he does have a tendency to descend into supposedly helpful examples that can be rather baffling, but this book remains one of the best attempts at getting across the whole astounding business. Liable to leave your head spinning, but that's not a bad thing."
63,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91577998-jannik-faierson,3,"""In search of Schrodinger's cat"" was a nice and entertaining refresher about the underlying principles of quantum mechanics. Gribbin presents numerous ideas and theories in chronological order and also focuses on the thinkers behind it. He begins to describe the scientific development from Newton to Bohr to explain how the idea of the atom evolved, only to reveal afterward that it is a nice and understandable model but likewise totally wrong and useless. From this starting point, he covers the major developments in 20th-century physics, starting by Planck and Einstein to Heisenberg and Dirac. Gribbin presents all these confusing and weird concepts in an easy and understandable manner and focuses on the fascinating problems that are of particular interest to the reader, such as the double-split-experiment with the Copenhagen Interpretation as a consequence or Schrödinger's cat. He uses these puzzles to speculate about reality coming to the conclusion that either nothing is real (Copenhagen Interpretation) or everything is real (Many-Worlds Interpretation).Altogether, it was an interesting refresher for me and a great book to learn about the principles and implications of quantum mechanics. However, it sometimes appeared to me that this book is already 35 years old. Many modern aspects that are already proven come as speculations and it was particularly funny to read how Gribbin dreams of a miniature computer that fits into your pocket only to realize that you hold one in your hand right now. The future is now and that is an exciting imagination that I got from this book."
64,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61994538-matthew-neitman,5,"A very thorough informative on physical anomalies in the subatomic level and it's relevance to overall physics, John Gribbin's ""In Search of Shrodinger's Cat"" will make your overall perspective of reality shift dramatically. You might not think that the concept of ""If I didn't see it, it didn't happen"" wouldn't be a bit more interesting than it sounds, and you'd be right if you hadn't read this book. The main idea that left me blown away is that particles don't always act the same, even when placed in the exact same situation. In the other words, the selling point I'd make for what i got from Gribbin's science bible is that reality is never set in stone, and that nothing is 100% predictable because particles don't follow rules.It only took a couple of pages of 320 to blow my mind, so if you aren't already left shocked from that idea alone, all you have to do is keep reading.The other thing I have brought home from such a reading was the idea that knowing more is realizing you know much less. Prior to it, I had merely thought that quantum physics is only about the concept I mentioned above, and only in the discipline of physics. However, it has applications in nearly all sciences you could think of. Biology, psychology, chemistry, you name it! And it relates to you, so I recommend this to you if you love science, and even more if you don't, because ""In Search of Schrodinger's Cat"" is truly a mind opener."
65,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107722441-robbe-sneyders,4,"The book starts out by recounting the history of scientific discoveries leading to the birth of quantum physics at the start of the 20th century, occasionally travelling through time to build a logical instead of purely chronological timeline. This puts into context the contributions of famous thinkers, which I was only superficially aware of, and provides insights in their collaboration in a time of treat theoretical leaps, but without the communication tools that would result from it.Once the history is clear, the theory of quantum physics is explained conceptually, while at the same time denouncing these conceptual explanations for the explanatory tools that they are, not afraid to end up with a description of quantum physics which is impossible to ground in the physical reality that we experience ourselves.The book doesn't stop with the physical interpretation, but also discusses the philosophical impact of the ideas underlying quantum physics. I thoroughly enjoyed the discussed thought experiments and at times felt like I could see the matrix.

Having read up earlier on the other pillar of modern physics, the relativity theory and the physics of the very big , it was time to move on to the quantum theory and the physics of the very small.Gribbin takes you on a journey starting with the discovery of the first atomic theories, the first subatomic particles, and ending with the modern day marvels of MWI and super symmetry, with a description of how each new discovery led to more questions and more discoveries. If one has an interest in physics which has been sustained after high school, one might pick this book up and go through it without distractions.Overall not the most straightforward, by which I mean that a level of prior training is required to begin to comprehend a few of the explanations . But then, as has been repeatedly mentioned by many others, quantum theory is like that, super incomprehensible at the beginning to even the people who developed it."
67,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16460578-randa-khlaif,5,"An amazing journey that starts at the beginning of the 20th century and takes the reader on a tour in the era around which the fundamentals for quantum mechanics came to be. Dr. John Gribbin, the author, presented the history and progression of theories from Newtonian classical physics to modern-day quantum mechanics in a simple and comprehensible language. Full of analogies from everyday life, he made the scientific material palatable to the lay reader, such as myself. The second half of the book gets even more interesting. Famous thought experiences, set up by the same great minds that put together the quantum theory, are explained in details. The author shares his own perspective on the implications of quantum theory on our physical world. He finally talks about physicits' eager and tireless quests to postulate a theory that explains all. He takes us on a final tour there and  leaves the book with loose ends.Personally, I will proceed to Stephen Hawking's ""The Theory of Everything"" for more insight. As it will be my next read."

69,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110260075-john,4,"A good introduction to quantum theory and the key players involved in its development. I read this book in college when it was first published in 1984. After this second reading in 2019, I still don't understand quantum physics.(If you don't get the following joke, this is the book to read!)Heisenberg and Schrödinger get pulled over for speeding. The cop asks Heisenberg ""Do you know how fast you were going?"" Heisenberg replies, ""No, but we know exactly where we are!""The officer looks at him confused and says ""you were going 108 miles per hour!"" Heisenberg throws his arms up and cries, ""Great! Now we're lost!""The officer looks over the car and asks Schrödinger if the two men have anything in the trunk. ""A cat,"" Schrödinger replies. The cop opens the trunk and yells ""Hey! This cat is dead."" Schrödinger angrily replies, ""Well he is now."""
70,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69124610-hisham,4,"The book is presented in a similar fashion to popular science books. The author starts by narrating the evolution of physics that emerged with the beginning of the 20th century and focuses mainly on the development of the quantum mechanics theory. I want to point out that the title is misleading since he rarely discusses the Schrödinger’s cat mystery. Nevertheless, the book is definitely worth reading. It opened my eyes to a number of interesting ideas in quantum mechanics that I wouldn’t have understood without going through the mathematical proof behind them. This simplifying approach did not succeed all the time. In some chapters I was confused and did not understand what he was discussing. Overall, I would recommend the book to physics enthusiasts as well as undergraduate students who are interested in reading popular science books. For those of you who enjoy reading rigorous proofs of physical theories, this is not for you! "
71,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7609801-kevin-o-brien,5,"Quantum Physics is very bizarre. As Richard Feynman said “[Quantum mechanics] describes nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And yet it fully agrees with experiment. So I hope you can accept nature as She is - absurd.” And Feynman maintained to the end of his life that no one really understands Quantum Physics. But this book is a pretty good place to get as much of an understanding as you can for a layperson. Gribbin takes us through the key discoveries the led to Quantum Physics, and introduces many of the key people who developed it. Einstein was one of the key people in the development, but could never bring himself to accept the implications of his own work. Neils Bohr led the group that made the Copenhagen interpretation, but even now we have mathematics that works to predict the outcome of experiments without actually any understanding."
72,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32246462-albert-myburgh,5,"Just a friendly warning: if you decide to read this book you will have induced a wave function collapse. However, by destroying the superposition of states you will have become an observer which in this case is a really good thing.It is by far the best science book I have read to date and not just because of the exciting and mind-altering subject matter. John Gribbin is a great writer and one of the few people who can explain an extremely complicated concept in layman terms without watering it down so much that its original significance and its true meaning becomes muddled in stupid analogy and plain absurdity. Except for understanding his subject matter very well he also seems to be a semiotician at heart and I have a sincere respect for that.Just like all my favourite fiction this science book will have a lasting effect in my life."
73,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38008473-odyssey,4,"A thorough book covering the history and workings of quantum mechanics. I had a misfortune to start it while going through my second year of physics in uni and as a result it took me way longer to finish it then it deserves. It just seemed like too much work trying to read it while covering similar ground albeit more in-depth at uni. The book surprisingly goes into quite a lot of depth for a popular science book and I would not recommend it as a first foray into the quantum world. However, of you already have some knowledge about quantum mechanics and would like to dive deeper, this is a very good choice. Furthermore, even though it was written in the 1980s it holds up very well apart from a few exceptions. Unfortunately, authors hope of unified theory is of course still nowhere near in sight 30 years after the publication."
74,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6204737-saurabh-shrivastava,1,"Good thing about this book for me was that it developed my interest in Quantum Physics and has left me at the stage where I am looking for more suggestions on the topic. But I would go with the low rating for this book because personally for me it didn't do the justice to what I was looking for. I feel that the book is not recommended for someone who has just started reading about the Quantum Physics. It is a little complex for newbies. Author spends lot of time in going through the history of physics than the actual theories (and their simple to understand explanation). The intent of author must have been to make it look like an interesting story with timelines, but somehow that story was not interesting as I felt it was deviation from the core content of the book. "
75,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27846107-missfede,3,This is a good introduction to the quantum world that I definitely recommend to anyone interested in learning the basic concepts and the history behind the theories. However it has some flaws. The subject is obviously not an easy one and sometimes new terms and elements are introduced in the discourse without any real explanation of what they are. I have to admit I found that a bit frustrating. Also the last couple of chapters were a bit too sci fi for my taste. I would have preferred an introduction to the string theory or a bit more info on the interpretations of the quantum reality. All in all it was okay but there are better and more complete introductions to this subject in my opinion.
76,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63369688-rekhit,5,"According to quantum mechanics, nothing is real, until you observe it. On the other hand, everything is possible till you observe it. Oh yes. Also, parallel universes exist. Not me, leading scientists say this.Ok, I will admit that reading this book won't mean you can brag that you are a quantum wiz, but it will give you a pretty good idea that the world of (really) small is super crazy. And chaotic. And well, not completely figured out. But I am sure you would be engrossed in it as the author has done a really good job in explaining something (which is more complicated than rocket science) in a simple language. My opinion, if you were ever curious about what lies beyond atoms (hint: quarks, mesons and a whole lot more), then you should definitely give this book a try. "
77,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3106232-nishant-deshpande,4,A really enjoyable and readable history of quantum physics starting with Newtons experiments with light to the current as of 1985 when the book was written.I read it as my every 5 year attempt to understand a little more on quantum physics. I ended up really enjoying the history and the characters and the discoveries especially during the 1900 - 1930 period when many of the major figures in quantum physics were making their discoveries.It put Feynmans lectures on my to-listen list.I have gotten to kind of understanding understanding what i think is still the 'central mystery' of quantum physics - the double slit experiments. The explanations of it and action at a distance theories and then the multiverse will have to wait for another day/year/decade.
78,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75682570-nilesh-barla,3,This book has deepen my understanding about Quantum Mechanics. Though a bit intimadating but it gives a lot of insight about QM. Its a show read obviously. But some how i completed the book. It complementary is Quantum by Manjit Kumar. Nevertheless great book with some boring allegory which I didn't like and in the later part of the book where I thought it would be interesting it turned to be boring. Struggled to complete the last part of the book but the 3/4 of the book was really intriguing especially the Copenhagen Interpretation. Altogether it is a real knowlegde book. I would rather own it forever for future reference. 
79,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5089109-john-gray,5,"I loved reading about the development of quantum physics and all those who contributed to the theory. They were all mavericks in their own way who had the courage to go against popular opinion. Gribbin has a knack for storytelling and making big concepts broadly palatable, although don't be surprised if you have to re-read certain sections and don't be annoyed if you still leave confused on certain points- most scientists in the field don't understand why the quantum world acts as it does. If you allow the big implications to wash over you, it'll give you chills and broaden your mind, even if some of the detail boggles you. I'll be looking for Gribbin's other books. "
80,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4475067-peter,5,"I read, enjoyed, and reviewed this book a while back. To be honest, I had forgotten that I had already read it. As I said before, if you are new to quantum physics, this is an excellent if outdated overview. Having read more by other authors in the meantime, I am now prepared to say that this may well be the best book on the subject I have ever read. Be warned: this volume was written in the early 80s, and a great deal has happened in the intervening years, including all the exciting work being done at the LHC at Cern near Geneva. Other good writers who cover that material include Brian Greene, Lisa Randall, and Lawrence Krauss."
81,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34993553-abhishek-agarwal,5,"The reason I found this book better than most on related topics, is that it remains relatively focused on heart of matters of quantum physics: The Copenhagen interpretation, observer effect and uncertainty principle. The book does *not* drift to string theory, information entropy, black holes or other such topics. It delves slightly into particle physics. Author remains considerably neutral in his philosophical leanings until the very end, when he makes the case for Everett's Many World interpretation. Exciting!"
82,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51894491-padmaja-kulkarni,5,"At least in this universe this is a must read book for quantum physics lovers. This book rather gives an introduction to quantum mechanics. One could read it like a novel. The author talks about right from inside the neuclus to the many world interpretation and twisted spacetime, again not in depth. If someone is looking to dive into mathematics then this book is not the one. Makes you certain that science is far beyond and much deeper than science fiction. Thanks to Rutherford and this book, once again I'm sure that ""I collect stamps"" :p."
83,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87368714-jack,5,"Takes the reader through the breakthroughs in the early 20th century leading to the formation of quantum theory. The puzzling experimental results that lead to quantum theory are presented consicely, sometimes with the use of helpful analogies. The author also likes to compliment the physics with anecdotes of the physicists themselves, which can include some occasional humour. It leads to a qualitative description of the Copenhagen interpretation and also explains the Everett interpretation. A very enjoyable read."
84,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60291482-sarah,5,"Accessible without condescension, Gribbin's book offered a fascinating insight into quantum mechanics and the importance of this in the world in which we live today. I'm sure that some scientists in this field would balk at the simplified analogies used, but these were invaluable in helping a complete layperson (me) put the ideas into a context which enabled a more concrete understanding, I am now hooked on the many-world's interpretation.

But as that same person who's been exposed to slightly more concise and well-worded (not to mention up-to-date) versions of this book in the intervening 30 years, this is more of an excellent skim than a real dive for information. Definitely a great second or third book to pick up on quantum physics, but maybe not a first, and not something spend a lot of time on if you've been keeping up. "

As the book progresses, quantum theories begin to make a little bit more sense than before without getting too metaphysical. students with a background in STEM may have an easier time grasping these concepts than non stem majors.

Gribbin does a great job of leading us through the history of dozens of discoveries across decades, building on concepts in a logical way. The ideas get extremely complex and are almost impossibly non-intuitive, but I think he gives as clear an explanation as I could hope for in a survey text of this topic. Highly recommended if you are new to quantum physics and are interested in thought-provoking science!"

Probably more suited to a reader with a background in math or science, though I did get a sense of of the overall concept of quantum physics - simply, that it is exploring physical reality at the sub-atomic level, and that reality at that level doesn't behave according to the rules of classical physics. I was happy to take away that. "

It rekindled my fascination with the micro world of subatomic particle and opened the door for the fascinating quantum mechanics. Book starts with introduction to the quantum world and does a fabulous job at enticing the reader's brain to know more. Author then takes the reader on the journey of origin of quantum physics from the time of Max Planck to all the way to the multiverse interpretation of Hugh Everette. The best part of the book is that it does not just throw lot of scientific facts at you but also talks about the history attached to each chain of events which eventually led to a better understanding of the mind bending world of Quantum Physics. The Author introduces different interpretation of the quantum mechanics and then at the end reveals his own stand. Quantum physics is not just a field of science but it could be extrapolated to the field of philosophy. It questions the causality which is the fabric on which most of our believes and civilization is based on. For me it was more of revelation."

147,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17609571-peter-ellwood,4,"A remarkable piece of work, which leads you, step by step, through the basic developments of quantum physics. Written in the 1980s, it remains remarkably fresh and up to date (Or perhaps not so remarkable really: it took us several thousand years to deduce all that, why should it be surprising that the discoveries of 1980 are still pretty much cutting edge?)Gribbin leads you down this dizzying path in an engaging way, using the individual geniuses as the hooks on which to hang his narrative. The result is an attractive mix of the history of science in the twentieth century; and of the science itself.He really does his best to make these impossible concepts digestible (for example, a particle that needs to revolve twice before it has returned to its starting position). At some points I found his innate enthusiasm for the subject beginning to run away with him just a little: he prattles on happily for pages, piling equation on equation, somehow demonstrating – well, something anyway. I guess it really depends on how much of a details person you are: if you're content to know that for example, electrons move more easily between the atoms of certain solids when super-cooled and leave it that, you might find his cheery explanation of the micro-detail a bit overwhelming at times. But at least it's there if ever you need to go back and mug up on the exact science of super-conductors. I should add immediately that the entire book is nonetheless perfectly approachable, and indeed written in a very earthy and accessible English. As he makes clear, without having first mastered the bizarre behaviour of electrons at the micro level, we wouldn't have achieved many (most?) Of the advances that lay the basis of the twentieth century's scientific claim to fame, from computers to DNA and genetic engineering, to lasers and even stereos. Quite a thought - it underpins everything.Leading on from that was another killer point that was new to me in its full implications. He remarks at one point that a great deal of the knowledge and scientific advance achieved was in its way no more than knowledge waiting to happen. If Bloggs hadn't had the inspiration (and therefore the damned Novel prize: see below) then Scroggs would have got there anyway. But Gribbin adds that, much more rarely, someone comes along and simply rewrites the rule book. Copernicus maybe; Newton clearly has a claim. But until I'd stopped and contemplated the enormity of his achievement I don't think I'd grasped how very much, how overwhelmingly much, the twentieth century, with its lasers and x-rays and stereos and PCs owes to Albert Einstein. Wow.A vague niggle for me was the number of times he quotes other people’s work. Of course, this is the norm in scholarly works, as the writer seeks to cover his/her backside, making sure they can’t be accused of plagiarism. But for lesser mortals it was slightly wearing. He quotes so very many books you wonder how he found time to get some work done. Intriguing to see how often he gives the winning of a Nobel prize as the gold standard of science. It is of course, but he goes a bit far for me. He bemoans for example that if only Pauli had continued with such and such a line of research, then HE would have got the prize for it. Or again, it took until 1954 (tut tut) for Bohr to get his Nobel prize. But what happened to the shining glory of endeavour? Personally speaking I’m as interested in who got a Nobel prize as who won the Champion’s League, and it does grate a tiny bit. I wish I had a pound for every time he mentions it.All the same, reservations like this are footling and beside the real point and impact of the book. What emerged for me, inch by inch from his writing, is the stupendous thought that it’s possible for a (bright) person with a pencil and a piece of paper to sit down and deduce in detail, also inch by inch, how the universe was formed 15 billion years ago, pretty much by destruction-testing theories through the use of mathematics. This book sets out how it happened and is a must-read if you don’t know the subject. What a piece of work is man…"

I must say that it is a wonderful book, which provides a good overlay of what one will encounter once one starts actually doing Physics. A lot of it is popular science, which is to be expected. In hindsight, I would wish for more rigor and mathematics, but for a beginner, it is perfect!"
149,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57667467-bob,4,"I can't even find the book at my house anymore so not sure if it was this one or another. I think any of them would be interesting, given the subject. Aside from being interesting, I give it a 4 because it re-sparked my interest in science. This is from my own casual ""layman's"" view. It was fun and I probably skipped over anything that got too technical for me. Just as much fun is when this leads to (or vice versa) reading about ""photon entanglement"". Real life science can be just as much fun as science fiction so I recommend books like this to anyone who likes Si-Fi."

151,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33125404-eric-layton,4,An excellent read. I like how Gribbin writes. 
152,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899477-bryan-higgs,4,"As an explanation of what quantum physics is all about, including its philosophical background, and competing interpretations, this book is hard to beat. Gribbin is an excellent writer about science for the intelligent layman, and he does a really good job here. He provides a good description of the history of how things developed, from Max Planck, through Einstein, Bohr, Max Born, Schoedinger, Heisenberg, Dirac and many others, while at the same time explaining the physics involved in understandable terms. I have read a number of such books, and I have a Ph.D. in Elementary Particle Physics, so there was little that was new to me, and I did not expect there to be.The main problem with the book is that it was published in 1984. Surprisingly, this has less impact on the science descriptions than you might think -- he covers the many worlds interpretation, super symmetry, and the definitive Aspect experiment that basically showed that Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen were wrong in their famous EPR paper -- using John Bell's ideas on how to show those ideas through experiment. However, the author's descriptions of the technologies that quantum physics has spawned are very out of date. Not surprising, but still I felt the need for an updated edition.This book has quite a number of diagrams (the lack of which I often complain about in books of this type). While this is good, I just felt there were too many diagrams about multiple slit experiments and too many Feynman diagrams. Some diagrams that tried to provide visual explanations of experiments and ideas would have been good, but were mostly absent.Apparently, there is a sequel to this book Schrodinger's Kittens and the Search for Reality: Solving the Quantum Mysteries, which dates from 1995, and presumably updates the material significantly. Unfortunately, it appears to be out of print."

154,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31341193-pongprapas,4,"Not the most interesting or exciting, but intuitive (and fun) enough to be read fluidly, this book is a nice beginner's guide to quantum mechanics, with the first half of the book providing a brief historical account of its development. It can give you a glimpse of what has been going on in this remarkable branch of physics."
155,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11171179-chris-chaplin,4,"Far from being drily theoretical, this is an entertaining and easily understood account of the science that underpins most modern technology. Gribbin takes us on a skillfully guided historical journey through the development of quantum physics, from Newton's classical (but utterly inaccurate) 19th century understanding of light waves and atomic particles, through the heady years of the early 20th century when a new wave of young physicists theorised that light was also particles and matter was also waves (years ahead of technology being able to prove them correct), to the next generation who showed that the world we think of as solid and certain is actually a sea of probabilities in which uncertainty is a fundamental characteristic.The quantum universe is a bizarre and unfamiliar place, where a cat can simultaneously be alive and dead, and information appears to travel faster than the universal speed limit. Schrodinger (creator of the cat paradox) hated it. Einstein helped confirm quantum mechanics then spent the rest of his life trying to disprove it. And Gribbin argues that most modern physicists fail to understand the real implications of quantum mechanics, preferring instead to use a ""quantum cookbook"" approach. It's easy to see why: the numbers work, but what it means is just too weird to contemplate. Take the atom, for instance: even today, the typical textbook representation is of electrons whizzing around a nucleus of protons and neutrons. This couldn't be further from the truth. Think instead of a fuzzy ball of probabilities in which ""solid"" particles like neutrons are waves, and it is permanently impossible to know what is really going on at an atomic level.I found the first 200 pages of this book riveting, worthy of a full five stars, but unfortunately in the last 50 pages Gribbin drifts into more personal speculation on the nature of the universe, weaving in elements of metaphysics and science fiction. These are valid areas for discussion, but they didn't sit well with the more factual content of the rest of the book. Nonetheless, this book is a great introduction for those new to quantum mechanics, and an entertaining ""reboot"" for those of us who thought we understood the science."
156,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4475067-peter,4,"Very good intro but a bit outdated now (originally published in 1984). Gribben writes well and knows his subject. If you're new to quantum physics, this is an excellent primer."
157,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3248384-gareth,0,"Quantum physics is deeply unsettling. The two competing theories that attempt to explain the Schrodinger's cat paradox of the title seem both (to the average person) equally implausible: the Copenhagen interpretation proposes that, until an observer 'fixes' the results of the experiment by opening the box, the cat is neither alive nor dead, but both; the Many Worlds interpretation proposes that quantum indeterminacy results in alternative worlds where both possible outcomes are respectively fulfilled (one universe contains a live cat, another contains the dead one). It's crazy stuff. And it doesn't stop there - but I'll let you read the book for yourself.However, whilst physicists may not understand why the sub-atomic world behaves the way it does, quantum theory is a hugely powerful tool that has provided the basis for many of the advances of modern science and technology - nuclear energy, lasers, microwaves, computers, even playing a role in the discovery of DNA. In fact, it wouldn't be too strong a claim to say that our modern world would be unthinkable without it. So, in Gribbin's words, we have a 'Quantum cookbook' with which we can exert an extraordinary power over nature, even if we don't fully understand why the recipes work or what the ingredients are.This is a difficult subject, and Gribbin does an admirable job of attempting to give a full account of the development of quantum theory in clear historical terms whilst also endeavouring to explain its advances in accessible language. However, given the complexity of the material, there are some sections which will leave the layperson baffled. This is perhaps unavoidable, and it would have been worse if the author had succumbed to the temptation to oversimplify. So, I'll probably read it again at some point, and hope that more of it sinks in. Well worth a read, though, and probably - even though it's getting on a bit now - still the classic introduction to the subject.Gareth Southwell is a philosopher, writer and illustrator."
158,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4760905-ghada,4,"In a quest to search for quantum reality, this astrophysicist paves the road for the reader by presenting a historical background on physicists and theories that have lead to investigations in quantum physics. He starts off with the most basic topics that usually introduce quantum physics to undergraduate students. From Young’s double slit experiment and the wave-particle duality to black body radiation, Planck’s quantization, Bohr’s atom, Einstein’s theory and the wave function; the foundations leading up to quantum physics theory are laid. He then begins explaining some of the implications of this new branch of physics. What I found very interesting about this section is the applications of quantum theory. During the courses we took in our undergraduate years, the curriculum focused on mathematical models and proofs. Although if questioned, we could deduce the scientific principles behind recent inventions and applications, it was refreshing to allow one’s mind to wander while reading through pages worth of various applications in various fields that all could not have been possible if it weren’t for the development of quantum theory.In the third part of the book, Gribbins presents his views and discusses the philosophical implications of this relatively new theory. Some of the topics he presents here are Cophenhagen’s Interpretation, Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle and Time Travel and the Spin Paradox. He uses examples of thought experiments to make it easier for the reader to follow the explanations, and explains the scientific objective of the infamous Schrodinger’s Cat.After what will seem as strange new ideas, Gibbins leaves the reader with a trail of loose ends, a new perspective of the world, and a pile of more questions! "
159,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28355672-avik,4,"QM is a very difficult subject to grasp. It is very easy to lose your step and smash your nose in the dirt while treading the tricky path of discussing QM for the uninitiated. John Gribbin, thankfully, is not of those. It seems to me while reading him that he has taken to heart the famous Feynman-speak ""Nobody understands Quantum Mechanics"" and never ventures on to become overtly speculative/imaginative regarding the weirdness of QM results.The book is packed with such brilliant and profound scientific insights as Rutherford's experiment, de Broglie's proposition, Heisenber's uncertainty principle, superimposition and double-slit experiment, Schrodinger's cat, the Einstein-Podolski-Rosen paradox and the Copenhagen intepretation just to name a few of the prominent ones. These ideas have shaped our understanding of the world and, mind you, are the reason we can watch our favourite shows on television and read this review on the internet. This small book is a wonderful starting point for those interested in the history of 20th century physics and is replete with interesting characters and fantastic anecdotes.The only downside, according to me, lies in the selection of the ideas that were discussed. While all the important ones found their place withing the jackets, some truly brilliant ones that, maybe, lacked some prior ""PR"" were left out - Pascual Jordan's work was equally important as Heisenberg's, John von Neumann gave a new direction to the epistemology of QM, Freeman Dyson's eccentric (literally) ideas and, finally, David Bohm and his hidden variables that may find a new lease of life in the years to come.All-in-all, a breathtaking survey of one of mankind's greatest intellectual edifices. Go, read it!"
160,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15416206-paul,3,"I am not mathematically minded, and I hated much of physics at school. I'm an arts student at heart, and I simply can't cope with this shit.Why am I teaching myself about quantum theory then? Because, to paraphrase Gribbin, it's the single most important achievement of the human mind, and as I'm building myself into the ultimate Renaissance Man, I can't just ignore that. Thankfully, there are now plenty of pop-science books to guide me through this terrifying, crazy world of alpha particles, fermions, pions, hadrons, hardons and lardons. Gribbin's tome was accessible enough, and really started from the very basics (light, atoms, etc.). Interestingly, this book is very much a historical account of the development of quantum theory out of 'classical' mechanics - lots of names and dates, but enough anecdotal tidbits to keep it fresh. Hell hath no fury like a physicist scorned.Ultimately, I learned plenty more about quantum mechanics, and for that I'm grateful. But I think I only absorbed about half of the content of the book. I think about a third of the way in I was beginning to get lost - I needed more and better diagrams, that's my problem. Also, Gribbin really has something against the prestige of the theory of relativity. Not to pun on the title but, miaow. I'll save the gushing about how mind-blowing multiverse theory is, the implications of quantum theory viz. a holistically connected universe, the slight creepiness about the photon double-slit experiment (the particle KNOWS YOU'RE WATCHING, it messes with you). I'll need a second read through to fully take it in. But I have no regrets. Three thumbs up. "
161,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17948667-diana,4,"Let me begin by apologizing to physicists and mathematicians everywhere. I have a music/liberal arts background, and my training in math and science is woefully weak, despite the best efforts of teachers and professors over the years. And I must also confess that I picked up this book because of the title: I had heard of Schrodinger's cat in several episodes of ""The Big Bang Theory"" so I was curious. Thank you, Sheldon Cooper.John Gribbin has essentially written a history of birth of quantum physics up to the mid-1980's for the layperson. His background as a professor and science commentator for the BBC contributes to his ability to lay a groundwork for an individual like me, curious but unschooled and without the chops to ""do the math."" He does a nice job of explaining the primary theories, and I especially liked the way he presents the logic and experimental evidence that proved or disproved this or that theory. He spends about 80 percent of the volume on what is past and devotes the remainder of the text to theories that were being developed and examined at the time the book is written. There was one surprise: I found not a single reference to Stephen Hawking, even in the last portion of the book. The version I have is an ebook, and it is well presented. The figures are easily readable, which I always find to be a problem. I was not distracted by poor editing, and the author's writing is clear and concise. As an academic, he is very specific to give credit where credit is due, and I am especially please with the bibliography and his suggestions for appropriate further reading on various topics for lay people. So, now on to ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters."" "
162,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/195827-joe,5,"A fun introduction into the absolutely bizarre world of quantum physics -- for the lay person. The amazing world of something being in many places at the same time, the shape of the universe... the list goes on. For the mathematically inclined, there are equations explaining everything, but for folks like me (who realized math classes required serious study!) you can skip over that and still gain an appreciation of the mind-blowing aspects of the universe.The title is drawn from a paradox introduced by Schrodinger, a colleague of Einstein. By all accounts, quantum-level particles are essentially nowhere specifially until they are observed. Schrödinger explained the quandary this way: picture a cat, an atom of radioactive material, and a bottle of cyanide in a closed box. When the radioactive element decays, its radiation will break the bottle of cyanide. Is the cat is alive or dead? The Uncertainty Principle says until you open the box, it’s both alive and dead. Schrödinger thought his calculations had to be wrong, that this scenario was impossible.Over the decades, experiment after experiment showed the Uncertainly Principle is right, and in effect, the famous cat IS alive and dead -- until someone opens the box to check.Again, this is a fairly user-friendly introduction for anyone ready to be amazed at the universe. Some works written since this famous book have shown even more bizarre proofs, but this is a great intro."

Complex physical concepts were explained at ease and were made assessable to my physics-hating mind. The history and people involved in the scientific discoveries were also described well and although I can't remember a lot about this book, I know that if I were to pick it up again I would enjoy it as thoroughly and I enjoyed it the first time.A few weeks after finishing this book I made friends with a physics graduate who is now training to become a teacher and I was impressed by the fact I could discuss quantum physics with him, whilst our friends stared at us as if we were speaking a foreign language!The geek in me is what loved this book, although it grew a bit tiresome at the end. Before this book I was completely ignorant of all the applications of quantum mechanics. The very keyboard I am typing on and the television I am trying to ignore were all made using this exact science.Whether you're a physics buff or, like me, are completely clueless when it comes to quantum theory, I would highly recommend this book if you'd like to expand your knowledge on the science of reality.Prepare to get mind-fucked!For more reviews check out http://bookworm786.blogspot.co.uk/"

The other books on quantum mechanics I've read, I've been able to understand because I read this book. It explains the concepts by 'discovering' them just like the scientific theorists and experimentalists did, in chronological order. The language is simple and informal and the diagrams are effective: they make the explanations easy (as easy as quantum mechanics can be!) to follow - unlike one or two others I attempted. Technical detail is targeted at the right level for the audience (people who are curious, probably covertly geeky like me, but new to the whole experience), and keeps the higher level tecky titbits for 'out of the closet' geeks in the footnotes. Secretly, I have to admit, those footnotes were a red rag to a bull to me, I just had to read and try and understand them. With mixed success. But by the time I reached the end of the book, it had given me a tremendous sense of achievement. Here was a topic that I doubted I could ever understand, and I had picked up not a basic understanding, but a good understanding of all the principles. It's enabled me to go on and up from there. I can only say, thank you. And now that the Higg's particle has made science cool, I can even admit I've read it. Fantastic!"

I'm not quite sure how outdated the material is b/c I'm not exactly up on all the latest breakthroughs in quantum physics. If you are, you may look at this book in a totally different light.The best parts of the book I thought were the explanations of the Copenhagen interpretation vs. the many worlds hypothesis to explain quantum observations. These are explained reasonably well and I'm glad I read them to know a little more about that sort of craziness.My main gripe with the book was that a lot of overly technical experiments and subjects were treated very superficially, to the point that I didn't feel like I got as much out of things as I could.If you are interested in knowing more about quantum theory, you probably will enjoy this, but considering how old it is I would guess that there are more recent books that might be better to check out.

He understands he is relating an episode in an ongoing saga, not proclaiming a definitive history.The story is as bizarre and exciting as any science fiction story: does the concept of time have any meaning to photons that travel at the speed of light? does observation alter reality? Does anyone have suggestions for a book picking up the story of quantum theory since 1984?""If the business of physics is ever finished, the world will be a much less interesting place in which to live, which is why I am so happy to leave you with loose ends, tantalizing hints, and the prospect of more stories yet to be told, each one as intriguing as the story of Schrodinger's cat."""

That includes the stories about the stupid cat.Recently, Thad Roberts presented a new way of looking at the universe (discretely in 9D+2T dimensions) which does away with the Copenhagen School and places it where it belongs, in the dumpster of physics history. Quantum uncertainty is emergent, not fundamental. Sorry, Heisenberg.This book is still an interesting read, as it explains Quantum Uncertainty with a mainly Copenhagen interpretation (that is: a mainly incorrect interpretation). But it does so as well as any other presentation that I have heard; and it shows how many, many very smart minds can be mislead, and can mislead each other, by ""thinking too hard"". By thinking too hard, I mean that Copenhagenoids have ignored Occam's Razor for way too long. Think ""easy"" and the answer will come to you.See Einstein's Intuition by Thad Roberts for more information."

I am a chemistry major, and have read other books by Hawking and Einstein that have touched on the subject. However, I feel like Gribbin was able to explain the subject in a very compelling way that doesn't short change the material and ""dumb it down"", but is also fairly accessible and gets to the core of some of the major misunderstandings that are propagated about quantum mechanics in popular culture (see What The Bleep Do We Know?). Particularly his description on the uncertainty principle and the implications of it are the best I have read in any popular science book. The last section of the book where Gribbin does go into some differing interpretations, such as the many-worlds interpretation as a pretty cool ideas to think about, while still staying grounded in the theory and science, and not into hokey new age mysticism. "
171,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/355378-damon,3,"An interesting history of the scientific revolution of the early 20th century in which the predictable clockwork of Newtonian physics was smashed by quantum theory, in which things exist only if we look at them, events can happen for no reason and cats may be simultaneously living and dead. Although not well understood, this theory has produced a litany of amazing inventions, including lasers, microprocessors, nuclear power and genetic engineering. On the downside, Gribbon's writing is dense and wandering, and so many names and discoveries are thrown at that at the end of a chapter I couldn't remember who discovered what. I also found his preference for the parallel universe explanation a bit silly and unneccessary, but it does leave the reader with a sense of the stunning implications of these discoveries. "
172,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4142763-jim-kennedy,4,"The subject of quantum mechanics is not an easy one to get across. Gribbin does as good a job as is probably possible. He first provides a historical perspective on how we ended up with this particular theory. He then does a pretty good job of explaining it for the novice - like myself. There is no intuitiveness in quantum theory, so I did find myself stuck at two or three points in the book, trying to get a grip on what he was saying. At one particular point I had to leave it for a while and come back to it after the mind had mulled over it for a few days. But I really don't think he could have been much clearer. I finished the book feeling I had finally gained a little understanding of the subject. (I had tried other books on the subject and they all failed miserably to help me get it.) So - definitely well worth it if you have an interest in the area."

""In search of Schrodinger's cat"", stands as an testament to the quote; The book describes the progress in our understanding of the universe and contributions of the great names in Physics in doing so. Gribbin succeeds in explaining the concepts of physics without resorting to the mathematics. The double slit experiment with electrons, (although repeated from Feynman's work) and its implications such as why classical laws are insufficient, was treated very well . The author's take on multiverse and time-travel would have been compelling if not for the developments since the book was in print. Finally, I understood, a little better, the difference between ""the cat being alive AND dead at the same time"" versus the ""the cat being alive or dead""."

For those of us whose minds need to translate math into words before it has real meaning, this book is excellent. It approaches quantum physics discovery by discovery, explaining the implications of each as it goes. I'm pretty sure that it's the text Crichton used to write  Timeline , but I really wish it was updated to include the field's advances during my lifetime - 1984 is a long-ago publication rate for such a dynamic field. It also fails the five-star rating because Gribbin ends by siding with multiverse theory which is not, in my opinion and based on the information as he presented it, the best explanation that fits the facts.

The concept of this book is part of history book part of popular physics text for those who want to know the hard road of the developing of quantum physics. The text is clear and very enjoyable to read and points to some books and thoughts, which makes reader to search for the questions.Schrödinger's Cat is used as the perfect example of one and this theme went trough the book and author returned to it like to the red ribbon.

At times it had me laughing out loud, at others taking gasps of amazement as some thread came together and another vista of understanding and wonder opened before me. At one point I was cursing my physics teachers, saying “why didn’t you tell me?” over and over. Really. And I’m not even an actor. It was written in 1984, which dates it a little, but for my level it gives me a great base to be able to understand some friendly summaries of developments since then."

Gribbin doesn't shy away from the uncensored mathematics in this book, so my eyes would occasionally glaze over. I'm pleased to say this does not detract from how fascinating the story of this branch of science is, and Gribbin has a clear affection for it.Reading this book in 2014 makes for an interesting experience, for the stuff at the end of this book was cutting-edge science when it was written in the 80s. I was struck to find that one of the last anecdotes he told was about Alan Guth and his theory of inflation, and here was I, reading this perspective mere weeks after Guth himself was given the good news of preliminary yet hard evidence for his theory."
179,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,3,"A decent introduction to quantum theory for the layman. I found it insightful in places and well written. It didn't cover EPR, Bell's Theorem and some of the most mind-bending aspects of quantum theory as well as Manjit Kumar's book, but is perhaps easier for readers new to the subject. It has also stood the test of time well. I found some of the chapters in the last third of the book less good than earlier chapters. The one in which the author takes a strong position in favour of the many worlds interpretation is noticeably weaker than those preceding it, and the sections giving reasons why quantum theory is so important to modern life (lasers, semiconductors, etc.) seem overdone. Still, it's definitely worth a read."
180,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5807484-talal,4,"The book was a slightly heavier read than I had anticipated, but as I researched some of the concepts Gribbin goes over online, I was overwhelmed by their complexities. In other words, relatively speaking, the author does a fantastic job of explaining complex concepts about the nature of the universe. I also love how Gribbin leaves his own opinion on the matter all the way at the end of the book. Either everything is real or nothing is real - it was a fascinating read and my curiosity on the subject of quantum mechanics has been extremely satisfied and yet my appetite for more knowledge remains, thanks to Gribbin's excellent book. I am also looking forward to reading more books from the same author. "

Still the book is rich in analogies to help you understand and imagine the real scale of those huge but tiny or even accidental quantum discoveries. Sketches and drawings are also really useful and this last star in my rating stands for a really good narrative. Gribbin elegantly wrapped up all the crucial lessons into a single historical/biographical story which makes it more fluid and a lot easier to follow. Not boring at all and it gives you some sense of how things work between scientists and their audience/global climate etc. Nicely written, well presented ideas, a good food for your brain."

It's the level of detail that has me rereading and going back over chapters. This book challenges how you view everything. Quantum physics, once poo-pooed by Einstein, theorizes that how we view reality is flawed; suspended reality is the place where quantum physics lives. Gribbin has done an excellent job so far in unraveling the mystery and showing the scientific steps taken for the world to arrive at this utterly bizarre yet totally fascinating field. I'm a true beginner in this area, but this book arms even me with enough info to be dangerous!"

I love Carl Sagan, but he was alone on the mainstream stage. I haven't figured out why Gribbin dislikes spirituality being associated with theoretical physics. Unity means everything is one. You don't get to exclude anything from the whole. Still, I really like his deep coverage of maths & physics history. It puts a lot into perspective when you see when a specific scientist came on the scene.I suggest a newer title if you're interested in quantum physics: ""Trespassing on Einstein's Lawn"". That one is truly riveting. "

These are all interesting because they connect to biblical themes. Somewhere out there, a Christian physicist surely has reflected on these theological connections to quantum physics? "

Despite a few difficulties with it, by the end of the book, I was amazed at how he managed to explain mind-blowing concepts like Everett's 'Many Worlds' theory in such a way that it resolves difficult puzzles like the Grandfather paradox. I'm still a reductionist at heart, so I have never liked the uncertainty principle, but combining his explanations with the anthropic principle, for example, makes it a lot more palatable.

I do not know if this is due to my complete lack of knowledge when it comes to physics. However this book does has diagrams so that helps. It is not the worst non fiction science book I have read and I am glad I read it however I would recommend it to people who unlike me did not get C's in high school physics.

Gribbin is able to take complex concepts and break them down into smaller, more digestible parts. Any qualms I ever had about physics disappeared under his tutelage. I would suggest this as a great introduction for anyone interested in the quantum world."

It's a fascinating subject, and a very accessible work for the layman."

For someone who has sudied physics or chemistry, even at simply an advanced high school level, the first part of the book moves very slowly. On the other hand, If you haven't studued scuence, ir if ut has veen a very long time, the material is rather complex."
