0,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1478106-bill,4,"This book puts me in mind of the story about how a Harvard number theorist, through some malfunction of the scheduling computer, got assigned to teach an introductory course in pre-calculus. Being one of those individuals to whom math came so easily that they couldn't grasp how difficult others found it, the professor had no idea what to cover in such a course. So, he went to the chair of the department, who told him: ""You'll want to start with the real number-line and then progress to inequalities; from there, move on to quadratic equations, then trigonometry and the wrapping function, Cartesian and polar coordinate systems, and, if time permits, conic sections.""The professor thanked the chairperson and went off to meet with his first class. Next week, he was back.""What should I teach them now?"" he said.A Brief History of Time is like that -- Professor Hawking doesn't seem to notice when his treatment progresses from the obvious to the arcane, ending with his concept of ""imaginary time"" (very nearly incomprehensible in this overly brief presentation).Fun nonetheless."
1,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/272430-daniel,2,"It is not clear to me who is in the target audience for this book. At times it tries to explain basic concepts of modern physics in simple language, and at other times it assumes a familiarity with the same subject. For the first time I think I ""understand"" why absolute time is not consistent with relativity theory or that space-time curvature supplants the notion of gravity, and for that I thank the author. There are a few other things I believe I have a glimpse of having (finally) slogged through the book.On the other hand, there are many places where he writes as if it were clear what he is talking about even though it would require a good deal of background knowledge. To give but one example, he starts talking about summing up over possible world histories (I cannot locate the quotation) without explaining what that would mean. Trained in statistics, I have some idea that he is talking about mathematical expectation in the context of quantum mechanics, but I don't know how another reader might make any sense of it (and I certainly don't have more than a vague notion). There are irritating writing practices that could have used some editing, e.g., the use of the naked pronominal adjective ""this"" when in the middle of a dense explanation of an abstruse concept(e.g., ""This had serious implications for the ultimate fate of massive stars.""). My biggest complaints, however, are about his philosophical opinions. Obviously he is entitled to think as he wishes about the ultimate questions, but his assertion that his hypothesis of a finite world without beginning or end would leave no place for God seems beside the point. The classic divide has not changed: some folks look around and say stuff just is, and other folks say there's a power behind the stuff that has at least as much going for it as we do. That argument hasn't changed with his theories. At one point in the book he claims that the late John Paul II told gathered scientists that they mustn't inquire into the Big Bang because that was God's territory. I would wager with anyone reading this comment that such an assertion is just plain false. JPII was a flawed mortal, to be sure, but he was no dope; it certainly sounds to me like someone hearing what he thinks the pope would say. (And the Galileo jokes are pretty dumb -- does anyone think that JPII, who apologized for the embarrassing Galileo fiasco, would go after this guy? It must be all that influence the Vatican has had in Britain over the last 400 years that has him scared.) Other philosophical complaints involve his use of entropy (he defines it first within closed systems and then uses it to explain why the ""thermodynamic arrow of time"" and the ""personal arrow of time"" must run in the same direction -- leaping from a box of molecules to the entire universe!), his droning on about what black holes are like when he doesn't know for sure they exist, his statements about ""random"" and being 95% certain a theory is true (does that mean about 95 out of 100 theories like that are true??). His opinions may be very rich, deep, though-provoking, but how would I (or most general readers) know? You can't really evaluate a judgment unless you know something in the field. And so that is why I ultimately cannot recommend this book: if you know physics inside and out, you might find his opinions interesting. If you don't, you can only walk around parroting what he says about black holes as if you had a clue what you were talking about. What we all really need is a remedial course in physics!"
2,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu,5,"Isn't it amazing that a person can read a book like A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking and come away feeling both smarter and dumber than before he started? What a universe we live in!It's quite short and generally a quick read. Not every page is filled with mind-blowing/numbing theories and brain-busting equations. Some of it is just history, say on Newton and such. However, there were a few pages worth of passages where my wee brain felt like it was getting sucked into a black hole...mainly during the black hole segment.I've forgotten so much since I left school, and since school was such a long time ago, some of what was taught back then is now outdated, it was nice to read this refresher/cleanser. I came away with a better understanding of the Big Bang theory and why it's plausible (Not the tv show. Its existence is not plausible). I'm trying to sort out the time/space quantifiability thing. That's going to require a reread...and probably further study elsewhere.Surprisingly, I also came away with the idea that God and science can coexist. I didn't expect that. I figured someone like Hawking would be like, ""God? Pssh, whatever."" But that's not his take at all, or at least that not the impression this book left me with.A Brief History of Time was written with accessibility in mind, knowing full well idiots like me wouldn't buy it, read it or recommend it if it were impossibly dense. Hawking's sense of humor even comes through on occasion, which is always appreciated in these sciencey texty thingies. So, I'll probably move on to his Briefer History... next and I'd be quite willing to read others as well!"

4,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-sean-barrs,3,"Stephen Hawking writes in a very simple and approachable way. On the surface the book has been written for the common man, for he who has little knowledge of theoretical physics. Hawking uses basic terminology and he tries not to overload his writing with explanations and information dumps, but at times it is very clear that the reader needs a certain level of knowledge to understand what he's talking about. As such, Hawking makes certain assumptions as he shifts from concept to concept which left me a little confused. Things that don't appear related are related and it made me question who the intended readership really was. I do believe this is a book every reader should try because it is an important one, full of discussions and ideas that could really open up your mind. But I would warn you to be prepared, although this seems like light reading, much of it may go over your head. Approach with caution. "
5,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856247-david-sarkies,4,"Things I learnt from Stephen Hawking11 October 2014	Ever since I took up physics in year 11 I have had a love affair with the subject, which is odd since I went on to study an arts/law degree (but that probably had something to do with the fact that I would not have had the staying power to pour all of my energy into helping human knowledge advance towards establishing a unified theory). I still wonder where I ended up getting this book, and it had been sitting on my shelf for quite a while (probably because I was too busy listening to people tell me why I shouldn't read this book), but it wasn't until John Lennox said that it was the most unfinished book (that is people start reading it but do not have the staying power to get to the end) ever written (I'm sure there are other books that beat this book though). There are quite a few things that I have discovered while reading this book, and it is these discoveries that I wish to share with you:1) This is not an anti-God book	One of the impressions that I got from certain people was that this was a book that an atheist wrote to try to argue that God does not exist, in much the same way that Richard Dawkins does in his books. However, that statement could not be further from the truth. In fact, throughout the book the question of the existence of God perpetually hangs in the background. Granted, Hawkings does suggest that if the concept of a infinite bounded universe (don't ask) turns out to be true then it would undermine God's existence, however he does not actually say that this may be the case. In fact his final sentence in this book is that the reason we study physics and try to find a unified theory is because we, as a race, seek to understand the mind of God.2) Stephen Hawkings is actually a really good writer	This probably goes without saying, especially since the cover of my book says that it is a 'record breaking best seller'. While he is involved in some very serious and complicated research he is able to write in a way that many of us who have probably studied physics up to a year twelve level (that is the end of High school) can understand. Okay, I probably have an advantage over most other people since my Dad is a theoretical physicist that we have regular conversations about some of these high level concepts (such as by having any more than three dimensions would cause the orbits of the planets to collapse), but I still found that he was very easy to follow and he explained many of these high level concepts in a way that many of us could understand.3) Scientists have a strange way of viewing the universe	Many of us would be familiar with this guy:but as it turns out, after reading this book, I have come to the conclusion that a lot of theoretical physicists seem to live in the same world that he does. Okay, they probably don't spend their time at the comic book store, or arguing whether Babylon Five is better than Star Trek (actually, one of my primary school friends is a theoretical physicist, and we did have such an argument), but they do seem to see the world in a way that we ordinary people would consider strange.	For instance, we see space as flat, meaning that if we look at a star, as far as we are concerned the star is in that direction. However physicists see space as being curved and that a straight line is not necessarily straight. We would see a brick wall as being a solid object and that the idea of walking through one would result in a sore nose. However physicists see it as being made up of mostly space, and the only reason we can't walk through it is because the nuclear forces (forces that exist inside an atom, not the force that can level an entire city) prevent us for doing so. Then there is the concept of dimensions: to us there are only three dimensions, however some scientists (and Hawking is not one of them) see that there are in fact ten, or even more, dimensions.4) Why are so many scientists atheists	 While reading this book I could not get past about how complex this universe is and it made me wonder why it is, with the mathematical precision of the universe, and the complexity that lies therein, that so many scientists seem to argue that it all came about by chance. Even Hawking argues, using the second law of thermodynamics, that the universe cannot move from a state of disorder to a state of order – a broken plate simply cannot mend itself. However, the argument also goes that with the Big Bang Theory (not the television show) that the universe began in a state of disorder and moved to a state of order, however the laws of physics seem to suggest otherwise because what the big bang did was sent in motion a series of laws that caused the universe to come about to what we have at the moment. However, to go into details would require some intense theoretical physics, something which I have do desire to delve into at the moment.5) Scientists assume the speed of light is a constant	The truth is that it is not. Okay, if light were travelling through a vacuum where there are no external forces acting upon it, then it is a constant, but that is very rarely the case. Take for instance this phenomena:	The reason light behaves thus is because when it hits the prism it SLOWS DOWN, and when it slows down it refracts. Thus my point is proven, the speed of light is only a constant when there are no external forces acting upon it.	So, what external forces may act upon light in space. Well, first of all there are black holes. When light hits a black hole the force of gravity is so strong that it will actually prevent light from escaping. Thus, gravity is a force that effects light and slows it down. Then there is the concept of dark matter, which are clouds of matter that do not emit light and float between the star systems. Okay, we know very little about the stuff (and it is also a theory, so it has not been proven) but my hypothesis is that if this stuff exists then would it not have an effect upon light, namely by slowing it down, which means that there is a possibility that our calculations as to the distance of stars from our own Sun could actually be wrong?6) Scientists do not know as much as we think they know	One of the things that Hawking stresses in this book is that theories are not actually proven. A theory is an idea that has some foundation based on mathematical calculations and empirical evidence. Therein lies the problem. Much of our understanding of the universe is based upon mathematical calculations, and it appears that if an event comes about which causes this mathematical calculation to break down, they immediately set out to try to find another mathematical equation to plug the hole.	Take light for instance. For years we believed that light acted as a wave and suddenly it was discovered that it also behaves like a particle (a particle of light is called a photon). The same goes with matter – for years we believed that they were particles when all of the sudden we discovered that they can also behave like waves. As such, our understanding of the universe suddenly breaks down (meaning that we are not necessarily made up of atoms, but have wavelike properties as well).	Mathematical equations have been very destructive in out modern world. Take the Global Financial Crisis for instance. A bunch of apparently really smart people create complex mathematical equations to determine when to buy and sell shares and how to make billions of dollars. However what these equations did not take into account was the fact that people could not simply continue to accumulate debt without having to pay it back and when people began to default on their loans enmass, the whole concept broke down and we were taken to the brink of financial armageddon.	Another point goes back to Ancient Greece. Here we have the theory of Democritus, namely that matter was not infinitely indivisible (the smallest piece of matter is an atom), and then the theory of Aristotle, that is that matter is infinitely divisible. Scientists preferred Democritus' theory, however they soon discovered that you could break down the atom into protons and neutrons, and you could even break them down to quarks. So, maybe Aristotle was right after all.7) We accept their theories because our gadgets work	It goes without saying that their research and discoveries have lead to the computer that I am writing this on, the energy that powers our devices, and the bombs that can level entire cities. We know how to make a nuclear bomb, as well as a smart phone, so we don't question what they say, because it obviously works. However, as a friend of mine once said, it is still all based on theory, and just because something works does not necessarily mean that the theory is correct. Remember that penicillin was discovered by blind chance.8) Nobel Prizes are simply shiny baubles that have no merit	Okay, maybe the people that win these prizes are actually really smart, but then again, the guys who set up Long-Term Capital Management also won a Nobel prize, which proves my point.9) Nobody really knows how gravity works	Gravity is one of those odd forces that doesn't seem to connect with any of the other forces in our universe. As Hawking points out, there are four forces that have been identified: electro-magnetic, strong nuclear, weak nuclear, and gravity. Out of those four forces (five if you divide electric and magnetic, but since electricity will create a magnetic force, they are effectively combined) only gravity stands out. This is probably why Hawking spends so much time talking about black holes because black holes are where the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape from its grasp. The other thing is that gravity does not, at least in our knowledge, have an opposing force. Gravity basically sucks, and that is all it does – it doesn't repulse as the other forces can.	It is interesting that in some texts that I have read (maybe it is speculative science-fiction but I simply cannot remember off the top of my head) some people have suggested that gravity is actually a force from another universe that affects our universe and what it is effectively doing is sucking our universe into their universe. However, as I have said, that is incredibly speculative, and since I am not a theoretical physicist I can't really say any more on the subject.10) The God of the Gaps is a cop-out	The idea of the God of the Gaps is that where there are gaps in our knowledge we simply say 'oh, God did that' and think nothing more of it. This goes back to the days of paganism (and Medieval Europe) where all of the unknown forces, such as the weather, was attributed God (or the gods) and we could not know anything beyond that fact. However I am arguing that it is a cop out. Creation scientists who resort to this argument are at best lazy and at worst dangerous. The reason I say that is that it discourages research into areas that we do not understand. Okay, we may never be able to control the weather, or predict earthquakes, but that does not mean that we should throw our hands up in the air and say 'this is too hard'.	While I may be taking a swipe at creation scientists here, I would also take a swipe at the atheists who claim that there is no God. The reason I say that is because there seems to be a fear within the scientific community that suggests that we may not be able to know everything, or that our understanding of the universe may be wrong. The problem that arises is that if we throw the idea of God out of the window and claim that the universe came about by chance, then we deny the fact that we live in an incredibly ordered universe that we can learn and understand through the development of mathematical formulae. If a formulae turns out to be wrong, that does not mean that the universe will collapse in on itself – it won't – it just means that we have to go back to the drawing board and start over from scratch.11) Why are Creation Scientists so dogmatic	Why is it that some members of the scientific community insist that we must take the Bible literally? The Bible is not a scientific text, and it was never meant to be a scientific text. It is a theological text that tells us how we should live with one another and how we should view God. Science exists beyond the Bible, and neither contradicts the other. Okay, granted, God has intervened in this world and done things that break the laws of science, but doesn't he have a right to do that – he created the universe? However, what the Bible tells us is that God is a god of order, and if he is a god of order then does it not make sense that the universe that he created is an ordered universe?	So, maybe you are looking for a whiz bang conclusion to my exposition on this book, but all I can say is that what I have written above pretty much sums up what I have learnt from this book. In a nutshell (hey, this is me in a nutshell), all I can say is that what I have learnt from this book is that the world is an amazingly ordered place in which we live, and having now completed this book I am just as committed to my Christian faith as I ever was. However, if theoretical physics fascinates you, then this is certainly a book that you should give a read (though you have probably done that already).This review also appears on my blog. I have also commented on this book in my review on Interstellar."
6,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,5,"This is an absolutely magical book, both objectively and for me specifically. I first read it when I was about 9 or 10, and ever since I've assumed that I didn't understand a thing, and read it as a childish boast. Fast forward nearly twenty years, degree and PhD in physics in hand, and I decided to give it a proper read. Much to my surprise I found that the book had permeated my brain! I remembered a huge number of the explanations, and the book resonated with the way I've thought about physics my entire academic career - I think I took in a great deal more than I first thought!As a primer to physics (I would say modern physics, but the book is a little out of date) you really couldn't ask for anything better than this. Especially when it comes to cosmology, this is possibly the best popular physics book that I've ever read. It really is a classic for a reason. It's such a concise, understandable introduction to the field that I'm determined to get my girlfriend (a linguist with no real interest in physics) to read it. Not just because I think she'll understand it, but because I think she will enjoy it!One peculiarity of the text is Hawking returning to the concept of God (with a capital G) over and over again. In some ways this feels like a transitional text, marking the passing of the public generation for whom the church determined the order of all things, and the coming of the current, secular generation. Unlike other authors (looking at you, Dawkins) Hawking always does so in a way that feels respectful while also forcefully stating his scientific case. It's quite feat of writing, much like the rest of the work.You really should read this, it's fantastic."

If you know anything much about relativity or cosmology, it comes across as a potboiler, admittedly a well-written one with a great final sentence. I wasn't impressed.But... without it, we would never have had MC Hawking. If you haven't come across him, start with the lyrics to ""E = MC Hawking"". Then buy A Brief History of Rhyme."
8,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,3,"“The universe doesn't allow perfection.” ― Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time I know. I know. I both loved and hated this book. I definitely should never have read this book, cut the pages, opened the box, etc.. Somehow Stephen Hawking has written a book that gently fluffs the tail on Schrödinger's cat (or perhaps Schrödinger's cat is fluffing Dr. Hawking). Look, no doubt the guy is a genius and has a fantastic story (ALS, computer voice, nurses, Black Holes, strippers, movies, etc). My problem is the wussification of a large scientific narrative by one of Big “P” Physics primary scientists. Let someone else write a pop-GUT/Blackhole/Big Bang story. Let another writer do the pop-up Children's book with the scratch-n-sniff singularity, the rotating black hole, the pull-out universe.  I want Dr. Hawking doing smart stuff. Let Bill Bryson write the summary science. But it is too late for me. I already crossed the damn event horizon. I've just become entangled with his book, so my ""observer state"" now corresponds to the damn book and the damn book review being both five stars and 1 stars is no longer a possibility; my reader state is entangled or linked now with my own review so that the ""observation of the book review's state"" and the ""review's state"" correspond with each other. I am finished.Hey, now to go see some movies about blackholes and wormholes and assholes."
9,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321030-matthew,2,"Hawking is a brilliant physicist and a true expert in explaining highly complex aspects of our physical universe in terms that can be understood by most lay people.Where Hawking fails, in my opinion, is his hubris. He proceeds in to the realm of metaphysics and religion in several portions of this book. For instance, in his chapter on the ""arrow of time"", he states that, essentially, the universe can only move in one direction of time. It cannot go backwards. He also states that this limits the powers of God himself. Now, Hawking never qualifies those statements by defining ""God"". However, if he is talking about the Biblical God, how can you honestly think you're so intelligent as to place limits on a limitless being? If God is so powerful as to have created the universe and all the physical laws, why wouldn't he be powerful enough to change those laws any time he chooses? It is the same concept as a scientist creating a computer simulation of the universe. The scientist can, at any time during the simulation, alter the underlying framework of the simulation, effectively changing the physical laws that simulated universe operates under.Now, whether you believe in God or not, the mere fact that Hawking has the audacity to think he can assign limits on a limitless being should cause you some concern. Hawking, because of his fame and brilliance, is a man that people listen to when he speaks. That gives him immense power over the minds of his readers. He should be more careful in choosing his words.When Hawking sticks to his strengths, however, the book is second to none. Hawking truly has a gift of explaining the powerful forces that shape our lives in ways anyone can understand.If this book had been edited better, it would have received a few more stars from me, but I can't reward stubborn scientific pride resulting in false assumptions."
10,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"The main idea to take away from this book is that time has a clear direction. Entropy is the idea that the universe moves from highly ordered states to less ordered states. If you take the lid off a bottle of perfume, and leave it off for a few days the perfume will go from being highly ordered (all in the bottle) to highly disordered (all over the room). Hawking uses this idea to explain why travelling back in time is impossible. It requires very little energy to knock a glass over and smash it - but think of how much energy it would take to make the glass jump back into place - all of the bits perfectly back where they were prior to the glass breaking. It would be impossible - and that impossibility is what gives time its clear direction.Philosophically, I tend to feel that the book makes far too much of the Uncertainty Principle. But that is another story.This isn't the easiest book to read in the world and is probably the most bought science book of all time while also being the one most likely gave up on after a chapter or two - but it is a fascinating read all the same."

Being Indian, I loved this - because we are strong champions of cyclical time. Also, if time and space are both curved, it creates the possibility of jumping from one place and time to another; which is just delicious.(I bought a pirated edition of this book for 25 rupees from the roadside at Connaught Place in New Delhi.

But there are quite a few people, whose curiosity and desire to find out more, to explore the truths of this vast universe, never dies. They are always always on the lookout for answers to questions deemed unanswerable , and then to ask new questions , that one by one, fills the gap between us and the truth and makes our understanding of this universe and it's secrets a bit more clearer and deeper,  Stephen Hawking is one such blessed genius! In this book, Hawking familiarise us with the possible beginning of the universe or space-time , which is called the Big Bang Singularity, the Black Holes with extremely strong gravitational force so that even light can't escape from it, the reasons why we are at this time and space of the universe [ this might be because that the present condition, universe ( if there are other universes), and dimensions are the only configuration which allows the existence of intelligent beings like us who can observe and ask these questions], the long quest for a Grand Unification Theory ( that will explain the whole universe completely ) which still continues, and so many more fascinating and incredible stuff. The writing style is highly enjoyable, Hawking is a great teacher and a wonderful writer, his wit and engaging writing makes me forget that I'm reading a scientific book!

The remarkable author leads the reader on a journey from the earliest premises of the ancient astronomers right up to black holes and white dwarves, and the latest thinking on the future of the universe. He appears to have escaped the vast egos that led the likes of Isaac Newton to discredit their rivals, and gives credit to the work of others where due. At a time when more information is available to more people than ever before, reading a book like this reminds you that understanding still requires effort, and that passive access to information is of only relative worth by itself.

Rest In Peace Mr. Hawking, and Thank You
During my time with this text, I made a comment alongside the percentage update I have for books I'm reading on goodreads. I said it was a strange experience to be reading an important and well loved book, only to have the author pass away during the time of said reading. To add to this, I was actually given this book years ago by someone close, and I never made a full start on it until now. So it was as equally saddening as it was surreal when I woke up on the 14th March 2018 to hear Steven Hawking had died. I immediately looked at my copy of A Brief History of Time and settled on finishing it as soon as possible (it had been slow going until then).Although I intend to be honest about my experience with this title, I actually want to make a separate statement regarding whether the average persons decision making process should lean more toward the positive end of the spectrum when considering this book. Having just finshed A Brief History of Time, I personally believe it's everyone's duty to pick this text up, engage with it, and carry through with it until the last page. Coming from the position of a lay person with no background in Science (unless you include working on a fundraising team at the Institute of Cancer Research for two months. . . I personally think that's scraping the barrel) or Psychics, I found this hard to comprehended in places. In fact, the chapter on elementary particles murdered me. So much so, that my reading really slowed down toward the end of the book, even after learning of Mr. Hawkings death. Not only this, but just conceptualising some of the topics being explained was a nightmare for me at times. Believe me, you don't realise how much you rely on the above ability to carry you through a book, until you come across one that requires you to abandon said ability altogether and just 'role' with the topic at hand, knowing full well you're completley out of your imagination processing league.Yet, despite the above said, I simply cannot lessen my high level of recommendation toward this book. I wish I'd read it when I was younger, as it provides some of the most important foundations to understanding our universe, and, as Mr. Hawkings mentions in the final chapter, science moves so fast that it's next to impossible for the many uninitiated individuals such as myself to understand what's new. So having books like this that really try to make the basic foundations of these huge topics understandable is a gift. For that I am immensely grateful toward the author, and I look forward to presenting this to my child when they're old enough to being to grasp these concepts (I mean, It's not really like any of us really can, but I won't tell him/her that).On a side note, there are moments where the ideas broached upon in this book might mess with your head. Case and point: at times, I found myself staring deeply into my hand- followed by my book- on multiple occasions, trying to comprehend that whilst I was staring at two completely different objects, they were ultimatley made up of the same stuff (at the micro level of course). It caused some odd stares on the tube more than once. Especially whenever my eyes widened at the thought I might also be staring at a different dimension I'm simply unable to comprehend or see. Something I'm sure you'll inevitably do as well if you really drink the quantum kool aid."

Cosmology is not an easy subject neither can everyone understand its deep connotations. Hawkings made it understandable in the most layman terms possible."
24,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,4,"Wow, what a book. So comprehensive, yet written in laymens terms and cranking up the technical information with each chapter, so you don't feel completely lost. By the time you reach quantum mechanics and string theory you almost feel like you know what's happening. Okay, so you still have no idea how any of it works, but that's alright. I've never felt compelled to read this. A book about space and physics is not my go to reading material and all of it sounds way over my head. However, it's such a well known science classic that I think a lot of people still have it on their tbr list. One for later. I wish I'd read this before and hadn't been so afraid of the science. It was easily digestible, broken into smallish chapters and often recapped previous topics, to help them really sink in. I still don't understand how black holes work, or how the universe was made, but neither does anyone for sure. I'm glad that others do the hard work to try to find out though. "
25,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7521704-mustafa-ahmad,5,"I've always liked science. But, it has never really been easy to distinguish my favorite subject, as I really like them all, so science is on par with history and math and literature for me.But, after reading this book and the works of Brian Greene, as well as numerous other popular books on physics, I have seen science in an entirely different light. If people could still produce intelligent books such as this one, then our world might actually be a fairly pleasant one. I'm not saying that we're all geniuses and can come up with our own mathematical theorems, but we should get a fairly good grasp of scientific ideas. This book, in short, takes a look at various positions on time throughout scientific history, ranging from Aristotle and Newton's idea of absolute time and space to Einstein's general theory of relativity.It's a bit of a dense read, so you'll have to read it carefully."
26,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,3,"All I can really tell you with certainty is 'A Brief History of Time' is very logically organized, but as each chapter described a series of linked discoveries and what it all meant, unfortunately it mostly was still opaque to me. Topics are introduced logically as Stephen Hawking describes in plain English the discoveries of scientists. He usually begins with observable phenomena which have led to verified maths (not actually detailed) demonstrating very likely how the Universe, and presumably Time with it, came into existence. Hawking does not detail the math in 'A Brief History of Time', but he tries to explain the significance of the observations. The Universe operates in a manner which can be predicted once the math formulas are sussed out from the objects being observed, or at least the side effect of an unseen act can be observed. Each discovery builds on older discoveries, which leads to more knowledge. I can tell I grasped only the surface of how each discovery led to a more holistic understanding of many separate ideas from many separate pieces. I do understand the bare bones of Hawking’s description of an experiment or observation, and I see vaguely how scientists have ultimately fitted it into the narrative of astrophysics.To me, it seems like each scientist was figuratively designing a personal knitted pattern for an afghan square (observation, experiment and math), which is ultimately tried on to fit into a larger, but incomplete, afghan of many other formerly disparate squares, placing it where to the scientists' best judgement the square seems to work out (or sometimes not, and sometimes the mismatched piece has to be unraveled and redesigned, or moved elsewhere). But I have difficulty in understanding some of the individual designs of the pieces, and I don't know sometimes why scientists have decided this piece must fit there in that location; however, I understand the ultimate description of conclusions reached which have been the result from the fit of the pieces. I can see Astronomy is where everything learned since the Ancient Greeks, but especially from the discoveries of Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein, has been like adding cars to a train engine, delivering more and more understanding about the size of the universe, its age, its chemistry and its elements, and how stars and galaxies came into being from a variety of small elemental particles responding to forces; all of which shockingly behave in a manner which can be mathematically described and reproduced.Sadly, I understood only half of the book despite reading it cover to cover and studying the included illustrations, and referring again and again to the included glossary and index in back. Kidding! No, not. Actually I'm not kidding. Reading this did not cause my brain to fizz, or jizz. (Give me a break gentlemen readers and other Goodreads reviewers! This book gave some of you guys the same mental thrills of, quote, “hard ons”!?!? Really. REALLY? And here I am, my brain being juiced into images of knitting afghan squares! I missed something huge in my understanding, for sure.)Instead, for me, thinking about the material was like being in a state of inebriation and working hard to connect sentences into a coherent communication, but it was worth the read somewhat as it filled in some blanks far more clearly than I have seen before! Hawking has a gentle humor throughout, especially in including God's absence after the winding of clocks and universes. But I think without having taken significant science and math studies in high school, or better yet, in college, this book is not simple or complete enough. It is sort of a partial introduction to astronomy, and it discusses a few physics concepts - the bits that lead to a discussion of gravity, the Big Bang, black holes, dimensions, time travel, wormholes, the 'arrow of time' which is also about boundaries and the shape of the Universe (I got lost in the theoretical concept of a round surface of a ball shaping the direction of Time like the moon orbiting the earth) and unifying the two major sciences of physics (classical and quantum) through string theories - so the book often was over my head in describing astrophysic concepts and discoveries. I know I could not pick out which concepts are supposed to be describing actual physical shapes or processes from otherwise imaginary thought concepts but impossible to reproduce in physical form. For example, the discussion on Time - Time is not something any human can see, so I don't get the Time arrow discussion in the book hardly at all. Time is possibly some kind of force going in a circle, maybe, or maybe not, depending on what is ultimately the Universe's 'boundary'? Frankly, I was completely lost in this chapter!I estimate I understood 70 pages out of 200, gentle reader."
27,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266234-7jane,4,"Finally managed to finish this; I think having a reading space quiet enough helped. Here, Hawking talks about such things as the beginning of time, black holes, string theories, dimensions, wormholes and time-travel - things of the universe, and where things are going. There is no Carl Sagan introduction in my version, but there are some newer things included that weren't in the original but have been 'found' since then, like a flavor of quark (top), and new findings in string theory, which are easy to notice because of the time mentioned.(what's with God popping up here and there? 8) )Throughout there are some helpful figure-pictures, though some would benefit for being made a bit sharper (more readable). And at the end there is glossary plus three short biographies (Einstein, Newton, Galilei - learned something new things about each in there).This has been a huge seller of a book, and I can see why. It is said in pretty understandable language for many average person's to understand, though no doubt some of it might go over one's head, at least for someone of average intelligence-level, like me (haha). But I feel that I got more out of it than when I first started it (leaving it unfinished until this moment). Some of it reminded me on the ""Interstellar"" movie (I liked it, so...), and I feel like watching it again. I did learn many interesting things from my reading, let some whoosh over my head, and consider this a good reading adventure."

This book is free from mathematical equations (except E=mc2) which is the best thing about the book. This book is so simple that even a lay person with basic knowledge of science can understand it. Stephen Hawking, the author of the book, is one of the well renowned scientists of the century after Einstein. Some people even called him the successor of Einstein due to his work in the field of science. In this book, Hawking talks about black holes, worm holes, time travel, cosmic background radiation (CBM), uncertainty principle, expansion of universe, space and time (or simply space-time), origin and fate of the universe, forces of nature and the most important The Grand Unification Theory (the theory of everything) which is the biggest unsolved mystery of the present time. This book is really amazing and is popular in both science and non-science related people. I enjoy it a lot and I would like to recommend it to all the science and nature loving people.

30,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/724958,5,"It was while reading this that I finally had an ""aha"" moment about why it is that observation can change what you're trying to observe. I was always kind of skeptical of this, because I was wondering ""what is it that our eyes do that could possibly affect things?"" Stephen Hawking set me straight: it's the tiny speck of light that you have to shoot at what you're trying to observe that affects it. Light bulb is on!I have an interest in physics, and I have read quite a few books for the layman about recent physics and cosmology - string theory, the big bang, hyperspace. So I wasn't sure whether I would end up learning something new when I finally got the chance to read this. But it was full of light-bulb moments like the one above - things that I had been wondering about but had never been described in a low-level, concrete sort of way that would make sense for me.Hawking's writing style made this book a wonderful experience, with a friendly, interested tone that brings the reader in while also expressing his own excitement about the topics. It's a good mix of historical notes, explanations of what exactly went on in the experimental work of science, and also what the implications of those developments are in the big picture - not just the big picture of physics and science, but what developments in physics mean for us as human beings and our understanding of the world around us.The only weak part of this book, that left me scratching my head and unable to visualize instead of visualizing and getting it for the first time, were the chapters on subatomic particles. Concepts like spin and what exactly antiparticles ARE in a concrete sense (and how they interact with the particles we are familiar with), are still beyond me after this book, but I'm not sure if that's a weakness in Hawking's great power of explanation, or if it's inherent in those ideas themselves to be difficult!I would recommend this book to absolutely everyone with an interest in the world - you don't have to be a science specialist (I sure am not) or mathematically-inclined to follow it, and it is full of ideas that will make you think (and also understand a lot more of what people are talking about when they reference scientists and concepts from the past)."
31,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2368214-nawal,2,"This is a review of a non-technical reader.A very readable and entertaining introduction to recent developments in physics and cosmology, Hawking attempts to deal with questions that bothered the cosmic physics community 20 years ago:Is the universe finite or infinite in extent and content? Is it eternal or does it have a beginning? Was it created? If not, where did it come from? ? What governs the laws and constants of physics? Why is the universe the way it is? etc.Glossing over the key aspects of quantum physics and relativity, the eminent physicist managed to address gracefully concepts of gravity, black holes, the Big Bang, wormholes, the nature of time and physicists' search for a grand unifying theory, the M-theory. His explanations are simple, accurate, well-illustrated, and peppered with dotted humor and insights.It goes without saying that Stephen Hawking is one of the greatest scientists in history. Nevertheless when Hawking ceases to be a scientist, I'm bound to have some areas of disagreement, the book takes provocative and irrational jabs at both philosophy and religion in my opinion. for the very simple reason that Science, by its very nature, is never capable of proving the non-existence of anything.And Hawking can never accurately claim that science has proven God doesn't exist (or exist), that's a misuse of the discipline, and his opinion remains unjustified. And unless the argument is purely philosophical, his conclusion is bound to end up going nowhere.Hawking does not believe that the universe really came from nothing since gravity was there to do the creating, but where did gravity come from?!It seems that Hawking simply replacing one transcending cause (God) for another (gravity)!And if the universe came into being spontaneously from nothing, it could have had any sort of conceivable spatio-temporal configuration, since nothingness, has no properties or constraints and is governed by no physical laws?! This very particular spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, neither gravity nor any other law of physics provides a mechanism by which universe can be spontaneously created. The question Hawking never answered was why those laws of physics exist?!“So long as the universe had a beginning, we could suppose it had a creator. but if the universe is really completely self-contained, having no boundary or edge, it would have neither beginning nor end: it would simply be. What place, then, for a creator?”“[allowing] the possibility that space-time was finite but had no boundary, which means that it had no beginning, no moment of creation… If the no boundary proposal is correct, [God] had no freedom at all to choose initial conditions”Hawking simply fails to grasp the point when he thinks a lack of creation has any effect on the existence of God. Even if the universe has no beginning and no ending ""no boundaries at all and is entirely self-contained"" It still fails to account for how it came to be. Who’s making up stories now?(view spoiler)[ Some scientists (Hawking included) define the range of questions that science is permitted to ask in such a way that God is excluded from the start, and then they claim that God is unnecessary, and doesn't exist for the simple reason that their science cannot answer that question.It seems to me that much of Hawking's rationale lies in the idea of a deep-seated conflict between science and religion, But my truth is that science, philosophy and spirituality, rather than addressing similar ground, speak to very different realms of human experience and have the potential to coexist in peace, complementing rather than constantly battling each other.  (hide spoiler)]And regarding ""God having no free will"" in choosing the initial conditions, Hawking clearly dismisses the fact that if God is the one who designed the rules it is illogical to state that he is confined by a certain limit. One may observe a universe in which it appears as though God is limited by certain conditions, and yet we only perceive this to be the case because God instituted those specific conditions.Our understanding of physics Is not really sufficient to conclude that we know everything necessary to explain the existence of everything!"
32,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/542037-annalisa,4,"Disclaimer: I love math and physics and books that make me feel stupid, as in they are that intelligent. It was interesting learning about the development of science as it refers to the way we think about the universe and how scientific discoveries have been influenced and influence the way people think about God. My favorite section was the discussion of black holes and antimatter. At times Hawking lost me. He wants to explain theory to the masses, but as he draws near to his own theory, he got excited and zoomed along, forgetting that us simpletons haven't memorized the ten theories he's building upon that he's given us a brief overview about. When I had to listen to a theory a few times or try to remember exactly what the uncertainty principle or thermodynamic arrow of time is, it was harder to take a mental pause in audio form, but had I been reading a physical book, I would have fallen asleep every few minutes. It's a book to make your brain hurt, maybe less so if you've recently taken an advanced physics class.Nevertheless, it was fascinating and gives you much to mull over, especially about how little man knows about the laws governing the universe when he can only observe effects and describe them. The further theories develop, the more I am left to question the givens they take from other theories. "
33,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16092014-paul,4,"I've owned this book for some time, and with Hawking's death last month, it seemed appropriate to finally crack it open to see if I could understand any of it.I was pleasantly surprised to find I was able to digest maybe 75 percent of it, which is pretty good for me and astrophysics. Hawking does an excellent job of breaking down some of universe's hardest concepts to grasp, and if I still couldn't wrap my mind around the notion of imaginary time and remembering the future, it's not his fault. I'm sure there are more updated versions of the story Hawking tells – the history of the cornerstone theories of gravity and relativity and the discovery of black holes and rise of quantum mechanics – but this is clearly a foundational text, a standard those other books must attempt to meet. I feel I now appreciate much better not only Hawking's impact as a scientist but his impact as a writer and ambassador of science. Well worth reading."

35,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,3,"It is difficult to judge such a classic on the history and the nature of our universe, especially as a non-physicist. I can only say that Hawking had an incredibly smooth pen, was able to convey infinitely complex and theoretical views in a very comprehensible way and could even add a touch of humor. This book originally dates from 1988, was reworked in 1996 and in 2017 an appendix was added in which Hawking briefly discusses the discoveries of the past 20 years.Since he himself played a major role in the development of the ideas about the origin and evolution of our universe, this book is also partly apologetic: Hawking highlights his own contributions, and also defends propositions he has launched at the time (such as the 'no boundary theory’ about the beginning and end of our universe). But he is not afraid to admit that he has regularly been mistaken, and often had to adjust his opinion. In this way he shows how real science works and always gives a provisional state of affairs. Only the really big ones, Nobel Prize or not, are capable of that!"

37,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6970638-sheri,4,"So I read his autobiography last fall and realized that I probably should read A Brief History if only to give myself some better background for sci-fi novels.I followed some of the arguments and felt like I learned a bit more about both the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics and why both are necessary. I really had not realized that relativity does not allow for gravity. What? I mean, really, how is it that the most widely known piece of physics leaves out the most readily understood force. We all know that gravity exists, we all ""understand"" how it works; I did not realize that relatively did not account for it (but now I kind of get it).I was disappointed that Hawking felt the need to bring God into things. I guess I understand that physicists are asked about the ""ultimate creator"" of the universe, but I also tend to get my bristles up a bit. I felt like Hawking was pandering to the religious (and not offending the vast majority of the population for whom religion is important) rather than more obviously stating that God is hogwash. If he was not going to just come out and say it, I would have rather he did not allude to the different possibilities of the existence of Santa Claus.He lost me for a bit in the chapter on string theory. I get that this stuff is way beyond ""physics for dummies"", but I think it would have been better to leave it out than to lapse into technical explanations that leave the lay reader rather cold. At times, I felt like a 3 year old at the park with a negligent babysitter; I would have liked to have a more attentive guide to the deep reaches of space.Overall, I felt like I learned a bit and Hawking is fairly understandable. I must agree with other reviewers, though in that he seems to wander off into the less comprehensible at times, without really grasping that lay readers may not be following. "

It was a great book, though, hands down. Stephen Hawking is a great professor. He's inexplicably intelligent and has this amazing skill to teach, two characteristics that are both needed and that are rarely found in most educators. In fact, he does more than teach, he communicates. Despite his condition, he is a man to be greatly admired. And even if I didn't ""get"" the contents of the book one hundred percent, I'm sure I picked up more than enough details that could help me along the way.P.S.Thanks to Hawking, I am now aware that Isaac Newton, despite being a scientist knight and all, is a complete jerk.Rest in piece, Mr. Hawking."

I have to say, Stephen Hawking's book is rather more technical and a bit less charismatic but still deeply fascinating. Astrophysics seems to be a field where creativity, humor, intellect, and morality are ideally melded together. I learned so much reading this book, and I continue to be inspired to learn more about the universe and everything it contains.

The individual words are simple but the concepts described in this book are vey thought-provoking but very complicated. Actually, everything was going pretty well until Chapter 8: The Origin and Fate of the Universe, primarily because we really don't know what the real answer is so there's a lot of speculation and conflicting theories. One of the crazy things I enjoyed learning is how forces are actually caused by particles, the exchange of these particles makes changes in the speed and position of the bodies exchanging them. For example, graviton is the particle that makes gravity happen, which is very weak but it works in long range. Compared to other forces, like forces in the nucleus of atoms that are heavy particles that work in very short distances. I wish he would've explained a little more about this, it left me hanging thinking about how are attractive and repulsive forces different. Also, the fact that you have to spin a graviton twice for it to look the same is bind-blowing.Talking about time is really complicated but one of my favorite questions was: if space-time is a continuum, why do we remember the past but not the future? Overall a good read but he lost me by the end. The fact that all attempts at a unification of physics haven't succeeded worries me. Specially if they've been able to unify all theories except for gravity. GRAVITY! The single most important force that made the galaxies, stars, planets, and the universe as we know it. "

The thing about reading something by Stephen Hawking is that by the time you're finished with the book, you're hooked. Few scientists manage to inspire their passion for their field in their readers as he does, in fact it was thanks to Stephen Hawking that I almost pursued a career in physics (but that's another story).A Brief History of time is, in a way, the precursor to all Hawking's other books written for the general public, which include The Universe in a Nutshell and, my personal favourite The Grand Design. In one manner, it's ""gentler"" than his other books, in the sense that he takes your hand as a reader and calmly guides you through the physics, all the while avoiding confusing you with the gritty maths (which would have made his job considerably easier). Yet that doesn't dull the book down for the ""experienced"" reader who has some experience in the subject, in fact what is more ambiguous in other book becomes clear here.A Brief History of Time is the perfect title for this book. Because Stephen Hawking is not just rambling on about the universe; he is telling a story. In fact he's telling THE Story: the tale of the universe where every other tale imaginable dwells. Stephen Hawking explains the complicated in a simple way, elevating the reader to his intelligence. He also offers a fair deal of background information on the scientists he mentions, making them individuals and not just names that come before a theorem. And if you read attentively enough you get a precious glance at his wonderful wit.Why is this such a good book? Because by the time you reach the conclusion, you'd be asking for more."

Although Stephen hawking has tried to present his views to the reader but in a way that most of the readers would find it intimidating. My assumption is that this book was written for the layman(may be layman cum professionals) but the things discussed in the book cant be for professionals as all material can be found in the textbooks of cosmology. But for layman it is too unreachable. My review may be a little bit critique. When one starts reading one assumes that book will be interesting because of an story of an old woman but as reader progress through pages it seems like reader collapse into the black hole of Theoretical Physics, Quantum Mechanics and Electromagnetism. I have special interest in physics since my childhood but since my college days i have steadily drifted apart from physics and have remain out of touch I just lost concentration during reading had to reread many times to understand some concrete concepts for book repeatedly plunges into unnecessary details. Stephen Hawking death 2 days ago prompted me to read this book this man has so much respect that despite his hard to understand books he was oversold author and he definitely need to be read and understood for his discoveries and ideas have many implications for the future of cosmology. IF somebody want to buy and read this very famous book one should keep in mind here were are talking about serious research and professional stuff not a light science fiction type book"

But it does so in a way that is impossible to calculate for an organism that is as complicated as a human being. The reason we say that humans have free will is because we can't predict what they will do.” Este es un libro que tenía mucho tiempo queriendo leer y aprovechando que entraba dentro del challenge... y que encontré un paquete de 4 libros de Hawking muy baratos, pues bienvenidos sean. la gran dificultad que tuve es que el autor no se amedrenta al hablar de la temática a través de algunas fórmulas y conceptos complejos, frente al lector no especializado... y si lo haces en un idioma en el que no eres nativo (leído en inglés) le agrega un factor de dificultad interesante jajaja  “The universe doesn't allow perfection.” Es un libro que explica de una manera un tanto ""sencilla"" (tanto como se pueda) conceptos como la teórica cuántica, la teoría de cuerdas y los diversos hoyos negros (notar que no solo hay de un tipo), de la mano de una mente altamente organizada como la del Dr. Hawking. y lo genial es que en medio de su texto te cuenta los múltiples errores que el encontró en su desarrollo intelectual, recordándole al lector que los errores también son un paso valioso para saber más y poder aportar... vamos, no tener miedo por los mismos.“If time travel is possible, where are the tourists from the future?” Es un libro que invita a las grandes preguntas, de los ¿por qué? y no solo quedarnos en el ¿cómo? una cosa que me hace bajarle un poco la puntuación, es que no es un libro de divulgación para todo el mundo, ya que entra de lleno con temas complejos, que alguien al que le gustan este tipo de literatura le parece genial, pero para un nuevo lector será algo difícil. muy recomendable para todo aquel que quiera adentrase más al mundo del conocimiento del universo, y que no le tenga miedo a usar un poco (más de lo normal) la cabeza para lograrlo."
52,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25605420-apoorva,4,"'A Brief History of Time' is a book about Cosmology. Here's what you are going to learn from this book- how universe looks like, ideas of various philosophers on the universe like location of sun,planets, stars and scientific view of the universe; the space and time- idea of absolute rest and absolute position, laws of gravity; Einstein's theory of relativity; the expanding universe using Doppler shift; the uncertainty principle, wave theory and quantum theory of light, interference; elementary particles which make up matter in the universe, different types of forces such as gravitational, electromagnetic, nuclear; black holes and it's explanation using law of thermodynamics; the origin and fate of universe; concept of time; wormholes and the idea of time travel.The book uses theoretical concepts and mathematical equations to explain the various concepts. The book is written in simple language and is easy to understand. The use of various illustrations and diagrams makes it more interesting. The most important quality of this book is it's simplicity, even the complex ideas are explained using everyday examples. It's short and informative. The writer has used humor at various places to describe the ideas which I loved otherwise it'd be boring. It gives a clear picture of how the views on universe have changed with discovery of new information and proposition of new theories. The writer describes the works of the most prominent scientists. He himself tries to find nature of God and he makes some arguments for His existence. The quest for finding of a theory that will explain all the phenomena in universe is still going on. The universe is vast and complex and is very difficult to understand. Maybe we'll understand it someday. All in all, I really enjoyed reading this book. If you're looking for a quick and informative read, pick up this book."
53,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9822645-jon,4,"I would like to say that this was an easy book to read and that I understood all the concepts, but it's been quite a while since I took a physics class and Hawking delves into some of the more exotic aspects of theoretical physics in this book. Take this description of string theory:""A particle occupies one point of space at each instant of time. Thus it's history can be represented by a line in space-time (the ""world-line""). A string, on the other hand, occupies a line in space at each moment of time. So it's history in space-time is a two-dimensional surface called the world-sheet. (Any point on such a world-sheet can be described by two numbers: one specifying the time and the other the position of the point on the string.) The world-sheet of an open string is a strip: it's edges represent the paths through space-time of the ends of the string. The world-sheet of a closed string is a cylinder or tube; a slice through the tube is a circle, which represents the position of the string at one particular time""I'm fairly bright, but there were more than a few times when I was a little lost and unable to follow the thread of what Hawking was explaining. This had more to do with the concepts that Hawking brings up instead of a problem with his actual writing. In the book, Hawking tries to explain dense and complex theories in way that someone without an advanced Physics degree can understand. For the most part, he's sucessful and the book touches on a variety of concepts: the uncertainty principle, elementary particles, black holes, and the origin and fate of the universe. More often than not, the book is fascinating and the concepts understandble. I'd definitely recommend the book to anyone looking for something a little challenging to read."

This book made me feel like one of the ' whos ' from ' Horton hears a Who ' 🤔 The book also has pages on Einstein, Newton and Galileo. It's written brilliantly. Surely you have to read this book by the Einstein of our era.IF you remember every word in this book, your memory will have recorded about two million pieces of information: the order in your brain will have increased by about two million units. However, while you have been reading the book, you will have converted at least a thousand calories of ordered energy, in the form of food, into disordered energy, in the form of heat that you lose to the air around you by convection and sweat. This will increase the disorder of the universe by about twenty million million million million units - or about ten million million million times the increase in order in your brain - and that's if you remember everything in this book ☝️ See the quote above??

The parts on black holes, worm holes, space time, time's arrow, and whether it's possible to time travel were those - how cool!Then there were a few parts I struggled to wrap my head around. Namely the quantum gravity theory of the beginning (or lack of a beginning) of the universe - no boundary, no singularity... I couldn't picture what there was. Or was he saying it doesn't matter what there was? Overall I'd recommend this to most people. You may not get it all - or maybe you will, who knows! - but it was an enjoyable, informative read overall. I liked the spots of humour and personal stories that interspersed the science.

59,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20772420-afkham,5,"I was looking for this book for a long time, and even more eager ever since I’ve watched James Marsh‘s movie, “the theory of everything”. And now I can take a deep breath and enjoy myself with this fine feeling of having done with an onerous task of my life. Obviously I fell in love with the book and all the detailed description of modern physics’ theories. I remember when I was in middle school (which coincides the publication date of this version of the book) an astute friend of mine used to discuss about relativity and four dimensional universe and though I enjoyed the subject it was almost the last time I tried cosmology related books. I guess I will do it more often from now on.And about the book:Hawking tried to describe all the important theories of modern physics as simple, brief and apprehensible as possible to common readership. His triumph is admitted by sales!He started with classic theories, then the revolutionizing relativity and then its flaws proved by the uncertainty principle. Now we find ourselves with the interesting subject on black holes and the possibility of time traveling and then with way more complicated mathematical theories related to quantum mechanics and the quantum theory of gravity suggested by Hawking himself, and even the latest and most baffling of them all the string theory. I suppose ever since the publication of this book they advanced even more rapidly and staggeringly. I categorized this also as a philosophic book with regard to its notes to God’s role in creation. Though it seems that Hawking doesn't believe if there’s any. He was criticized a lot about his language regarding the god and I heard he changed his tone in his later publications. I should see that for myself but for now I’d like to mention some quotes in this regard:“One could say that free will is an illusion anyway. If there really is a complete unified theory that governs everything, it presumably also determines your actions. But it does so in a way that is impossible to calculate for an organism that is as complicated as a human being. The reason we say that humans have free will is because we can’t predict what they will do. However, if the human then goes off in a rocket ship and comes back before he or she set off, we will be able to predict what he or she will do because it will be part of recorded history. Thus, in that situation, the time traveler would have no free will.”“We find ourselves in a bewildering world. We want to make sense of what we see around us and to ask: What is the nature of the universe? What is our place in it and where did it and we come from? Why is it the way it is?”""When we combine quantum mechanics with general relativity, there seems to be a new possibility that did not arise before: that space and time together might form a finite, four-dimensional space without singularities or boundaries, like the surface of the earth but with more dimensions. It seems that this idea could explain many of the observed features of the universe, such as its large-scale uniformity and also the smaller-scale departures from homogeneity, like galaxies, stars, and even human beings. It could even account for the arrow of time that we observe. But if the universe is completely self-contained, with no singularities or boundaries, and completely described by a unified theory, that has profound implications for the role of God as Creator.""""Einstein once asked the question: “How much choice did God have in constructing the universe?” If the no boundary proposal is correct, he had no freedom at all to choose initial conditions. He would, of course, still have had the freedom to choose the laws that the universe obeyed. This, however, may not really have been all that much of a choice; there may well be only one, or a small number, of complete unified theories, such as the heterotic string theory, that are self-consistent and allow the existence of structures as complicated as human beings who can investigate the laws of the universe and ask about the nature of God.""""Up to now, most scientists have been too occupied with the development of new theories that describe what the universe is to ask the question why. On the other hand, the people whose business it is to ask why, the philosophers, have not been able to keep up with the advance of scientific theories. In the eighteenth century, philosophers considered the whole of human knowledge, including science, to be their field and discussed questions such as: did the universe have a beginning? However, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, science became too technical and mathematical for the philosophers, or anyone else except a few specialists.Philosophers reduced the scope of their inquiries so much that Wittgenstein, the most famous philosopher of this century, said, “The sole remaining task for philosophy is the analysis of language.” What a comedown from the great tradition of philosophy from Aristotle to Kant!""""However, if we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason – for then we would know the mind of God."""

Won't say Hawking explains as, say, a high school or college textbook would, and I certainly have seen more straightforward graphs, but I managed. Confusion rolls in in Chapter 9 when he brings forth the three time arrows.Think of the everyday challenges Hawking faced: writing this, communicating with lawyers, publishers, and who-not, going back and forth to ""dumb his complicated baby down"" to cater to the general public... all with the help of a machine. Can you IMAGINE how abstruse his original script would be like? Really.Comparing Hawking to other physicists who have made more groundbreaking impact, I finished this book thinking that Hawking is a little over-celebrated for his high-profile prolonged battle with ALS than his achievements in physics. After all, a guy confined to his wheelchair while in his head he dances among the stars paints a beautiful picture for humanity.This book is supposedly written for people with little knowledge of quantum physics, I don't think he nailed it.

His writing is very simple and to the point, considering it’s covering a very complex topic!I can’t lie and say that I’ve understood everything in it, some theories & concepts were like talking gibberish .. some concepts like (imaginary numbers, spins, the string theory , the universe with 10 or 26 dimensions) were just too complicated for me! The parts that you will disagree with the writer about, will be those related to his comments on God. However, for me ( as a believer in God’s omnipotent) I’ll share this excerpt:“However, if we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists.

The book starts of with the ancients and carries us through to more modern times. I really enjoyed the first chapter because it covered ground I was familiar with from previous history and science classes. After that, it was a learning adventure.

I fancy myself quite the Physics nerd. I might not be able to mathematically derive the equation for the quantum Harmonic Oscillator but I am still well versed with the theories and the concept.A Brief History of Time is not an easy book for a layperson. You need atleast some background on newtonion physics, general relativity, special relativity and quantum mechanics. I am an Engineer, not a very good one but I did study Physics rather diligently as it was my favourite subject. Plus I watch way too many documentaries and spend too much time sliping into the Wikipedia wormhole. One link to the next to the next to the next. We have all been there. I already knew most of the things. Mr Hawking did very good in summarising mankind's developing understanding of time and the universe. Fascinating occasionally but most of the time....this book was boring AF.I am sure there are plenty of books out there that would teach the same things as this one in a much simpler and engaging way. You don't want to be introduced to Hezeinberg's Uncertainty Principle through this book, take my word for it. It was hard to go through it because I kept falling asleep on it. I have been using it to make myself go to bed on time. Guys, I am not kidding. I am not guys. Listen to me.What a misleading caption on the cover page. This book marries a child's intellect (mine) with a genius' wonder (Stephen Hawking), not the other way around. The relationship had no spark. No Passion. There was almost a divorce.

75,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites,4,"A friend of mine loves this book and has read it more than once. Reassuring, since like me, she doesn't hold a doctorate in the sciences! In fact, as someone who used to do a lot of science reading--I read many a astronomy book by Isaac Asimov and Carl Sagan once upon a time--most of the concepts here were very familiar. Well, until we reached the very weird land of quantum mechanics and string theory and imaginary numbers, where I admit I was pretty lost. Hawking gives the history of the science surrounding the ultimate questions of the universe starting from the arguments of Aristotle in 340 B.C. for a round earth to the very strange land of today's physics of quantum mechanics with its different colored quarks and antimatter on the micro level and the strange interstellar beasties of relativistic physics of dark matter, black holes, quasars, and neutron stars and the very weird string theory that might unite both. I do think his explanations are lucid and elegant. I can't remember a better description of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity by explaining its historic relationship to Newton and how the theory tried to answer questions about the relationship between space and time. And Hawking manages to explain some sophisticated concepts without loading the book with jargon or equations. Hawking was also great at explaining how the theory of Relativity fits--or rather doesn't fit--with Quantum Mechanics and the search for a theory that could unify them both. I'm not saying I understood everything in the book. The concepts are counter-intuitive and hard to digest, and there's only so far you can go in explaining difficult subjects in simple terms to people lacking the background. But I understood it better, and certainly got the implications Hawking spelled out. About the only stylistic quirk I had an issue with was Hawkings refusal to use the B-word. (A Briticism?). I find it a lot easier to wrap my mind around ten billion than ""ten thousand million."" The edition I read was written in 1996, updated from the first edition from 1988 which was a enormous bestseller. In the Foreword to that revised edition, Hawking wrote he thought that ""within a few years we should know whether we can believe that we live in a universe that is completely self-contained and without beginning or end."" Hawking definitely leaves me wanting to read more to find out the verdict. Worth reading, although not always easy to grasp."
76,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16487011-joseph-inzirillo,4,"To start...Why only 4 stars? I think the main reason is due to my own ignorance. Most people don't care about Theoretical Physics. As soon as they see the math involved they run. I am one of those people who ran, except I am still interested in the field. I ran instead to people like Neil Degrasse Tyson, Brian Greene and Michio Kaku. What this tells you is that I only know as much as I have learned from a few books, the internet and the Science Channel. Compared to Hawking, I am an absolute moron... So consider the 5th Star withheld in honor of Hawking's intellect. Kind of like pouring out a drink for a fallen Homie. 4 for your book and 1 for your genius...This book breaks down into laymen's terms everything from Aristotle to the beginnings of string theory. The implications of half of the things he says are staggering and some are enough to break your very core beliefs about life. This is an ingenious work that will be followed by me reading the other two books I own by Hawking. (Although the next Hawking book I read may be accompanied by a note pad to jot down things I need to Google later...) Hawking in and of himself is a testament to anyone who was ever told no or that they can't. Hawking was told in 1965 that he had two years before the ALS killed him. That would have been in 1967---48 Years Ago!!! And so, instead, Hawking has challenged science on multiple occasions and pioneered everything we know about Black Holes. As his body deteriorated, his brain ramped up and produced even more amazing works. The man has been before the Pope to discuss science!!! Hawking is an unbelievable human being with a horrible disease that has never once stopped him. We could learn something from that....If you have not read this yet, do so. It doesn't matter if you like science. It is something we should all read at some point in our lives..."

I am a student of commerce stream and after tenth standard I never studied Physics and in fact I was not interested in Physics . It all began when I watched 'X-Men : Days Of Future Past' , one of my most favourite films and a real life incedent . These two things piqued my curiosity in Physics and me and my best friend talked about different theories and aspects of Physics since then . If you are interested in Physics and you really want to understand ""from big bangs to black holes"" (and certainly my all time favourite - time travel) then I don't think you can get a batter book than 'A Brief History Of Time' . The book consists many different theories about very basic concepts like time , space , black holes , light , origin and fate of the universe . Stephen Hawking wonderfully explains the theories and also their evolution with time . I especially liked the way he describes the different takes on the shape and structure of the universe . The way he described the light cones was also great . Though book deals with Physics yet it each of the topics are explained so easily with examples which helps in a batter understanding .A Wonderful Read . Perfect 5 Stars ."

A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawkingpublished: originally 1988, updated 1996, with appendix added 2017format: 220 page paperbackacquired: Aprilread: Apr 19-26rating: 4I bought this on my birthday with the idea my daughter might just read it with me - this is a very unlikely thing, but worth a shot. Anyway, it was sitting out and I suddenly found myself fascinated and decided to just read it. What did I gain from this? I'm not entirely sure. A lot of this I've read about before, although maybe never really understood well. I did have the feeling that I understood what he was saying, but just barely, and never enough to be critical of it, if that makes sense. But then, when I put it down and pick it back up, that flimsy understand sometimes wouldn't stick. So I just took it. I think I understand vaguely what NPR meant when the said scientists seems convinced we live in a flat universe. Hawking's in 1996 was a sphere of spacetime, where the big bang isn't a break down of physics, but just a pole along the sphere, like the north or south pole. Of course, that's an over-simplification and, of course, Hawking was up on the science and undermines some of this in his appendix. But, it's a cool idea anyway. "

While it is a fairly 'brief' account of The Universe as we know it, it would probably have taken me another week or more to actually read it as my inner science geek would have highlighted the heck out of this and reread many paragraphs of crazy numbers (i.e. How many years does it take a single proton to decay? At least 1,000,000 + 80 more zeros. That's longer than the Universe has been around) to try and begin to comprehend their significance. Since I'm long from trying to ace an exam, I just let the book 'speak' to me by British narrator Michael Jackson who gave much life to what some might deem an interesting but rather boring read. Trust me, with his regal accent and intonation, Mr. Jackson could describe paint drying and have you glued to his every word.While I won't remember the exact information from 95% of this book, the one thing I have taken is that we have come so far in the past century of math, physics, space, and science but we have barely scratched the surface of what life and The Universe is really all about.

Lists and tables would have helped The diagrams were simplified, but simplified scientifically, out of reach for me sometimes. I am grateful for the glossary and the micro bios of Galileo and Newton. The description of time being different for someone on the train tracks vs someone in the train makes sense, not too scientific. I wish that Hawking had had his students or even upper-division science students read this book so they could have made suggestions, some of which may have been taken. If the topic is too much for an upper-division student of science, then it is too much for those of us with basic college educations."

And I enjoyed going to each new chapter with the hope that I would understand the next chapter better than the last.I feel most readers will not be far into the book before they are almost totally lost with Mr. Hawking's line of thought.

Still I found it satisfying to refresh my memory of the spin of particles, the particle properties of light, black holes, infinite periods of time, and so on and so on. Uplifting.

For example, when Stephen Hawking talks about imaginary time or superstrings—or even the uncertainty principle, for that matter—what choice do I have but to take his words on faith?In fact, Hawking writes that “only a few people can keep up with the rapidly advancing frontier of knowledge, and they have to devote their whole time to it and specialize in a small area.” If your average PhD physicist doesn’t really understand cutting edge physics, then where does that leave regular people like us?So what is this book trying to accomplish? As a pop-science book, A Brief History of Time covers a lot of area—from black holes to the unification of physics. Naturally, its explanations are overly simple—and, if Hawking’ claim about the rapid advancement of knowledge is correct, likely already outdated. It appears, then, as if it's trying to accomplish the impossible.Yet there is something very powerful about this book. It’s not so much the writing style or the specific content, but more that a look—any look—into the mysterious world of contemporary physics, even a look that is dumbed-down or partially obsolete, is still mind-expanding.In his conclusion, Hawking makes a very pertinent observation:Up to now, most scientists have been too occupied with the development of new theories that describe what the universe is to ask to question why. On the other hand, the people whose business it is to ask why, the philosophers, have not been able to keep up with the advance of scientific theories. In the eighteenth century, philosophers considered the whole of human knowledge, including science, to be their field and discussed questions such as: did the universe have a beginning? However, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, science became too technical and mathematical for the philosophers, or anyone except a few specialists.Although we are living in an undeniably scientific society, we are incredibly ignorant of how it (science) really works. Most of us, for instance, still view physics in terms of classical mechanics—a theory that’s been dead for nearly 100 years.* What this means is that books like this one—pop-science books, general guides, etc.—are extremely important, if only to jolt us into the realization that the perceptions we have of science and the universe at large are most likely erroneous. No one is going to come away from reading A Brief History of Time with an understanding of physics—not even a general one. Nonetheless, Hawking succeeds in a very admirable task: he has taken something exceptionally complicated and exceedingly technical, and managed to show how fundamentally cool it is. Thank-you, Stephen.*Dead, as in it's no longer viable for making novel predictions. But I digress."

Even the student of physics may find the account interesting, and grasps the theories intuitively rather than mathematically. Space-Time FabricThe Big Bang Theory and the inflationary universe form the basis for exploring the frontiers of cosmology. And the search for a quantum theory of general relativity becomes the cosmologists’ goal to understand black holes, which will give insight into the nanoseconds during the Big Bang. Perhaps in understanding that period of time, physicists may unify the forces of nature and formulate The Theory of Everything. Simulation of a Black HoleThough we can find these cosmological concepts and theories in books and journals, Hawking presents them without all the mathematical hocus-pocus, so common men and women will understand the ideas behind the equations. Sure, there are some scientific jargons but they don’t overwhelm. And though the ideas have evolved since the book was published, the concepts provide the basis for understanding the challenges confronting cosmologists. I recommend the book for those who want a basic understanding of cosmology minus the differential equations and singularity points.Stephen Hawking"

""We find ourselves in a bewildering world. We want to make sense of what we see around us and to ask: What is the nature of the universe?""
The universe is about as big as the questions we have about it. I think everyone has had that moment of looking up into the sky and realising that there must be more out there. And once I came to that conclusion, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I picked A Brief History of Time up for the first time three years ago and it lead to an ongoing curiosity about the scientific things of cosmology and astronomy. In a language that is (relatively) easy to understand, Stephen Hawking summarises what we know about our universe's origin, its evolution and ultimate fate.
""Today will still yearn to know why we are here and where we came from. Humanity's deepest desire for knowledge is justification enough for our continuing quest. And our goal is nothing less than a complete description of the universe we live in.""
It is definitely a book that takes focus and time and there were passages I read several times, taking breaks in between, trying to wrap my head around the relationship between time and space, black holes and the forces of nature, but it is the most accessible introduction into these themes. Accompanied with little visualisations and the occasional joke or personal insight, it is a most satisfying read that made me comprehend how much there is to learn about this world we live in and how much there is that we still do not know. And will we ever? I guess that something only time will tell - whatever that may be. "

Gravity, electromagnetic fields, laws of warmth - I devoured all subjects and was well-versed in the language of equations. I joined an extra-curricular science class, and visited the hadron collider in CERN. But physics disappeared from my life when I choose to pursue my dream of entering the literary field.A Brief History of Time reminds me of why I frigging love physics. Hawking has an incredible love for his field, which penetrates every word he writes. Our understanding of the universe has boomed in the last fifty years, and A Brief History of Time gives a short overview of all modes of thought up until the time it was written.What is fascinating to me is how reality is stranger than science-fiction writers think up. Especially the concepts of relativity and quantum mechanics are incredibly hard to wrap your mind around, and modern science is almost complete hocus-pocus for a lay person.I don't think it's possible for someone without a background in science to understand A Brief History of Time. It probably all makes sense for Hawking himself, but for an ordinary person he might as well be speaking a foreign language. I understood about one third of everything he explains here, and that's only because I have followed classes on relativity and quantum mechanics for a year. Even in its incomprehensibleness, A Brief History of Time is utterly fascinating."

Unfortunately, Stephen Hawking's writing pales in comparison to Tyson's. I would highly recommend Tyson's books on the subject over Hawking's.This book dealt with lots of complicated subjects, and unfortunately didn't do much to un-complicate them to a popular level. Instead of coming away with a feeling that I now know more about how the universe works, I have more of a feeling that someone TOLD me about how the universe works, but I can't really remember much.Also of note is that I listened to the audio version. The Narrator, Michael Jackson (no, not that Michael Jackson), left a lot to be desired. His reading style is very staccato, constantly putting pauses in sentences where they don't belong, and speeding through bits that should be read more slowly. He also constantly adds in ""umm..."" and ""uhhh..."" as if to make it seem like the author is actually talking off the cuff. It's quite distracting. The production quality of the recording is poor as well. you can regularly hear the narrator turning the pages of his script, and several times he will begin a sentence, mess up, and then start over again.

106,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking“A Brief History of Time” is the 1988 classic book that covers the big, basic questions about our universe. Science icon Stephen Hawking takes the readers on a journey through space and time. This book was updated prior to Hawking’s passing. This instructive 240-page book includes the following twelve chapters: Chapter One - Our Picture of the Universe, Chapter Two - Space and Time, Chapter Three - The Expanding Universe, Chapter Four - The Uncertainty Principle, Chapter Five - Elementary Particles and the Forces of Nature, Chapter Six - Black Holes, Chapter Seven - Black Holes Ain’t So Black, Chapter Eight - The Origin and Fate of the Universe, Chapter Nine - The Arrow of Time, Chapter Ten - Wormholes and Time Travel, Chapter Eleven - The Unification of Physics, and Chapter Twelve – Conclusion.Positives:1.	Professionally written, accessible, brief and well-researched book. 2.	The fascinating topic of the big, basic questions of our universe from the masterful mind of Stephen Hawking. Originally released in 1988 and updated in 2017.3.	This book has great flow. It reads well and follows a logical sequence. 4.	Hawking does his best to simplify very complex topics. The book is intended for the masses evidenced by the lack of equations.5.	Effective use of diagrams.6.	Hawking is an educator at heart; he guides the readers through major discoveries and the scientists behind said discoveries. “Newton postulated a law of universal gravitation according to which each body in the universe was attracted toward every other body by a force that was stronger the more massive the bodies and the closer they were to each other. It was this same force that caused objects to fall to the ground.”7.	Explains the concept of a theory. “A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements. It must accurately describe a large class of observations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations.”8.	The grand theory of relativity explained for the masses. “The fundamental postulate of the theory of relativity, as it was called, was that the laws of science should be the same for all freely moving observers, no matter what their speed.”9.	The concept of time. “We must accept that time is not completely separate from and independent of space, but is combined with it to form an object called space-time.”10.	The expanding universe. “Or, in other words, the farther a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away! And that meant that the universe could not be static, as everyone previously had thought, but is in fact expanding; the distance between the different galaxies is growing all the time.”11.	Hawking is a scientist’s scientist; he is not afraid to be humble and goes with what the evidence states. “So in the end our work became generally accepted and nowadays nearly everyone assumes that the universe started with a big bang singularity. It is perhaps ironic that, having changed my mind, I am now trying to convince other physicists that there was in fact no singularity at the beginning of the universe…”12.	At the heart of the matter and the key mystery in science. “We do not yet have a complete consistent theory that unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics, but we do know a number of the features it should have.”13.	Clearly explains black holes. “According to the theory of relativity, nothing can travel faster than light. Thus if light cannot escape, neither can anything else; everything is dragged back by the gravitational field. So one has a set of events, a region of space-time, from which it is not possible to escape to reach a distant observer. This region is what we now call a black hole. Its boundary is called the event horizon and it coincides with the paths of light rays that just fail to escape from the black hole.” Bonus because it’s too good not to share. “Black holes are one of only a fairly small number of cases in the history of science in which a theory was developed in great detail as a mathematical model before there was any evidence from observations that it was correct.”14.	Explores fascinating topics like the origin and fate of the universe. “The first primitive forms of life consumed various materials, including hydrogen sulfide, and released oxygen. This gradually changed the atmosphere to the composition that it has today, and allowed the development of higher forms of life such as fish, reptiles, mammals, and ultimately the human race.”15.	Explores the complex topic of arrow of time. “Disorder increases with time because we measure time in the direction in which disorder increases.”16.	Is time travel possible? “We thus have experimental evidence both that space-time can be warped (from the bending of light during eclipses) and that it can be curved in the way necessary to allow time travel (from the Casimir effect).”17.	The quest to unify physics. “With the advent of quantum mechanics, we have come to recognize that events cannot be predicted with complete accuracy but that there is always a degree of uncertainty.”18.	The tasking of science. “In effect, we have redefined the task of science to be the discovery of laws that will enable us to predict events up to the limits set by the uncertainty principle.”19.	A short bio of the three giants of science: Einstein, Galileo, and Newton. A glossary of key terms too.20.	An appendix that updates key concepts. “Perhaps the most striking trend is one that many find uncomfortable: the no boundary proposal and eternal inflation point increasingly strongly to the idea that our universe is just one of many.”Negatives:1.	No links to supporting information.2.	Meant for the masses not for those in the field.3.	No matter how much you simplify some topics; topics such as quantum mechanics are too complex to wrap your head around it.In summary, this is an instructive book to read for laypersons. Hawking does his best to simplify complex topics by removing the math out of it. There is indeed wonder and mystery in science. A classic worth revisiting; I recommend it.

Of course, I later found it to be an exaggeration by the writer of that fact but yes, it was sold heavily when it was released. First, the book is written by an enigmatic personality who despite having physical limitations has solely discovered many secrets of the universe. Stephen Hawking was already a hero before this book arrived and after this book, he became a sort of legend. This can be easily proven by the fact that he was the professor at the same university and was sitting on the same position where Newton used to sit 300 years back. Everyone bought this book but not many read as they found to be a little complex or rather assumed that since it involved physics so it was supposed to be a complex book. However, the entire book is just philosophy, some science and interesting trivia’s and facts about our world and beyond. There is only one equation used in the book and that too is the most familiar equation of all time. Even people who hate maths and physics know about the equation. The equation was E equals to M*C(square), the world-famous equation given by Einstein which changed the way scientists looked at the matter and helped them invent many things thereafter. The book is not autobiographical and the author never talks about himself in the book. He only talks about the universe and its law in the most basic fashion that there could be. I was in the final year of my school and I was preparing for my engineering exams when my cousin visited my home and during a casual conversation asked me whether I know that time is absolute. I was offended to know such fact because it opposed everything I knew and was taught. I was like how can two different people have two different time zones. I totally negated him but then to prove himself right he asked me to read this book called ""A brief history of time"" which I had seen on books stands previously but never took the courage to buy it. Finally, I bought it and it opened my eyes to so many things about science which I didn't know before. It opened an entire new world for me like why we live in three dimensions and not more or less than that, and why time is relative and what is the exact meaning of the Einstein’s famous equation. I also got to know a lot about black holes which again I find it to be a very interesting topic and later I read an entire book on the same subject by the same author. There was a time when I thought that maybe Hawking’s was obsessed about Blackholes but after reading a lot about Black holes I came to know why. The theories about black holes solved myriads of mysteries of science. Black holes are also related to time travel, the most used and most favourite topic of writing for science fiction authors. This book is brilliant because even a man with no science background can read it and find it interesting. You don’t expect such kind of simple language from a scientist because normally such kind of topics are aimed at only a section of people who have a background on such topics. I think every kid should be made to read this book so that they can develop some interest in science. I think I read it very later in life because if I had read it earlier, I would have opted for science as a career and not filmmaking. I was good in science and theoretical physics had always attracted me.However, this book is also the reason why I ranked less in my exams that year because this book started a chain of thoughts inside me which led me to buy more books and I ended up buying more books on the same subject, mostly by him and Roger Penrose, another author whom I love dearly. In the end, I would just like to say that this book is a must read and you should give it a go. "
108,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15708825-ana-lelis,4,"I liked it a lot, it really tells the story and theories along with the explanations about the subjects. I'm Christian, but I didn't feel offended by it, the way he talks about it is very respectful and interesting. I'm really surprised.But at the same time, there's something quite wrong about it.At times it explains thing in simple language and for a good amount of time, and at other times it doesn't explain the basic concepts, it only assumes that we know it and mentions terms that we have no familiarity with. For example, It had a great explanation about black holes. On the other hand, it mentioned quark but didn't explain its components and why it changes with the different reactions that can happen. Since I'm not a scientist it was kinda hard to understand some terms, so I had to do some research after reading it to understand some subjects fully.Overall, It's a great book and no one can deny that."
109,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13417829-john-mccullough,5,"Until his death several years ago Hawking was the uncontested leader in both the exploration of deep science and explaining it to the general, well-educated, but non-physical science public. This book is one of the reasons for leadership in that latter category.My impression of the book was that it was really a tour of cosmology (study of the cosmos, the universe) with the micro- and macro-physics necessary to understand the problems of studying the origin and fate of the universe, with light historical notes along the way. The writing is dense and the thought occurred to me that I was learning some Readers Digest physics written by exceptionally competent staff. For an interested non-physical scientist like me, a second or third reading would substantially help comprehension. I read it catch-as-catch-can over a long period of time and that might have interfered with comprehension. On the other hand, Hawking lays out many ideas and questions that are worth more than momentary consideration. The Big Bang. Black Holes. The expanding universe, and what about contraction? And the millions of millions of stars that were created in the Big Bang and thereafter – where did we come from and where are we going? Hawking also thinks that “why a universe” is a legitimate question. I do not. When many people are struck by disease or tragedy, often a first question is “why me?” I find that to be a silly, pointless, and useless question. When these happen to me my first questions are “where am I on this problem?” and “what do I do about it?” Perhaps we might be reminded of paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson’s suggestion that “why” is a question for philosophers and theologians while “how come” is a better question for scientists.I actually read the first edition instead of the later expanded edition, which was a mistake. Nonetheless, I did get the gist of the message, but worry that “a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.” Perhaps reading a last edition would be helpful.Occasionally Hawking introduces humour into the text, the kinds of jokes professors use in their lectures – like I did for years, eliciting groans from most students. Which reminds me of a personal incident involving Hawking. For one academic year (2000-2001) I was a visiting fellow at Cambridge. We had no car but lived in Trumpington, just two miles south of Cambridge center. A new Waitrose store had just been built there and we often shopped there as it was not far from our home and had quality products. One night while shopping I was bent over an open-top freezer choosing several packages of fish, when something struck my butt which was sticking out into the aisle. I looked in the direction of the hit and saw no one, then in the other direction and saw Hawking and a woman slowly chugging down the aisle as if nothing had happened. Quite a sight! My first thought was, “that cheeky shit!” I then pondered the possibility that the “hit” was caused by one of two things – accident or trick. Maybe an accident? He misjudged distance and banged lightly into me? On the other hand, my exposed butt sticking out must have been a choice target for a trickster-motivated drive-by hit. If the latter, I hope he enjoyed it. Life has so few pleasures at times and his life must have been extremely trying for him. The memory of him and the lady accompanying him slowly, monotonously fading down the aisle are permanently etched in dark ink in my mind. People sometimes ask me if I ever ran into Hawking while in Cambridge. I have to tell them “no,” I never ran into Hawking, but Hawking ran into me!"

This book is a nice trip with history of science and breakthroughs and advances of the most important theories, that rule our high-tech world, plus another try to connect these theories into the Theory of Everything, the theory that may enable us of knowing and explaining everything around this vast universe.Although must be outdated now, still a good choice to update on where our human brain have reached."

Hawking’s view of the universe is fascinating. He theories and discoveries on time travel, space, time and wormholes, Newton’s law, gravity, force, and resistance. I was very fascinated when reading his take on time travel and space/time because it’s not very different from what I’ve learned from Einstein's books and TV shows/ movies. Overall this book is amazing I cannot express how happy I felt after finishing this book because it has opened my understanding of the universe and space/time themselves.

I have to say, it took me extremely long to read, which might stem from it being non-fiction and hard to understand. I mean, roughly 200 pages are not long enough to actually fully grasp a topic.Nevertheless, I learned a lot and would recommend others wo are interested to read it. So, I quite liked it."

Prior knowledge would certainly help get through certain aspects of this book.

117,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60270-khalid,4,"This book discusses the origin of the universe, its future, and the way it could have developed to its current state, and bases all that on physics. It dives into the part of physics whose sole aim is to devise a unified theory that describes everything in the universe, or at least do that as much as possible.The book starts out by discussing theories as they developed, beginning with theories we all are familiar with and consider trivial, and then showing how they have proven to be wrong in describing special events. After that it dives into the theory of relativity, and shows how this theory fails at a certain point. Following that, it discusses quantum mechanics, which seems to become important at the point where the theory of relativity failed. Then, the book goes on trying to combine these theories along with other ideas to reach the unified theory. It does not exactly get there by the end of the book, but this does not make the book any less wonderful.A Brief History of Time is not a source of information as much as a mind opener. It provides a new vision of the world, in a form of an interesting model. It does not delve into the physics part of these theories as much as the philosophical part. It shows how human thought tries to solve the problems they have, and more importantly, that we always do not know the full truth, even when we think we do.Theories discussed in this book all had problems. Many of them we could not even find observations for that match the predictions. However, they are the result of thoughts. They are sometimes merely put based on what we observe, and one more observation simply destroys them.According to [Stephen Hawking], it has not been proven that time travel is impossible. It has not been done, and it is not likely that it would, but he provides an explanation on how this could be made, if the universe matched some certain models.This book also shows one very interesting thing. It shows that a big part of science is an attempt to prove the inexistence of God. They keep trying, and it gets harder every time they go further. And even at the end, when Stephen Hawking could get to describe a self-contained boundary-less universe, there was the question of how this universe came to be. Even if we try to model a perfectly self-contained universe in which no supreme intervention is needed, this does not mean that 1) supreme intervention is not possible, and 2) this universe created its own. The fact that the universe is very sophisticated only suggests that thought should have been put into it, and that it is not created by random.There is a theory called the anthropic theory, which I understand as: The universe is the way it is because this is the only way there could have been intelligent beings who would at the end ask ""How did the universe come to be that way?"" and question their very own existence. I personally find this theory very cyclic, and see that it simply calls for the thought of the existence of God anyway.Another way to get away from the idea of God was to suggest that an infinite number of universes exist, and that we live in this one because it is the one whose properties are suitable for our life. Nice explanation, but why is it more 'sensible' than the idea of a supreme being? It is so simply because it does not expect you to believe in a supreme being, I suppose. I do not deny the thought that God could have created various universes, but that is beside the point.At any rate, I am just simply providing some of the thoughts that result from reading this book. I enjoyed it to the fullest, and I intend to read its sequel, The Universe In a Nutshell sometime in the future."
118,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,3,"As an individual, I hold immense respect for Stephen Hawking. There aren’t many people in the world who when faced with such a debilitating medical condition will chose to put their formidable brain power as a tool for the aid of humanity. This logic also explains why there is only one Stephen Hawking on this planet. The man’s intellectual faculties and achievements have crowned him as a living, breathing legend. For a lot of people, this book has made him immortal and they shall forever remember him as the man who wrote the book. There is reason for it too for the scope of this book is staggering as it deals with things right from the very small (atoms, electrons and anti-electrons) to the very large (galaxies and star systems). And for a book of 200 pages, it will keep you befuddled for a long, long time. The viewpoints and perspectives Hawking puts forward cements your belief in rationality and science incredibly well. Cosmology could never have hoped for an apostle as brilliant as him.These are all things we know and I don’t want to shove these in your face again. In spite of all these glories, he was a lousy writer for me as a reader. The book begins simple enough by tracing the development of how we came to know about the stars. From Aristotle to Galileo and Da Vinci and finally to Newton and Einstein, Hawking traces the development of Cosmology. While it is tremendously exciting, I fell out of his rocket fueled vehicle somewhere along the way. Hawking is a genius and the biggest impediment of genius is that it is almost always very frustrating for the common man. Barring a few exceptions, a person of very high intellect will always talk and think in a way where it is implicit that he expects others to be at the same level of thought as him/her. From the simplicity of the first two chapters, the book proceeds into topics which are dense and where I did not receive much help from Hawking. He assumes that you have a background of the things that he is talking about ( for instance cosmology, astrophysics, the Schrodinger’s equation and so on) which I did not have. Maybe I am not a member of the intended audience, I who passed Physics examinations by some dumb luck. An author like Carl Sagan or even Richard Feynman was much more approachable in their treatment of Science. Quite later, chanced upon a review where the person said that this book gave him a hard-on…sheesh ! I mean...ah forget it !This book features on the list of a lot many people and I tend to go along with Manny’s review that it figures in the list of ‘bought not read’. It is a fantastic addition to the bookshelf and you can smile enigmatically at people gaping at your shelves. I prefer my books well thumbed through and read from cover-to-cover though. I will pass Mr. Hawking, you are too good for me and I will go sit in the corner wearing a cap that says Dunce ! Note : The stars in the rating are for the content and the way they are summarized and not for readability."
119,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46735809-tasnim-dewan-orin,5,"It is a book by Hawking trying to answer the question we all have about the origin of the universe.The first chapter is a short history of astrophysics. And I always have a thing for history. So this chapter introduced me to the best astronomers of all ages starting from Ptolemy to Newton. This chapter will retell the story of their quest of finding the origin of the universe.The second chapter is about the theories related to the astrophysics and the major differences and similarities between them. It broadly talked about the differences between the idea of Aristotle, Galileo, and Newton. This chapter also talked about Clark, Maxwell, Lorentz, and Einstein.The third chapter named ""The Expanding Universe"" demonstrated the transformation of human's view of the universe in less than 50 years after the Hubble's discovery that the universe is expanding.The fourth chapter is about quantum physics and I found it difficult to understand, to be honest. All I remember it talked about unified quantum theory.Rest of the chapter talks about the elementary particle of nature, black hole, the origin of the universe, the fate of the universe, about the forward and backward direction of time, unification of physics and the brief about Einstein and Newton after conclusion.He concluded by saying he hoped that if we can find a unified theory we will about to know the mind of God. It was a present from me to my Papa who had this book in his TBR list. This book has his bookmarks all over the book which I never removed after his demise. This book is a basic book of astrophysics for common readers. This book had a massive impact on me in my school days and it invoked in my interest in astrophysics. I loved the sense of humor of Hawking when he mentioned in acknowledgment that every equation he would put in the book would be halved the sales. I had been ridiculed by my fellow mates when they heard I read this book at that tender age. I read in class-7 back then and no one believed me that I read this book. At that age, I realized one thing for my generation or in my country it is not cool for a teenage girl to have interest in astrophysics, to read about it and above all, to commit a cardinal sin of trying to discuss it with my fellow teenagers. I was termed with the tag ""nerd"" and ""boring"". I accepted myself as I am and find peace in doing so. But after the demise of the father, I could not pursue my passion of astrophysics and I had to stop there. I want to read this book again to feel all things it made me feel 11 years back. It will be a journey back to my teenage and let me check what adulthood has done to me!"

Therefore, when I found this book in the library, I took the opportunity to explore the topic.We assume that the book dates back to 1988, so the latest ideas presented here are at least 27 years old.Hawkins starts from simple concepts such as the structure of the atom, the expansion of the universe and traces the various discoveries over the centuries, through the ideas of philosophers and scientists.He try to explain things as clearly as possible, even with a certain amount of humor, using each time specific examples. Continuing with the reading, he switch to more complex topics, requiring a greater attention.(view spoiler)[Fun section where, reasoning by contradiction, describes the world as a flat disk resting on the back of a turtle. Don’t you remember anything? Thanks sir Terry Pratchett.  (hide spoiler)]This book covers all the most important theories expressed in the last century and the race of scientists searching for the unified theory that explains the 'everything'. Interesting to see how often a theory explains only part of what is detected by observation and experiments, but combined with another, is almost satisfactory.How popular science book is certainly interesting to read, to understand the science not only from the point of view of the concepts, but also from the historical and philosophical.

This is probably a problem with how to present scientific material: it is hard to make everyone happy, and popular works are often annoying to practicing scientists.On the other hand I have *loved* A Short History of Nearly Everything and Fermat's Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem, finding them as gripping as a thriller.I think the main problem with Hawking's book might be that the writing has an awkwardness in taking these long loops around a description, which merges poorly with a certain self-importance. In the end the best thing this book might have done is to give Bill Bryson an opportunity to make a pun in his title. (I actually don't know if that's deliberate, but I thought of it immediately...)"

123,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10405670-kerri,4,"This is a highly interesting book, even with only a vague understanding of the very, very basics of physics (such as ""yes, there are such things as Newton's Laws"". We are talking Basic.) Hawking speaks in a very conversational way and manages to make the ideas he talks about approachable. I could nod along and say, ""that sounds reasonable"" or ""that is really interesting"" as long as I did not think about it too hard. Once I started thinking about it, it would make my brain bend uncomfortably. And there are more than a few times where I just had to take him at his word and keep going because it was just so far over my head.It was also interesting to see how the theories have changed and evolved, what sparked the new train of thought or how different discoveries impacted the way science views the world and the universe. How we got to String Theory from believing that the world is flat and balanced on the back of a giant tortoise. What a ride. It definitely reminds me of how amazing the world and the universe truly are!"

The ideas he attempts to explain are too complex for words without equations or at least some technical detail. I don't see why books on physics are either 90% or 0% equations. His explanation for why nothing exists before the big bang concerns me. Current theories cannot predict events beyond a singularity — hence history before the Big Bang doesn't exist. I've seen him answer the question of pre-Big Bang history on television, instead of telling people 'We have no idea' he makes it sound like we know that nothing existed previously. The two statements are equivalent to logical positivists, but not to anyone else. Statements like these can give the wrong idea to people about science. "

133,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8274533-ashley,4,"I’m not going to pretend that I understood everything discussed in this book. But I do want to stress that the late Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time is significantly more readable than many people make it out to be. When I first opened the book for what I thought would be a quick curious glance earlier today I had no intention of finishing it a few hours later. But once I got going I found it incredibly hard to stop.My knowledge in any science related field is substantially minimal since my academic background is in the history of art, so my tolerance for reading complicated texts may be a bit above average. But I want to stress how little I knew about the subject of this book before going in. I have an armchair interest in astronomy and physics but it doesn’t go beyond binging Brian Cox’s beautiful documentary Wonders of the Universe or falling down the occasional Wikipedia rabbit hole. In university, I took an undergraduate astronomy course for my science context credit and despite my straight-A status I couldn’t seem to budge the grade for that class above a C-. However, after reading A Brief History of Time I realise that my university professor was missing something that both Hawking and Cox have that truly brought these complex and grand ideas to life: passion.A Brief History of Time can be summed up by the phrase ‘it isn’t the destination, but the journey’. Hawking looks to the history of his field and discusses the various influential figures in human history that helped us get to the understanding we have the universe today. He credits his friends, colleagues, and graduate students as well as those he meets at various conferences he travelled around the world to participate in as being among the great minds that brought humanity to its current place of understanding. Before reading this book I thought of Stephen Hawking as existing in his own bubble of infinite knowledge and understanding, but now I see him as an important piece of a much grander puzzle in which he was thrilled to be involved. A Brief History of Time, a book that many find unrightfully intimidating (myself included prior to today) is actually an extremely insightful look at how far we have come as species and our tiny existence within something so much larger than we can ever imagine.Overall, this book is moderately easy to read and interesting enough that I didn’t put it down until it was completed. Hawking is passionate and excited about his field in a way that makes you excited right along with him. He uses examples of everyday occurrences and situations to explain the ways he and other scientists believe the universe works while providing extremely helpful diagrams that were a blessing for a visual learner like myself. A Brief History of Time, most importantly, allows a look into the human side of the internationally famed physicist with occasional references to his family and the various humorous bets he made with colleagues. It was really fascinating to hear how Hawking placed his own research (with its ups and downs) into a historical context alongside some of the most renowned thinkers of human history. It goes without saying that this is anything but your typical science text.Please don’t find this book intimidating simply because of its authorship and definitely don’t go into it thinking that you will completely understand everything that’s being discussed. Take from it what you can and enjoy the ride through one of the world’s most celebrated minds. This book was written for people like me and you who are nothing more than curious readers looking to learn more about our universe without attending Cambridge for a PhD in theoretical physics."

It talks about things that the simple mind cannot easily perceive.Things like:One second after the big bang, [the temperature] would have fallen to about 10 billion degrees. This is about a thousand times the temperature at the centre of the sun.p.132or[Alpha Centauri is the closest star to us and the sun. Sun's light needs 8 minutes to reach Earth. Alpha Centauri's light needs four years to reach us.If we send a spacecraft like Voyager to the Sun it will reach it in 100 days.If we send it to the Alpha Centauri it will reach it in 100 years].It also talks about highly technical staff that are also hard to comprehend:In quantum mechanics, the forces of interactions between matter particles are all supposed to be carried by particles of integer spin. p.78It was a short 250 pages book, but you cannot read it in two days since as I said is quite technical.Of course I didn't understand everything I read but it was an interesting experience.Now, I know my limits when it comes to technical popular science books.Tomorrow's review will be also about a popular science book but this time much more easier:Palaeontology, hence dinosaurs. Stay tuned!"
135,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48243908-graham-wilhauk,4,"I was debating on what I should give this for a couple of hours. It was either going to be a 4 out of 5 stars or a 3.5 out of 5 stars. The topic at hand was discussed extremely well and it was a fascinating read. However, I just feel like I'm not very connected to the field of physics. With this in mind, I didn't get a lot of extreme joy out of this book, or at least not as much as the people who adore this book did. Though the straw that broke the camel's back for me on giving this a 4 out of 5 stars was Stephen Hawking as a man of knowledge and as a writer. He is an incredible man. Despite his disabilities, he has become one of the biggest names in modern science, bringing revolutionary ideas on the topics of black holes and string theory. Also, this man knows how to write. I watched an interview with his that proves how he wrote this book. He truly wrote this book and it was beautifully told. While I didn't enjoy this as much as I really should have, I do think this book is really great. Stephen Hawking is a truly remarkable man who has inspired thousands in the field of physics and just overall science. If this sounds interesting to you, read it. It provides a history of many points of view of how the universe is structured and it is worth a read. I did really like it!I am giving this one a 4 out of 5 stars. "
136,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81791013-michael-kress,3,"Stephen Hawking lays out some heavy concepts in this book. He starts the first chapter with a historical perspective by referencing the struggles the ancient scientists and philosophers had in figuring out what was going on in the universe and in understanding the nature of time. Many of them were terribly wrong, like Aristotle, who claimed that the Earth was the center of the universe. But St. Augustine's claim that ""time did not exist before the beginning of the universe"" should garner him some respect in that his statement is consistent with the Big Bang theory. Hawking goes on to get deeper into scientific concepts, many of which went way over my head. He is always referencing old scientific theories that have been debunked, and this seems to muddle the ideas he is trying to get across. At one point I got frustrated and had to put the book down for a few weeks. When I picked it back up, I tried to understand it in a more general way without obsessing over the details. But I am totally lost on string theory. The conclusion is good in that it comes full circle to explain how far we have to go to have a complete theory of the universe.Here's a little clip explaining what he covers in Chapter 8.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJ88k..."

If you are into this kind of stuff, probably. But the people who are into this stuff most likely are quite familiar with all the concepts and don't need some silly book to explain it in terms for us common simpletons. Sadly I think it's still a bit too complicated for a total beginner. The people who'd read this book hovers somewhere between newbies and those familiar with the arts of the universe, and there just aren't all that many of those around."

I only grasped the general ideas, but still a humbling and eye-opening read nonetheless. Hawking goes through all the major theories from Aristotle to string theory, ending with his thoughts on our ongoing search for a unified theory and a reminder that we have yet to touch upon the question of why there is a universe to begin with. There is so much we don't know, and so much we can only try our best to understand (""theories can't be proved""). Also make sure not to skip the short chapters on Einstein, Galileo, and Newton at the very end!"

Most of the contents I never would have known if I didn’t read this book. It also has an optimistic feel wherein I’m like “Wow that’s a possibility, that’s amazing”. You will also at least have an idea of brilliant nobel prize winners and even few stories about popular scientists. It’s like taking a peek inside the mind of guys like Stephen Hawking. Rest in Peace. You are a legend. "

Hawking is best at that, without dumbing down his subjects though.I just loved that bizarre feeling I was left with at the end of the book, feeling smarter and dumber at the same time. I knew more, but I realized I had so much more to dig into and explore. The best feeling ever!Thank you Dear Professor Hawking........."

Stephen Hawking's a Brief History of Time is the guileful work of a sheer genius.Apart from Ulysses (by James Joyce), the only book that has ever stretched me beyond limits. Although, It's arduous nature standout. Yet, It opens the sole window of opportunity to corporeally and conspicuously appreciate the gallant, grandiose and inexhaustible complexion of Theoretical Physics.It's an Epic, a Macro-cosmic odyssey, making it's way through the big bang to Black holes.Simultaneously, Hawking bestows his vehement services throughout this cosmic voyage (as a spectacularly faithful guide), by illustrating the phenomena such as general relativity, special relativity, quantum mechanics and gravitational singularity, accompanied by embellished details rendered in the glossary. Thus, making this prodigiously nebulous journey, lucidly pellucid."

“The universe doesn't allow perfection.”
4 stars. I cannot stress enough on how brilliant Stephen Hawking was. I hate that I'm just now getting into his work but I'm really enjoying them so far. This was great and I liked the narrator. I like how Hawking put humor and wit into his writing to keep it from reading like a textbook. He had a great sense of humor. If you're even just a little bit interested in physics then I'd recommend it because I personally don't think that it's too advanced and the audiobook is well done and keeps you entertained in the midst of all of the information and science jargon. Great read. "
144,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111852642-minhal-sherazi,4,"Make no mistake Stephen Hawking is ridiculously smart even when he is trying to write for a layperson. There are several parts that require a lot of thinking, rereading and other videos, articles and books to supplement reading this book. Nonetheless, the language used is simple with a touch of humour, philosophical questions and personal accounts which makes it a fun and enjoyable read for anyone."
145,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8972144-soraya,3,"I liked the first chapter; a sort of sweeping look at science which felt like watching Brian Cox’s Wonders of the Universe (one of the best programmes to fall asleep to, because it’s soothing - not boring). Then there was some stuff about gravity that made me feel like I was learning and thinking and getting a little smarter. Then came the chapter on quantum. Then I realised I’m in fact very stupid. I wondered if the book had suddenly slipped into webdings when I wasn’t looking. It’s probably written very plainly. It’s probably in baby-language for Hawking and it can’t be that the theory doesn’t make sense - way too many people say it does. I feel less prepared to deal with the quantum realm than I did after watching Ant Man, so at least my trip to see Avengers Endgame wasn’t marred by knowing too much about the real science.So.. is it quantum baby? I don’t know, Keanu .. it seems like it might be - but it depends if you’re looking at it and it both is and isn’t and it’s Schrödinger’s Ant Man but also not and I’ll see you all in vector space...and also won’t."
146,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20819164-fern-adams,5,"Brilliant! I was slightly intimidated by this book before starting it but there really was no need to be. While yes there were a few paragraphs I had to read twice the vast majority of this book was really accessible, comprehensive and beyond all else completely fascinating. Hawking’s humour also shone through the pages and there are some witty comments and remarks throughout. My favourite chapter was the one on time travel. A fantastic read full of food for thought and not at all scary! "
147,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76360473-soleil-shah,3,"Informative, but not the most engaging read on the subject. Much preferred Tyson’s Astrophysics for People in a Hurry. "
148,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6463881-l,5,"Stephen Hawking's 'A brief history of time' is a must-read for anyone interested in cosmology or physics, and it is written in such a way that the non-scientist can gain a sense of what is being discussed. Through helpful diagrams, photographs and clear explanations Hawking's book is a true masterpiece. Also, I found his wit and humour to be brilliant, making for an interesting and fun read. He looks at the big questions, such as for instance; was there a beginning of time? could time run backwards? is the universe infinite or does it have boundaries? Everything we want to know is explored in here, including how science has influenced writers of science-fiction and fantasy. From the big bang and big crunch, to black holes, dark matter and string theory... this book covers a lot of topics. I would also recommend 'the universe in a nutshell' also by Stephen Hawking, as a good follow-on read. This book really introduces you to a world of wonders! "

The back cover of this modern classic states the book, which explores the creation of the universe among other things, is written in a “ language we can all understand.” Hmmm"
151,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1847371-michael-scott,5,"As my last reading project before the new academic year, I set myself to understand Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time. I knew about it very little, other than it is a classic pop-science book about astrophysics (cosmological physics) and that the initial version was revised over time due to important new discoveries (dark matter, the LIGO observations, etc.) I wanted to understand a bit more about astrophysics - apart from Neil deGrasse Tyson's Astrophysics for People in a Hurry, whose tone and content I generally disliked -, but also to understand how the field has evolved (as seen by Hawking), and how to present complex scientific material to a general audience (so they both like and understand it). So I bought one of the last editions (a Bantam paperback from 2017), the initial 1988 edition (hardcover), the intermediary 1998 Tenth Anniversary edition (also paperback), plus the simplified version co-written with Leonard Mlodinow (A Briefer History of Time, hardcover, 2005). I read them over two days, with most of the time spent on the original reading of the 2017 edition, with which I started. This is the summary of all these reading sessions.Note: The content is largely the same in all the editions, with the addition only of a new Chapter 10, Wormholes and Time Travel, since the Tenth Anniversary edition, and otherwise with only small in-text additions and adaptations in the later editions. Thus, unless otherwise noted, I will use the 2017 edition as the reference, esp. when referring to a specific page.Overall: I got interested in astrophysics following a talk by George Smoot, at the computer science conference Supercomputing (SC07, if I recall correctly). He explained to the audience his work on cosmic microwave (background) radiation, and how much technology, and especially e-Science and computer technology went into his scientific processes. A Brief History of Time is the complement of that talk: instead of a concrete advancement and its link to the technology enabling it, Stephen Hawking's is an overview of what we know about the origin, evolution, and current state of the universe, and of how we know it. It is based on a thorough, albeit high-level, survey of the key advances in the science of astrophysics and of the people who made them, a summary of the author's own contribution, a good bit of analysis and interpretation of how this knowledge came to be, and some speculation (both personal and, as in the case of string theory and multiple universes, somewhat scientific - see also Higher Speculations and The Trouble with Physics). It is also written to be accessible to a non-specialist audience, but with an academic style to it, despite the famous quip about knowing that each equation halves the sales making Hawking ""resolved not to have any equations at all"" and at last to ""put in one equation, Einstein's famous equation, E=mc2"" (Acknowledgements, 1988 edition). Overall, it is very good and simply recommended reading for everyone.The Content: A Brief History of Time starts with a long-term history of astronomy, which also includes one of the briefest practical definition of 'what a theory is' (only 2 pages in each edition) and the important warning that ""any physical theory is always provisional"". The same Chapter 1 introduces the two partial theories of physics, the general theory of relativity (Einstein) and quantum mechanics (Pauli, Heisenberg, Feynman, etc.), and the search for a theory ""that will incorporate them both"", a grand unified theory. The chapter concludes by setting the goal of astrophysics as ""nothing less than a complete description of the universe we live it"".The reader learns in Chapters 2 and 3 about the basic components of the two theories, the general theory of relativity and its consequences about the notion of time-space; we also learn that the universe is expanding and about its possible start in a zero-volume, infinite-density spot (a singularity inflating during the Big Bang). We learn in these two chapters about many important theories and concepts, in particular, about the homogeneity assumption of Friedman and its experimental proof by Bell Labs (applied) physicists, and about the failure of the general theory of relativity in points like the Big Bang singularity.Chapters 4 and 5 give an excellent summary of quantum mechanics, and in particular introduce with clarity and wit the basics (the uncertainty principle, the dual particle-wave behavior of light, etc.), and the more advanced notions of elementary particles (sub-atomic particles that get significantly smaller than the atom, starting with the electron) and the four types of forces that appear in nature (gravitational, electromagnetic, and weak and strong nuclear forces). We also learn here what a grand unified theory (GUT) would need to include and to predict.In Chapters 6 and 7, we return to singularities, this time presented as Black Holes - what they are, how they form, how likely they are to be found, and also a surprising link between Black Holes and the second law of thermodynamics, through entropy (disorder).Chapter 8 discusses the origin and fate of the universe, focusing on the possible evolution of the universe after the Big Bang, the conditions for the formation of supernovae, and an explanation about the formation of our own Sun as ""a second- or third-generation star formed [...] out of a cloud of rotating gas containing the debris of earlier supernovas"" (p. 124); there's an uncomfortable segue into the appearance of ""primitive forms of life"" (p. 125), which is mercifully very brief (picture Sheldon talking about real-world topics, in a Big Bang Theory episode). There is much talk about the weak and strong forms of the anthropic principle (p. 131-3) -- that the universe must be compatible with us because we exist. The explanation of how the universe came to be (one could also summarize it with the title A Universe from Nothing), on pages 132-35, and the punch-counter-punch-reverse-repeat of how the science around it evolved, on pages 135-37, is outstanding. (Beats Astrophysics for People in a Hurry, which is also longer and too cocky for my taste.)The next chapter, The Arrow of Time, plays with ideas of what constitute credible time-arrows; Hawking discusses thermodynamic, cosmological, and psychological arrows of time, and their inter-relationship. He talks again and in more detail about CPT symmetries (p. 148). He presents what through analogy we understand is his greatest scientific mistake, that ""the no boundary condition implied that disorder would in fact continue to increase during the contraction"" (p. 155), and, by this point, the statement is a good test of whether one can follow Hawking's scientific argument. (Possibly this is where Mlodinow decided to jump in and make A Briefer History of Time a highly disorderly contraction of A Brief History of Time. To keep in line with the hubris expected in every writ on astrophysics, he can thank me in the 2020 edition for this pun.)The new Chapter 10 talks about wormholes and time travel, and, when Hawking does it, it's a serious matter. Turns out the topic of time travel was initiated in 1935 by none other than Einstein, who discussed in an article with Nathan Rosen about bridges and negative space-time curvature; surely, by this time it's clear to the reader these concepts are one and the same with wormholes and time-travel. Chapter 11 talks about the unification of physics, starting from the forewarning that many have tried reaching this holy grail of modern physics (and Nobel Prize winner Max Born even stated in 1928 that ""physics, as we know it, will be over in six months"") and going through various unified theories. There's a more cautious take on string theory/theories. Hawking predicts we will obtain a complete unified theory ""within the lifetime of some of us"" (p.185) - so, by 2100? -, due to limits in the energy-mass of particles.Chapter 12 combine with the Appendix on how well the book has withstood the test of time into a remarkable conclusion. The notes about Albert Einstein, Galileo Galilei, and Isaac Newton can be skipped - they seem to punctuate the cautious admiration of the author for some of the greatest names in science, but they are short and overall quite negative.A Briefer History of Time does away with much of the introduction and chops important detail from the original book, but at 140 pages has enough room for the good stuff (including the witty story of how Gamow convinces Bethe to join an article on the beginning of the universe, so that the author's names spell Alpher, Bethe, Gamow, on page 73 of this book) and has much better graphics (but not the awful pic on p. 21, where two semi-nude Marylin Monroes opposite one of the authors illustrate how twice the mass leads to twice the force of attraction). Overall, this is good enough.Analysis:++/- I learned something in physics, both astro and quantum. There are quasars, pulsars, white dwarfs, black holes, nebulae and supernovae; and these are just the big pebbles. Then there are various principles, from testable (exclusion, uncertainty, etc.) to the debatable (anthropic, etc.). I'm not sure if that's all there is to understand time, and I'm not sure this really is a history of time (other than the ideas that time as we understand it started with the Big Bang and/or never started at all under the no boundary condition, if I got it right).+/-- I understand a bit better how the field has evolved. Unfortunately, there is actually very little revised material - a small phrase here, a key experimental result there, but nothing fundamentally changed in the text since the mid-1980s discoveries that form the core of the original book.+++ I learned much about how to present complex scientific material to a general audience. I found most excellent the mix of wit, humor, and gossip that complements the core knowledge and analysis of it. There are even speckles of personality, such as the endearing series of bets Hawking makes with his peers, about the (experimental) overturn of one of his pet ideas. I'm saying that I've learned from this; however, the proof is in the pudding.+++ I learned much about how to present science. There's pleasure in reading about the notion of theory.+++ I learned much about how to present a science - history, key concepts and figures, key debates. --- Again and again in reading books by (astro)physicists, the hubris. By the writing, you'd think this field alone has solved cancer, provided universal healthcare and income, and at the very least made everyone happy on Earth and beyond. Everything is super-important for every human being. Not wanting to understand the origin of the universe makes you a schmuck. The key theories are not just some, but the best theories; the intellectual achievements are not just among the great, but ""the great intellectual achievements"". The use of ""million million [...] millions"" and ""one-tenth of a million million [...] millionth"" may be Cambridge posh, and it's impressive, but still not making things more desirable to know or more useful for everyday Joe. Of course, astrophysicists get to chat all the time to famous people (and to the Pope); namedropping is abundant. (But, all in all, the tone is still less hubris-driven than Astrophysics for People in a Hurry's.)-- Some of the arguments in the book strike me as incomplete. As an example, see the use of an argument based on natural selection to justify why we should have the intelligence and the wit to reach a complete unified theory (p. 13). (There's also namedropping Darwin into the discussion, which every scientist knows is a big plus.)"
152,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15719656-martina-bu-kov,3,"Manny people say that this book is of the category ""bought but not read"" so I am a bit proud of myself that I managed to finish this book till end even though it was a struggle for me. Hawking was a brilliant physicist and real expert in his area and you can realize that as well during reading of this book about universe. I liked his attempt to explain to the broad audience powerful forces that shape our lives in ways anyone can understand. Though the book is very complex and not at all comparable with the Astrophysics for People in a Hurry which was much easier to understand for me. So it is easy to read but harder to comprehend.If this book had been edited better, it would have received a few more stars from me, but I can't reward stubborn scientific pride resulting in false assumptions.What I did not know about Hawking and surprised me was his believes in God and he mentions God several times in book.He explains string theory, quantum mechanics, black holes and white dwarves, and the latest thinking on the future of the universe to be understandable ""for dummies."" At a time when more information is available to more people than ever before, reading a book like this reminds you that understanding still requires effort, and that passive access to information is of only relative worth by itself.

154,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5000206-bianca,4,I sincerely don’t know how I can like a book that I didn’t understand at all. 
155,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/651844-luann,3,"It's good to read a book like this every once in a while! I could feel it stretching my brain. But I'm very glad that I won't be tested on its contents! I know I learned from reading this, but I can't say for sure how much.I could tell that Stephen Hawking was explaining this in the simplest terms possible. To him, it must have felt like he was explaining this so simply that any elementary school student should be able to understand. I enjoyed his conversational tone and his brilliant down-to-earth examples of such grand concepts of the universe. That said, he lost me again and again. If I wasn't well-grounded in so much science fiction literature, movies and TV, I'm not sure I would have been able to follow him at all. :) Although my chemistry, physics, and other science classes in high school and college helped some as well.I also enjoyed finding hints of Stephen Hawking's sense of humor about every 10 pages or so. Finding the occasional phrase that made me chuckle really helped me progress through the text. Some examples:While explaining antiparticles: ""There could be whole antiworlds and antipeople made out of antiparticles. However, if you meet your antiself, don't shake hands! You would both vanish in a great flash of light.""When explaining grand unification energy: ""But a machine that was powerful enough to accelerate particles to the grand unification energy would have to be as big as the Solar System--and would be unlikely to be funded in the present economic climate.""While speaking of theories regarding black holes: ""It is greatly to be hoped that some version of the censorship hypothesis holds because close to naked singularities it may be possible to travel into the past. While this would be fine for writers of science fiction, it would mean that no one's life would ever be safe: someone might go into the past and kill your father or mother before you were conceived!""I was surprised at the frequent mention of God in a book that is all about science. I suppose contemplating such concepts as the origin of the universe does lend itself to at least consider God and his role - even if it is in an attempt to explain away the possibility of God by using scientific theories. Although it didn't seem like he was completely discounting the possibility of God, just that he felt at some point in the future there may be a scientific theory which would explain why we and the universe exist which means that humans would then understand the mind of God. He said, ""The whole history of science has been the gradual realization that events do not happen in an arbitrary manner, but that they reflect a certain underlying order, which may nor may not be divinely inspired."" Also:""With the success of scientific theories in describing events, most people have come to believe that God allows the universe to evolve according to a set of laws and does not intervene in the universe to break these laws.... So long as the universe had a beginning, we could suppose it had a creator. But if the universe is really completely self-contained, having no boundary or edge, it would have neither beginning nor end: it would simply be. What place, then, for a creator?""One of the reasons I read this is because it is on the Lost literature list. One of the show's characters is shown reading the book, and it's also shown in Ben's room. Also, Eloise Hawking shares the author's last name. It also relates due to the time travel aspect and, as I discussed above, the concept of faith versus science.I enjoyed this more than I expected. I'm very grateful he didn't include complicated mathematical formulas! As I said, it's good to read something like this every once in a while. But now I'm looking forward to getting back to some fiction! 3.5 stars."
156,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999881-geoff,2,"I'm not sure 2-stars is a fair rating for this book. Hawking does a great job at explaining some pretty complex concepts in this book while throwing in a few jokes here and there. But for me, this kind of science is just too far on the theoretical side for me."

What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?""..In school, I had little real interest with subjects like this. I only needed to know enough to do well in my exams. But reading this through Hawking's words made it digestible somehow. Even sparked curiousity in me too.But the funny thing is at the end of this book- of all the researches and experiments to date, there always comes something to contradict previous beliefs, always an ""anti"" to something, or results saying that it's there but we still can't see it or prove it-- making man's ultimate answer just a bit out of reach every time..... This makes me understand better and believe more in the line ""The more I study the universe, the more I believe in God"". ..I recommend this to curious minds and rate this a ⭐⭐⭐⭐/5."
158,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5049190-yassin-omar,4,"I really envy those guys! It's the passion that makes this work unique. The passion you feel when you listen - not read! - to these electronic sound waves previously recorded from Hawking's voice, talking to you in the simplest ways to make you realize just flashes of knowledge about this marvelous universe. The passion when you live with progression and evolution of science and Cosmology, from Aristotle 340 B.C. to Ptolemy/Macedonian era in the second century A.D. to the copernican revolution and Galileo's devotion in confronting the Catholic church, passing through Newton and Einstein. All great scientists in history, revealed and explained by one of the great scientists of our era. I got fascinated by the concepts of time, arrows of it, and in particular that of the Thermodynamic one, I think it's because of the underlying Philosophical concepts of chaos, disorder, nihilism, and their implications on one's thought and behavior, and vision to life. “The increase of disorder or entropy is what distinguishes the past from the future, giving a direction to time.” “Only time(whatever that may be) will tell.” Also, I feel quite optimistic/safe with the uncertainty principle and its implications, or I mean that, for science, being almost always relative and uncertain, from that perspective I can depend on it as the closest point to the absolute. To God! Hawking's stress on that point is so clear.""Any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a hypothesis: you can never prove it. No matter how many times the results of experiments agree with some theory, you can never be sure that the next time the result will not contradict the theory.""And I have that sense that the day is coming to connect gravity of the general relativity with quantum theory. COME ON, CERN GUYS! “... if we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason - for then we would know the mind of God.”  And for the record of my misery :D, I remember the year I studied Chemistry in secondary school, ""Duality of the particle"", ""Rutherford's experiment"", ""Bohr's equations"" and ""Planck's Quantum mechanics"" , as I, and all of my colleagues I guess, barely understood these topics and their fundamental implications in real scientific community and for the evolution of knowledge of the entire human race. Another side point that I'm really curious about, is to know much more of Hawking's philosophical and political views. His briefings on Einstein, Galileo, and Newton made feel so. I wish he's on his autobiography.It was a really good companion and a good read. #This book was my friend during the boring clinical rounds in the last year of my medical study at university of Tanta. To those fucking boring moments. :D "

All the concepts are written in a style that makes it easier to understand for many of us, using every life example and Hawking's sense of humor.Definitely worth a re-read as most chapters and theories are quite dense but I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in the subject."

A Brief History of Time
 is a really cool book. Totally awesome. About as awesome as it was over my head. At times, more so at the beginning of the book than at the end, I still held the illusion that I would be able to have a decent understanding of the topics Hawking touched on throughout. No such luck, which is why I had to knock off one star. Accessibility is important, you know?That being said, the concepts that are covered in this book are really difficult concepts. Kudos to Stephen Hawking for making it accessible enough for my brain to grasp even parts of it! And the parts that I did grasp were very interesting, enough so that they reignited my interest in the universe, and further compounded in my head the idea that science is the best. Another thing, Hawking is a great writer. His voice, while being pragmatic and intelligent, is also quite down-to-earth and approachable.For all the people out there who don't have a deeper knowledge of physics except what you've gleaned from the occasional documentary or article (we're in the same boat here), you're probably going to find quantum mechanics the most difficult topic in the book - I know I did. It sucks, because quantum mechanics is important, and Stephen Hawking keeps talking about how it's important, and yet you still don't get it. Here's what I did to combat this realization of my absolute ineptitude: I traveled down the Wikipedia wormhole - many, many times. To finish this off, I'm going to leave you all with a very strong recommendation. If you take one thing, and one thing only, from this review, take this: 
 READ THE ILLUSTRATED VERSION
. Unless you actually know what Hawking is talking about when he says virtual photon with a particle spin of 1"" (and the spin stuff is the worst), then there's no shame in using pictures to help you. Anyway, this review was a bit of an enthusiastic mess, and I promise I actually did understand more of this book than I let on. The four stars was well-deserved. "

THE QUEST FOR COSMIC ONENESS
The progress that Science achieves in understanding the Physical Universe reflects the evolution of the collective human consciousness in its quest for Cosmic Oneness, as the eventual unification of physics in the future will allow man to peek through the mind of God.As Science slowly unravels the mysteries of the Cosmos, it bridges the wide gap between the human reason and the Divine Intelligence, allowing man to discern the complex structure of his existence that enables him to tap his innermost power to create. Slowly fulfilling his eternal quest to unify with the Spiritual God, the source of all consciousness and intelligence, the invisible, mysterious power that triggers the moment of creation during the beginning of time.
A Brief History of Time
 is a highly technical book that summarizes humanity's evolution to understand the Universe. Stephen Hawking chronologically describes the human progress in grasping the Cosmic Grand Design. As it shows how history or rather time itself allows the human reason to be as expansive, as the Universe it is trying to discern. From Ptolemy's Aristotelian inspired geocentric model to Copernicus' heliocentric theory, to Newton's law of gravity and Einstein's general theory of relativity, to the study of minutest particle, quantum mechanics, it vividly depicts the gradual development of human consciousness as it gains a deeper understanding on the nature of existence on a wholistic whole. Hawking then tries to simplify these complex theories, as he rationalizes them for an ordinary reader, attempting to find harmony in its disorder, to create a unified theory of the Universe that will place man on the moment of creation itself. 佛月球 Будда Луны"
164,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Bless you, Hawking, for not lying to me. So many things with the word “brief” in the title are anything but. 200 pages is indeed brief. Not that it wasn’t enjoyable, but my head hurts a bit, so you timed that shit perfectly.I won’t lie to you, either. There were definitely places where no matter how many times I reread a paragraph, I was getting these perfectly grammatical sentences that did not produce meaningful concepts in my head. The cosmological version of Colourless green ideas sleep furiously. Absolutely, Hawking is gentle with us liberal arts students eagerly venturing forth to see how the other half lives (and- this is the truly shocking bit- doesn’t patronize us), but there’s only so much he can do. Still, I come away from A Brief History of Time with a much stauncher understanding of the basics of more-or-less current cosmological theories so cheers. Also, I really, really appreciate the way Hawking approaches science. I don’t mean the way he does science- he’s obviously lightyears away from the rest of us in genius- but I mean the way he thinks about science qua science. He gets that science has its place, but that reality has a lot of aspects to it, and science is but one of the ways of characterizing it, and is not superior to other characterizations or systems of thought:“A scientific theory is just a mathematical model we make to describe our observations: it exists onlyin our minds. So it is meaningless to ask which is “real”... It is simply a matter of which is the more useful description.” Yes.Anyway, it's a classic of pop science and deserves its place at the top- it's a challenging (for the layman) but mesmerizing read.

165,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11434974-sara,5,"Absolutely amazing!This is one of those mandatory books I see referenced everywhere. Stephen Hawking is also a scientist that is very dear of the media and society in general, having making multiple appearances in popular shows such as The Big Bang Theory. So, I had to pick it up to see how his sense of humor would shine in the book. I must admit, I am a fan of the topic but by no means an expert. My knowledge is quite limited on quantum physics and other scientific maters. Still, I'm happy to say I was able to grasp most of the concepts. Hawking was able, with simple comparisons and metaphors, to facilitate the understanding of complex terms like string theories to the reader. In a journey since the beginning of theories about the universe until later discoveries, he is able to sum up the advance in physics and astronomy really well. My favorite part was the discussion of time traveling, that was the chapter I was waiting for! It was so interesting the concepts used and the possibilities... *gasp* To keep in mind, this is a book that is heavy with information and that sinks in slowly. If you don't mind that, and if you have an interest in anything related to space, this is a must read! Pick it up if you can. "
166,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5167235-sophie,4,"I'm really interested in science, I love reading magazines and watching documentaries about astronomy and physics. So it was very natural to me to want to read A Brief History of Time. In this book, Stephen Hawking presents the history of science and the quest to find meaning and definition to the universe. He explains the most followed theories about space-time, the big bang, time travel, string theory, etc.Even though I have quite a lot of general knowledge about those theories (I'm not a trained scientist though), it wasn't an easy read. In terms of pleasure to read, I'd say it's more like a 2 or 3 stars. However, I was really impressed with the writing. I don't think anyone could have explained all those complicated concepts in so few words, but yet to be so clear. To be honest, I had to read some sentences a few times to really grasp their meaning. But Hawking goes strait to the point and doesn't load your thinking process with too many useless words. That way your brain as more power to comprehend all those complex concepts. I gave it 4 stars so people would know it is worth reading.I don't want to scare anyone who's interested in reading this book. It is very interesting and if you're curious about pure science, you should definitely read it. But, you should not go in thinking it is a very popularized version, because it stays quite complex.If you're curious about discovering all those things but in a easier way, I strongly recommend the documentary series The Universe, it is very good and blows your mind with beautiful images of the stars and cosmic phenomena.

167,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7833883-si,1,"This is apparently the second most unread book on British bookshelves, after the bible. Reason enough to have a read.As I started to read this book the language was very non technical and it seemed very accessible. As I got into it however, I started to be disappointed: for some basic things, like describing what probability is, he went into ludicrous detail using patronising analogies. But then it got to the meat of some of the theories, such as Feynman's multiple histories, and he glossed over the idea.The review of ""A Briefer History of Time"" says ""readers have repeatedly told Professor Hawking of their great difficulty in understanding some of the book’s most important concepts"" so it looks like it's not just me.The impression I came away with after reading this book, is that we have some useful theories - general and special relativity, quantum theory, etc. that describe the universe well. However, the impression I got about a lot of the other theories about origins, black holes, boundaries, etc. is that they are made up ideas that might explain things, but nobody really knows. Almost like they're metaphors to describe what might be. Maybe that's his way of getting across what they mean, but then I'd have preferred some more of the thinking behind them, and more of the observations that match the theories.In short, this is probably better as a review of the ideas for someone that already has a good understanding of the physics; I would think that there are better books out there to get the hang of these ideas in the first place"

Of course, since this book has been published for a very long time. Most of the ideas presented in the book are very commonplace now. None the less this was an enjoyable and short read and I loved every bit of it. But sadly I don't think that reading about all the wonderful scientists and their discoveries made me any more intelligent :( after all it is very hard to remember every detail about a book, it may be different for you but you already know about relativity, Ciao.People who don't read generally ask me my reasons for reading. Simply put I just love reading and so to that end I have made it my motto to just Keep on Reading. I love to read everything except for Self Help books but even those once in a while. I read almost all the genre but YA, Fantasy, Biographies are the most. My favorite series is, of course, Harry Potter but then there are many more books that I just adore.

171,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4413597-praxedes,4,"This book delivers what it promises: a short history of our universe. Hawking succeeds in creating a physics book for the masses, simplifying difficult concepts with accessible examples and a bit of humour. I read this book when it first came out back in 1988 and just re-read it for a book club. Thanks to new technologies such as the Hubble Space Telescope many of the original hypotheses have been reaffirmed or rejected since the original publication.I marvelled at the way discoveries built upon each other, creating increasingly complex theories to explain our existence and that of the cosmos. Although at times convoluted, this book is a great primer for anyone who wondered about life and our relationship to existence as seen through the eyes of a scientist.Some concepts are a bit esoteric (such as imaginary time and virtual particles), but overall the book is accessible to anyone with a high school education.Perhaps my favourite part was how Hawking is now emulating his idol, Einstein. Einstein was arguably the father of quantum mechanics, a division of physics he spent most of his later life trying to disprove. This edition finds Hawking doing much the same, questioning his earlier assumptions about the universe and refuting his own original theses."

But that doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll understand it all.I personally think I understood about 70% though, which is a pretty good ratio – I got a C in Science when I studied my GCSEs, and that’s about as far as my scientific career progressed. If you understand 100% of what Hawking is talking about then you’re a genius and if you understand less than 50% of it, you’re an idiot – I reckon you’re probably somewhere in the middle.One of the most difficult concepts to grasp was that of a shape which, when you rotated it 360 degrees, was no longer the same, but which was the same if you rotated it 720 degrees (360 degrees, twice). I’m not even going to begin to understand that, but a lot of the space stuff like the big bang and black holes was well-written and easy to understand. I’m pretty sure that Hawking’s goal was to educate future generations, and he’s sure been successful at that – even more so, if you go and read it yourself."

It doesn't mean I fully understand every term in the book but I'm excited I'm learning something new from such a great alive scientist!Isn't it wonderful how tiniest things in the universe(s) combine together to form a planet, then life, and then a human with thought? Isn't it even greater that a combination of tiniest particle (myself, for example) try to learn a tiniest part about how itself was formed (and would be faded someday)?I read on my Kindle and stopped at 70% of the book.I was sure I got what I wanted from the book. Finishing it wouldn't make me a quantum physicist. I highly suggest this book not to people who are already interested in science but those are not yet but love to understand more about life.I also suggest this book to those who have studied Yi, Yinyang, Fengshui and different philosophies to read this book.

Despite its age (1988 the same year I was born), I felt it held up very well.Only thing stopping me from giving it a perfect rating was that some topics I felt were not explained in simple enough terms for me to understand completely (and I'm a Chemistry major); particularly on topics like particle physics. The majority of the book explained very complex concepts in a way that most people could follow, but there were a few parts of the book which I had to re-read several times to grasp completely.But bottom line its definitely one of the best books on Astrophysics I've read, period."

182,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84465231-aniruddha-rege,5,"*A Brief History of Time* by *Stephen Hawking*Every reader, at some point in his literary journey, is bound to suffer from a mildly inflated ego and a sense of eminence derived from the number of books he has read and the knowledge he has acquired. In such time of delusion, I find it best to pick up a book which I know will put me right back in my place and ensure I stay there for the foreseeable future. Stephen Hawking, a name you may have heard here and there, is a master at writing such books.A Brief History of Time is definitely one of those books. Very erroneously classified as Pop Science by some, Hawking uses the book to take the reader, most of which are certain to be laymen with a rudimentary understanding of what physics, chemistry and science is, on a journey starting with Isaac Newton and Galileo through the likes of Heisenberg and Einstein right to the modern developments in the field of theoretical physics and it’s unending search for the ultimate equation – The Unified Theory. When I read The Theory of Everything last year, Hawking had touched upon many of the topics he covers in far more depth here. However, given that the nature of the topics is so extremely complex, I’d wager he’s barely managed to cover 0.000001% of the depth scientists have actually gone to. This isn’t Pop Science at all. This is a well-written book which does not attempt to hide the fact that these topics cannot be covered in 200 pages.Lucky for us, the purpose of the book is not make us overnight experts in the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. Rather, Hawking fully takes into account that most readers of his book will be undeniably stupid with a pretense of being intelligent, and modifies the purpose of the book to perhaps inculcate an appreciation in our minds of the absolutely incredible progress science has made in enhancing our understanding of the universe and the terrifying distance yet to be covered. Two chapters into the book, I stopped reading it to understand the exact theories being quoted and the mathematical solutions behind the predictions of those theories (I still cannot get behind the concept of imaginary time, to give one of many examples) and started reading it with an intention of gaining that appreciation and maybe a tiny bit of an understanding of where we, as the human race, stand in the universe and why we stand where we stand.Stephen Hawking’s skill as a teller of these tales shows only how much he is in love with his field of study and how much clarity he would have in this field to be able to simplify an extremely complex topic even to this extent. It would take a scientist of the highest intelligence to be able to pull this off, and Hawking does it admirably. It also betrays a slight arrogance, which will be found in most men of that order, and pride in the legacy he carried into the 21st Century. You can feel this pride in the way he talks about the history of theoretical physics from Newton’s discovery of Gravity, the duality of light, Einstein’s groundbreaking Relativity and Heisenberg’s push into the world of Quantum Mechanics. Hawking talks adoringly of the multitude of scientists who gave the theories a little nudge in the right direction, applying knowledge and discoveries from every field to better our understanding of the universe and even more importantly, of how it might have begun. You can also feel his struggle with the understanding of whether there is indeed a God, and his struggle to deny his existence through finally being able to explain the beginning of the universe.A Brief History of Time will not make you an expert in theoretical physics. In fact, it might have the dangerous effect of making people think they know what they’re talking about and get themselves thoroughly embarrassed, if someone in the audience actually knows what they’re talking about. However, it is a book which will teach you a lot more about human nature and how we affect and are affected by the universe around us. It shows us how the theory of time becoming relative instead of absolute completely changes what is possible and what isn’t. It is a book which will tell the discerning reader how discovery of knowledge in one field has a cascading effect on all others and how the best scientists in the world – the ones who truly push the boundaries of science – are curious to know about absolutely everything. In pieces, Hawking allows us a glimpse into the minds of the greatest scientists we have ever known and how they balanced ego with humility to achieve what they achieved. In other pieces, it will tell stories about how fragile science is, with scientists discarding and disproving their own theories when they have newer and better ideas. It allows us a peek into science’s struggle with the existence of a Creator and its eternal search for answers. It shows us how open to change science can be, and how necessary that change is to ensure that it keeps flowing.This is a book definitely worth reading, even if you do not understand 95% of what is written. In the 5% you will understand, you will probably learn more about physics and human nature that most books would manage to teach you in their entirety. Don’t read it to be able to understand Black Holes and be able to argue about their existence, but read it to understand a 500 year old journey of modern physics which has shaped modern society and thinking in a million different ways.A Brief History of Time will tax your brain. But it is a tax you will love paying. This is one history lesson that will hold the future for us, after all."

187,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45313785-sara,3,Wow that was a journey!!Probably one of the hardest books to understand I have ever read. It's definitely not for everyone but particularly liked to learn more about the universe through the perspective of such a brilliant and funny man.

I took almost 2 months to read this book, I think it's due to my lack of knowledge in physics.. I am happy that I finished the book as most of my friends counldnt finish.. it is interesting to read about our universe.."

196,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82113322-booklover69,5,I kinda feel dumber but thats because im not a specialist ofc (also newton was an asshole wtf)
197,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45562158-david-duran,3,Stephen Hawking explains with clarity and easiness some of the most outstanding and complex topics of science. It has been really exciting to read some scientific discoveries I was not aware of.
198,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2764185-chris-shank,3,"This work is lauded as theoretical physics for the layman, but it is no Dummies version. Hawking quickly exhausted any common language and ideas that he and I might have shared, strapped me to the back of his wheelchair, and warped to light speed. And yet, it really was an enlightening read, and I feel better informed regarding the frontiers of science, at least as it stood 20 years ago. It was especially nice to learn from Stephen Hawking, the late 20th century’s Einstein, and the fact that Hawking overcame so much in his lifetime (a quadriplegic suffering from Lou Gehrig’s disease) gives his ideas a courageous flavor. It also helps that the cover art of the 1990 edition totally looks like Hawking is the Emperor in his throne at the last duel between Luke and Darth Vader in The Return Of the Jedi. “Take your weapon. Strike me down! Your journey towards the dark side will be complete!” And I trust this man to escort me “From the Big Bang To Black Holes”? Enough.I really did appreciate the leap to being able to understand, partially at least, the beginning and end of the horizons of the empirically known universe in 182 pages. To be sure, some parts of the book were…shall we say…a black hole sucking all light of the understanding into the fathomless abyss where Hawking sits alone with the key to the origins and ends of it all. Or maybe he doesn’t. It was intriguing to learn that some of Hawking’s “Eureka!” moments weren’t always the byproduct of complex mathematical procedures, but some occurred spontaneously in rather mundane places and times, such as a conversation with one of his students, or during a bedtime routine. In other words, he fortuitously stumbled upon some of his best ideas like any normal bloke, not always painstakingly exhuming them from the deep, ponderous vaults of trigo-calcu-bra. Einstein said that imagination is more important than knowledge, and I definitely see good ole’ fashioned creativity and wonder at work in Hawking as he discovered new worlds (and anti-worlds) for his brain to roll around in. I find it hilarious that at one point he found himself so immersed in ‘imaginative physics’ that when he finally reached irreconcilable contrarities, he had to be reminded by one of his students that he was using imaginary time in some of his formulas, which didn’t always work in real time scenarios. And I feel smart again for a couple seconds.Let it be known, I love having my mind blown. Hawking takes us on the journey of basic physics, but then reaches to the furthest applications of those fundamentals without all the mind-cramping math. He includes only one equation in the book: E = mc^2, and this is simple enough to understand as he explains the implications of Einstein’s Theory Of Relativity on energy (E), mass (m), and the speed of light (c). The beauty of the whole thing is this: it is beyond me. I had to try to picture the ‘color’ beyond the white pages full of static black symbols. The words had to become events. My mind often transposed the convoluted processes into cartoons; after all, much of it only makes sense as story. How else is anyone supposed to understand what is going on inside a star or an atom? Reality transcends mere words. We transpose the unseen, untouched world into pictures, into analogy, into math, into poetry. In the end, science is fiction, language is myth, math is… music! I believe Hawking reconciles himself to the metaphysics of physics, even if it is unconsciously, when he states, “It is meaningless to ask: Which is real, “real” or “imaginary” time? It is simply a matter of which is the more useful description.”It is so interesting that so much of this book is now common knowledge at least in outline: The Big Bang, black holes, the variable nature of time and space. It was new depth in decades-old ideas for me as I relearned Einstein’s theory of relativity, the Uncertainty Principle, and quantum mechanics. I also finally understand a little better the nature of light, color, radio/x-ray/gamma rays…and the whole electromagnetic field that these waves wave on; and I can finally grasp the essentials of Super String Theory, which I’ve come to think is just a way to apply the mystery that particles cannot be differentiated from waves. Holistic cosmological evolution is now outlined in my mind more lucidly than it ever has been before. And I certainly know more now than I EVER wanted to know about black holes!I was a little confused about Hawking attributing a sweeping loss of order to the universe in his elucidation of entropy with barely a nod to increasing order. He concedes the remarkable nature of human consciousness and man’s understanding of the universe, and refers to it as “a small corner of order”, but isn’t that small corner a greater improbability than all of the rest of the universe’s order/disorder put together? In other words, the concentration of evolution in terms of improbably and highly complex structure is weightier than all the entropy of all time. Doesn’t this warrant more attention and awe than quickly dismissing it as ‘a small corner of order’? Is he so eager to prove his point about the ultimate Big Crunch at the end of time, or the absence of cosmic intelligence, that he totally disregards the significance of his own sphere of existence and its rarity?Science, for all it claims of emotional detachment and pure mechanics, so quickly capitulates to egoism. Maybe this betrays my ignorance, but I am always stunned by the amount of angst wrapped up in the competition among the intelligentsia. Maybe this shouldn’t be a huge surprise, but still it is upsetting for me to learn—the scientific community is cutthroat! Reading Hawking’s short bio on John Newton at the back of the book floored me as regards the Machiavellian nature of Newton’s politics that polluted any hope of unbiased research he might have undertook. Who would believe a word he said if they couldn’t reproduce the results themselves? And apparently times haven’t changed: Hawking couldn’t even get through this book on super-physics for the layman, a daunting enough task to warrant cutting out all extraneous drama, without alluding to recent skirmishes between himself and his colleagues, and years later he’s still defending himself, or ostensibly trying not to defend himself. To the credit of Hawking’s scientific integrity, he has admitted at least some of his errors in the past. Immediately following a paragraph in the book in which he asserts “one cannot really argue with a mathematical theorem [referencing his own handiwork of course]”, he humbly acknowledges, “It is perhaps ironic that, having changed my mind, I am now trying to convince other physicists that there was in fact no singularity at the beginning of the universe.” It seems that though one can’t ‘argue with the math’, one can change its meaning, even years later. Two plus two may equal four, but two apples and two refrigerators equal four…what? The idea that science is pure and math is not arguable is nonsense. Simone de Beauvoir rightly said that “every objective description, so-called, implies an ethical background.” We’re all trying to get at something.The last chapter, ‘Conclusion’, was truly startling to read. Hawking all but admits a thirst for some kind of ultimate meaning at the end of the book. “Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?...Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?” I thought it was a brave move, especially after working so hard to debunk God. Then, as if he was the first to ask these questions in an intelligent way, Hawking commits an embarrassing faux pas by accusing philosophers of neglecting their task of asking ‘why’. “Up to now, most scientists have been too occupied with the development of new theories that describe what the universe is to ask the question why. On the other hand, the people whose business it is to ask why, the philosophers, have not been able to keep up with the advance of scientific theories.” He cites Wittgenstein as a “comedown from the great tradition of philosophy from Aristotle to Kant”, and obviously laments Wittgenstein’s linguistic philosophy as drifting away from the real purpose of philosophy. Let us suppose Hawking’s elitist view—that only certain people have the right to ask certain questions—is valid, and suppose it really is solely the philosophers business to ask the ‘why’ as Hawking suggests; then who is he, a mere empiricist, a mathematician, to question another sacred authority? Though I disagree with his accusation of modern philosophy, and though I think he has contradicted himself by questioning a fellow authority that he self-allegedly should be trusting implicitly to work unassailably in their specialized field, I still think he’s right in asking the questions himself. Maybe we all ought to be asking the big questions and making some discovery for ourselves, not implicitly trusting Hawking and Wittgenstein to do it all for us. In the end, the ‘specialists’ can’t save us. They can barely save themselves.That all being said, I really did enjoy the book and I learned a lot. Mystery is necessary for the expanding soul, and we can take comfort in the fact that there isn’t an end in sight. This ‘small corner of order’ is boundless—as deep as it is wide—and the longer the universe expands, the more infinite the scope and intricate the scale. The universe we know will always be a door to a larger universe as long as something keeps urging us to ask ‘what’ and ‘why’. And the question itself signals more; and if nothing else, we can always squeeze back through the small hole the question itself slipped in at. There’s always more for those who want more."
199,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,4,"This book is a model of clarity and certainly is brief. Though it is known for readers not finishing it, that can't be due to lack of skill in Hawking's writing. He avoids math as much as possible never using a formula, but at a certain point delving further into the nature of things requires the use of math concepts that simply cannot be visualized.In fact the progress that has been made in the last century in getting down to the foundation of reality has been due to abandoning common sense, to disregarding appearances and going with non-intuitive thinking that leaves everyday perception behind.All through the book intriguing questions are raised - how did the universe begin? Can time run backward? Why does the universe appear the same in all directions, yet have a clumping of matter that we see as galaxies and groups of galaxies? Wouldn't probability suggest the universe could take many forms instead of ours being unique?Hawking starts by summarizing where physics stood at the opening of the 20th century when the world described by Newton was failing to explain recent experimental discoveries. The remarkable thinking of Einstein followed, he realizing that it is the speed of light and not our traditional ideas of space and time that is absolute. Space and time are inseparable, to be called spacetime with matter and energy interchangeable by a factor of great magnitude - the speed of light. But Einstein's general relativity was to be superceded at subatomic levels by quantum mechanics with the all important concept of uncertainty - that there is a limit to what we can know about position and velocity. The greater the precision of our measurement of one, the less will be known of the other.What might be a bewildering array of tiny particles at the atomic and subatomic level are lucidly described by Hawking including virtual particles that bind real particles through exchange. He made clear to me the concept of spin as a particle characteristic, something that I had not understood. He brings in an idea that I had not encountered before of the possibility that at very high energy levels all of the different particles lose their defining characteristics to become all of a kind, as was the case at the ""big bang"" when the universe that we know is thought to have begun.It is also suggested that at this extremely high energy level (far higher than that at the center of our sun) what we identify as separate forces would lose there distinguishing characteristics. These forces are gravity, the electromagnetic force that binds the electron to the atomic nucleus, the force that causes radioactive decay, and the force that keeps the protons and neutrons of the atomic nucleus bound together. With the cooling after the big bang of creation, these forces would differentiate within a matter of hours.Hawking writes of the free exchange of matter and energy that happens so fast we cannot detect it. Even in what we call empty outer space (which is never lacking energy fields) particles and antiparticles of matter spontaneously appear only to immediately reunite and be gone.A case is made over the course of the text that our universe may not have started out as a single point of infinite density and zero time, which is called a singularity, but may be eternal yet bounded having no beginning or end in time yet being self contained and limited in extent.Hawking's early work was on describing the nature of a singularity and the black hole that would surround it. Here gravity would be so powerful that not even light could escape, making it appear black. Everything would be sucked into this hole that was close enough to get caught. Given enough matter in a star, a black hole would be inevitably created. A black hole would have mass, increasing with all that it would pull in, but this process would not continue forever and eventually a black hole could disappear from losing energy through a process worked out by Hawking that he describes clearly.I found the book enjoyable but necessarily a slow read with my pencil scribbling notes on almost every page. Only when he discusses the need of infinities in mathematics and the usefulness of imaginary time to reduce the number of infinities could I say that I had no idea what he was writing about. But that only occupies a few pages and isn't necessary to understand (as only a mathematician could) to get what follows. I suspect this is where he lost many readers, but you need not be one of them.If any book can be called thought provoking, it is this one."

This has been the case for me with most science related books, but especially ones that are very mainstream and break down complex subjects to make them understandable for everyone. The reason is that in most cases I don’t learn a lot of new things that I didn’t already know. It happens very rarely that this kind of book gives me a new view on things. But just because I personally don’t benefit from the book, doesn’t mean that others – who aren’t in the fourth semester of their physics degree – won’t. It also doesn’t mean that I don’t have a huge appreciation and respect for an author being able to make things this simple. It takes a much deeper understanding than I have to do this.Okay, so now I’ll stop rambling about NF in general and let you know my thoughts on this book, because that’s probably why you’re here. Stephen Hawking makes it incredibly easy to understand those big concepts that make our world go round. If you don’t know anything about physics or astronomy, this is exactly where I’d recommend you start. I completely understand why this became so popular.I do have to say that I did learn a few things that I didn’t know beforehand, there is a lot of information in this book that’ll come in handy for a paper I need to write, and it even made me understand one of my classes’ main topic better. Therefore, it did all I expected from it. But had I not picked this up for my paper, but to read it in my free time, I think I might have been a little disappointed.So, if you’re in a science degree or are reading a lot on that topic and you feel like you need to read this, let me tell you: No, you don’t. You probably already know most of this. Read it for fun if you want to, but don’t expect it to be lifechanging.4/5"
201,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72293965-thuy-dinh,5,"Professor Stephen Hawking was an exceptional teacher who can deliver such complex and abstract ideas through sharp explanations, simple language and brilliant analogies.Concise yet rich and thought-provoking, this book is like an interesting textbook on modern physics. He walks us through how our knowledge of the universe evolves from time to time: From a very primitive Earth-centric model, to Space and Time (and Spacetime) concepts, the discoveries of fundamental constituent of the universe (elementary particles) and fundamental forces. To tell us about the origin, the development and the ending of the universe, he focuses on 2 cosmological phenomena which are Big Bang and Black holes; explained mainly on the basis of 2 modern theories: General relativity and Quantum mechanics. The book ends with the current effort of developing the unified theory of the two: The quantum gravity theoryReading the book, one outside the field can truly understand that being a (great) theoretical physicist not only requires intelligence, logical thinking and being extremely great at algebra and calculus, but a theoretical physicist also has to be truly an artist with extraordinary imagination ability and creative thinking, to go beyond boundaries, to bend previous knowledge and sense of the world in order to form new understanding of things.As put by Einstein: “The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge, but imagination.” “Knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution.”—The book is written for general audiences with no prior knowledge of (mentioned) scientific theories required. However in order to easily comprehend the book, one may need to be familiar with some basic concepts (and formula) from classical physics:- Law of motion- Gravity (and orbits)- Optics- Waves- Thermodynamics- Electromagnetism- Classical mechanics"
202,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14106330-amy-suzanna,3,"I have conquered one of the most iconic science books ever written! I can see why so many people started but never finished when it was first released, the concepts introduced back then were pretty radical, but for a modern reader who is aware of scientific ideas it's actually fairly easy to follow for the first 4 chapters. After that it gets a little more difficult as the ideas introduced become more complex, but it is possible to be a novice and still get through it. I had two main problems with the book, both of which are more to do with the passing of time than with Hawking's narrative style. Firstly, and I am aware that this is a minor gripe, it annoyed me that every example involving a human used the pronoun 'he'. Astronaut, scientist, whatever, despite the fact that women had and were doing those jobs at a high level in 1988, only men are mentioned in hypothetical situations used to illustrate how concepts work. Another was that science has moved on and some of the things that are mentioned as not having been fully explored or understood are now. That is obviously unavoidable, but anyone reading the book now with an in depth scientific knowledge may find that slightly jarring. But it is still well worth a read, particularly this year in memory of the man we have so recently lost."
203,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50253762-ema,5,"4 stars? No, just make it 5. I've thought about it for some time and yes it definitely deserves 5 stars. I don't think anyone who is not familiar with physics will understand most of this book but listen, how exactly would one simplify the beginning of the universe and everything in between? I still think Stephen Hawking did a great job of explaining all of these highly mysterious stuff we only hear about in science fiction and made it somewhat approachable for all of us. This does not seem like an easy feat to me considering all the mathematics involved in this particular field of physics. This book was exactly what I was looking for. Physics has always been one of my favourite subjects although it wasn't something I was particularly good at and since I'm specialising in a field that has pretty much nothing to do with physics I wanted a good book that would be a good foundation for space-time and all that jazz. This book covers all the topics from Einstein's theory of General relativity to Quantum physics and the pursuit of a grand unified theory. Not gonna lie I had to stop multiple times and just dive into YouTube videos to understand a lot of concepts and yet some flew way over my head. Which is kind of why I was on the fence about giving this book 5 stars because I don't think most people would want to put so much effort into reading one book. But hey if you're interested in this subject then this book is an absolute godsend. I'd still encourage everyone to read this book though, because you're still gonna come out of it with answers to some questions you've been wondering your whole life. But if you actually want to read direct answers to those questions I'd recommend reading Brief Answers to the Big Questions by Stephen Hawking. It's short and I'd say I caught most of it lol."
204,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55190721-jessie,5,"Dad jokes, dad jokes everywhere!Definitely a must-read for any beginners exploring the concepts in cosmology and astrophysics. There are almost no equations in the book, just concise and clear explanations of ideas and theories from a legend in the field. The book's valuable regardless of its age. Many of the theories still hold up, and the questions are still relevant. I was curious as to his take on God. I'm not religious, but contemplating the universe can sometimes give you a similar feeling to religion, albeit with different approaches and for different reasons. I wonder if this is what he meant, or if he literally meant ""God"" each time he mentioned him. Or both, or maybe neither. Maybe he was just referring to others' perceptions of what God might be. He was vague regarding God, but for a scientist, he sure mentioned him a lot. Of course, I can always google the answers, but I want to think about the questions first and pretend instant gratification doesn't exist. Anyway, it was a quick and enlightening book by someone who didn't just research the work of other astrophysicists, but also obviously pioneered plenty of work himself. It's clear where present popular science writers get their inspiration! (Yes, the exclamation point was intentional! Exclamation points were all over this book! Almost as much as dad jokes! But I appreciate them far less!)"
205,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28298345-bruce-freedman,1,"A long flight is hard enough without bringing an obscure and unreadable book. And of all the books I’ve ever regretted bringing on a flight, no book stands out more than Hawking’s A Brief History of Time.I’d heard about the book years before I decided to read it. The catalyst to finally buy it was an article that stated Hawking believed in God. In fact, according to the article, not only did Hawking believe in God, but he had proven His existence in the book! Now, I was a self-professed agnostic. But here was a scientist, with one of the biggest brains to have ever existed, who believed otherwise. I had to read his book.Before I go any further, I should probably point out that as I prepare this review, I have not been able to find any article in which Hawking said he believes in God. The internet, which can provide me with everything from Santa Claus’ website to proof that unicorns live on Mars, has yielded me nothing. In fact, according to today’s version of Wikipedia, Hawking has said he does not believe in God. I don’t know how I messed this up, but it appears that for all these years I was wrong. I did not have to read the book. Too bad I didn’t know this back then. I could have avoided much hardship.But back in the past, my perception that Hawking believed in God got me very excited. This was not your rabbi or your priest telling you to have faith. This was one of the greatest scientists to ever live. If he had convinced himself that there was a divine creator, I had to understand why. But there was a problem. I couldn’t understand the damn book.The first time I tried to read A Brief History of Time was twenty years ago, on a flight from Hong Kong to Bali. It was the only book I’d brought with me. I got no further than page twenty-two. I blamed it on the ‘riveting’ inflight flick, Look Who’s Talking Too.On the return flight, I decided to give the book a serious second attempt. I did not succeed. I did not get one page further than twenty-two. Not because of distractions (the inflight film had not changed), but because my head hurt (the inflight film had not changed). Moreover, the book did not exactly flow easily into my brain. I felt like I was reading a foreign language. Nothing made sense. I even double-checked the page numbers to make sure that no pages had gone missing. Nope — the book was perfectly intact.In the years that followed, I have picked up the book another three or four times. I always start from the very beginning and I always read it with a pencil, a dictionary and a pad of paper — so I can take notes. During my most recent attempt — five years ago — I even read it in front of my computer, so I could google any concept that I did not understand. Yet, I never got any further than page twenty-two. The first twenty-two pages of my copy are as worn as the wheels on Hawking’s wheelchair, while the rest of the book is as clean and untouched as his shoes.Now I may not be a science guy but I’m not a stupid guy either. I graduated from McGill University with distinction. I scored in the 98th percentile on my GMAT. The fact that I decided not to get an MBA is probably indicative of even higher cognitive abilities. So I refuse to accept that I’m the problem.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes once said, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”While it may be unorthodox to take counsel from a fictional character, one can't deny the brilliance of Holmes’ supposition: If I do not understand the book and I am not stupid, then the book itself must be stupid.But what about all the rave reviews that Hawking and his book have received? How can they all be wrong?Back in my university days, I worked as a teaching assistant and lectured in real estate finance. One portion of the course had some very complicated math. As I prepared my lecture, months after I had taken the course myself, I realized that I’d forgotten the essential principles. So what did I do? When I got to that part of the lesson, I simply said, “The math here is pretty straightforward. I’ll leave it to you to do on your own time. Let’s move on to the next chapter. Any questions?”Not a single person asked me a question.The consensus view is that Hawking is the most brilliant physicist since Einstein. But how do we know that all this praise isn’t just a case of scientists not wanting to admit that they have no idea what he is saying, because they do not want to look stupid? So they worship and flatter him, and hope that nobody asks them to explain what he’s saying.Consider the possibility that Hawking isn’t really the greatest living physicist but is in fact the greatest living con man. The setup could not be better. We’re told Hawking cannot speak because of a tracheotomy some years back. Using head and eye movement to control a computer program, he selects words that are converted into voice via a computerized speech synthesizer. The process is very time-consuming. Just articulating fifteen words can take up to a minute. Is it any wonder then that audiences hang on his every word? And if he doesn’t answer a question properly, who would dare cross-examine him? Not if they want to get away in time for lunch.It’s like The Wizard of Oz. And just like the wizard, if you took away Hawking’s gimmicks and electronic trickery — that futuristic wheelchair and his computer voice controls — would we be left with anything other than another skinny guy who’d have trouble getting a date?In any event, last week I bought Hawking’s latest book, A Briefer History of Time. It says on the inside front cover, “readers have repeatedly told Professor Hawking of their great difficulty in understanding some of the book’s most important concepts.” So this new book is an attempt by Hawking to make his knowledge accessible to readers who could not understand the original. Nice. The book cost me thirty bucks — maybe he is brilliant after all. I’ll let you know how it goes, but I’ll be taking a Grisham next time I hop on a plane."
206,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7813066-gerhard-venter,5,"To me, this book had one function: to finally understand the general theory of relativity. There's a little story behind this: in the 80's in South Africa TV was still new, and Carl Sagan's documentary about space (oh, yes, it was called 'Cosmos') was watched religiously. On the night when he was going to explain relativity, I was ready with my popcorn and blankie. Just as I sat down and the opening sequence started, the doorbell rang: it was a friend with a six-pack of beer in his hand. A dear, dear, friend, but not one who was interested in Einstein or physics. That was it. My last chance to understand relativity — gone!And that's where Hawking's 'Brief History of Time' comes in. It was my second chance. And it worked. A cherished book on my shelf. One of those that you can read cover to cover, but also go back to for reference.No home should be without it.PS: My copy was practically destroyed by my grandchildren. They dog-eared it, they drew in it, they dragged it along to school. Never did the destruction of my property give me greater joy."
207,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70879977-sonali,0,"Okay, so, I don't think this was a kind of book that could be 'listened to' because there is an information overload. I am the kind of person for whom the concepts of Quantum Mechanics and Theory of General Relativity are akin to pineapple on pizza—I don't get it. But that is not to say that I didn't increase my know-how; I did. I just couldn't retain quite a lot of stuff.~As I had mentioned in my previous review, I was a space nerd growing up, but time and black holes were something I was too young to understand. Even though I didn't understand the small technicalities, I could wrap my head around its basic concept. It had a lot of interesting concepts like the big crunch, the concept of the Universe, space-time, and, of course, black holes.~It is an easy read for someone who is into this field and wants to know more about it. This book will give a good idea to any beginner in space theories and about our universe in a concise and crisp manner.~I am not going to rate it because I don't think it's fair to do so."
208,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2393718-nick,3,"This book can seem intimidating to review because most of us don't have the scientific/mathematical background to confirm or refute Hawking's arguments. I will say this however: his presuppositions are showing ; ) He will make casual, off-handed remarks about God and what it appears that God has or has not done, about human beings' significance in the world, etc. But these notions are beyond the realms of science. But on most of these statements, Hawking pulls his punches. I was surprised by the amount of humor in the book. He really does try to lighten the load, but so many of the concepts in this book are so abstract, theoretical, and otherwise so alien to our everyday reality that I had to pace myself (and usually take a nap afterwards).This is good stuff to wrestle through. Just understand that just because Hawking was very knowledgeable in certain areas, doesn't mean that his take on everything was correct. "
209,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20087831-tahmidul,5,"This book was one of the best I've ever read, all genres combined. Dr. Hawking's sense of humor is pretty shockingly awesome! There are no equations, no true in-depth analyses. That's what makes the book so easy and fun. The diagrams are helpful. The little stories, personal and impersonal, are fun. This not just a book about cosmology, astronomy and physics. This is also a literary masterpiece. Amazing how a guy who was supposed to die in 1965 lives to write a book this great in 1988 (23 years smack on the face of death).A Brief History of Time might be a bit outdated, since it's been a while (29 years!), but still awesome. One can learn a lot from this book. Not only about the big bang, but about the development of physics. The transition of physics from the Classical to the Modern. Thrilling!"

I bet its annoying to get updates of me editing my review, but I have decided I cant give any stars at all to this brief history of time. I didn't finish it, I didn't get it, I wont rate it.Previous review:I appreciate what Stephen was doing here, but this book was not written for the likes of me. This is my first audio book and I suspect that if I had actually tried to read it I wouldn't have made it through chapter one. As it is, I managed 6 with the help of whoever read it aloud to me in the car. I have to admit to myself that I haven't learned anything because I understood very little.. the reason I don't understand it, I hope is is because I don't have an interest in the topic and not that I am dim. This was a one star reading experience but I.m giving it two because I feel it might be my bad."
211,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9472436-natalia,3,"I hate to give this book such an underwhelming rating, but hear me out:So I received this book 15 years ago, when I was a teenager, as a gift. Since then I started reading this book literally dozens of times. I wanted to understand it, but I didn't. ""Not yet"", I thought. ""I'll become more knowledgeable about physics and then progress step by step."" But by now I have a somewhat decent understanding of physics (at least for someone who studied economics at uni) and I decided to go ahead and figure out what the deal was with this book. And I realized the problem isn't primarily me. The problem is that this book operates under the motto ""If you don't know, you won't know."" Here's the thing: while there are some fascinating passages in this book that should be approachable for many people, a large chunk of this book requires very solid background knowledge of physics to follow the train of thought. And those people probably don't have much to learn here. And while I definitely gained some astounding insights, it doesn't completely make up for all the parts that are not properly explained for the typical audience of popular science books.Oh, and since I read the illustrated edition: the pictures were visually pleasing, and some helped with understanding... and others were nice decoration, nothing else."
212,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1859681-dianna,5,"I loved this book! I'm not a scientist, but I found Stephen Hawking's ideas on cosmology and physics fascinating. I also like how he talked about the Catholic church's historical role in science, and their takes on scientific ideas through the years. He talks a lot about people's ideas one way or another that the existence of God goes against science of vice-versa, but as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I found the ideas he presented 100% compatible with my ideas of God.The narrator of the audiobook I listened to (Michael Jackson—no, not that one!) was excellent and I really enjoyed listening to him. "
213,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59318919-safder,4,"Stephen Hawking gives a lucid explanation of complicated scientific phenomenons e.g. how time is relative? I remember watching for the first time the movie ""Interstellar"" (2014). A team of astronauts landed on a planet (near a black hole) leaving a fellow astronaut behind on the space station. They hardly spent an hour on that planet, but when they returned back to the space station 14 years had passed! This book gives an easy explanation of the concepts like Relativity and Uncertainty Principle etc. in plain words without any mathematical equation. A layman not having a scientific background, like me, can easily understand."
214,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30576499-samantha,3,"Science isn't my best area, but Hawking kept me mostly interested throughout the book. I appreciate how he gave simplified examples of many complex concepts explored here, breaking matters down for the average person to understand without needing a huge science background. A bonus for me was that this is not merely a book of how time and space work and are constructed; it is an historical account of how we got from staring into the heavens to what astrophysicists, astronomers, and cosmologists know today and are still yearning to discover. I loved following the track of views from different groups of people and scientists throughout history. A Brief History of Time, while written by Stephen Hawking, is not just his findings but a culmination of time and space theories from a multitude of scientists leading up to modern thinking. Admittedly, some content flew over my head, but I liked it overall."

(immediately followed by confessing how little I understood of it )"
216,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113722526-salar-shamchi,4,"Stephen Hawking delivers what he promises in this book, which is to explain the unexplainable to the average people. I must admit however that I struggled with some of the concepts, especially when it came to quantum mechanics. Although one might argue that it's either my inability to grasp these complicated subjects or it's their inherent complexity rendering them incomprehensible, concluding that it's not Hawking's fault. But in my defense, I did encounter a few phrases or concepts or even theories which were only pointed out and not really explained. But then again it's just a relatively short introduction to cosmology with its target audience being the average people. So I shouldn't really expect to learn everything from it. But including a few easy to understand references for the bits which were left out would have been awesome.When it comes to my take on the material of the book however, probably the most noteworthy influence of this book (or any other material on cosmology) is the realization of our lives' sheer insignificance and perhaps even the insignificance of the whole existence in its entirety. It leaves you with a lot of thoughts and questions on which you can ponder and maybe have a better grasp of your life's meaning or the lack thereof. And for me that's what makes this book special and worthy of reading."

Perfection simply doesn't exist.....Without imperfection, neither you nor I would exist""It was a good overview of the evolution of our understanding of the laws of nature starting from the times of Aristotle, with many not-so-widely known facts and thought-motivating discussions. As the name and the length of the book imply, the overview of the whole history is supposed to be brief, which is undoubtedly an ambitious task. The author put a lot of effort to make the material more approachable for the general audience by describing complicated concepts using illustrations and real-world examples. Nevertheless, throughout the read, it was slightly unclear what the target audience of the book was supposed to be. While the book starts with the explanation of very basic concepts, such as Newton's laws of motion, much more complex ideas are often described quite briefly. For example, I doubt that the average reader with no specific knowledge of quantum mechanics will be able to comprehend the part of the book devoted to its evolution."
218,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5793994-zachary,5,"Mind-blowingly amazing. Thoroughly impressed by its readibility and his clear explanations. Foreword aside (some note on how the whole book is about God which is a bit ridiculous and clearly designed to up sales), this might have been my favorite read in a long time. It certainly re-instigated in me an appreciation for astronomy and a much better understanding of General and Special relativity, as well as a much better understanding of the universe and how we know what we know. 6/5 starss, can't believe it took me this long to read.

I bought this book back in 2013 (I know) and had started a few times since, but never fully finished. However, this time was THE time. I enjoyed the book a lot, especially the wittiness of Hawking and the small stories that tells us in between lines of theories and problems. I can't lie and say that it was an easy read. It wasn't. My knowledge of physics is scarce, but I did enjoy the simple way Hawking tries to explain things, repeating them over and over again until you get the slightest idea of what he's talking about. I do think it's an interesting book for everyone who's curious about the universe in a broader perspective. It doesn't go too detailed with theories or maths (thanks god), but it does give you the sufficient information for you to understand the basics of what certain theories are trying to convey. "
220,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47481919-c-patrick-g-erker,5,"A book that makes you wonder all the big wonders. I read this right before and right after our son Henry was born, and so its penetrating questions of why and how hit even deeper. It's hard for me now to look into my son's little eyes without contemplating the mysteries of how in the heck he got here with me. While the talk of 10 dimensions, quarks, etc., often zoomed over my head (especially when I was taking a short city hike from our house in SF, distracted a bit by the beauty here), I caught enough to have a deeper curiosity, if not fully understanding, of our existence.It's the kind of book I wish I'd taken a class on in college, to have had a guide through it. Even still, worth checking out."

It did however mention many theories that completely went over my head. Nevertheless, its an excellent book by its own right. I would definitely recommend this for the curious minded."
222,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26059564-andre,4,"I was always curious, but postponed this one with fear of it being too technical. It is actually not THAT technical, but one needs to have a basic understanding of some of the theories to prevent getting completely lost (space-time, big bang, quantum physics and the uncertainty principle, wormholes, etc). I actually recommend starting with the “cosmos” series on the tv. A great (and historically important) book, not that easy to follow, but indispensable."

I like learning about things that aren’t in my wheel house from people who have made them their life’s work. Unfortunately, I just couldn’t gel with this subject material. I do think I made the right choice for me in listening to the audiobook version of this book because it would’ve taken me forever to get through it otherwise.On the other hand, listening to the audiobook made it easier to tune things out. I think if I had read the physical version, maybe it would’ve stuck in my head better.Anyway, I respect Stephen Hawking for all of his research and for how smart he is.

But propably my horrible sleeping schedule is to blame and not the book itself.

225,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63254500-martin-sevecek,4,"Stephen Hawking truly was a genius. However, it is not clear who the target audience is for this book. Expect that you will understand maybe around 40% of the book, while in the rest he talks about very advanced theories that are not really explained to basic people. But those 40% will blow your mind. So I recommend to focus on the 40% and flip through the complicated parts instead of trying to understand them and wonder whether other readers got it. They didn't either :) "

It covers progress of physics from ancient times through the classical physics of Einstein to the particle physics of quantum world.

It does not cover the topics into great of a detail, but it is great stepping stone for intermediate physics enthusiasts.I am glad I was part of group reading for this book, i ve got great tips for further reading for topics that were interesting to me."

Most of it I could easily grasp, some were quite arcane and obscure for me to fully comprehend, but it didn't hinder my overall understanding of the topic at hand. It all comes down to Hawking, renowned genius and obviously very knowledgeable and versed in his field, who brilliantly managed to get across such complex theories and reasonings in a way that could be, more or less, be absorbed by a layman like me. There's also a clear own, personal voice seeping through the page, making the whole experience more pleasurable and less boring - he also does convey a charming sense of humour. All in all, I'm surprised by how much I've enjoyed this little book and I do feel a little less ignorant on the matter. I will probably try and pick up another work from Hawking shortly. "

Granted it was interesting all the different theories and how it all interconnects in some way, but personally I can't remember one theory to the next, and as a result this makes it hard to remember what was last spoken about, when I have to leave it alone every few days just to take a break from it. So the first 30% I did was interesting but it doesn't fully hold my interest enough to finish the book, probably because I'm not smart enough to understand remember them all. Oh well, never mind. For others I can see why they love the book."
249,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50647721-soheil,3,"Prior to reading this book, I had read Hawking's The Universe in a Nutshell. While that book was more accessible and understandable by a physics amateur such as myself, this one delves further into technicalities of physics impeding the understanding of their implications on our day to day life.Hawking has painted a picture of how our knowledge of the universe has expanded from the past to now, but in getting there, he definitely has left out most of the readers; the reason being that some parts of the book are unnecessarily too complicated.It is noteworthy to say that Hawking acknowledges my aforementioned point and takes a more accessible narrative in The Universe in a Nutshell.I am happy I read this book because it helped me to catch up with a lot of what physics has achieved since my high school and university days. However, I would have enjoyed it more, had it been more comprehensible at times."

255,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105587657-jack-leitch,4,Nicely written and an enjoyable read thanks to the big Hawk. Not too much new stuff in here for me and the stuff that I haven’t come across before wasn’t explained in too much depth so felt a bit unsatisfied in that sense but a good book nonetheless.
256,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1679953-bogdan,3,"If I would come across this work 1-2 years ago, when I was very interested on the topic and searched for materials on it, it would perhaps make a better impression on me. Now, I already viewed several documentary films on the topic and downloaded some iTunes classes. So I was more interested to compare it with the other sources rather than learning too many things from it.The premise in this case is a nice one. Stephen Hawking takes the role of a scientist that wants to translate into regular language and popularize the latest physical theories. Thus it will help us, regular guys that have only basic knowledge on high-school physics, to learn a little bit how the universe works and what the scientists believe about its final fate. At least partially he made it, so I will give it a 4 for premise.On the form element, I will need to deduct few points for the several paragraphs where it lost my attention due to obscure explanations. But I am not the regular reader for which it was perhaps intended, as I had some previous contact with these theories. Maybe that regular reader would be lost after first few pages. So I cannot rate it more than 2 at form.In terms of originality, I need to confess that I have not read similar works lately. But I haven't searched for them as well, so there may be a lot out there. And you cannot be original too much in such a work, but only decide on the content and how it will be presented. I will rate it with a 4.Although usually this may not be applicable, I will discuss about the characters from this book. The author is one of them as he discusses pretty much on where he added his contribution to the theories presented. He also introduces some other scientists from various ages, but refrains from adding too much anecdotes about them. He keeps these characters in their strictest scientific sense, so I will rate it with a 3.Regarding the complexity and difficulty, I believe it is always a hard task to translate scientific models into day to day language. He did not succeed always, but definitively tries it out. I also recall Stephen from some documentary films and he had very little trouble, apparently, from converting the scientific theories into day to day words. I will rate it with a 2 for complexity and difficulty.In terms of credibility, I believe the book contains the latest knowledge available to the author. But as the rate of scientific discoveries in astronomy and physics is very high, I think that some of it is already out of dated or could be enhanced by newest theories and experiments. I especially did not liked that he did not included too much about the dark matter, dark energy and insisted too much on the Big Crunch scenario, for the ending of the universe. I think that most scientists now believe there will be no Big Crunch but an eventually expansion of the universe until even the strong interaction force will be to weak to keep together the atoms. At least this is what I learned from other sources, so I will rate it with a 3 for credibility.The last criteria is edition. I read a Kindle edition translated into Romanian, and the translation was pretty good. What I did not liked it was the fact that some drawings were not included and this could have helped the reader to digest the book easily. And also some included drawings had a poor quality on my Kindle black and white display. I will rate it for edition with a 2.To summarize, I liked it but offered few things new to me. It could have been better, but I will always praise such attempts of science popularization. All in all, my final rating for this work is 2.86, rounding it up to a 3 stars on Goodreads system.+--------------------------+-----------------+| Criteria | Rating |+--------------------------+-----------------+|Premise | 4 |+--------------------------+-----------------+|Form | 2 |+--------------------------+-----------------+|Originality | 4 |+--------------------------+-----------------+|Characters | 3 |+--------------------------+-----------------+|Difficulty/Complexity | 2 |+--------------------------+-----------------+|Credibility | 3 |+--------------------------+-----------------+|Edition | 2 |+--------------------------+-----------------+|Total | 2.86 |+--------------------------+-----------------+For more details on how I rated and reviewed this novel, please read these guidelines."

Can you limit it?Written in the early 1990s, some of the material in this book is certainly out of date (Hawking himself admits that scientific developments outpace the layperson's and even the professional's ability to keep up with everything). Nevertheless, in his bold venture, one of the best minds of our generation (certainly up their with the giants he references) exposes some of the inner mystery of the universe. Indeed, while some of the material soars over my head (most of it conceptual), I learned a great deal from this book and I think you will too. Nor is this a dry text. His occasional wit arises from the chaotic ether of complex ideas like flashes of antiprotons bursting to life. For example, he once remarks that he came up with a great idea about black holes while getting ready for bed which, he notes, took a long time because of his ALS. Hawking, now in his early 70s, is himself a bit of an oddity. When he was diagnosed early in his life he was not expected to live past 25 and most with his degenerative motor disease are not expected to live much past their 50s. He admits that following this diagnosis he considered giving up his PhD. However, ""I was not that much worse [after a couple years]. In fact, things were going rather well for me and I had gotten engaged to a very nice girl, Jane Wilde. But in order to get married, I needed a job, and in order to get a job, I needed a Ph.D."" (49). In addition to being a monument of the capacity of the human mind, he is a monument to the capacity for humans to endure.If you are interested in astrophysics, the nature of the universe, the history of science, or just understanding a bit more of the world around you, I would recommend this book with a caveat. Unless you have a good background in physics (I am coming at this text from the position of an interested lay-person), much of it will go over your head. (Probably, many cleverer people than me might get more from it.) It is NOT mathematical, however it does require its reader to have a strong apparatus of visualization. AKA, you need to be able to picture what he says. There are diagrams, but these were for me often inscrutable. (Can someone help me out with the light cone.)I'm digging the universe metaphors, so here is another. Much like the universe itself, this is a text that benefits the reader the deeper and the more she or he examines it. I have no doubt that if I dove into this text again (it is not long, though dense) I would get even more from it. Big picture: the universe is complex: ""If everything in the universe depends on everything else in a fundamental way, it might be impossible to get close to a full solution by investigating parts of the problem in isolation"" (11). Yet, we understand what we don't understand and that is a good thing. At a macro level, objects obey the dominating law of gravity which is predictable and clean (in Newtonian models). However, once we get down to the atomic and subatomic levels, into the murky realms of quantum mechanics, things get really tricky. Throughout the book, Hawking reasserts that Grand Unifying Theories (or GUTs) seek to bridge the apparent gap between the predictable models we deal with on a daily basis and the probabilistic, spontaneous, and unpredictable realms of quantum mechanics. At the end of the book he asks an important question that is the one that often bothers me because, admitting that I know comparatively little about all of this stuff, I still wonder about the ""why?"". As Hawking put it: ""Up to now, most scientists have been too occupied with the development of new theories that describe the what the universe is to ask the question why"" (174). God is invoked throughout the text, something in a blase nod to the religious implications of understanding the moments of the universe's creation, at other times in a seemingly sincere invocation. I am giving this book 4 stars rather than 5 for the simple and selfish reason that I wanted to understand more and I needed more to understand more. Some of the explanations were so far over my head, the complex discussions that lasted for pages became a sort of frustrating buzz of noise from which I could gather no meaning. This is selfish because I know I could understand it (at least more of it) if I go back, do some research, and return, which I might do. "

261,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67018549-sumit-kumar,5,A highly informative and well-explained book that takes you on a journey back in time. The author has done a really good job in explaining complex concepts and theories about the universe. 
262,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7118702-loy-machedo,5,"Loy Machedo’s Book Review – Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawkins1988 - A Brief History of Time was first published. 1999 - I purchased it 2012 – I finally decided to read it and completed reading it. Crazy right?It took me nearly 13 years to pick up the courage to read a book I never thought I could complete. Imagine the jungles of fear and inhibitions I had to walk through just to pick up the courage to finally read this masterpiece. And finally, after reading it once and getting confused, reading it again to undo my confusion and finally reading it the third time and understanding it, am I finally in a position to write the book review. The reason for me to read it three times is not as much as the authors incapacity to make the subject simple, but rather my inability to embrace physics in its greatness. I am after all a not-so-studious-ex-student of the academic world (did I forget to mention a college drop out too?). So yes, it took a lot for me to understand what was presented in the book. And I will shamefully admit, I still wasn’t able to follow it completely. If you would ask me, I would admit that I understood this book say by around 40%. So here folks is my translation of this great masterpiece into a simplified book review by an academically challenged simpleton. The book is about physics, cosmology, the history of the universe, how light travels, black holes, the Big Bang, Time Travel, Einstein's general theory of relativity and Event Horizon. And in case you found that sounding more like a Hollywood Sci-Fi Flick, you will also be introduced to String theory, Quantum mechanics, Dropplers Effect, Quarks, Neutrinos, Leptons & Membrane Theory. What makes this book so appealing is that instead of relying on nomadic scrolls for childish answers on creation and evolution, which to many religious experts is as simple as a magic apple, a talking snake and two naked people, Stephen Hawkins presents with facts, evidence and theories (ideas) on how the universe began and where it is moving towards. So now the big question – what makes this book a 5 million copies best seller? What made this book the London Sunday Times bestseller list for over 4 years?Apart from the genius of the author, one should know that no other luminary other than Aristotle, Galileo, Newton, Darwin and Einstein came to being so widely accepted, acclaimed and admired than Stephen Hawkins. He has made complex scientific & mathematical answers understood to the general public in a manner where the endless depth of knowledge shared by these great minds can be made to be understood to people like you and I. And if nothing else the single biggest reason for him being respected and honored as a phenomenon is that he contracted ALS otherwise known as Lou Gehrig’s disease – A crippling and unforgivable disease that decays your motor neurons. It was years ago that Stephen Hawkins was reduced to a wheel chair without being able to speak or move – with the only mode of communication, thanks to a computer – his eyes and a finger. Today he is totally paralyzed. Despite such a horrific curse, he is a respected researcher, an avid and sought after speaker and in demand lecturer. And if that does not amazes you enough – Stephen has written papers, books, appeared in documentaries, performed calculations in his head, raised a family and manifested himself as an inspiration to millions around the world. So in a nutshell, I would conclude by stating this is a must read book and a book that you must cherish and appreciate for years to come, simply because of the effort and time put by one of the greatest minds of our time. If nothing else, this book will marvel you at the power of a single individuals capacity to greatness and a man who will be considered a Genius for generations to come. Overall Rating 10 out of 10.

264,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38970458-willian-molinari,4,"Nice book but not that simple for those who are not engaged with physics. That's not a problem with the book, IMO, physics is complicated.The pacing of the book is really good. He starts with the basics of physics and how paper after paper it is changing. It's interesting how Stephen Hawking puts himself as part of that story, not the center of it.I knew the Doppler Effect before this book, but for some reason, I was only applying it for sound and not for light. It was quite interesting to see the explanation of how we measure other stars via the light they emit. The redshifting effect because of the Doppler Effect is something I never thought about and was a good experience.I have to say that it was quite hard to read (listen, in my case). I decided to not listen at 2.0x as I usually do and even though I had to move back many times to be able to get ""in the flow"". I don't have too many notes for this book and I think it's related to the fact that I can't explain some ideas I had without adding the whole context to it. To be able to add full context, I would need to understand some other contexts that are not clear enough.I will probably read it again in the future.Here are my personal notes:* Aristotle had a thought that the earth is round because the shadow of the moon would be an ellipsis if it was sharp* Isaac Newton not only proposed a theory of how objects attract each other but created all the complicated math to validate it* Newton came to the idea of gravity when he was in contemplating mood. It's not when an apple hit his head* The city of God book, Saint Augustine* A theory can be disproved by falsifying just one of its hypothesis* When an object is not acted upon any force, it will keep moving in a straight line. It's the first law of Newton* Acceleration is smaller the greater the mass (big engine in a heavy car)* Newton thought that time and space were two separate things* Time is not constant anymore. Now we consider the speed of light as constant and calculate time using it* Different elements absorb different specters of life. By using this information we can determine the elements present in that star's atmosphere* The Doppler effect also applies to light. If a source star is moving away from us, its color tends to be more red, since the waves are reaching us faster and fave frequency is how we see colors. The same happens with sound waves, the sound changes related to distance (cop sound)* All measurements we have from galaxies are red shifted, which means that they are moving away* The farther a galaxy is from us, the faster it's moving* The current evidence we have shown that the universe will probably expand forever but we're are not 100% sure of that. If we have enough gravity to hold the expansion, the universe may start to compress* Hubble discovered that the universe is expanding* Why does the universe look so similar whatever direction we look?* The initial state of the universe must have been very well chosen to result on what we have now if the theory of a hot big bang is right. There are many explanations for this fact, not only ""god"", but also multiple universes, each one having their own configuration and we can only exist in the ones who reach this form/state* Mathematics is what we use to describe our experiments. It doesn't make sense to question what is real or not (talking about real and imaginary time)* The disorder increases in time because we measure time in the direction where the disorder increases 🤔* Science became too technical for philosophers in the past centuries* Galileo fought the church to be able to spread his ideas on science"
265,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93293528-khairil-anwar,5,A very good book indeed.
266,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,4,"This is one of those books I've been meaning to read for a long time. I bought it for a high school friend a long time ago, and was recently inspired to check it out after seeing the film Theory of Everything, about Hawking's life and his marriage to Jane. It's fantastic - if you see it, you'll also want to read this book.Stephen Hawking is a good writer and a gifted explainer. The first few chapters were a delight to read, as he gave a brief (as advertised) history of how humanity has looked at space and answered the question of where we came from. He jumps into the relationship between space and time, describes why we know the universe is expanding, and introduces that wild variable: the uncertainty principle. At each step, he talks about what kind of universe we'd be living with if things worked otherwise, and what kind of experimental results we'd expect to see if those were the case.By chapter five, things begin to get considerably more dense, as Hawking explains the variety of elementary particles and the forces that hold them together (and push them apart). It's a large family tree, and this is where my reading slowed down considerably as I tried to ponder the meaning of each sentence. As he continued on to his specialty, black holes, where conventional physics break down, I was working even harder to keep up. There are regular mentions of infinitely positive values that are canceled out by infinitely negative values, or additional fudge factors that jump in to change an expected outcome. You definitely have to take him at his word that all the maths work out, as a book that provided proofs would be decided less brief.I would catch myself being inspired by a particular description, almost thinking I understood the underlying reality, and then be suddenly tempted to offer some kind of direction for scientific inquiry. ""Aha! Well have they ever considered..."" I could instantly see why there are so many cranks on the fringes who feel they can overturn established physics with some insight they've had.Hawking continues with our current understanding of how the universe began, and how it will end. He is very humble all along the way, admitting times he's been wrong, and suggesting ways that our current theories may one day prove incomplete. He also looks at the arrows of perceived time and entropy, explores the possibility of time travel: how a wormhole would work, and why time travel might only be possible on an extremely small scale.Finally, he looks at candidates for a theory of everything - one unifying explanation for how the universe works that would unite our very good understanding of quantum phenomena with our even better understanding of relativity and the actions of large bodies. There is no solution yet, but string theories are offered as one of the most promising avenues.One thing that surprised me was the role that God played in the book. Hawking has made it clear that he does not believe in any kind of personal God, but you'd be hard-pressed to guess that from reading A Brief History of Time. God is cited frequently, his pronoun his, and his motives speculated at for why he might construct a universe with the laws and parameters we observe. The anthropic principle is also raised on numerous occasions, reminding us that whatever answers we arrive at must account for the fact that we are here asking the tough questions.It's not a long book, but it's also not the easiest read. My biggest recommendation would be to just keep moving and not try to completely wrap your head around each concept. Understanding the gist of Hawking's explanations will probably do you just as much good."
267,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114013989-manolo-oropeza,5,"A true masterpiece. It is as beautiful as it is mindblowing. I sincerely don't believe it could have been written by anybody else but Hawking, or perhaps a select few of his intellectual equals. He elegantly describes extremely complex scientific topics as if he was just a simple storyteller. A beautiful journey by an extraordinary man who will live through time indeed."
268,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4705182-wordman,5,"I believe in a Creator. I also believe in the evolution of the time-space continuum. To me, they are all-encompassing. A disjunctive proposition where one alternative does not and can not rule-out the other.“In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.” Genesis 1:1 KJV“And the earth was without form, and void: and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” Genesis 1:2 KJV“And God said, let there be light: and there was light.” Genesis 1:3 KJVClearly, something spoiled the original creation which made it necessary for God to restore order out of chaos. The Hebrew word ‘hayah’ as written in the original scripture of Genesis has been incorrectly translated to mean ‘was’. When in actuality, the Hebrew word ‘hayah’, as scholars have attested, rightly translates to mean ‘became’: “And the earth ‘became’ without form, and void…..”. (Vines Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words – ‘to be’)“…..only a cosmic catastrophe could account for the introduction of chaotic confusion into the original perfection of God’s creation.” (A Survey of Old Testament Introduction written by Gleason Archer, professor of biblical languages).The Bible, read as a whole, supports a time-gap between Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 1:2. So, what we have here is the science of what is now known as The Big Bang Theory through the words of God Himself.Stephen W. Hawking, Theoretical physicist and Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge has given us a look into the time-space continuum without condescension or overly technical language… a remarkable rendering into the Big Bang singularity that any layperson can identify with.Professor Hawking, regarded as one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists since Einstein, reviews some of the theories set forth by a few of the greatest scientific minds in history: Galileo, Newton, Einstein. Quantum mechanics, astronomy, cosmology, and physics are explained in such a way that the non-specialist can easily understand.Space and time; black holes; forces of nature; the expanding universe; and God, all as they relate to the science of theoretical physics. Hawking, who adds a bit of levity into the seriousness of this subject, also weaves snippets of his own personal journey: his marriage, children and debilitating illness throughout the pages of his time-space theories.Why do we and the universe exist? “If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph to human reason — for then we would know the mind of God.” page 175In 1981, Professor Hawking attended a conference on cosmology in the Vatican where he was granted an audience with the Pope:“He told us that it was all right to study the evolution of the universe after the big bang, but we should not inquire into the big bang itself because that was the moment of Creation and therefore the work of God.” page 116Giving some allowance to doubt, regardless the direction, each of us will have to determine for ourselves. So, this is where I leave you – to ponder our beginning within your own understanding."
269,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26386317-gautham,4,"“The ultimate triumph of human reason would be to answer the question of why everything exists, as for then we would know the mind of God”				- Stephan HawkingThe book is a record of wonder that human mind has unraveled about the universe. There are questions that linger around everyone’s mind about the universe. Though they may not be relevant in our daily lives they are in fact what that makes our entire life meaningful. Time as it is has neither a beginning nor an end. As a matter of fact time is traversable – back and forth. As Hawking explains this and more it’s like whatever or wherever we are living in seems to be like the imaginative figment of an unknown reality. The points of creation of matter out of nothingness just seems to be the beginning as the author unravels more and more of this magnificent world that we call the universe. The need for the evidence to prove all that men have contrived about the universe seems to be an almost unachievable goal. Hawking evidences this by stating the fact that in this universe our observations are limited by two fundamental findings: the uncertainty principle and the microwave background radiations. These two limit us ultimately at the smallest and largest realm of the observable universe respectively. But men continue to ponder beyond all these limits with his rationale. However, there comes a point at which it rather seems like even the rationale that man has built over all these years comes to a break down. The singularity as it is called is what in a way Hawking calls the end of time (or rationale that we have achieved till now). Rather the end of time for the observer. It is as a matter of fact the time tending towards infinity. But then, as Arthur Eddington put it, universe can never be seen naked and so we are left to our own imaginations to this fact to unravel, marvel, and peer into its intriguing manifestations as the black holes and the big bang. A theory as hawking defines should not only help in explaining the events that we observe but should also predict the future outcomes too. In that respect he has even probed through the superstring theory in this book. More than its implication for the multitude of universes its prediction of the multitude of dimensions is what Hawking says is the great back fall of this theory. However in the book he still doesn’t lose hope for it as it has a strong bearing towards an ultimate theory of the universe. For all as it is out there he tries to converge all that he could to make it the brief history of ‘time’. For whatever ‘time’ is, here he assumes it to be the one which we see as the combined entity called the ‘space-time’. The beauty of the book as I see it is that, apart from looking far back into the universe it nevertheless stops to make the questions about the universe go away, but reinforces it by ultimately stating that our quest for understanding never stops for there always seems to be the question of ‘why’."
270,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7476396-jemima-pett,4,"Apparently this book has set records as the most bought but unread book in history. Well, it's lost one of that number tonight. I have finally read my 1988 copy!I enjoyed the way Stephen Hawking, later Lucasian Professor of Maths at Cambridge, held our hands through the history of various scientists, or philosophers” attempts to understand the world we lie in.I have several books on the history of science, and this was a refreshingly easy to read version, until it fell into the trap it described in advice to a professor asked to teach grade level maths. Start easy, introduce more complex things, and end up with something excitingly new, to paraphrase. “Yes,” said the professor. “And what do I do in the second lesson?”Stephen Hawking starts several expositions of his subject with simple concepts expressed in the simplest of terms for the layman. Three sentences later he is talking about his own subject using very long words strung together. Some of these I recognise, but take three or four readings to grasp. For all that, it only takes me three or four readings. But… I have a maths degree (I didn’t understand that, either, but I knew when to learn things by heart). I read astronomy and scifi books, and I try to keep up to date with scientific developments. Many readers must get to the point of struggling. I suggest parking the not-quite-understood and continuing, as the process continues, and each time your understanding gets to a new level.Some of the diagrams and sketches are extremely helpful. I now understand much more about spaghettification. By the time I’d finished the book, I reckon that my space travellers enter imaginary time, so they don’t get completely spaghettified.If, like me, you were at school when the geology model was Continental Drift. You have now caught up with Plate Tectonics. You owe it to yourself to update your special relativity into general, and quantum into string theory. I had heard the term, and I now have a little more idea of what they are talking about.So, this book will bring you up to speed with physics of the 1980s.Now to find out which book will help me understand dark matter (already a ‘thing to study’ in 1988), Buckie-balls, and several other buzzwords. I suspect one of the books already on my shelf may help…Yes, I do recommend A Brief History of Time to you. You’ll already know if you really don’t want to read it!It has to be essential reading for scifi writers. And if you are a writer who delights in adding exclamation marks, it will probably cure you of that, too.PSOn page 137 is a paragraph describing the ‘sum over histories’ concept to describe everything in spacetime. What that basically does is allow for every parallel universe that we writers have ever invented—and more. Speculative fiction justified!"
271,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10449878-naomi,4,"Firstly, the only reason I read this book was because I had previously read two fiction books and I wanted to balance it out. And the only reason I took it out of the library because I thought I might want to include it on my Personal Statement. However, I am so glad I did read it!This is a marvellous book. Although it is at least 30 years old, the subject matter is still relevant and wholly interesting. As a physics student I know quite a lot about cosmology and particle physics so I thought this book would confirm most of my previous knowledge. Conversely, I ended up learning a lot of new information and innovative theories of which I had never encountered before. Furthermore, Hawking described these ideas in a fascinating and meticulous way so that everything was explained thoroughly. Nevertheless, I must admit I did get confused at some of the ideas presented in this book. One such chapter, the 'Origin and Fate of the Universe' was really baffling and at one point I was skim reading because the information was way beyond me! However Hawking was brilliant at explaining the ideas, and he would sometimes reiterate information and details from a previous chapter to reinforce it in the present chapter. For example, a concept called the 'uncertainty principle' was thoroughly explained, then when it was brought up again, Hawking briefly skimmed over the explanation again to remind the reader of its meaning. Moreover, the book contained a glossary at the back so that the reader could swiftly look up a technical term they were unsure of instead of having to sift their way back through the book to find the original definition.The writing style was also brilliant; there was a mixture of objectivity, wit and light-heartedness which came together to make a fantastic book.The only criticism is the lack of maths. At the beginning of the novel, Hawking himself stated that there would be no mathematical language in the novel because it detracted from the novel's appeal to the general public. However, I found it quite irksome because equations and numbers aid me to visualise and comprehend the information better, so the lack of maths actually detracted from the book for me. In addition, Hawking would write figures in letters rather than numbers, for example, he would state 'a million million' instead of '1000000000000' or '10^12' and use descriptions instead of equations. Perhaps if he included both, his book would appeal to both the general public and the avid maths student equally.Conclusively, this book was excellent, informative and enlightening. I did not understand half of it though, so I will definitely have to read it again! "
272,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5634382-aamil-syed,4,"There is a certain joy in reading the account of something from someone who was intricately involved with it. Science is not something that was very popular a few years back. It has gained greater following thanks to the internet, but Physics (and more so mathematics) is still an esoteric enigma that still confounds many a netizen. Beyond a basic grasp of ideas of physics we usually don’t know much about the universe. Enter, Stephen Hawking.With his disarming charm and with utmost lucidity, Hawking goes on to explore some of the more difficult questions about the universe, namely it’s origin and nature. This is a mainstream book and as Hawking promises in the beginning, he hasn’t used any equation to do so (except e=mc^2), relying instead on beautifully crafted nuggets of information (with diagrams where necessary) that link seamlessly with each other.The book is filled with wonderful anecdotes and gives a view of the history of science from the eyes of a scientist. Someone who has made substantial contributions to it (and yet, is as humble as they come). Hawking begins the explanation of each theory or concept from the ground up and as such one doesn’t need to know much science to follow his book. It is like a big story, only that is our own story – the story of humankind. You can just sit back, relax and read through it, marveling at the way certain people in history have paved the way for the rest of us to move forward. Now, Hawking doesn’t talk about these people in a heroic way. But what he says is so honest and pleasant and so amazing, that it becomes grand.He cracks a few jokes here and there, most of them are self-deprecatory. But none of them ridicule anyone, or any belief or idea. He writes like a true gentleman. Even the conclusion that he makes towards the end, is not so much to make a point, as to educate people about the facts.Another thing that I liked about the book is the short biographies (or notes) about Einstein, Galileo and Newton. These are very honest and frank observations about these people, that make them seem so much more human than scientific superstars!This book is a very successful book and doesn’t really need my stamp of approval. Nathan Myhrvold of Microsoft once remarked that Hawking has sold more books on physics than Madonna has on sex! I am not surprised, at all. A book like this definitely deserves to be read by everyone.Rating: 9/10P.S. I am reading 130 books for 2014 and reviewing them.

273,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,4,"After Kołakowski’s Religion, Cox’s Quantum Universe, and Hannam’s God’s Philosophers, Hawking’s Brief History is yet another book on my journey along the fringes of human knowledge. It has been a wonderfully enriching experience to look at the same or similar issues from these very different perspectives. Kołakowski shows the battle of reason against faith in philosophical terms; Hannam shows the same in a historical perspective. Cox sticks to his maths and vehemently denies that it could have anything to do with anything vaguely religious, but he uses the mystics’ vocabulary to describe certain implications. And Hawking is brave enough to say: we want to know the mind of God.Some reviewers accuse Hawking of hubris, and perhaps rightly so – they do so not for Hawking’s far-stretched ambitions, but for his authoritative tone in presenting certain conclusions. However, he does stress that science cannot prove anything in final terms: it only improves our understanding and provides more accurate measurements; it is a continuous process of verification without, as of yet, any absolutely final results.Hawking wants to see the final results. Maybe it seems a bit crazy to think that it’s possible, but it does appeal to me very much. After many years of seeking answers in religion, philosophy, and science, I have come to be a great admirer of the strong anthropic principle (of a sort): we are here because we must, because it is our role to look upon the world and our own selves, and to observe, and analyse. We are the eyes of the universe. Our power of perception is our purpose and our ultimate goal. This is why I have warmed up to Hawking despite his authoritative tone and his occasionally obscure writing – because he says this:Today we still yearn to know why we are here and where we came from. Humanity’s deepest desire for knowledge is justification enough for our continuing quest. And our goal is nothing less than a complete description of the universe we live in.I had actually written down very similar words long before I read this book. It really feels good to see them written by wise folks as well ;-)"

I've gone throughout other Goodreads reviews and it's clear that I'm not the only one who felt that some concepts were presented clearly and understandably and others are impossible to get unless you already have a college-level background in physics. Yet it's a great book and should be definite reading after watching Interstellar. (I kept thinking of the movie the whole time I was reading this book. Hawking concludes that anything like the plot of Interstellar would be impossible in real life because science! But why let a thing like that spoil a good story?) I've been hankering for a while to go back to science; I've always felt that one cannot properly do the humanities without a strong scientific basis, and that school-level science is barely enough as a foundation. Hawking is right when he says that philosophers need to know about the recent advances in physics and cosmology before talking about metaphysics. Yet I found Hawking's own discussions on the question of God annoying. I found it weird that Hawking dragged God into every chapter, cautiously assuring the reader that it might seem as though physics has disproved the existence of God but we don't know for sure. For someone who's read Dawkins and sympathes with his stiff, uncompromising atheism (and someone who hails from the Hindu faith, a faith that has never been very attached to the notion of God as creator of the universe, let alone making it the very foundational belief of the religion), Hawking's focus on God is surprising. It detracts from the purely scientific nature of the book. But these are minor criticisms. I've taken notes throughout the book, writing down concepts I understood and making note of those I probably need to read more about before I can properly get them, starting with string theory. ABHOT was a great primer on why time is relative, why it moves forward and not backwards, why the universe is expanding and why entropy increases, what it would take to time travel, and what are the problems besetting physics today. These aren't entirely new concepts to a 21st-century reader, but it's always fascinating to delve deep into context and detailed explanation. This book is always worth a read. "
277,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187833-rach,4,"A short book, but it took a good amount of time to read because the subject matter is so complex. Hawking does a fantastic job distilling the details of such complicated science down into something that someone like me, with almost no science training, can mostly understand. It has been a LONG time since my last science class - some of this stuff I vaguely remember, but I'm sure most of it we never even touched. The hardest thing to wrap my mind around so far has been particles, atoms, neutrons, quarks, and the like - pretty much anything microscopic. I think I would need to read this book about 10 more times for some of this stuff to truly sink in. I loved the parts about black holes, worm holes, and time travel, which need all that small stuff to make sense, so I'm glad I stuck with it. The time travel stuff is especially fascinating in relation to LOST. It seems as though Daniel Faraday was at first operating under the consistent histories approach - if time travel into the past is possible, you could not go back in time unless history showed you had already been there, and while there, had not committed any acts that would conflict with your current situation in the present (aka, kill your grandfather). You also wouldn't be able to change recorded history. Although he changed his mind about that possibility, I don't think he meant that the alternate history hypothesis was true - that by going back in time, they entered a history that differed from recorded history - an altered history, ala Back to the Future. But maybe he did. Maybe when the bomb went off, all of those that were in the past will be suddenly transported to the 2009 time of an alternate history, where the plane never crashed on the island? :DI'm spinning off in to Lost theories, which could go on forever, so let me get back to the point. If you are a fan of science fiction, whether it be books, tv, or movies, you need to read this book. See what is theoretically stuff possible (time travel - yes! space travel - yes!), and what isn't (surviving inside a black hole - no!). It may hurt your brain, but it will be worth it."
278,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/989452-rachel,2,"It seems blasphemous to give anything written by Stephen Hawking less than a satisfactory rating (What do I know, anyway? Let's face it, my knowledge of deep space is pretty much defined by 'Star Trek' and 'Spaceballs.'). I'm not a mathematician, an astronomer, or a physicist. But then...chances are you aren't, either, and this book was supposedly written for us, the common people. As Hawking himself writes in the final paragraph of this book, his goal is to find a complete theory that unifies quantum mechanics and relativity, and one that ""should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists."" His aim in writing this book, apparently, was to provide scientific information about the universe to a widespread audience, and to encourage ""ordinary people"" to ""take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist."" It's easy to see the appeal of the book; the issues of creation and humankind's ultimate destiny are compelling and thought-provoking. It is unfortunate, then, that so much of the narrative is unreadable. Hawking teeter-totters violently between simple anecdotes and complex details, as if he doesn't realize when he crosses the line from popular author to mathematics professor. His writing is most understandable when he asks rhetorical questions (e.g. ""What do we know about the universe, and how do we know it? Where did the universe come from, and where is it going? Did the universe have a beginning, and if so, what happened before then? What is the nature of time? Will it ever come to an end?"") and least comprehensible when he tries to answer those questions (e.g. ""If the classical theory of general relativity was correct, the singularity theorems that Roger Penrose and I proved show that the beginning of time would have been a point of infinite density and infinite curvature of space-time.""). Disappointingly, my confusion at quantum mechanics and lack of understanding in general far outweighed the few nuggets of insight I gained from the narrative, and instead of finishing with an ""A-ha!"" I instead closed the book with a resigned, ""If you say so, Stephen Hawking."""
279,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,2,"This still very readable book did not teach me much new things about how we can look at time from a physical point of view (I already read some books on this topic). Of course, the theory of relativity is discussed, which shows that space (in 3 dimensions) and time (1 dimension) have been linked to each other since the creation of our universe. There was no time before the singularity of the Big Bang, or at least it is not relevant to pose the question about what came before it.In one chapter Hawking elaborates extensively on the arrow of time, with the inevitable 2nd law of thermodynamics, but he also involves the psychological experience of time (we can only remember the past), and the cosmological time experience (only within an infinitely increasing expansion of the universe disorder increases). So these three different experiences all indicate the arrow of time cannot but point in one direction, within universe as we know it.The most curious thing in this issue is the use Hawking makes of the ""anthropic"" argument: only under the conditions of a strong thermodynamic arrow (that pushes time in one direction) does it appear that intelligent life can be created in an expansive universe. The argument goes as follows: theoretically a lot of possible universes are imaginable, but only a tiny fraction of them make intelligent life possible; and since we are intelligent (we can ask questions about time and contemplate on the origin and evolution of the universe) this ascertainment is very relevant and distinct to the way the real universe can be imagined. So according to the anthropic principle the universe must be as we perceive it, otherwise nobody would be here to perceive it. So if we perceive the arrow of time in one direction, then that must be the way our universe functions. I must say I was really surprised to look at the question in this way, and to see a physicist use anthropic arguments to 'proof' certain theories. I'm wondering if other scientists follow him in this direction. Finally, Hawking also examines the possibility of time travel, an issue that he leaves undecided, although it's my impression he is very skeptic about it."
280,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11897192-doug,3,"Most books describing these mathematically-rich concepts soar high over the everyman's intellect with an almost ""Sheldonian arrogance."" Dr. Hawking, however, explains it all in such a way that it's at least at treetop level for us; and, he pointedly avoids equations altogether, with the only exception being the widely recognized E=mc squared, better known as Einstein's Theory of Relativity."
281,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/134323-brian,4,"Excellent, excellent book. If you like science at all, I would recommend this book. Reading this reminded me of my favorite class as a Freshman that I took with Nick (and where I learned how to spin a pen around my thumb) - Astronomy 101. One thought about the subject, and then two observations:Thought: Just picking this book makes you feel smarter. Starting to reading makes you feel really, really smart until you realize that if someone asked you to explain what you're reading you would sound like an idiot. Maybe that's just me. I started to understand the broad strokes, and will admit that Quantum Mechanics (study of really small stuff like atoms & quarks) was harder for me than Physics and Relativity Theory. Hawking does a nice job making the language as simple as possible, and using everyday examples to bring concepts to life. Only one equation in the book (E=MC2) and lots of pictures - perfect for me. Observation #1 - There was almost as much talk in this book (about physics and the universe) about God as there was about Science. Philosophy and Physics seem to be merging based solely on my count of how often God was referenced in this book. Observation #2 - Scientists are at least as, if not more egocentric than the rest of humanity. At least 10% of the book is dedicated to giving correct credit to who discovered what first, and who was wrong in what way. It's a bit like racing contests we'd have in grade school and everyone keeping track of who could run the fastest on which given day. Sure, I bet they study science for science's sake - but a lot of these guys just want to become immortal like Galileo or Einstein. Added to my bucket list is to re-read this book with a separate sheet of paper and a pencil and write down all the things that didn't make sense to me (how can light be a wave and a particle? what are antiparticles? etc...) and try and study them. Or sit some engineer down and make them explain it to me :) "
282,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4695858-hind,4,"I was worried that I would hate the book cause it is pure science , and if I hate it I will not read about this topic for a great deal of time . As a recovery :dBut the book came to prove me wrong .It's amazing ,I can say confidently ( My time well spent reading this book )With all the simplified theories , the great doses of imagination, and the writer surprising sense of humor :D I was more than satisfied .The main topics were about the expanding universe , the big bang , explaining in short theories such ( the relativity , quantum mechanics ) which were fundamental for understanding the rest of the book. there is also the curious mystery of the black holes .A great chapter about time ( definitely not as we knew it ) Yes the writer lost me in some pages especially when he talked about the atom &the quark which is an elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. Mostly because I hate this topics since high school but I went through it again to understand the concept .  If you wanna know something there are No excuses :DThis magnificent book is a pure science ,I can not help but link it with religion & spirituality .. So did the writer in some chapters Cause if you talk about the infinite universe , you are indirectly pointing out the questions about the first cause, the creator , the purpose of all this incredible yet mysterious giant universe . Whether you believe in god or not , whether there is a god or not ,, these questions should be asked ,, thought of ,, and then answered . At least we owe this for our selves .. Science is a great way to spirituality .. After finishing the book I had this unique yet painful feeling which I cannot in any way put it in to words but remind me of what Carl Sagan once said ( or write )“We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever.” ― Carl Sagan"

284,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,4,"Hawking is probably the most well-known physicist of the 20th/21st century. In many ways he is probably iconic of 20th century science—the shell of a man in his motorized wheelchair with his computerized voice, all of it to support an acute and articulate mind. And he generously [*:] gives us this nutshell version of modern physics in an easy-for-the-layman-to-digest format—masterfully articulated (and in some cases illustrated) by one of the science's best minds. (Did I already say that?)For as brilliant as Hawking may be, and for as accessible as he makes the physics, A Brief History of Time does suffer from at least one obnoxious pitfall: humble though he may be, Hawking does engage in a bit of anecdotal self-aggrandizement; parts of the text read more like a soap opera (if a soap opera were written by science academics).This turned out to be stop #3 (4 if you count 
The Tao of Physics
 [†:]) on my personal Layman's Roadmap to Understanding Physics. In retrospect, I would recommend others to go first with Feynman's Six Easy Pieces (which is accessible but may be biting off more than a mere mortal can chew); then read Hawking's accessible masterpiece A Brief History of Time; and only then will you be properly prepared to defend yourself against Greene's The Elegant Universe.---* Well, the generosity is debatable. There's always a touch of authorial vanity in any book; plus a book that goes on the best-seller list is certainly there for profit.† I do not count The Tao of Physics."
285,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,4,"This was excellent, although at times I felt my brain overheating inside my skull like it did back in my advanced physics classes in college. This was the first book of Hawking's I've read and was pleasantly surprised how well it was written. He explains the topics simply (as simply as one can explain some of these subjects) and with humor and clever analogies. Some of the subject matter was also covered in the 2017 books by Lawrence Krauss (The Greatest Story Ever Told—So Far) and Neil deGrasse Tyson (Astrophysics for People in a Hurry), both of which I've read. In A Brief History of Time Hawking tackles mind-blowing subjects such as: the origin of the universe, elementary particles, black holes, the fate of the universe, the concept of time, worm holes, time travel, and the unification of theories of physics. The 2017 version includes an updated forward and an appendix with updates of some of the topics covered in the main text. These include: dark energy, microwave background radiation, the multiverse, and gravitational waves (detected by LIGO in 2016 a century after Einstein predicted their existence!). The only negative I came away with from this book is his use of capital g ""God"". I know he was an atheist and did not have a death bed conversion so I was a bit taken aback by this constant referral to a God. I understand he was trying to put a name on what may have been before the Big Bang but I thought he would've been more effective just referring to this using an nonreligious term rather than referring to a supernatural entity which has no place in science, period. Highly recommended for any fans of science and physics, but I'm guessing I'm one of the last of this group to have read this book!"
286,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820503-katie,4,"Full of fascinating scientific facts, theories and questions that the layman often overlooks in everyday life. Complex ideas are distilled down into digestible sections. Theories of the expanding and shrinking universe, the limits of time and space, the possibility of time travel and the question of what existed before the Big Bang are explored. I listened to the audio version of the book, but felt like I had to keep pausing to unwrap ideas and was tempted to take notes at some points. As someone who regrettably never studied science in school I enjoyed learning from this and I'm sure others in a similar position would too.One irksome characteristic is that Hawking seems quite open to the role of some form of 'Creator' which sits uncomfortably with me. I understand that science must include all variables and it rests that we have no idea how time began, but how little time was spent discussing other possibilities was disappointing. I also found it quite frustrating to learn that Hawking and other scientists deem it sensible to disregard time (if it existed) before the Big Bang as the have absolutely no way of quantifying it. This, paired with the God discussion, seemed to leave a big gap in the conversation. However these are frustrations which cannot be pinned to Hawking, but science as a whole.Hawking makes quite a funny jab at philosophers towards the end which is interesting. Definitely worth a read. Basically the only let down is that we still have absolutely no clue what's going on out there and where we come from. If anything, this book will leave you with a myriad of new questions, which is a wonderful thing to happen."
287,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445533-sarah,4,"An absolutely fascinating read. Although theoretically aimed at the layperson this is not a simple read and I was definitely helped by my background in A-Level maths and chemistry, a decade-and-a-half rusty though it is! Up to about half way through I was following everything pretty well, the latter half of the book where Hawking starts combining the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics I was following a bit more loosely. When he got to imaginary time I was definitely just taking in the general concepts being presented, rather than try to get a firm understanding on the proofs.The advances we've made in science over the last 150 years are staggering. The fact that the universe is the way we observe it to be because if it was any other way we couldn't exist to observe it pretty much blew my mind. Having read the proof that the universe is expanding and also the proof it will one day re-collapse, I was surprisingly disappointed to hear that life would not be able to exist in the universe once it starts to collapse. Despite the fact that clearly I would never personally be able to experience the universe starting to shrink, and that our sun will have died long before then anyway, I was somehow sad that there would be no intelligent beings around to observe the amazing effects of the universe shrinking back together. That would be amazing to see!Having read my Dad's copy of the original work which was published in 1988, I'm tempted to get hold of a more recent copy and see what else Hawking has to say almost 3 decades on. Maybe for next year's reading challenge!"
288,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2017317-tamsen,2,"A Brief History of Time is supposed to be the layman's version of science as it is applied to the universe. While I could understand whole sections fine (especially when Hawking used anecdotes, his own unique 'nerd humor' or referenced the history of science), there were other chapters where I would read, then reread and finally just move on. I think that Hawking tries very hard to incorporate laymen's terms and he does, successfully... however, he seems to zip along on his own journey/history of his scientific discoveries and forgets that the normal person needs more basic starting information. I'm sorry to say he completely lost me on the chapter of quarks. However, I now know that a quark is not supposed to be pronounced like 'lark'. Which is helpful.I actually did find portions of the book fascinating - how stars are made, how the universe is expanding and especially his relationships with other scientists. My favorite fact is if the sun ever burned out, we wouldn't know about it for another 8 minutes. Crazy!A quick remark on this book in regards to religion: I know a lot of reviewers were upset about Hawking's placement of god in the universe. I felt rather surprised that god was mentioned so much at all. You don't often see scientists writing about theories, and including god/universe creators in those theories. I found that interesting. I probably shouldn't give this book only 2 stars - because, who am I compared to Stephen Hawking? However, I did find it such a difficult read and unfortunately just don't have the smarts to keep up!"
289,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4769883-luka-antoni,2,"I consider myself novice in studying cosmology and astronomy. Since, in school, only classical physics (almost without mentioning cosmology) is being taught, you cannot get even basic knowledge about this topic. Therefore, I use internet to learn some basic theories, proofs for them and to get to know better how universe functions.There are two problem with this Hawking's book:1) There's no adequate reader. Some parts of the book are basic facts, and some of them are really hard to follow. I think that Stephen Hawking's idea was to write the book, which could be understood by an average human. In my opinion, he didn't succeed in that. 2) He wanted to present reader all major discoveries in cosmology throughout the history, but everything in book was so messy, so I didn't notice much of the history here. There was just something in his style of writing, which made me read one sentence more times. He introduced new terms without explaining them enough.The best part of this book is the one about black holes. That seems logical, because Hawking is known for his large contributions in this area, which he studied for a long period of his career.There was too much of god in A Brief History of Time. He doesn't have his place in cosmology. Although, this is the best sold popular science book, I believe you can find many better than A Brief History of Time. There are some good and memorable sentences, though."
290,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8187431-rade,4,"I am not going to sit around and pretend I understand everything I just read but for what it was, this book was quite interesting. Plenty of topics about space and plenty of explanations of what we know so far (well, up until 1988 when this book was published) about space, dark holes, time travel (if it is possible and if so, how?), as well as plenty of other topics. There is an updated version of this book but I guess I was not one who had read it. There was a lot of examples of some of world’s most famous figures who contributed the most to our understanding of physics and space in general. Almost every person’s contribution was followed by the year when that person won the Nobel Prize. Each chapter is quite short (hence the title) but it does pack quite a lot of information. I am not going to say I understood everything. In fact a lot of the stuff is confusing. However, there is a lot of information that even a dumbass like myself who has zero knowledge of space, can understand it (seriously, I almost failed Physics and my college Astronomy class was fun but gave me a huge kick in the guts when I failed two tests and was almost on edge of failing the class (my fault though)). After I read this book, I want to go check out Cosmos TV show with Neil deGrasse Tyson . Space is quite fascinating and I hope to Buddha we get to find another planet with intelligent life while I am still walking on this planet. "
291,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43961993-john-vanek,5,"I read this book with my father in 5th grade, and it blew my mind. Now nearly 20 years later, I just listened to an audio book version to see how I felt about it as an adult. The content has dated some with the advance of physics, but Hawking's philosophizing hasn't. The big questions he asks in A Brief History of Time are the big questions we're still asking today. His thoughtful and engaging personality invites readers in to ponder these mind-bending ideas with him. He set out to write a book that could be understood by a broad audience. I think he succeeded, as much as the material itself would allow. Hawking's place in the pantheon of physicists was in inspiring to me as a child. His professional ego showed through a little more strongly for me on this read, on the verge of annoyance. That said, Hawking is always humble about his (and our) place in the universe. It's a humility that comes from the study of a universe in which our existence seems entirely trivial. And he has always been a true scientist--willing to admit defeat and change his position when the appropriate evidence is presented. Moreover, he HAS been an important thinker on these subjects, not to mention one of the main public faces of cosmology ever since this was published. There may be equally worthwhile popular cosmology/physics books of a more recent vintage, but I would still highly recommend this one. "
292,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17401149-nelson-minar,3,"I wish I liked this book more. It's an amazing accomplishment, boiling down all of cosmology into a thin, readable book. It succeeds in being accessible to folks without higher mathematics while not dumbing it down too much. It even has human touches, specifically Hawking's occasional appeals to God's role, which isn't religious pandering so much as an acknowledgment that the scientific theories don't explain everything.But, well, I couldn't follow the whole book. The parts of cosmology I already understand, like the Big Bang and inflationary universes, that I followed completely. And was a little bored, but OK, this isn't new for me. The parts I don't understand, like how time behaves around singularities and the theory of quantum gravity. I still don't understand them, despite Prof. Hawking's best efforts to explain them to me. I don't know if it's because I'm a bad reader (likely), he's a bad writer (unlikely), or if this part of the science just really requires math to understand (definitely). Specifically Hawking can't help but introduce the concept of imaginary time, a mathematical concept, but then he doesn't really follow through with explaining how that works in the equations to make the theories. It's not that book. But I found myself wishing a little it was a bit more mathematical, at least here.Still the book is an enormous accomplishment. And it's aged pretty well even if some of the theories he describes are no longer in favor. I'm glad I read it."
293,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45393113-ryan-madman-reads-rocks,4,It's... interesting. A lot of stuff went right over my head. Other stuff will keep me in a state of perpetual wonder for the next five years or so. My complete review is at: https://youtu.be/rqYh6ep6CmM
294,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8709873-mindy-mejia,5,"I was reading A Brief History of Time the other night when my three-year-old pointed at the page.""What do those words say?"" he asked.""This man is wondering how the universe began."" I replied.""What did that look like?"" he asked, which is one of my stock questions for him when I don't understand what he's saying.""I don't know. We weren't there. What do you think it looked like?""Without hesitation, he answered, ""I think it looked like a smile.""Was he really talking about the shape of space-time in the post-big bang expansion? Doubtful. In that moment, though, it struck me that the gap between his knowledge of the universe and mine was probably closely proportional to the gap between my knowledge and Hawking's, and my son's shining moment of clarity was at least as impressive as my own fuzzy grasp of the myriad theories that Hawking outlines. Make no mistake--I learned as much from Hawking's clear and entertaining writing as any liberal arts major could, but, as he pointed out, it is impossible for an average, educated person to understand the frontiers of science today (or the frontiers of science twenty-five years ago. Whatever. I've been busy.) It is our privilege, however, to be given such a consummate introduction to physics from one of the most brilliant scientists of our time. A must-read for anyone who ponders smiley face universes. "
295,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9811549-jim,5,"Whoa...and I mean it. Brilliant, articulate man, this Stephen Hawking.He has managed to distill some very complex ideas into a form that I can (almost) understand...starting with the startling revelation...""that just raises the question of where the energy [to create the known universe] come from. The answer is that the total energy is exactly zero."" He then goes on to explain the concept of positive and negative energy (or particles and antiparticles)...everything cancels everything and you are left with zero.Or the question, since the universe is known to be expanding, does it have any boundaries? Did it have an event horizon (a beginning), or an end? His answer? ""One could say:'the boundary condition of the universe is that it has no boundary'. The universe would be completely self-contained and not affected by anything outside itself. It would neither be created nor destroyed, It would just BE"". In addition he presented this conclusion at a meeting at the Vatican!This is a very readable book, albeit mind-boggling at times. By understanding the origins of the universe (and all the very complicated math/astrophysics that make it possible) we might know why we exist. Can we, as Hawking puts it, ...find the answer and finally ""....know the mind of God""?"
296,0553380168,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5988627-tanya-tosheva,4,"Highly recommend. I'm giving it 4 stars for two reasons only:1. I felt Hawking was more engaged with the unproven but probable, with the possible, than he was with what we already know. This may be caused by the fact that he's so familiar with what we do know that he does not think it would interest people much (and also by the fact that he's devoted his whole life to questions we still don't know the answer to) but I picked up this book to find out what we have observed of the laws that govern the universe until now i.e. what we know for sure.2. At times I just could not follow the explanations, and I admit it with great frustration because I'm not used to not being able to follow explanations. I will definitely reread this book again, once I've gone through Bill Bryson's history of nearly everything which seems more novice-friendly. Next immediate step: to better understand Einstein's general theory of relativity, as everything seems to come back down to it and I definitely don't feel comfortable enough with it to understand any of its implications. For example, why does the theory of relativity imply that there was in the past a state of infinite density? I still don't know, so my quest to understand modern physics will not end here."

The world is flat history recap, beliefs of primitive societies like the world sits on a giant sea turtle, etc. But... hang in there!

This book goes into a lot of really fun topics such as:Space timeParticlesAnti-particlesParticle spinLight wavesLight speedQuantumBlack holesThe big bangThe big crunchOrder and disorder relationshipThe arrows of timeImaginary time/numbers/values (this chapter made me laugh)And so much more!It is very well written, and I only found myself slipping in comprehension in a few areas, such as event horizons, quantum stuff, and thermodynamic time... but for essentially the first time I have ever studied/read about this kind of stuff I am super impressed on the easy to understand presentation of the huge plethora of complex topics.Really glad I stepped outside my comfort zone and tried something new. This book was a lot of fun and I highly recommend it to anyone who... ""wants to know, to not know."""

The answer, of course, is the romance of Hawking's life and the way in which he was able to overcome his disability.The book itself, in this revised edition marking the tenth anniversary of the original publication, is a clear account of modern cosmology from one of the subject's leading researchers. To anyone who has read this sort of thing before, it contains no particularly difficult concepts, and its style is simple and generally easy to follow (with occasional lapses into more technical language). Hawking's involvement in many of the advances in the field lends his writing a particular authority, and even those who read a lot of popular science will find this classic a useful summary, more or less up to date. (The current research into neutrino violations of the Standard Model is the main development to have taken place since publication.) "

While I didn't understand everything, this was purely due to my own failing as well as my unwillingness to hang out in every chapter long enough to perfectly understand the concepts as Hawking described them. I did get a lot out of what I managed to read closely and feel like it has helped me be more comfortable assembling the scientific, philosophical and spiritual aspects of the world into a coherent (though certainly deeply flawed) picture. Highly recommended for anyone interested in but intimidated by discussions of grand unification theories.(Side not: Of course, I'm not nearly physics-savvy enough to identify any true weaknesses or unfounded claims, but I trust Hawking's reputation, credentials, and the positive scientific reception of the book.) (Side side note: this book is worth buying for his 2-page ""bio"" of Newton alone. I had no idea Newton was such a cantankerous child. He and Leibniz were a perfect megalomaniacal, calculus-creating-and-competing pair.)"
