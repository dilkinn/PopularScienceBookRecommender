0,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4906521-chuck,5,"Another great book from Jared Diamond. I found this to be just as engaging as Guns, Germs, and Steel, and also an easier read. I find that his books have so much information that it is helpful for me to outline them as I go. Here are my favorite bullet points from The Third Chimpanzee. Not at all a comprehensive outline, but may be of interest to some people.Chapter 1- Our ancestors diverged from other apes around 7 million years ago.- We share 98.4% of DNA with common chimps.- Chimps are more closely related to humans than to gorillas. We are really a third kind of chimp.Chapter 2- We descended from Cro-Magnons, not Neanderthals.- Hunter-gatherers were probably poor hunters.- Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals co-existed 100,000 years ago (from 130,000 years ago until 40,000 years ago).- The Great Leap Forward occurred 40,000 years ago with the emergence of spoken language. Progress no longer depended on genetic evolution but cultural evolution.Chapter 3- Across primate species, degree of polygyny is correlated with sexual dimorphism in body size and other physical features, and also testis size of males.- Humans have exceptionally large penises and breasts for our body sizes.Chapter 4- Roughly 10% of babies are adulterously conceived.- Unlike most mammals, human ovulation is concealed and sex is done in private.- Also unlike most mammals, humans have sex all the time and it's purpose is largely social rather than merely for reproduction.Chapter 5- Couples tend to have a high degree of correlation (+.9) in religion, ethnicity, race, socioeconomic status, age, and political views; (+.4) for personality and IQ; (+.2) for physical traits; (+.61) for middle finger length.- Incest taboo is probably genetic rather than cultural. We avoid people we grew up with between birth and 6 years, but then as adults we seek out partners similar to those people.Chapter 6- Racial variation can be explained only partly by natural selection (correlation between skin pigmentation and latitude - which is nevertheless noisy); but it is also probably due largely to sexual selection which results from the mating preferences reviewed in the previous chapter.Chapter 7- Body is like a car. Scheduled maintenance and unscheduled repair. When do you scrap it? When everything breaks at once. But it's not a conscious decision to scrap it. The evolutionary reasoning is this: the body is only as strong as the weakest part. So given that it's going to fail, it's ideal/optimal if they all fail at the same time.- If you are likely to get in a crash that totals the car in the near future, then it's not worth investing in a lot of repair and maintenance.- Rate of aging across species is correlated with age of first reproduction.- Turtles live long because it's worth repairing their bodies because they have good protection (shell) and so are unlikely to die a sudden violent death.- Menopause is a solution to the risk taking behavior of having more kids. Human childbirth is particularly dangerous. Having a fourth kid could kill the mom and put the other three at risk.Chapter 8- Most sophisticated animal ""language"" studied to date is the vocalizations of vervet monkeys.- Vervets have at least ten ""words"": ""leopard"", ""snake"", ""unfamiliar human"", etc. They are truly words, not just stimulus-response grunts, because they sometimes use them in a lie to confuse rival troops.- There is no correlation between linguistic and social complexity. (Really?)- Children in a community of pidgin-speaking parents spontaneously add grammar to make the next generation a full creole language.- Chomsky said we have universal grammar, with switches that can be set for different word orders and specifics; Bickerton went further to say those switches have a default value (a default word order that emerges spontaneously unless overridden by the linguistic environment).- Babies start to say single words; then at two they can make multi-word phrases; then at four they can make complete sentences. That stage may have enabled the Great Leap Forward.Chapter 9- First human (Cro-Magnon) art emerged around the Great Leap Forward 40,000 years ago in the form of cave paintings and flutes.- Bowerbirds use their art to woo mates. It is as if women put each of their suitors in sequence through a weight-lifting contest, sewing contest, chess tournament, eye test, and boxing tournament, and finally went to bed with the winner.- In humans, dance and music and poetry are common preludes to sex.- In summary, art is about sex. And now that we have lots of free time, our art can get very elaborate and serve other functions (such as aesthetics) as well.Chapter 10- No other primate practices agriculture. Closest thing is ants, which grow fungus and use insects such as aphids like cattle, drinking their honeydew.- Hunter-gatherers are taller, work as many hours or fewer than farmers, have healthier bones, fewer diseases, fewer cavities, have a more diverse diet, are better nourished, are less susceptible to famine because of the diverse diet, and have lower rates of mortality at every age.- Today just three plants - wheat, rice, and corn - provide more than 50% of calories consumed by the human species.- American and European civilized society are elites, and their lives are better in large part because of oil and other resources. The elite became healthier, but at the expense of the majority who became worse off.- Agriculture allowed for specialists and for class divisions.- Agriculture allowed for birth intervals to shorten from 4 years to 2 years, and increased calories per unit area of land tenfold, thus dramatically increasing population density.- Agriculture was not a conscious choice. It spread largely because it could support a population density 10x of hunter-gatherers, and 10 malnourished warriors can still beat 1 healthy bushman.Chapter 11- We drink and use drugs as a sexual advertisement that says, look how much of a handicap I can give myself and still be superior. Like birds of paradise with long tails that make it susceptible to attack. It says, look how long and heavy my tail is but I can still get away from predators.- but in humans drugs and alcohol are addicting and also genuinely harm the user.Chapter 12- An important consideration in guessing whether intelligent life exists elsewhere is the degree of convergent evolution (inevitably).- Woodpeckers exploited an extremely rewarding niche, but only evolved once. On the other hand, eyes and flight evolved multiple times independently.Chapter 13- Europe has about 50 languages, but New Guinea has one hundredth of the population but 1,000 languages.- New Guinea included lots of small societies completely isolated from one another by the terrain.- We are becoming culturally homogenized; there are very few places where alternative models for society can exist.Chapter 14- Of the many plants and animals available as candidates for domestication, only a few are actually domesticable, and those happened to be in Europe and the Near East.- In addition to that head start, the east-west axis of Eurasia allowed the spread of farming more easily than the north-south axis of the Americas did.- Rise of civilization brought disease and the people evolved immunity; but not hunter-gatherers.Chapter 15- Language evolves over time, and languages diverge to become mutually unintelligible when a group becomes isolated, just like speciation.- Glottochronology is like a genetic clock; languages replace 20% of their words every one thousand years, but it's noisy.- Invention of wheel about 3,000 BC (or about 5,000 years ago).- Domestication of horses about 4,000 BC (6,000 years ago).- Indo-European languages probably had a common ancestor around 3,000 BC north of the Black Sea. The package of agriculture and technology there allowed rapid waves of expansion, then another expansion into the Americas, and now half the world speaks Indo-European languages.Chapter 16- Chimps are xenophobic. They recognize members of other bands and treat them differently. They practice genocide.- Many species practice murder, and some genocide.- Stalin and Hitler were better at genocide because of technology, communications, and high population density.- Humans practice a dual standard of behavior: strong inhibitions about killing one of ""us"", but a green light to kill ""them"".- Our early American heroes were outspoken supporters of Native American genocide.Chapter 17- Tells the story of three ancient civilizations that collapsed due to environmental exhaustion: Easter Island, Anasazi, and Petra.- Humans basically live in harmony with nature when conditions are stable, but sudden changes such as acquisition of a new technology or discovery of a new island realizes conditions for species extermination and environmental collapse.- ""While courses in the history of civilization often dwell on kings and barbarian invasions, deforestation and erosion may in the long run have been more important shapers of human history.""Chapter 18- To get to the Americas, you gotta cross Siberia, then Bering Straight, then coast-to-coast ice sheet of Canada. Humans crossed the latter during an opening 12,000 years ago.- Those early people are called Clovis people. They reached Tierra del Fuego within 1,000 years.- Clovis people probably killed all the large mammals except bison.- The Clovis culture then rapidly changed to the Folsom culture about 11,000 years ago, with different spear tips optimized for bison.Chapter 19- Four mechanisms of species extermination: overhunting, species introduction, habitat destruction, and ripple effects.- ""Dismissing the extinction crisis on the grounds that extinction is natural would be just like dismissing genocide on the grounds that death is the natural fate of all humans."""
1,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"A confrontation with the often forgotten stations of incarnation.The author tackles a variety of topics in his first work and shows similarities with human norms in the animal kingdom in state formation, social and sexual behavior, drug use and rudimentary agriculture by using evolutionary development. The origins and history of communication, xenophobia, art, and warfare are also illuminated in detail.The influence of environmental conditions can be well explained by the differences between bonobos and chimpanzees. Separated by the insurmountable Congo, the peaceful, matriarchal life of the bonobos developed in an environment of sufficient and comfortable living conditions, while the habitat of the hierarchically structured and highly violent chimpanzees was rather barren and inhospitable. Thus, the thesis comes up: Adverse environmental conditions would require stricter rankings and an evolution promoting aggressive behavior. On the other hand, the wealth of resources enables the bonobos to cooperate socially and peacefully without the necessity of aggression.In contradiction to this, however, there are both other animal species and specialized groups of people, who still treat each other friendly in the most adverse conditions. To start directly and just with the assumption of the necessity of a more brutal mentality would be too far-fetched and simplified. There are for instance the inexplicable, for the own group sometimes even harmful, behavioral patterns of chimpanzees such as senseless violence, incitement, and persecution of individual group members and genocides in conquest campaigns including cannibalism, which all together already gives a pretty good description of modern humans.Moreover, bonobos are threatened of extinction because they are defenseless against organized animal attacks or rather raids organized by the chimpanzees, which can be described as an animal precursor to genocide. This shows impressively and sadly that the mentality of humankind awoke long before our rise to power.It is close to impudence how often Diamond has used parts of this book for his other, later published books. Thus, portions of the chapter on the conquerors of the world were included in the book ""Guns Germs and Steel"" and sections on the meaning of the habitat are found in ""Collapse: Why Societies Survive or Perish.""In the case of personal interest, the reading of the detailed descriptions of both works is, in any case, an option if the relatively short explanations of this work have made one curious.There are few arguments against the preference to blame humans as the most likely cause of past species extinction and as a secondary cause of climate change, given the apparent archaeological evidence. It may well be that the evolution of ice and warm periods in specific regions had stronger influences, but especially in the always relatively moderate climates, this argument does not withstand because of the adaptability of most animals.It is argued by skeptics that the finding of fossils is a random gamble that does not allow serious estimates of numbers. Only if one finds excessively many bones of extinct animals in the sediment layers coinciding with human migrations, this should be a clear indication.At the end of the book, Diamond asks people to avoid the always same mistakes and the cycles of expansion, species extinction, and environmental degradation and at least not do more damage. It is a noble concern because it must be incredibly frustrating, especially from the perspective of an evolutionary biologist, to observe over decades how habitats, that are still to be explored, are irreversibly destroyed right in front of one's nose.

2,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,3,"Original review: The audience called for an encore and Jared obliged. The rewind was not as much fun.Update:The Homosexual Chimpanzee?However, this book has some great explanations on human sexuality but does not address one which I was not able to find a satisfactory explanation for, evolutionarily speaking: Homosexuality. The following is an explanatory excerpt from The Extended Phenotype by Richard Dawkins. I am adding this here for my own reference, but I am sure you will find it damn interesting too.""Consider human male homosexuality as a more serious example. On the face of it, the existence of a substantial minority of men who prefer sexual relations with their own sex rather than with the opposite sex constitutes a problem for any simple Darwinian theory. The rather discursive title of a privately circulated homosexualist pamphlet, which the author was kind enough to send me, summarizes the problem: 'Why are there ""gays"" at all? Why hasn't evolution eliminated ""gayness"" millions of years ago?' The author, incidentally, thinks the problem so important that it seriously undermines the whole Darwinian view of life. Trivers (1974), Wilson (1975, 1978), and especially Weinrich (1976) have considered various versions of the possibility that homosexuals may, at some time in history, have been functionally equivalent to sterile workers, foregoing personal reproduction the better to care for other relatives. I do not find this idea particularly plausible (Ridley & Dawkins in press), certainly no more so than a 'sneaky male' hypothesis. According to this latter idea, homosexuality represents an 'alternative male tactic' for obtaining matings with females. In a society with harem defence by dominant males, a male who is known to be homosexual is more likely to be tolerated by a dominant male than a known heterosexual male, and an otherwise subordinate male may be able, by virtue of this, to obtain clandestine copulations with females.But I raise the 'sneaky male' hypothesis not as a plausible possibility so much as a way of dramatizing how easy and inconclusive it is to dream up explanations of this kind (Lewontin, 1979, used the same didactic trick in discussing apparent homosexuality in Drosophila). The main point I wish to make is quite different and much more important. It is again the point about how we characterize the phenotypic feature that we are trying to explain.Homosexuality is, of course, a problem for Darwinians only if there is a genetic component to the difference between homosexual and heterosexual individuals. While the evidence is controversial (Weinrich 1976), let us assume for the sake of argument that this is the case. Now the question arises, what does it mean to say there is a genetic component to the difference, in common parlance that there is a gene (or genes) 'for' homosexuality? It is a fundamental truism, of logic more than of genetics, that the phenotypic 'effect' of a gene is a concept that has meaning only if the context of environmental influences is specified, environment being understood to include all the other genes in the genome. A gene 'for' A in environment X may well turn out to be a gene for B in environment Y. It is simply meaningless to speak of an absolute, context-free, phenotypic effect of a given gene.Even if there are genes which, in today's environment, produce a homosexual phenotype, this does not mean that in another environment, say that of our Pleistocene ancestors, they would have had the same phenotypic effect. A gene for homosexuality in our modern environment might have been a gene for something utterly different in the Pleistocene. So, we have the possibility of a special kind of 'time-lag effect' here. It may be that the phenotype which we are trying to explain did not even exist in some earlier environment, even though the gene did then exist.""Yes, this is inconclusive, but it does point out some interesting directions in which we can direct our evolutionary reasoning. Don't you think?"
3,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36819318-scott,4,"If you've read Guns, Germs and Steel or Collapse you know what to expect from Jared Diamond- a blizzard of fascinating facts, insights and theories that will spark tens of conversations among your like minded friends and colleagues.Diamond is a master of spinning hard fact and intriguing theory into readable books, and he does so again in The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution & Future of the Human Animal, exploring the link between humans and the beings we call apes (Diamond argues against such a distinction, and posits that humans are simply a third variety of chimpanzee) and the evolution of human bodies, minds and culture.If you're in the mood for an interesting and informative info-dump you've come to the right book. Diamond explores high and low, illuminating research ranging from comparisons of genitalia size (There's reason why 'Hung like a Gorilla' is not a popular phrase) and the theories behind these differences, the possible reasons behind Homo Sapiens' sudden technological leap beyond our early origins and our cousins the Neanderthals, and finally a discussion of the threats to our existence that Diamond later devoted Collapse to. Diamond weaves his own experiences working with remote tribes in Papua New Guinea into the narrative and I that found this aspect of his storytelling balances the more fact heavy sections well.I learned a great deal from this book about the evolution of my own body, and the ways that the human form could indicate social and behavioral traits to a neutral observer (Diamond uses the example of Aliens viewing our species for the first time). Diamond makes these learnings both accessible and interesting and I experienced a number of out-loud-wow-science exclamation moments while reading this book.If you're at all interested in evolutionary theory and our genetic proximity to our forest-dwelling relatives, you should read this book. If you're still uncertain that we're related to chimpanzees and gorillas, you too, should read it (I guarantee you'll be convinced we should have been inviting Bonzo and Harambe to our family barbecues). If you're really, really certain we aren't related to 'apes' and you aren't interested in being convinced otherwise.... well, I suspect you aren't browsing this section of the library/bookstore anyway."
4,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a wonderful book by a great author. In fact, I prefer this book to the other books that I've read by Jared Diamond. It is entertaining, informative, and every page is interesting. The book covers a vast range of topics, such as how are humans qualitatively different from other animals, why do men do stupid things to impress women, why do people practice adultery, why do humans practice genocide, how did languages evolve, why do some people become addicted to drugs, why do humans produce art, and why do humans age. The book ends with the ecological harm humans have done to the planet (not just recently, but in ancient times as well), and the extinctions of species that we cause. Diamond shows how none of these activities are unique to humans; each activity has some analog in animal behavior, as well.Like Diamond's other books, there is plenty of speculation here. He makes sweeping generalizations that are not always held up by documented facts. But Diamond's enthusiasm rings loud and clear, and his speculations always sound reasonable, at least to me. "
5,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826429-sj-loria,2,"Funny that I read this book in Mexico, a country where more people believe in creation than evolution. For the record, I think we evolved from apes. For the record, that doesn't bother me in the least.I am going to do two things, first, I will talk about what I learned from this book, secondly I am going to go on a rant about anthropology. While this book was interesting, there were parts where the author stepped far beyond his area of expertise, leading to some very weak chapters. Further, this was written almost 20 years ago, and it is simply amazing how quickly scientific knowledge has advanced. Some parts were outdated, which I found remarkable. Scientific facts seem to have a very quick expiration date.This book details defining characters of human society - symbolic language, art, agriculture, war, drug abuse and environmental destruction - and presents our evolutionary precursors to these traits. He covers some excellently, and others with not as much conviction. He begins by discussing the unique aspects of the human body both genetically and our life cycle. This part was quite interesting. I learned that we share a whopping 98.4% of our genes with chimpanzees, which is pretty cool if you ask me. It was interesting to see how our prolonged life cycle and the unique characteristic of females menopause has influenced human life. Those two things allowed us to transmit lots of information (because old folks would be the story tellers and survival experts when shit hit the fan) and allowed women to also live a bit after having children. It's quite dangerous to have children, let us recall. So menopause was a great thing for women, evolutionarily speaking. Interesting to learn that genetic changes took thousands of years to develop, but once they developed than cultural evolution exploded and since has outpaced biological evolution. Evolution slowly brought us to the place where we had the tools to really start running with it.One thing that stands out from this book is that a large part of our progress was heavily dependant on the environment and our genes. Rarely do we stop and thank water for being there, or acknowledge how certain geographical features shaped us as humans. Perhaps we should do this more often.At points, the author stepped outside of his area of expertise to strengthen his argument via other disciplines. I admire the approach and feel it's best to cover one subject through as many routes of knowledge as possible. The tricky thing is, you just have to make good arguments in those other fields. There were two chapters which I shook my head more often than I nodded it, they covered art and astronomy. The author, in discussing what makes humans unique tries to find precedent in other animals as to how this evolved in humans. Art proves tricky. Art, which I would define as the soul expressing itself in reality, is a uniquely human endeavor. Diamond makes the claim that chimpanzees and elephants have produced art in captivity. He quotes an abstract expressionist painter and critic and a psychologist as his authorities. However, the issue is that other animal art is not a spontaneous creation. They were provided the tools in captivity, it's much more likely that they pick up paintbrush and smoosh paint to gain the approval of their handlers and earn extra attention than it is an undeniable expression of their soul. Also, the category of ""art"" that Diamond holds up as his ""see, they can produce art"" in fact defines itself as ""anti-figurative aesthetic,"" meaning art that tries to look like nothing in order to symbolize emotion. So yes, chimps splashing paint fits into this very specific category, but that doesn't make it art outside of that interpretation. Show me more realistic art, art that holds the mirror to reality with a bit more clarity and then show me another animal spontaneously producing that, then we'll talk. This author simply does not understand art, which is fine, but which also means you should steer far clear of it while making a case.However, the chapter that blew my mind more than any other was one chapter on our place within the universe. This chapter came from left field, was almost entirely speculative and had very little to do with the central thesis. I have no idea why the editor didn't cut it. Suddenly he begins to explain the immense size of the universe, accurately. Then he suddenly declares that there are no planets that can support life (incorrect), we're the only one with life (speculative), period. I was shocked, and I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt only because we have learned very much about the abundance of habitable planets in the universe since 1992. That is the only thing that can possible explain this chapter, because after factually stating how immense the universe is, he then is completely incorrect scientifically about the abundance of planets and finally 100% speculative about there being no other life. The crappy part is he tries to present it all as factual, when in reality just his first stand of evidence was. Ugh. What the hell.Now, time to rant, this book embodied a perspective on life that I am coming to disdain - anthropology, or 21st century intellectualized racial awwwing at the primitive people who are just so interesting! Primitive people make great facebook photo albums. Let me explain. The author did a lot of research on New Guinea, and talks extensively about it. Due to the terrain, there were many different societies who lived close to one another but remained isolated. Each pocked was a unique culture, with unique traditions and all that. For example, apparently round them parts the cool thing to do is wear basically a codpeice or penis stick. Some tribes painted them yellow, some green, some had flowers, some feathers, dudes had multiple and some were special occasion ones, etc. You getting the picture (if so what color is your penis stick, haha)? Lots of penis sticks, no shoes, native instruments, so cute right? None of the influence from evil modern society and satan incarnate aka the white man. Only within the last 40 years or so did these tribes begin to modernize, trade, get modern goods and all.The author fondly recalls one of his strolls through the jungle back in the good old days where he came up to a tribe banging on drums and they were so amazed to see him, a white man. About 20 years later he goes back to visit the tribe, with I'm sure his notebooks to do ""observations"" on them, fancy camera, maybe a computer, etc and to his horror hears them listening to pop music and sees a few wearing Reeboks. Gasp, they were so much cuter, so much more useful to the purpose of my research paper, when they didn't have Reeboks.What I find appalling about this perspective is it completely ignores the desires of the native people and it ignores the benefits that one is able to obtain from modern society. The very system that allowed the author to think in this way, be educated, and write a book is the one he wants to hold back from cultures because he would rather see the variety of penis ornaments. What if these people want to be modernized? Is it such a horrible thing that they learn about medicine and their infant mortality rate plummets? Is it a bad thing that their life expectancy is over 40 now? What if they want to wear Nikes? Is it such a bad thing to see a world map, understand it's a big place, learn that there are about 7 billion other humans out there?What I simply do not understand about the ""awww, look at and study the primitive people"" perspective is the lack of consideration for the desires, wishes, or well being of the culture in question. It's like they feel guilty about being white and going to good prep schools. So they'll write academic papers about those cute jungle people, and take photos and all that, but it's like they want that to remain the way it is. Don't modernize, I just got grant money to study you! It's like their vacation from reality, and I think it's frankly insulting to the people being photographed and studied as if they were animals.Breathe. Anyway, I thought this book was going to be excellent, instead it was average. Perhaps a new edition would really go a long way in improving it. I learned some interesting statistics, but am not very inspired to continue reading Diamond.It has also proved possible to work out a calibration between genetic distance and elapsed time, and thereby get an approximate answer to the question of when we and chimps split apart from our common ancestor. That turns out to be somewhere around seven million years ago, give or take a few million years. 12If our ethical code makes a purely arbitrary distinction between humans and all other species, then we have a code based on naked selfishness devoid of any higher principle. If our code instead makes distinctions based on our superior intelligence, social relationships, and capacity for feeling pain, then it becomes difficult to defend an all or nothing code that draws a line between all humans and all animals. 30The emergence of Homo sapiens illustrates the paradox discussed in the previous chapter; that our rise to humanity was not directly proportional to the changes in our genes. 37Those of us accustomed to getting our information from the printed page or television will find it hard to appreciate how important even just one or two old people are in a preliterate society...one such person in a preliterate society can thus spell the difference between death and survival for the whole society. 50Cro-Manon Neanderthal transition was a harbinger of what was to come, when the victors' descendants began squabbling among themselves. It may at first seem paradoxical that Cro-Magnons prevailed over the more muscular Neanderthals, but weaponry rather than strength would have been decisive. Similarly, it's not gorillas that are now threatening to exterminate humans in central Africa, but vice versa. People with huge muscles require lots of food, and they thereby gain no advantage if slimmer, smarter people can use tools to do the same work. 52Until the great leap forward, human culture had developed at a snail's pace for millions of years. that pace was dictated by the slow pace of genetic change. After the leap, cultural development no longer depended on genetic change. Despite negligible changes in our anatomy, there has been far more cultural evolution in the past forty thousand years than in the millions of years before. 56Our mean duration of coitus (about four minutes for Americans) is much longer than for gorillas (one minute), pygmy chimps (fifteen seconds), or common chimps (seven seconds), but shorter than for orangutans (fifteen minutes) and lightning fast compared to the twelve hour long copulations of marsupial mice. 75In these days of growing human over population, one of the most ironic tragedies is the catholic church's claim that human copulation has conception as its natural purpose, and that the rhythm method is the only proper means of birth control. The rhythm method would be terrific for gorillas and most other mammal species, but not for us. In no species besides humans has the purpose of copulation become so unrelated to conception, or the rhythm method so unsuited for contraception. 78How does one decide whether recognizably distinct animal populations from different localities constitute different species, or belong instead to the same special and just constitute different races (also known as subspecies)?...The distinction is based on interbreeding under normal circumstances,: members of the same species may interbreed normally if given the opportunity, while members of different species don't. 112The longer life span of modern humans as compared to that of apes does not rest only on cultural adaptations, such as tools to acquire food and deter predators. It also rests on the biological advantage of menopause and increased investment in self-repair. Whether those biological adaptations developed especially at the time of the great leap forward or earlier, they rank among the life-history changes that permitted the rise of the third chimpanzee to humanity. 135 Up to half the words in typical human speech are purely grammatical items, with no referent that one can point to. 153 Most of today's leading infectious diseases and parasites of mankind could not become established until after the transition to agriculture. These killers persist only in societies of crowded, malnourished, sedentary people constantly reinfected by each other and by their own sewage. 187Besides malnutrition, starvation, and epidemic diseases, farming brought another curse to humanity:class divisions. 187[Discussing dangerous behaviors, such as smoking or tattoos] Males of many more species have bright colors, loud songs, or conspicuous displays that attract predators. Why should a male advertise such an impediment, and why should a female like it? Zahavi's theory goes to the heart of this paradox. According to his theory, those deleterious structures and behaviors constitute valid indicators that the animal is being honest in its claim of superiority, precisely because those traits themselves impose handicaps. 197Continental differences in level of civilization arose from geography's effect on the development of our cultural hallmarks, not from human genetics. Continents differed in the resources on which civilization depended - especially in the wild animal and plan species that proved useful for domestication. 236Plants and animals spread quickly and easily within a climate zone to which they've already adapted. To spread out of this zone, they have to develop new varieties with different climate tolerances. A glance at the map of the old world shows how species could shift long distances without encountering a change of climate. 245These calculations, which belong to a science called glottochronology ( = chronology of languages), yield the rule of thumb that languages replace about 20 percent of their basic vocabulary every one thousand years. 262The steppe itself reaches its western limit in the plains of Hungary. That's where all subsequent steppe invaders of Europe, like the Mongols, stopped. To spread further, steppe society had to adopt to the forested landscape of western Europe - by adopting intense agricultural or by taking over existing European societies and hybridizing with their peoples. Most of the genes of the resulting hybrid societies may have been the genes of old europe. 271Chimpanzee behavior suggests that a major reason for our human hallmark of group living was defense against other human groups, especially once we acquired weapons and a large enough brain to plan ambushes. If this reasoning is correct, then anthropologist's traditional emphasis on ""man the hunter"" as the driving force of human evolution might be valid after all - with the difference that we ourselves were our own prey as well as the predator that forced us into group living. 294Our power threatens our own existence. 311"
6,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,5,"Having been on a evolutionary biology and history trip of late, I couldn't resist revisiting this 1991 classic by Jared Diamond. It is a good introduction to his favorite subjects that get fuller treatment in Guns, Germs & Steel and Collapse. Part One (Just Another Species of Big Mammal) focuses on the evolutions of primates and the split between apes and monkeys and the further splits down the line between gorillas, chimpanzees, and finally homo habilus, homo erectus, and homo sapiens. This is the strongest part of the book, discussing the incredibly similar genome between chimpanzees and humans, which share 98% of their DNA. It posits that the development of language triggered the Great Leap Forward that gave homo sapiens the edge against the larger, stronger Neanderthals in the struggle for survival, especially in their ability to collaborate in hunting and communicate complex plans and concepts.Part Two (An Animal With a Strange Life Cycle) discusses the sexual behavior of humans from an evolutionary perspective. It dives into the previously taboo subject of the potential evolutionary rationale for adultery, as a means for males to spread their genes as far as possibly, while on the flip side women (mothers) seek a stable mate to provide sustenance for themselves and their children in a monogamous relationship, and the inevitable friction this causes in modern couples. It also discusses the seeming evolutionary disadvantages of humans vs other animals: female menopause, having only 1-2 babies at a time and only after reaching the teenage years, and living beyond a reproductive age. The answers are thought-provoking and well extrapolated.Part Three (Uniquely Human) discusses the development of human language; the animal origins of art and its function in modern humans; the mixed blessings of adopting a sedentary, agrarian lifestyle rather than being roving hunter-gatherers; why human beings exhibit the seemingly self-destructive behavior of smoking, drinking alcohol, and taking drugs; and how likely we are to be alone in the universe. The section on the agriculture vs hunter-gathering is fascinating and gets much more detailed treatment in Guns, Germs & Steel. Part Four (World Conquerors) is one of the most interesting sections, detailing the influence of environmental factors in the different rates of technological development among different cultures on different continents, which was the centerpiece of Guns, Germs & Steel. Here he discusses how the domestication of native edible grains and animals such as horses, pigs, cows, and sheep provided the nutrition and energy for Eurasian peoples to conquer and dominate other societies that lacked advanced weapons like guns and cannons, lacked horses to form cavalry, which afforded a massive advantage in warfare, and also the proximity to domesticated animals also exposed Eurasians to myriad animal diseases that then allowed them to develop immunities that New World people lacked, leading to disastrous epidemics after contact. This section also details the spread and dominance of Indo-European languages over other languages, which reflected the population movements over the past few millennia. It also contains one of the most disturbing chapters in modern human history, the systematic extermination of the aboriginal blacks of Tasmania by Australian white settlers, and the various religious and cultural superiority beliefs that allowed them to justify genocide. The actual excuses provided for hunting down and killing natives that were viewed as barely human is pretty stomach-turning from a modern perspective, but is detailed without holding back. He then expands on the long and repeated ethnic genocides in human history during the 1492-1900 and 1900-1950 periods. I think this should be required study for high school or university students to remind us all the atrocities humans are capable of, and why we need to curb our worst instincts to demonize and dehumanize “others”.Part Five (Reversing Our Progress Overnight) is another sobering chapter that is a precursor to his book Collapse. Diamond details in lucid and unblinking details the numerous waves of extinctions that have happened on the Earth over many eras including the dinosaurs, and then the waves of extinctions directly caused by the explosion in global human population and our destruction of animal habitats and spread across the planet. It also talks about our ability to destroy ourselves overnight via nuclear holocaust, and how on our present path we are likely to exhaust our resources and multiply till the point of ecological collapse. It’s pretty disturbing reading, but very convincing as well. Again, if all students could read this book, they would have a greater sense of urgency that we need to change the path of human civilization if we want to avoid disaster and collapse.Recommended reading for evolutionary biology and historical anthropology:1.

7,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,2,"Diamond packs a lot of interesting information into this book & it flows well, but it's old (1992) so a lot of his information is outdated. Worse, his conclusions shouldn't be trusted. In several cases, I knew enough about the subject to catch him completely misunderstanding it & making his points based on cherry-picked data. That's bad science which he hides fairly well behind parts of conflicting views. Read this only for the interesting trivia (much of which is repetitive) but don't be swayed by his conclusions except perhaps in his actual fields which are geography & anthropology, I think.Well narrated & interesting, but since I can't trust him, I can't give this a high mark. That's a shame. I'll put more comments after the various sections.Table of ContentsPrologue Diamond hit a sore spot with me almost immediately when he wrote ""When Darwin intimated in 1859 that we had evolved from apes... I am so sick of reading & hearing that. Darwin never wrote or intimated any such thing! He wrote that we must have had a common ancestor. That's a huge difference & if someone doesn't understand it, everything that follows is drivel. Sigh. I know Diamond does, though. He gets on with the basic premise that we're actually just one of several hominid species & aren't as genetically distant from chimps as the white-eyed & red-eyed vireos are from each other. We share much with other mammals & what really makes us unique is our ability to communicate complex thoughts & our inventiveness.Part 1 Just Another Species of Big Mammal1 A Tale of Three Chimps 2 The Great Leap Forward Diamond makes a great case for us just being another mammal from a biological perspective based on differences in DNA & early habits. He then shows how much we differ from other hominids including Neanderthals, but that also shows the age of this book. He sets an interesting lens to look through. He set my teeth on edge by using 'theory' rather than 'hypothesis'. If he's going to argue with science, he should be using the correct terms.Part 2 An Animal with a Strange Life Cycle3 The Evolution of Human Sexuality4 The Science of Adultery 5 How We Pick Our Mates and Sex Partners6 Sexual Selection, and the Origin of Human Races 7 Why Do We Grow Old and Die? All really interesting, but I think he left out a lot to make his point. I'm not well enough informed to really pin down most of it. It just felt that way until I noticed that he was strictly arguing phenotypic evolution rather than the selfish gene theory. Again, lacking updated data like the genetic studies of Jews which was doing a wonderful job tracing their migrations until they cut off access when it was found that they, like the rest of us, have about a 15% adultery rate. Since they inherit through the paternal line, this was a big deal. Part 3 Uniquely Human8 Bridges to Human Language9 Animal Origins of Art10 Agriculture's Mixed Blessings11 Why Do We Smoke, Drink, and Use Dangerous Drugs? 12 Alone in a Crowded UniverseAgain, a lot of interesting stuff until the last chapter which was a train wreck. The only more idiotic treatment of the search for extraterrestrial life that I've ever heard has come from Young Earth Creationists & he barely cleared their low bar. For instance, he says we sent a message to another galaxy several decades ago & leaves the impression we should expect an answer. M13 is 21,000 light years away, so our message couldn't reach them until 23,000AD, but he never mentions that awkward fact. Instead, he tries to overwhelm the reality with a lot of other interesting facts, but all are very incomplete & twisted. The impression I've had that he's cherry-picking to make his points is confirmed. Yuck. He completely destroyed any remaining credibility he had.Part 4 World Conquerors 13 The Last First Contacts 14 Accidental Conquerors 15 Horses, Hittites, and History 16 In Black and White More about language than I would have expected, but I found it interesting. Much is a synopsis of his Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies which was great. He's quite pessimistic about us, even writing at one point something about 'modern nuclear warfare' leaving the impression we've dropped nuclear bombs fairly often while I'm shocked that only 2 have ever been deployed. That we made it through the Cold War & MAD days without one being being set off is incredibly hopeful, IMO.The last chapter is primarily about genocide & he managed to bore me through sheer repetition of a handful of examples. There are plenty & he despairs of our race while not providing any actual numbers. We're changing fast & less people are dying from violence or most other causes but he's a pessimist. For instance, in 2012 (20 years after this book was published.) the total number of deaths worldwide were less than those in 1 battle of WWI.Part 5 Reversing Our Progress Overnight17 The Golden Age That Never Was18 Blitzkrieg and Thanksgiving in the New World19 The Second Cloud He's right, we've never lived in harmony with nature when we had the power to take what we wanted. According to him, the first men on this continent wiped out almost all the large mammals & spread amazingly fast, but this book is 28 years old, so he's using 15,000-11,000 years ago for our invasion of the Americas. Lately I've read several articles that push that a lot earlier, probably at least twice as long ago which doesn't help his argument, although I haven't read a better one for the large mammal extermination. The same happened in Australia, too.Epilogue: Nothing Learned, and Everything Forgotten? Very pessimistic & he doesn't pay enough direct attention to economics. He writes We do not need novel, still-to-be invented technologies to solve our problems. We just need more governments to do many more of the same obvious things that some governments are already doing in some cases.Again, I don't entirely agree. Energy makes the world go round & that means economics, too. A LOT of problems would be solved if we had something that produced portable, high power as the internal combustion engine does. Alternative energies are fine, but they're clunky & intermittent, so a better battery (Think Heinlein's Sun Stones.) would also help a lot. He also doesn't mention GMO crops to minimize climate change, invasive & ever adapting pests. Of course, this book was written before they became a big deal.All in all, not a terrible read, but it was repetitive, old, & lacking depth in many areas. Very well narrated. I wouldn't bother reading it as there are many other books out there, but it's not a complete waste of time. Just don't drink his Kool Aid."
8,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/667234-james,4,"Excellent. I'm giving it four stars instead of five only because from the vantage of 2014 its age shows, mainly in the absence of some information learned since it was written about the Neanderthals and the similar but then-unknown Denisovan people - specifically, the presence of small amounts of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA in the modern human gene pool - and in the absence of that knowledge, the author makes some assumptions about our history with those other peoples that are incomplete at best; but the book is impressive in its accurate anticipation of the situations of the present and probable future. The title is based on our very close genetic links with the two species normally called chimpanzees, i.e. the 'common' chimp and what Diamond calls the pigmy chimp, normally referred to now as the bonobo. Any other species as closely related to those two as we are would be recognized as simply a third type of chimpanzee by naturalists, hence the title. But this book is not only about our species, but about the environments that have shaped us and how we in turn began shaping the rest of the natural world, usually unintentionally but no less powerfully, once our numbers and technology made that possible, starting with humankind's probable role in the mass extinctions of large animals wherever we showed up and continuing through today's problems of climate change, overfishing and -hunting, introduction of invasive species, and habitat encroachment. The threat of nuclear war is in there, but Diamond accurately predicted that it would become less likely as the catastrophic consequences of environmental devastation grew more visible and irreversible.Informative, thought-provoking, often funny - I recommend this strongly to anyone interested in human history and prehistory and our relationships with the places and the other life forms on our planet."
9,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969387-john,4,"Jared Diamond should be required reading. He has influenced my view of humanity and history more than probably anyone except maybe a history professor in college, where I was a history minor. No, I think I Diamond has influenced me more. I stumbled across a 3 part series on PBS based on Guns, Germs and Steel a couple of years ago and was floored. I bought and read the book immediately and was even more blown away. Since then I have read Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed and Why is Sex Fun. Both of them were also mind-blowing and insightful. The Third Chimpanzee was Diamond’s first book and it really lays the groundwork for his three following. In fact 3C read a bit like an abridged version of the other three books combined. But that is not to say it did not contain things the other books didn’t….or at least that I don’t remember. The next time I recommend Diamond to a friend, I think I will recommend 3C because it is a great overview of his works.I was particularly struck by the chapters on language, both animal languages that are only beginning to be unraveled, as well as the information on human languages.The book also contains a striking chapter about genocide. It was a tough chapter to read and teetered on the edge of being overwhelmingly depressing to me. But it is something that can’t be ignored. Humans have a long history of killing each other on a massive scale. If humanity is going to change how we act in the future, we can’t gloss over the past because it demonstrates human tendencies.  Besides his incredible insight, I appreciate Diamond for a number of other reasons. First off I find his writing reachable. Although he often talks about some very complex and specific things, he does a brilliant job of making it understandable to a layperson. He also pulls no punches; he seems to have a very realistic view of humanity, good and bad. He is quick to point out inconsistencies, discrimination and arrogance, including his own. He preaches without ever feeling preachy. He also has a fun sense of humor and appreciates irony as it regularly occurs in life. I would be dumber and my life less full if I had not discovered Jared Diamond. And much to my joy he has a new book coming out in mere weeks! "
10,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4908095-ray,3,"We are all 98% chimp. By that I mean that we share 98% of our genes with our closest animal ancestors. Diamond patiently explains what that means and explores what makes us human.People say that humanity is differentiated by the use of tools and language, but also by murder and genocide. Actually the animal kingdom has examples of rudimentary tools, complex language, murder and genocide. Perhaps it is the degree to which we indulge that makes us human - no bonobo or aardvaark has a red button where, by pushing it, they could obliterate whole cities.No penguin or gazelle lives in as diverse a range of habitats as humanity, nor do they bend nature to its will in quite the same way as we do.So what does make us human. Diamond makes the case that language of increasing complexity and abstractness (this is a word?) is the prime suspect.An interesting book, and thought provoking. I marked it down because I did not find this as compelling as the other books I have read by him. Perhaps this is because he invokes many of the same themes as other books, and I have lost the thrill of the new as far as Diamond is concerned.By bizarre coincidence Diamond was on Desert Island Disks on BBC R4 on Friday. Must catch up with this."
11,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,3,"Jared Diamond is a mostly sensible anthropologist. However, he's a lousy evolutionary biologist.For example, he presents multiple theories of the reason for homo sapiens concealed ovulation. These are presented with false balance i.e. he doesn't share the consensus view, or the quality (and lack thereof) for each theory. Some have laughably low plausibility, in my opinion. He should have done the research and presented the reader with the likely truth, not a list of mostly bad ideas. Worst of all, he presents issues of natural and sexual selection from the species and even the group point of view. Group selection isn't a thing. Individual selection isn't a thing. Gene selection is the only thing. Come on, man! Read some Dawkins! There's yet more false balance and lack of scientific scruples when discussing skin pigmentation. And race. And aging.He also has this cooky theory that drug and alcohol addiction is a sort of ""status symbol"" of fitness gone amok. I think this is bogus. Heroin isn't sexy. Alcohol and tobacco can be sexy when they make you look older (and thus allowed to legally buy it). But drug addiction didn't evolve in humans. All animal that has a basal-ganglia-to-limbic loop can become addicted. Our propensity to become drug and alcohol addicted stems only from our access to drugs and alcohol.While I'm picking knits, he claims that the ancient practice of taking an alcoholic beverage as enema would bypass the liver. It actually bypasses the stomach, wherein enzymes would begin to break down the alcohol. Ethanol delivered into the blood stream via the lower gastrointestinal tract goes strait into the blood but does eventually arrive at the liver. Safe to say, it's not advised.Another thing Diamond gets wrong is SETI. For some reason, hopefully not a personal one, he insists on calling the Drake equation the ""Greene Bank Formula"" which nobody else does. Diamond seems perplexed by the question, where are all the flying saucers? This is essentially the Fermi Paradox. The answer Drake himself gave me when I posed the question to him at a SETI convention in 2011 is that space travel is expensive. ET isn't going to visit us in a flying saucer. They'll send robotic probes, and maybe even colonize multiple star systems. But they won't waste time abducting cows. Diamond doesn't adequately illustrate the degree to which we've barely started looking for SETI signals. He claims we've looked, but the silence is deafening. This is just wrong. We've not looked at a millionth of the stars in the milky way at all, and looked at no single star for longer than a year. SETI will take immense patience.He uses the wood pecker to make some point about how convergent evolution may not be universal, implying that radio capable civilizations might be super duper rare. This is bogus. Convergent evolution is not intimidate. But you better believe that a hundred million years from now, something will be picking bugs out of trees. Maybe descendants of birds. Maybe not. But something will fill the niche.Diamond dedicates the last chapter to anthropogenic mass extinction without using the word ""Holocene"", which I found strange. He suggests that humans might be dead men walking, that we're all doomed like the Easter Island civilization. But Easter Island had people on it when it was re-discovered. Small population, but humans didn't go extinct on Easter Island. I think Diamond plays the doom and gloom card to heavily. There is plenty to say about how we can conserve biodiversity. He talks about some conservation efforts in Indonesia. But it's clear he's playing the Silent Spring card. Probably a great political tool, just not very skeptical."
12,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1876124-bonnie,3,"I've read Diamond's Collapse and Guns, Germs and Steel and had never heard of this book before, so when I saw it at the bookstore I picked it up because I thought it was his new book. It wasn't. It was his first book, and it shows. This is basically a primer for the rest of his books, since all his other books are expansions of chapters/sections in this one. Why is Sex Fun? is Chapter 3, Guns, Germs and Steel is Part 4 and Collapse is Part 5.My problem with this book, besides the fact that I'd read some of it before, was that while most of his arguments were interesting, some weren't convincing. He sometimes kinda relied on personal anecdotes--mostly from his New Guinea friends--and broad generalizations instead of facts. The chapter I had the biggest issue with was ""Why Do We Smoke, Drink, and Use Drugs?"" His answer is: because, like peacocks' tails and other seemingly useless/potentially dangerous displays, it shows others that I can have/do this crap and still survive, so obviously there's enough awesome about me that it outweighs this stupid thing I do, so you don't want to mess with me if you're a predator/you should want to mate with me if you are a female. He states that ""Now, let's test my theory...if it's valid, [it:] should apply to other societies as well."" So he brings up this one guy he knows in Indonesia who drinks kerosene as a test of strength. Okay...and that proves your theory how exactly? To be fair, he also mentions Native American tribes that used drug enemas, but still. He doesn't address other possible factors, such as the benefits people feel they get out of drugs and alocohol (mood boosts/escapism/whatever) or their addictive nature. That entire chapter seemed like a 10th grade paper: lots of suppositions, little to concretly back it up. The book did bring up ideas I'd never thought about before, and made me feel less special as a human being, but I'd still say just read Diamond's later, better books and skip this one. "
13,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clouther,5,"This book was both very interesting and entertaining. It precedes Diamond's book Guns, Germs, and Steel. It ties in pretty well with some other books I've recently read including The Sixth Extinction and Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, and even Breasts: A Natural and Unnatural History.It's a little out-of-date. For example, our ancestor Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals co-existed approximately 100,000 years ago. New research shows that many modern humans contain a little Neanderthal DNA showing that there was interbreeding, whereas Diamond was pretty sure that there was basically no interbreeding. The title of this book comes from the fact that chimpanzees and pygmy chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than chimps are to gorillas. Thus, especially from the perspective of chimps, humans are a third chimp.Fun topics include the emergence of language in humans, male penis and testes size, sexual selection, adultery, racial variation due to sexual selection not natural selection, aging, menopause as an adaptive solution to childbirth, the arts, agriculture and animal domestication, drug use, the question of intelligent alien life, genocide, and extinction. Whoo. It didn't always feel like it was well-organized or related but it was all very interesting.Personally, I don't think the menopause explanation makes a lot of sense. It seems like if you weren't well-suited to give birth to your partner's baby, a first or second birth would kill you. At the rate of a baby every 4 years from ages 16-40, you'd be up to 6 births before menopause. Instead, menopause seems to make grandmothers more available to tend to their grandchildren instead of having more babies of their own (think prehistoric Michelle Duggars)."
14,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/140165-bart-everson,5,"I first became aware of Jared Diamond while having lunch in Tampere in the summer of 2001. I was there in Finland for a conference, and one of my lunch companions was raving about Guns, Germs, and Steel. A quick glance at other reviews indicates that's his most revered book; it seems to be an expansion of a single chapter in The Third Chimpanzee. Indeed many if not all of his subsequent books seem to expand on themes he first addressed here. That says a lot about the scope and ambition of Third Chimpanzee.I was drawn to this book because of its focus on human origins. This is a subject about which I knew little, and I learned plenty here, which was gratifying. But I was surprised by how much more I found here, everything from ruminations on extraterrestrial life to an examination of genocide.Diamond takes aim at the biggest questions of human existence, and attempts to explicate them with passion and honesty. Occasionally his reach exceeds his grasp, occasionally he doesn't seem to deliver the goods he promises — but only very occasionally. And honestly, if he's half-right about half the issues he takes on, it's still an impressive effort. I found his outlining of the questions at least as valuable as the answers he provides.Utterly fascinating."
15,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,3,Hmmm. This one is a bit dated and he goes off on some not terribly impressive tangents. But also a lot of interesting stuff. Here is an outline of the book:https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4...And here is a great critical reviewhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4...
16,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,4,"Jared Diamond has an amazing talent for connecting facts one after the other, leading to surprising insights. His books are full of things that make you go “Hmm.” In The Third Chimpanzee the reader will learn of humanity’s evolutionary past and the social and cultural adaptations that led to the modern world.We start with a common ape-like ancestor from whom both humans and chimpanzees/bonobos diverged some 3,000,000 years ago, and progress through the various human ancestors until we arrive at homo sapiens. Spoken language precipitated what Diamond calls The Great Leap Forward, from which point mankind’s evolution would proceed along cultural rather than biological lines. We learn interesting facts about human reproduction, some of which are still not clearly understood, about things like why ovulation in human females produces no outward physical changes in their appearance, why they are fertile for only a few days each month, why sex is done in private, and why women experience menopause. Individually, these are just facts that we all know, but most of us never thought about linking them together into into a narrative that explains how biology and cultural selection reinforce one another. Remove any one of these characteristics and modern society would probably be very different.Language is a remarkable subject, and, once again, Diamond provides interesting observations. For instance vervet monkeys have a small number of words for different kinds of threats. That these are truly words, not just vocalizations like prairie dogs make, is shown by the fact that they can use them to purposely deceive rival troops.Diamond has some good observations about the transition of humans from hunter gatherers to pastoralists and farmers. The transition from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle was not necessarily a healthy choice. Archaeological evidence show that hunter gatherers worked less than farmers, were healthier, and lived a more egalitarian lifestyle. Yuval Noah Harari, in his recent book Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, expands on this topic in greater detail and with more recent scholarship. For those with an interest in political history, according to Marx this is also the point in humanity’s past when things began to go wrong, when communities moved from what he theorized was primitive communism into the next stage of society: slavery (to be followed by feudalism, capitalism, socialism, and finally, communism again. Needless to say, it didn’t quite work out that way.)The author makes a point about the domestication of plants that he would develop more fully in Guns, Germs, and Steel, and it is one of the key concepts that he would use to try to answer the question: why did science and technology develop in the West rather than somewhere else? Why did the Europeans sail to South America rather than the Aztecs sailing to and conquering Europe? One reason was that Europe and Asia found their dominant societies oriented on an east-west axis, while in South American it was north-south. The east-west one allowed plants to move easily across the continent, introducing better nourishment and leading to larger populations. North-south would require long and painstaking generations acclimatizing plants from cooler environments to equatorial heat, and back again to cooler climates in order for them to make it to the Northern Hemisphere. The accident of east-west geography granted European and Asian societies an advantage that none of the other cultures could overcome.Finally, Diamond ends his book with a prescient look at humanity’s impact on the world. We have wiped out many many species and there is no reason to believe we will show greater caution in the future than we did in the past.The book was published in 1991 based on earlier research, so, while it is still interesting and informative, science has moved on and some of what he says is out of date. With that in mind, however, this is an excellent book for someone looking for an understanding of human social, biological, and cultural evolution."
17,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2170150-sheng-peng,1,"I will show below why I think Jared doesn't know what he is talking about, why he is an abysmal science writer, and why he is as much of a drama queen as Gladwell.Firstly, most people would put this book on the ""evolutionary biology"" shelf. So Jared better know something about evolution and biology. He does. But not nearly enough. For example, I noticed at least five times where he had used group selection, by which a gene propagates because it's beneficial to the group rather than to the individual, to explain some evolved traits. It's quite wrong. I get it that it's easy to fall for this unless being constantly on the guard. But he fell for it more than five times. Maybe he didn't get it how natural selection really works after all. Considering the book was published in the 90s, when group theory had been out of favor for decades and was becoming pretty much as laughable as Lamarckism. Oh Jared, quo vadis?Secondly, he is a really annoying smart alec. It was the worst when he used Zahavi's handicap principle to explain drug addictions of people. The theory could work very well for why peacocks have big showy tails and male deers have big antlers. But it's really stretching to say that people are showing off their health when doing hard drugs. When I was reading it, page after page, I was like this was so implausible there's no way he actually believed what he wrote. And lo and behold, he proved me correct himself! On the last page of that not so short of a chapter, he admitted his explanations didn't really work for our case and that's actually what made us uniquely human. Then why have you just wasted dozens of good pages on this nonsense. This is a ridiculous level of pedantry. To have the balls to waste the reader's time and trees like this on an irrelevant theory that obviously does not explain the question proposed. He devoted about 90% of the chapter to this non-answer.And later, he literally flipped out when listing the risks we were running when beaming radio signals to potential alien overlords out there. I think it's a valid concern and caution is warranted. But I don't think the concern could only be conveyed to the reader by showing your lid literally flying off as you are tying and head banging on desk and all. Did you forget to take your pills again, Jared?Obviously, this is all my opinion, but I judge Jared to be a frivolous pulp science writer. Avoid if you want true intellectual stimulation."
18,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/148121-simon-aloyts,4,"Dr. Diamond’s first book for which he won nothing but the admiration of some pathetic, lifeless losers like yours truly. But he should have. It was excellent. True that Chimpanzee is the Salieri to Guns’ Mozart, but what it lacks in breadth it makes up in simplicity and erudition. I breezed through this book with nary a trip to Wikipedia unlike GGS, which sent me there virtually every day. And yet I still learned a ton. The chapter titled “The Golden Age That Never Was” was a delightful decimation of the position that simpler times harbored some kind of environmental respect that we have since lost. It’s like he read Quinn’s manuscript for Ishmael (see) and wrote this in protest. Diamond points out that the Native New Worlders, far from respecting nature, precipitated the largest wave of extinction in human history. Just how respectful is it to walk up to a 500lb flightless bird that doesn’t run from you because it didn’t have the benefit of evolving to be afraid of humans and club it over the head? Or to kill a wooly mammoth, feast for 2 days and then leave the rest to rot? About as respectful as trading Manhattan Island for some beads. At least now the species-killers get to keep our gambling money. What did the giant ground sloth get?"

 and then read Collapse. So reading The Third Chimpanzee was sort of like getting a summary of those two books, plus the one I haven't read yet. Thus, I sought out to determine if the latter books suffered because they were too long an exploration of Diamond's ideas, or if they are superior to his original formulation of arguments concerning those three subjects. The shocking answer will soon be revealed!Caveat: parts of this book are now dated, as it was written nearly twenty years ago. Hence, while I usually find Harper's ""P.S."" sections boring, this one was useful because it allowed Diamond to update us on some of the advances in science and historical discoveries since the book was first published.My reaction to this book is probably the most mixed reaction I've had to any of Diamond's books thus far. As the aforementioned ""P.S."" author interview says, Diamond's life as a modern scientific polymath stems from a desire not to be confined to ""one tiny slice of life's palette."" He began as a physiological researcher and has since distinguished himself for writing on subjects like ornithology, anthropology, history, and geography, earning him the title of ""biogeographer."" I applaud Diamond for his varied interests and ability to apply those interests and synthesize an argument about human development from multiple disciplines. However, it's important that the reader remember that Diamond isn't a geneticist, astronomer, anthropologist, etc. And sometimes, he overreaches himself when attempting to apply his considerable life experience to his arguments. Oh, and he also tries to be witty and . . . well, once and a while it works, but most of the time his attempts at humour fall flat.In Part One, Diamond begins by examining how we differ from our closest relatives. There's a fancy chart that shows the estimated dates of evolutionary divergence from common ancestors (gibbons and orangutans split off earlier, then gorillas, then chimpanzees and humans finally went their separate ways around 7 million years ago). Still, the human genome and chimp genome are 98 per cent similar, and Diamond argues that this is enough of a similarity that humanity should constitute the ""third chimpanzee."" He then postulates that the rise of complex spoken language was the cause of the anthropological ""Great Leap Forward"" that allowed humans to begin developing the behaviour required for societies to arise. This is the ""teaser"" part of the book, in which Diamond whets our appetite for details he'll later reveal. He also makes a one-off attempt to plead for the cessation of medical experimentation on chimpanzees, implying that because we are—in his view—of the same genus, it's just as bad as experimenting on humans. Regardless of one's views on the subject, Diamond raises an interesting point . . . and then doesn't return to it at any subsequent moment in the book.Next, Diamond looks at humans' anomalous ""life cycle"" compared to the rest of the animal kingdom, particularly primates. Humans are the only primates in which the women go through menopause and cease being fertile. Chimpanzee males have larger testicles than human males because chimpanzee males mate so frequently they need the extra sperm, but most couplings last only seconds! I've always been interested in how our different sexual characteristics have helped humanity rise to its present status on the planet, so I loved this part of the book. Furthermore, unlike some later parts, Diamond remains on firm ground when he seeks evolutionary explanations for human sexual behaviour.That ground becomes progressively shakier in Part Three, perhaps the worst of the five parts to Diamond's book. Here, he examines aspects of human society that are uniquely developed—the two most notable examples are art and drug abuse. Unfortunately, Diamond over-extends his attempts to explain these behaviours purely from an evolutionary perspective. Is this because evolution can't solely explain them? Or is this merely a failure on Diamond's part as thinker? It's a little of both, in my opinion: Diamond is great at synthesizing disparate sources of information to create a compelling thesis; unfortunately, as he does so, he tends to get somewhat reductionist in his perspective. While his argument is not wrong, it is at the very least incomplete, which still makes it flawed.I was annoyed when, in the chapter on extraterrestrial life, Diamond began to explain why it's not necessarily likely that an advanced species would develop radio:You might object that I'm being too stringent in looking for early precursors of radios themselves, when I should instead look for just the two qualities necessary to make radios: intelligence and mechanical dexterity. But the situation there is little more encouraging. Based on the very recent evolutionary experience of our own species, we arrogantly assume intelligence and dexterity to be the best way of taking over the world, and to have evolved inevitably.Now, I actually agree with the latter part of that quotation. The fact that, on Earth, so far humans are the only form of life to have developed what we term ""intelligence"" indicates it may not be the only path to global domination. After all, prior to their extinction, the dinosaurs ruled the Earth, and they were certainly dumb by our standards. Still, Diamond is short-sighted; he wrongly assumes that intelligence or dexterity are prerequisites to leveraging radio. They're prerequisites in the invention and construction of mechanical radio transmitters and receivers, sure. ""Radio"" itself is a medium; radio waves constitute part of the electromagnetic spectrum of radiation. Just as many species have independently evolved eyes to see visual light (and some species can see into other spectrums), what's to stop a species on another planet from evolving a radio transceiver organ? Perhaps the absence of any such creature on Earth would make such an evolutionary development unlikely, at least on Earth-like planets. However, not every habitable planet has to be exactly Earth-like. Maybe there exists conditions on another planet where the evolution of biological radio makes sense. This is a totally hypothetical, spontaneous scenario, but I hope it demonstrates my problem with Diamond's reasoning. In an effort to produce the best arguments possible, he often generalizes or focuses too narrowly on subjects beyond his best areas of knowledge.In Parts Four and Five, Diamond explores the seeds of the ideas that would turn into two of his later books, Guns, Germs, and Steel and Collapse. Since I've already read these books, I have to admit I skimmed a great deal of these sections. The chapter on language was interesting, but I had already learned much the same from the more recent 
Before the Dawn
. If you read a great deal of anthropological non-fiction, you too may find these sections less-than-fascinating. The one exception is Chapter 17, ""The Golden Age That Never Was.""Thank you, Mr. Diamond, for that chapter. It irks me to no end when I hear someone talk about the ""good ol' days"" of human society, some sort of pastoral paradise where everyone was happy and we experienced no strife. The idea that simpler times were better times is a myth, one that Diamond thoroughly discredits in this chapter. He shows us that people, for the most part, have perpetrated the same sort of acts in the past as we see happening now—the difference is one of degree. Modern technology allows us to expand the scale and speed with which we create problems, making us more efficient at marshalling chaos. Unfortunately, Pandora's box has been opened, and there's no going back. Diamond comes to the same conclusion and so focuses on what hope we might have for the future of our spaces, however slim.As with Collapse, Diamond broadcasts a message of cautious optimism. We may be able to survive, provided we as a society ""choose"" to begin living in a way that's more sustainable. He's vague on the details, claiming that his book is ""an analysis"" of our problems rather than a laundry-list of potential solutions. The solutions, he maintains, are already well-known; we just have to choose to implement them. While that sort of rhetoric isn't very appealing to me, I understand Diamond's difficulty in writing prescriptions. Nevertheless, that call for optimism is less effective in such an unhelpful context.Right from the start of The Third Chimpanzee, Diamond was up front about his mad love for New Guinea and its peoples and his opinion that it's somehow a microcosm for the development of society. Those who have read my review of Guns, Germs, and Steel know how I got tired of hearing that line. Paradoxically, the New Guineans feature more heavily in this book, but I found their inclusion both more tolerable and more interesting. I actually learned things about New Guinea that made me exclaim, ""Oh, that's cool!"" rather than roll my eyes and snort, ""Right, OK Diamond. Whatever you say."" My experience with The Third Chimpanzee has therefore provoked the least amount of sarcasm from me regarding Jared Diamond's writing. It is both the best and the worst of his work: where it is flawed, it is more flawed; where it is useful, it is far more useful. If you read one Jared Diamond book, this should be the one.And there's the rub. It's difficult to write popular science books. There's a fine line between intelligent and esoteric, between academically rigorous and overly-complicated. Diamond has undertaken a challenge, and for that I respect him; at least he isn't writing puff pieces. For the majority of people, The Third Chimpanzee is worthy of dinner table conversation or book group discussion; it's a great starting point in the quest to read anthropological non-fiction. It is not the culmination of that quest, but a stepping stone along the way to more rigorous, more intense non-fiction on this subject. And that's all it can be."
21,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16616412-nandita-damaraju,5,"A few weeks ago, a bunch of us were talking about the origins of our species, Homo sapiens and I was astonished at how little my friends and I knew about our ancestors. Going back to the roots of our development can provide a lot of insights into our present. So after scouting around for some recommendations, I picked up this brilliant book to learn more about our past, present, and future. The book begins with the deviation of homo sapiens and our closest relatives, the chimpanzees, and the bonobos from our common ancestor, the great ape, about 3 million years ago. The book then proceeds to trace our evolution through hallmark human characteristics and how these characteristics might eventually spell disaster for our species. The author Jared Diamond draws a lot of his observations from his frequent trips to the Pacific Islands, that until recently were isolated pockets of land with no contact to the outside world. These observations span the domains of biology, anthropology, culture, history, and language. It is hard to gain an unbiased outsider’s perspective of the evolution of our species, and the author attempts to do this from time to time by invoking a neutral alien observer who would comment on our development. Since this book was written in 1991, a part of the book that is based on conjecture about the genetics of human evolution. These theories have primarily been proved/disproved ever since sequencing technologies have evolved rapidly. I also couldn’t help but notice how natural selection has played a significant role not only in genetic evolution but also in cultural development. The author remarks how genetic differences between humans 40,000 years ago and now are very minimal. The author argues, that if humans of 40,000 years ago were to be born today, they would be able to use the latest technology with dexterity. The author in his chapters of sexuality and the human life cycle very wonderfully brings out how this cultural evolution has superseded genetic evolution in various aspects of our lifecycle such as our choice for a mate, concealed ovulation, clandestine copulation. The traits mentioned above, have been carried forward over generations because they enable us to perform more efficiently. It was a revelation to see how the modern plagues of society, xenophobia, violence, environmental destruction, etc. are rooted deeply in our evolutionary history. We, humans, were responsible not only for the extermination of large species such as the woolly mammoths, sabertooths and giant sloths that roamed the planet until recently. We were also responsible for the extinction of a part of our OWN species, such as the Tasmanian aboriginals, all 50,000 of whom were killed by colonists. The list of species we have driven to extinction is a lot larger than I would have ever imagined. So it doesn’t come as a surprise that we continue to act in our evolutionarily wired ways and continue to decimate our environment and species around us. But being rooted deep in our evolutionary history doesn’t warrant justifying such acts. To quote the author, “The past was still a Golden Age, of ignorance, while the present is an Iron Age of willful bliss.” We were oblivious to the damage we were causing to the environment a few centuries ago, but now we are aware of the consequences and aware of the fact that these consequences are much more substantial due to our large population. The period of “willful bliss” will soon transform into a period of ""irrevocable despair"" if we continue to use lack of awareness as a pretext to cause environmental damage further. The last few chapters of the book, take on an apocalyptic tone and very rightly so. Even though the author profoundly believes our end is near, if we don’t reform our ways, he remains “cautiously optimistic” in the epilogue of the book. A lot of the events that helped our species flourish throughout the planet were mere coincidences, and we’re collectively abusing that luck. Reading about our origins was deeply humbling and puts all the other ""problems"" that pique our capitalistic, material world today into perspective. I would highly recommend this book to EVERYONE, irrespective of age, interests, and beliefs."
22,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,4,"Were you a visitor to Earth from outer space, you'd want a handbook about the dominant kind of life on the planet. The Third Chimpanzee would be perfect for you!Jared Diamond has published several books, all of them a pleasure to read. In this one he first presents the themes that he develops in the others. You hear about the factors that favored Europeans in their rise to domination of other people which is greatly expanded upon in Guns, Germs and Steel. You also learn of the common human social characteristic of continuing to follow the same path even when it leads to the destruction of a way of life, which is greatly expanded upon in Collapse.The Third Chimpanzee takes a wide view of Homo Sapiens Sapiens, explaining where we came from (having a common ancestor with the chimps), our patterns of social and sexual behavior contrasted with other animals, the most important being language. He writes of our place in the universe, and why we may be alone though others might have gone before elsewhere. Intelligence brings the ability to manipulate the physical world in dangerous ways and responsibility does not necessarily develop with brain power. Upon finishing the book, the reader can't help but acknowledge that humans are not the perfection of life on earth, but rather are creatures with positive and negative qualities that, because of our explosive population growth, must be controlled if we are to survive. A bountiful earth has given us the illusion that there are no limits, but the lives most of us spend in completely artificial creations, our cities, keep the changes our consumption makes in the natural world from notice. Diamond wants us to think of ourselves based on our real behavior and the consequences to be expected from it, not upon lofty mythological tales of what it is to be a human with a divine sanction to do as we please.The most intriguing topic is our sudden great leap forward about 40,000 years ago, long after our large brain had evolved. Diamond believes it was the development of language that allowed us to plan with each other and to pass knowledge from one generation to the next that did the trick, but how did that come about? Other animals are intelligent but lack the physical apparatus to speak as we do. Another amazing fact is that since humanity emerged in Africa a million years ago, until about 15,000 years ago there was not a single human being living in North or South America.It has been more than 20 years since this book was first published. I had read it then and put it on the shelf to read again. This second reading was not a disappointment, it has aged very well, but leaves me curious to find out what further information has been found since 1991."
23,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4704819-eric,4,"This is the third ""textbook"" I have read by Jared Diamond. Guns, Germs, and Steel continues as a must read for anyone remotely interested in the history of mankind. The Third Chimpanzee refers to Diamond's views that Homo Sapiens evolved from chimpanzees some 6 million years ago. The other ""two"" chimpanzees refer to a not well understood ""third man"" and robust australopithecines. In any event, homo sapiens first emerged as homo erectus 1.7 million years ago and evolved into homo sapiens about 500,000 years ago. The other two chimpanzees did not ""survive"".What was most intriguing for me is Diamond's unique writing style (I can understand him!) and the logical progression he outlines in the ""Third Chimpanzee"". Perhaps the most important event in the history of man is Diamond's portrayal of ""The Great Leap Forward"". This Leap is likely the bridge in our evolution to human language for which, due to its nature, archaeological evidence is very difficult to find and age. Other topics he covers are the substantially unique human elements of: sexuality, why we grow old and die, origins of art, agriculture (and its mixed blessings), domestication of animalswhy humans smoke, drink and use dangerous drugs (even though they know it is stupid to do so), whether we are alone in the universe, history of first contacts, accidental conquerors (hard to summarize but interesting), racial discrimination, and genocide.Diamond closes with his views of two clouds hanging over us. Until our own generation, no one had grounds to worry whether the next human generation would survive or enjoy a planet worth living on. That is no longer the case. First is the cloud of nuclear holocaust. If it occurs, it will be bad of us and might even kill us all. The risk shapes much of current world diplomacy. The second cloud is environmental holocaust. As early as 1992 (when The Third Chimpanzee is published), Diamond succinctly summarizes this risk. His epilogue is ""Nothing Learned, and Everything Forgotten? We should pay attention to everything he has to say."
24,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,3,"I read this the first time more than 25 years ago. At least, possibly more time ago even than that.Then it was a 4 star read going on 4.5 stars. It just isn't anymore. Some parts of it are excellent but dated. Some parts are beyond dated- they no longer are considered viable theory. Some sections are pure hogwash, although stated in a strongly logical and respectful tone. This is primarily his whole universe ""picture"" to life and intelligent life, in particular. What that issue of compatible numbers of environments that could produce life outside of our solar system. That's just plain wrong, IMHO. The probabilities figures on that have immensely been turned upside down since this book was published. Most of the early homo species stuff is 4 or 4.5 stars. But this is a field that has been tremendously altered by DNA and other particular physical forensics and anthropology studies of forms and chemical sciences in the last 10 to 15 years, IMHO. Also there is another wider tangent he takes here that is likable to read, but most probably is not numerically or nuance width assumption correct. He knows a lot, don't get me wrong. He is a superb observer and seeking, an excellent scientist. But he also clearly did not know all he did not know when he wrote this. His picture was actually too narrow to make assumptions as wide to the outcomes he has here, IMHO.But it's really worth a read if you never understood early homo forms or had see where that field was when earlier tracking homo progressions in geographic movement. And especially a call out for the excellent parsing of homo sapiens women's menopause development appears here. That's a particular phase of life that rarely, rarely exhibits in any animal or mammal life form and he has a superb chapter here about evolution favor for this feature."
25,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4146169-karishma,4,"Jared Diamond writes lucidly and engagingly about the rise of the human race as the dominant species on the planet, as he documents the contribution of our animal heritage towards what we consider uniquely human achievements like language, art, agriculture and use of tools. He also pointedly argues for us as a species to change our ways as he paints a vivid picture of our fall from grace, demonstrating how easy it is to reverse our hardwon progress - through our destruction of our environment, our willful abuse of the earth's resources and our lack of regard towards the ever-dwindling numbers of other species we share this planet with. It is a timely warning and one we must heed. It is in Nature that we evolved our gifts, and it is in Nature that we lose them just as easily, and history is littered with examples of erstwhile successful species and populations brought low by their thoughtless actions that laid waste their resources.Earth is the only home we have and it's time we stopped acting like we have a spare. We've been lucky so far, but we must learn from our past mistakes or like the chilling example of Ozymandias in the desert, we too will die out, our past glories half buried under the restless sands of time and no one to remember our names."

This book was written before that one and you can tell that  Jared Diamond becomes a more polished and focused writer. The Third Chimpanzee focuses on how many of the characteristics the we consider uniquely ""human"" (language, art, murder) really aren't as unique as we think. He makes good arguments but maybe takes on more than he should. Still, it sets the stage for Diamond's later works (including  Collapse which I still haven't read. 3.5 stars"

The one idea I saw discussed here which is often neglected is the idea of human cultural elements existing within animals. That is really freaking cool and I would love to see a book handle that topic in more depth. If you have any recommendations lemme know.I recommend this for those who liked books like sapians, the selfish gene, the moral animal and books of the kind, this will help you gain some more depth in your understanding of humanity."

The anthropological view, unlike the biological one covered by Dawkins, keeps things interesting by addressing questions related to our every day lives, yet still having a scientific foundation to provide scaffolding for the content. If you've read Diamond's GG&S prior to this, as I'm sure many will have, there may be a few chapters you can skip, but the content remains as fascinating as when you read it the first time. "

31,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1445709-tyas,5,"The Third Chimpanzee seemed to be a late addition to my book collection. I have read the other books by Diamond that elaborate on specific topics discussed previously in The Third Chimpanzee, and it is only now that I had the chance to finish the book.I was reading this book on a short flight connecting Bangkok and Chiang Mai, when the Irish guy sitting next to me said to me, “Excuse me, but is that a book by Jared Diamond? I saw the name but I’m not sure about the title…” Thus began one of the strangest conversations in my life about the human race. He came from Ireland, ‘the only European nation that probably has never colonized other nations – well, because we were colonized…’ while I came from Indonesia, one of the cradles of the Homo genus and where Diamond did some of his research. I said to him though that I hadn’t yet finished reading The Third Chimpanzee, so I couldn’t give any opinion yet about the book. We forgot to exchange contact details, so I had no idea how to tell it to him now.Well, I would tell him: this book is amazing!Talking about the human race – the human species, to be biologically correct – is like walking on a mine field. One slip of a tongue, or one misunderstood line, and people may label you as a racist. But people like Diamond aren’t racist – they’re not here to tell us that whitemen are genetically more superior, thus able to stomp across the world and defeat other peoples, other cultures. They believe that by learning more about the human species, we can get to the roots of our hatred and misery and find more effective ways to stop us from destroying ourselves and Nature.The Third Chimpanzee sets to find out what makes us unique, just as each species there ever was, is, and will be is unique; what makes us human. And on its way, it made me cry with its gripping tales of the crimes we have done to our fellow human beings – especially in the chapter about genocide. It also opened my eyes about the connection between agriculture and some of our miseries now. This book cut into my heart and cut it further into pieces, and reassembled it, even more determined than ever to get up and do something for fellow humans and Nature.I was lucky I had found Diamond."
32,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/764967-nola,3,"The Third Chimpanzee is meant to show that humans may be able to preserve the environment and avoid mutual destruction through awareness of our true nature, which is something that we don’t spend much time exploring. This book is meant to remedy that. I don’t need to be convinced that humans are a type of chimpanzee, but Jared Diamond has some convincing evidence that I hadn’t known. For one thing, in addition to humans being more closely related to chimpanzees than to any other species, chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than they are to gorillas or any other apes. Jared Diamond also makes a compelling case against using chimpanzees for medical experiments or keeping them in zoos.The book has introductory teasers at the beginning of the sections, asking the reader to think about intriguing questions. The answers given vary from no one has any idea to nicely crafted theories of how evolution progressed. Here are just a few tidbits from the book. The progress of human civilization has been very slow. It is documented only through items that have been preserved, which leaves gaps in what we know about early ape/human lives. Neanderthals, in contrast to humans, had a culture that did not vary from place to place or change over time. The life history of humans is remarkably different from that of all other mammals in number of offspring, menopause and length of life. Agriculture has been a mixed blessing, supporting more people than hunting and gathering, but requiring more work and leading to epidemics as more people were able to live closely enough together to facilitate the spread of disease.There is a lot in this book that I didn’t know, both facts and studied considerations. I’m not sure the components of the book are tightly tied into the basic premise, but it is well worth reading for the perspective that Jared Diamond can provide.Audio Version"
33,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44354532-simo-ibourki,4,"Unlike Guns, Germs and Steel, this book seems to me to have no central thesis, Jared wanted to talk about everything that make us human (Genes, sex, war, art, language, ...).He tried to trace every human behavior to its animal origins: Humans have a language? Vervet monkeys too.Humans use drugs ? Just like peacocks.Humans commit genocides? Chimps too.Humans make art? Elephants too.Except the vervet monkey language which may be valid (an earlier stage of our own language), I guess that the other animal origins of human traits are just speculations)The last 3 chapters of the book are a warning message about the status of our environement. He said that the current extinction rate of animal species is higher than normal (natural rate), and that by killig animals and clearing trees we put our lives and the lives of the next generation at risk.In this I agree with Jared 100%.The best chapter I read was the one on genocide, I was shocked reading about the history of genocides, we have a bloody history and we are a blood-thirsty species."
34,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77330473-siddharth-samal,5,"Oh boy. Where do I begin. This book took weeks to get through. Even accounting for busy-ness and laziness, it was tough to push through this labirynthine work. There were times when I was frustrated - wanting to fling this book right through my window - and to let the gaping crack on the window remain as a testament to my rage. Because he can drone on and on redundantly at times. Or maybe he is worried about not stressing on certain points enough. What is not in doubt is his level of multi-disciplinary knowledge. History, geography, linguistics, politics, biology and more. This results in a systems approach - linking together multiple facets of an issue to present a cohesive theory, of which he has many. Sometimes, it can be genuinely amazing. Sometimes it's hard work. I have never felt so slowed down by a book, so maybe that added to unnecessary frustration. You have to process each paragraph, as most of them are choke full of information - which can range from geography to a linguistic theory to a biological mechanism or even a psychological one. That being said, the rationales that follows these insights and information are easy to follow. All in all, a book that is a world in itself, while acting as a stepping off point for further reading. He's imperious throughout, but he's also humble in his final words for each chapter. Of course, the implications and conclusions about humanity can keep you staring blankly at a wall in your next party, even while your drink lays forgotten. Just kidding. It's an honest book, never veering off into unwarranted cynicism, despite the subject matter at hand. I look forward to the next Jared Diamond brain pilates session. After all, this is one of his older works.PS: What also works is the story of the man himself. An accomplished polymath, he's lived with the many prehistoric tribes in New Guinea (which we learn is one of the last remaining pristine microcosms of our prehistoric past). When you combine this innate intellect with the fact that he's also considered as one of the top 100 public intellectuals - it adds to the feeling that you are listening to one of the best unified theories on this planet"
35,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,4,"Hopefully this won’t come as too much of a surprise, but you better sit down just in case … humans (including you and I) are animals. Humans are the mammalian relatives of dogs, cats, porpoises, chipmunks and walruses. More specifically, we share a common ancestor with the great apes with whom we also share much of our DNA (98.4% of our DNA is identical to that found in chimpanzees). If it weren’t for a few important differences found in the remaining 1.6% (from which we’ve evolved language and tool use) we could very well be classified as a third chimpanzee (along with the common and pygmy varieties). Because we are animals, many of the behaviors found in humans can also be found in the animal kingdom. Certain animal species form bonded pairs, care for their offspring, act aggressively towards strangers, and feature a social hierarchy, just as humans do. Although animal corollaries exist, Diamond argues that there are two behaviors common in humans that are found to a much lesser degree in the animal world, those being: the killing of members of our own species and the tendency to destroy our environment. These are the two topics that Jared Diamond (noted author, polymath, and UCLA professor) seeks to explore in The Rise And Fall Of The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal:-	What are the genetic, physical, cognitive, behavioral and evolutionary differences that make humans both unique and similar to other animal species?-	What is it about humans that make them predisposed to destroy each other and the ecosystems upon which they rely for survival?Evolution lies at the heart of each of these questions and Diamond explores the evolutionary pressures that led to these human characteristics. Diamond has a nice writing style that makes these concepts interesting and understandable without oversimplifying the subject matter. Anyone who is interested in human evolution will find the book to be of interest. He also introduces two important topics (that of: why cultures develop at different rates, and why cultures collapse) that he fleshes out in more detail his later excellent books Guns, Germs and Steel and Collapse respectively. Diamond is pessimistic as to humanity’s ability to exist in harmony with nature and this conclusion is supported by the historic record. Whenever humans are introduced into a new environment, extinctions of large animals invariably results. Moas, giant sloths, mammoths and the dodo disappeared in the geological blink of an eye upon encountering the most destructive of earth’s species … and the trend has only accelerated as the human population has ballooned. It’s really only a matter of time before a cascade of negative environmental consequences begins from which collapse is the inevitable result. Perhaps it’s already underway. With regards to the book I will raise two points:1.	It’s worth keeping in mind that many of the ideas Diamond presents are speculative. Neither skin color, language, nor sexual behavior leave evidence in the fossil record. Thus when Diamond discusses the evolution of these characteristics, he is presenting a hypothesis for which no direct evidence exists. He can draw correlations with other species that we are able to study directly, but ultimately these questions have yet to be conclusively answered (and may never be).2.	The book was originally published in 1997 and this 3rd edition was published in 2006, but like with other fast moving scientific fields, that of anthropology has proceeded beyond Diamond’s knowledge at the time of his writing. By way of a few examples, his description of hominid evolution fails to mention Homo floresiensis, Homo denisova or Homo naledi. Genome sequencing was not a mature technology in 1997 so he also was not aware that Neanderthal-derived DNA accounts for an estimated 1–4% of the Eurasian genome and others. "

37,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1429082-daniel-solera,4,"Originally published in 1993, The Third Chimpanzee is in many regards, a precursor to Jared Diamond’s much acclaimed Guns, Germs and Steel. In fact, Guns is basically an expansion of Chapter 14 of this book, “Accidental Conquerors”; I am also predicting that Diamond’s newest book, Collapse is an expansion of Chapter 17, “The Golden Age That Never Was”. Anyway, where Guns deals with the human race as societies, Chimpanzee deals with it on an anthropological and sociological level. The book details the various theories about our ancestral heritage, explains the evolutionary origins of our biological makeup and how our unique qualities as animals will shape our future as a species.Much of the first half of the book revolves around the scientific discovery that we share 98.4% of our DNA with chimpanzees, and it is that miniscule disparity that somehow made possible the Great Leap Forward. Through careful explanation of biological history and visual aids, Diamond illustrates the various hominids that make up our evolutionary genealogy. He asks and attempts to answer questions such as, what happened to Neanderthals? Were they a separate species of man, a split in the evolutionary chain or simply a different race? How do we explain the emergence of key skills and traits for which we have no fossil imprints, such as why we feed our young for decades, why we developed an ubiquitous monogamy, why women go through menopause, and why did we develop writing and language when we did?This book definitely changes how one views humanity. Not only does it break down our idea of being human to a series of biological impulses, but it highlights the exponential rate at which we have evolved. He continually mentions the idea of an Outer Space Anthropologist visiting our planet at various stages of our development and what he would think. At every point in which he comes across a characteristic that one would assume as uniquely human, he immediately brings up an unlikely animal that shares that trait.Much like Guns, Diamond loses steam about 2/3 of the way into the book. Up until this point, I was thrilled with what I was reading. The idea that the size ratio between sexes of a given species largely determines their degree of polygamy was fascinating. The book also did a lot to answer the question of why human babies are so helpless, while the offspring of cattle or a wild rhinoceros seems capable of so much from its first hour in the world. I also enjoyed his breakdown of our criteria for mate selection and how pathetic it sounds when compared to our survival imperatives. I was hoping that he would venture into predicting how our bodies would continue to evolve, but I was not spoiled with such a chapter in this book.But again, the last third isn’t as compelling. Too early in the book, Diamond brings up ethical issues that fight with his scientific themes for attention. They come back at the end in the form of doomsday warnings and a laundry list of all the atrocities that humanity has committed both towards each other and to the environment, which slowed down the pace. But Diamond earnestly loves humanity and its rich history – but not as much as he loves New Guinea – and this book does the animal justice."

The chimpanzees, not the gorilla, are our closest relatives. Put another way, the chimpanzees' closest relative is not the gorilla but humans.""2) ""[The] most hotly debated problem in the evolution of human reproduction is to explain why we ended up with concealed ovulation, and what good all our mistimed copulations do for us. For scientists, it's no answer just to say that sex is fun. Sure, it's fun, but evolution made it that way. If we weren't getting big benefits from our mistimed copulations, mutant humans who had evolved not to enjoy sex would have taken over the world.""3) ""We wouldn't mourn the shrinking cultural diversity of the modern world if it only meant the end of self-mutilation and child suicide. But the societies whose cultural practices have now become dominant were selected just for economic and military success. Those qualities aren't necessarily the ones that foster happiness or promote long-term human survival. Our consumerism and our environmental exploitation serve us well at present but bode ill for the future. Features of American society that already rate as disasters in anyone's book include our treatment of old people, adolescent turmoil, abuse of psychotropic chemicals, and gross inequality. For each of these problem areas, there are (or were before first contact) many New Guinea societies that found far better solutions to the same issue.""4) ""Our inherited [proto-Indo-European] roots tend to be for human universals that people surely were already naming thousands of years ago: words for the numbers and human relationships; words for body parts and functions; and ubiquitous objects or concepts like 'sky,' 'night,' 'summer,' and 'cold.' Among the human universals thus reconstructed are such homely acts as 'to break wind,' with two distinct roots in PIE depending on whether one does it loudly or softly.""5) ""Although we usually think of the Cro-Magnons as the first bearers of our noblest traits, they also bore the two traits that lie at the root of our current problems: our propensities to murder each other en masse and to destroy our environment. Even before Cro-Magnon times, fossil human skulls punctured by sharp objects and cracked to extract the brains bear witness to murder and cannibalism. The suddenness with which Neanderthals disappeared after Cro-Magnon arrived hints that genocide had now become efficient. Our efficiency at destroying our own resource base is suggested by extinctions of almost all large Australian animals following our colonization of Australia fifty thousand years ago, and of some large Eurasian and African mammals as our hunting technology improved. If the seeds of self-destruction have been so closely linked with the rise of advanced civilizations in other solar systems as well, it becomes easy to understand why we have not been visited by any flying saucers."""
39,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34442147-nuno-r,5,"The title sums up the provocative proposal that Jared Diamond advances in this book. Why think of humans in any other way than as another chimpanzee? The argument is very well presented - the evidence for the classification of our species in the same branch of the common chimpanzee and the bonobo. What this allows is too escape the trap (we are usually in) of human exceptionalism and, instead, look at our species with some degree of sobriety and equanimity. The author goes on a brave attempt to investigate the history of our species and our potential for future survival. This is an interesting exercize. We are, so far, the only species we know that is self-aware. But we frequently are unable to do these exercizes where we include ourselves in the planet's tree of life. This book is not an heretic gratuitous provocation, using a device just for shock value or to get media attention and sell more. It is a serious effort to restore humanity to its most precious place: nature. And by that effort, to give us a better perspective of where we are and where our future might take us."

The book explains what is the meaning of the sexual and natural selections (in the evolutionary sense); why the human evolution has reached today's technological level; what are the social interactions between the primates (for example, are there soulmates?); what are the simple (not unusual) scientific reasons behind some of the mass-extinctions on Earth. The book tells us a story about the amazing worlds, tribes, and societies in New Guinea and describes quite a lot of interesting and curious facts and conclusions interrelated with the evolution of the species.

Jared Diamond tells an exciting, coherent and relatively accurate story in his book The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee - How our animal heritage affect the way we live. A book that tries to tell a story that spans several million years will have to be very selective. Especially when it draws data from fields such as biology, archeology, linguistics, genetics, human psychology, ecology, etc The author obviously has cut a few corners but it doesn´t really matter. There is a section at the end of the book with further reading for those that want to read more about the subjects at hand. This book is a must read for those that want to learn more about our human origins. Brief synopsisThere are five parts to this book. It starts off with Just another species of big mammal, a short description about our evolutionary history from several million years ago up until right before agriculture was discovered about 10 000 years ago.The second part, An animal with a strange lifecycle, deals with what makes us different from the other primates. Changes in life-cycles were crucial to the development of language and other aspects of modern human activity. We are talking about monogamy, infidelity, sexual selection, why humans have hidden ovulation and menopause (come on! what is up with that?)Part three continues with discussions about the development of language, art, agriculture, drug use and whether we are alone in the universe or not. I found the part about language especially intriguing. It turns out that the linguistics experts have reconstructed alot of PIE (Proto-Indo-European), a language that hasn´t been spoken for thousands of years. This part also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of agriculture, which was very interesting. Because I always figured that there was no real negative side to agriculture. Well it turns out that agriculture gives you alot of calories, but the diet will be less varied. This makes you more affected by caries and malnourishment. Not to mention that you are more affected by droughts. Most diseases could not have spread if we didn´t live in large concentrations that agriculture permits. The fourth part of the book is called World Conquerors. As soon as people have entered areas that previously hadn´t been discovered it usually spelled disaster for a majority of the species living there. This has led to the extinction of many many species of animals, birds, reptiles etc. Too many to count. Islands like Mauritius, Madagaskar, Crete, Hawaii, New Zealand and numerous other islands in the Pacific have lost an incredible amount of wildlife when humans arrived. ""Dead as a Dodo"" has even become an expression. The discovery of the american continent(asians crossing the Bering Straits about 12-14 000 years ago, not that italian sailor dude) also coincided with an entire fauna of large mammals getting extinct. So far I had heard about most of this before, but the really chilling part of the book shows that we not only conquers nature, but we also conquer each other. Through the spreading of disease, interbreeding, and even genocide. I remember from biology class in high school that most animals have the hardest competition with members of their own species. Because they fit the exact same niche they compete for the same partners and resources. Other species also fight each other and you could even say that some species have conflicts with neighbor groups. Lions, hyenas, and chimpanzees are among the species where small scale warfare has been observed. We humans are no exception.Xenophobia is a natural instinct and it is made much worse by our capacity for mass murder and genocide. This chapter lists all kinds of genocide through out history, from ancient times up until the 20th century. Jared Diamond discusses at length how seemingly normal people can take part in genocide. They are not necessarily crazy or different from any one of us. We all have the potential for violence. According to Diamond there are three major principles to how normal people justifies in taking part in genocide. A usefully elastic definition of ""self defense"", possessing the ""right"" religion, race or political belief and finally a different ethical code for animals. And by reducing other people to the same level as animal permits you to treat them much worse. All three rationalizations were used both in the USA and in Australia in reducing the number of natives. Not only by civilians but also by military and the government. This is also completely common to see in wartime propaganda. This part of the book is coldly rational and it all makes sense. Even if it is completely terrifying. I chill went through my spine when he discussed what the world looked like in the early 1990s. And what areas we should watch out for when it comes to genocide. He lists areas like Northern Ireland, New Caledonia, Sri Lanka, the middle east and last but not least Yugoslavia. Several of these places have experienced if not an all out genocide, definetly mass murder. Just the other day Radovan Karadzic was sentenced in Haag for his actions during the genocide in Screbenica. In trying to understand how genocide is possible we are able to minimize the chances of it happening. Globalisation of media and the understanding that we are all the same species are among the factors that will hopefully reduce violence. And according to Steven Pinker and his book The Better Angels of our Nature, this is exactly what has happened. I will have to read that book some other time. Reversing our progress overnight is the title for the fifth and last part of the book and it deals with the myth that species live in constant balance with each other and the environment. This is normally not true, maybe only true for short periods of time. Species migrate and whenever a predator expands into an area where the prey is not able to defend themselves disaster is usually spelled for the unlucky ones. This should be no secret as we know of many examples when rats, goats, snakes, cats etc have wiped out some indigenous species. This is especially true when predators are generalists and not dependent on any one single type of prey. The same principle applies to humans, and have done so numerous times in the past. There are countless examples after the (re)discovery of the american continent, but there are also several earlier ones. such as the extinction of the Moas from New Zealand. There are also strong indications that humans eradicated a lot of large mammals like mammoths, horses and other large herbivores from the american continent. It is obviously much harder to prove since it happened more than 10 000 years ago, but the author makes a very convincing case nonetheless.Jared Diamond is a very interesting author, lecturer and science educator. He started out his career by studying the physiology of the gallbladder. He studied at both Harvard and Cambridge and in 1968 he became a professor in physiology at UCLA medical school. Ever since his childhood he had very diverse interests. Everything from learning languages, to geography, to birds and astronomy. He started writing articles for a magazine in the late 1970s, and he could finally explore his other interests. By chance he won a scholarship from the MacArthur Foundation in 1985 and this encouraged him to focus his writing for the public. He started writing The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee, in 1985 and finished it in 1990. The book was published in 1992 and it turned out to be a great success. He has later expanded on the topics and published them in other books such as Why is Sex fun (1997), Guns, Germs and Steel (1997), Collapse; How societies choose to fail or succeed (2005). It is seems quite obvious that his later books are expansions of chapters and topics found in this book. I´ve previously read Guns, Germs and Steel, and Why Sex is Fun, whereas the book Collapse is still sitting at the book shelf. I can definitively recommend the first two books. Especially Guns Germs and Steel. It is a great read. I might write a review of that later some time. ConclusionI really like Jared Diamonds work. He connects ancient evolutionary history with modern world events, and by doing that he demonstrates that knowledge of the natural world is crucial. If we do not understand where we are coming from how will we be able to make the best decisions? He is a great science educator and a skilled storyteller, both in writing and in the documentaries he has made. Several of his lectures, documentaries, TED Talks can be found on Youtube. I suggest you check them out. You can also buy The Third Chimpanzee at Amazon, or any other book store, or why not stop by your local library and borrow it there?Memorable Quote:""Along with drinking a strychnine cocktail, poking an adult rhinoceros or Cape buffalo with a spear ranks as one of the most effective means of suicide that I know.""

55,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19412798-megan,4,"Jared Diamond's book is astonishing for the breadth of subjects covered in under 350 pages. He is a polymath who covers pre-history, linguistics, behaviour and nation-states in an easy to read style. This is the pre-cursor book to Guns, Germs and Steel that I read last year (or was it the year before, I forget). As a result it covers much of the information that is dealt with in much more depth in that book so I admit to skimming some of the information that was already covered in that book. I read the original version, written in 1991, not the version updated in 2006 so it is missing some of the updates such as new information about Neanderthals and is annoyingly ignorant of the extent of Australian aboriginal agriculture. It is written from a 1991 lens so the spectre of nuclear war is alive and well. Other than that it is a book that is remarkably modern in its outlook. It is anti-racist and anti-sexist at a time when it was not fashionable.Jared's political inventions are remarkably hard to determine. The book is largely a call out to prevent the mass extinction of species by humans. He calls out colonial practices and yet doesn't let pre-contact people off the hook. Rather than regarding them as 'noble savages' he regards them as he does all other humans - capable of mass genocide and environmental destruction, and that our behaviours are rooted in pre-history. He doesn't use these as apologies and he points out that as our population grows and our technology improves we have faster means of achieving our own environmental doom if we don't be careful. In short, he thinks we humans only have ourselves to blame and don't learn from history, despite being fully capable of doing so.A good companion (along with Guns, germs and Steel) to Sapiens and Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari, Superior by Angela Saini and Behaviour by Robert Sapolsky."

There's also a serious issue with this guy going into fields in which he is not sufficiently well versed to write about correctly, even if his actual thoughts are more or less fine, plus he chooses contentious things and goes a bit twee with moralizing. And yes I see the contradiction with me calling him a bummer. He's. . .weird. Guns, Germs and Steel is better, Sapiens is WAY better, something covering memes is glaringly absent here, and so on. It's not an outright bad book, but I'm really not sure you should read it. If you accept it whole-cloth you'd probably have been better off not reading it at all. . .unless you're trading creationism out for it, in which case literally any porridge of evolutionary thought is an improvement over your current situation."

I couldn't help but notice many similarities between this book and ""sapiens"" by yuval harari (this book was written two decades before sapiens was published). If you have read 'sapiens' and liked it, I'm sure you would thoroughly enjoy this one. some of the morally ambiguous questions posed in first part by author really struck my nerve. for example, since chimps are 98.4% similar to humas (in DNA) should we experiment/ mutilate chimps willy nilly?. let's say, a slightly advanced species (compared to homosapiens) puts humans in cages and does things that we are currently doing to chimps, would we be okay with that?Second and third part of the book explains the sexual selection without boring the reader.In last part, author clearly attributes the causes for the extinction of number species. author makes a pretty good case as to why humans are culpable for this phenomena. All in all an excellent read.highly recommend it.prudhvi"
58,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23558406-jaak-ennuste,3,"Jared Diamond undoubtedly has one of the best ""big picture"" views of all authors that I have encountered. We humans are genetically very similar to chimpanzees. In fact, we are closer to them than they are to any other ape. Then how come we are so very different? Diamond takes up a task to explain how we, in many ways, are actually much more similar to animals than we would've guessed. With that, he also takes us through the development of the human species, and how is it that during our evolution, most of what we call progress has happened at the very last second (relatively to how long we've evolved). It is similar to Sapiens, but less sensational and much more academic. It is not a page-turner like Sapiens, but you will have a better understanding of the human species after you read it."
59,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4551268-sara-g,3,"I enjoyed this book, but it's obvious that quite a bit of the scientific information is a little out of date. Gene sequencing and our understanding of DNA is very different now than it was in 1992 when this book was published. That being said, the anthropological studies are fascinating (as always with Jared Diamond) and I did find some value in reading this book. I'd recommend that most people just go with the slightly later Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies if they want to read something by Diamond."

He tends to take a theory and make it fact. I was frustrated with some of his conclusions. For instance, you are very likely to marry someone who looks like you (so much so that you would marry someone whose nose bridge was similar to yours). However, I know just as many people who look nothing like the person they married and to base a theory on two couples that you know can easily be refuted by the two couples that I know.....irritating at times. As far as the extinction portion, The Sixth Extinction was more interesting."

This book led me into a journey through contextual information to explain who we are and why we are so unique as a species. Although verbose and speculative, this book offers an abundance of information and detailed explanations of how and when we became the third chimpanzee. One important detail that was left out was religion but I think he saved that one for his masterpiece, GG&S.

65,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3066091-joanne,2,"I literally had this staring at me on my ""currently-reading"" shelf from May until November which may be a new record for me. The first chapter or two was so difficult to get through that I seriously debated just giving it up as I don't lack for things to read, but I just find it so difficult to do that. So instead I put it aside on my night stand and occasionally looked at it while picking up anything else to read.Finally I guilted myself into just getting on with it just this month, and even though I was probably less than a quarter of the way in, I tried to read at least a chapter a day and found it was not nearly as dry and difficult once I got going. I did actually start to semi-enjoy it by the time I got well into the book, but I am definitely glad I'm finished.This book did have some interesting things to say on how most of our virtues and vices have some sort of counterpart in the animal kingdom and we are not quite as unique as we like to think."
66,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/234061-kate,3,"This book was ok, just a bit different than I expected. With a name like The Third Chimpanzee and the initial chapter about the minimal genetic differences between ourselves and chimps, I thought he would actually talk about the distinction a little more - like how can chimps be *almost* human but not quite human, and how did humans become more advanced. I had a difficult time following the main thread, I kept thinking, ""Wait, what to woodpeckers have to do with humans?"" I suppose his argument was that there is some precedent in the animal kingdom for some of our particularly human traits, but as many other reviewers have said, some of his connections seemed a little far fetched and dubious. Granted, my grasp of evolution is sort of tenuous, but I didn't quite see how some of the traits seen in peacocks or woodpeckers could be connected to humans, yet these same traits are nowhere to be found in other primates. I think he wanted it to be a bigger book than it was. In truth, it could have been at least 500 pages and might have been better. Toward the end he started to take a lot of liberty with connecting things together without giving much scientific backup, and it seemed like maybe he was trying to rush through and get in all his theories without taking up too many pages. Oh and how about in the epilogue where he suddenly in passing suggests that Neandertals were exterminated by Cro-Magnons via genocide?? Boy that certainly came out of nowhere!There are a lot of things he seemed to ignore that I would've been interested to hear about. Like he kept focusing on the idea of nuclear weapons, but what about the rest of technology? I think in picking up this book, my interest was in the concept of how we could have gone so many thousands of years with the most rudimentary technology, and in the past century it seems like we've been expanding that knowledge exponentially. Where do we go from here? I like the idea that there never really was some magical golden age when all humans lived in harmony with the earth, but he doesn't at all address the difference between what a million Native Americans in the entire new world were capable of vs. 300 million people in the US alone. When I picked up the book I didn't realize it was written in 1992, and I feel like there have been so many developments since then that would be interesting to have addressed - life in a post-9/11 world, oil spills, the green movement, etc.Wow! Long review. Anyway, to sum up, while being nowhere near comprehensive, this book was a good jumping off point for me, and opened up a lot of questions that I'd like to look into elsewhere. Maybe I should have been an anthropology major!"
67,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649003-joe,3,"Let's agree this book serves as the map of Jared Diamond's career as a popular science author. It's the salt flats, the test kitchen, the proving ground for the ideas that appear more completely in Collapse; Guns, Germs and Steel; and Why is Sex Fun? The sections in The Third Chimpanzee that broach the ideas he explores in those books are, predictably, excellent. As I see it, there are a couple of depths tested in this book that are as-yet un-plumbed. He ought to plumb one, and leave the other stopped up. He explores the origins and development of the language, in primates, and then in Cro-Magnon-and-beyond human societies. That section of the book is really intreguing: he tracks the development of Proto-Indo European langauge deftly and quickly through thousands of years. It's fascinating, complex stuff that's delivered cogently and cleverly, like the best of his writing.On the other hand, there are a few chapters in middle of this book, under the section ""Uniquely Human"" that deal with moving the gulf between supposedly distinctively human characteristics: art, drug use, agriculture. In these sections Diamond is embarassingly glib and presumptuous-- it's really the worst of what I thought was a pretty unimpeachable author. For example, to answer the claim that humans alone make art simply for aesthetic pleasure, Diamond writes: We can't ask bowerbirds whether they get pleasure ot of their art, and I suspect that many humans who claim to do so are just putting on cultural affectations."" That's the entirity of his refutation of what Orwell called ""the aesthetic impulse,"" in ""Why I Write."" It's just a little wave-of-the-hand dismissive for my liking. Diamond is usually pretty good about deferring to experts to make the case for him. On the topic of creative impulse, and the production of great art, I'd defer to someone like Orwell (or any artist, for that matter-- he talks to none) over Jared Diamond.There are a few presumptuous passages in this middle section that almost made me put down the book (his explanation of drug use boils down in its entirety to a demonstration of virility, for instance). (He's also a little too cheeky in this section-- he passes the point a once or twice that separates pithy from snotty.) But, if you can move from the very good primate passages in the first third and onto the later chapters, like ""Last First Contact"" and ""Horses, Hittites, and History"", you'll once again be amazed by his ability to present vast rethinkings of humanity's history and prehistory convincingly in such small spaces. "
68,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2224950-kathryn,5,"This marvelous book was written in 1992, so it seems I am reading my Jared Diamond books out of order; this is the first book he wrote, and the third I have read (having read Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (1999) in January of 2000, and having read Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed (2005) just this February). As a precursor to some of the themes that he took up in the other books, it’s a fun read; and it’s a fun read on its own, in that it regards Homo Sapiens as genetically being closer to chimpanzees than to anything else; and as there are two existing species of chimpanzee already (common chimpanzees and pygmy chimpanzees), that would make us the third species of chimpanzee. (In the interests of full disclosure, I am a reasonable devout Roman Catholic who believes in the theory of evolution, in that evolution seems to be the most logical means for God to have given us both being and free will.)The book is separated into five distinct parts. Part One is titled Just Another Species of Big Mammal, and the author presents his theory that what caused Homo Sapiens to quit being just another type of chimpanzee was the evolutionary gift of speech, which gave us not just an endless present, but a future and a past. Part Two is titled An Animal With A Strange Life Cycle, and covers sex (four chapters) and death (one chapter), which proves that sex is about four times more interesting than sex. (The one Jared Diamond book I have not yet read is Why Is Sex Fun? (1997).) Part Three is titled Uniquely Human, and covers language, art, agriculture (which the author regards as a mixed blessing, and mostly negative), and dangerous addictions. Part Four is World Conquerors, on the fact that our species is spread all over the globe, demonstrates how one can use world language history to backtrack to a proposed Indo-European language, that essentially overtook almost all other languages in Eurasia. Part Five is titled Reversing Our Progress Overnight, and covers the topics of how we got where we are ecologically, and pretty well establishes that unless forethought is taken, our species natural response to natural resources is to exploit said resources to the vanishing point.However, we are not just murderous conquerors of the Earth and of each other. While language and our brains and technology have brought us so far, due to language we also have a past; and surely we have the capacity to learn from the past, and to try to halt overexploitation of the Earth before we ourselves render ourselves extinct."
69,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38063199-ferruccio-fiordispini,5,"The story and the challenges of the Man told with competence and irony.A great scientist, with this first book with an evocative title, which launched him in the firmament of the great science communicator, Diamond competently and ironically conduct us into the depths of anthropology and the story of the man’s evolution.Among the many interesting ideas, I like to point out the demolition of the myth of the hunter, which traditionally has been used to explain the development of basic human skills, such as the language. Recently, in fact, other scientists began to suspect that the language skills come from females, rather than from the male hunting males, and particularly because of the nursery needs of mothers, such as communicating with their children.Diamond emphasizes the innovative capacity of Homo Sapiens, his flexible intelligence. Instead of the Neanderthal, who used the same tools wherever he was, demonstrating no cultural diversification (this perhaps explains the advantage of Homo Sapiens, which led us to prevail on Neanderthal). Another significant difference with Neanderthal - and a fascinating theory of Diamond - is due to the ability of Sapiens to live longer, thus keeping alive the elderly who have a basic function of cultural learning, and to pass on the knowledge.A curious and intriguing chapter is that about adultery and its physiological and culture utility among the animals, as well as insights on why we tend to couple with people who look like us.Even if the man is usually considered to be an itinerant, nomadic being that has spread around the world, the careful observations of Diamond among the populations of New Guinea confirm that in fact human groups have mostly lived in confined areas with minimum contacts and frequent clashes with other groups. This explains the incredible variety of languages, before that the prevalence of some ethnic groups due to agriculture and some technological developments would allow their dominance.The evolution of the human kind and the greater or lesser success of the ethnic groups are exclusively due to geography, and not to biological factors.The final chapters are deep, informed and impressive documents about the issues of genocide and extinction of species, including humans. On these issues, however, the author finally loses the usual humorous spirit, which makes the book very enjoyable to read."
70,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin,4,"This one looks at humans as animals and compares them to our wild counterparts. It looks at evolution, culture, genocide, language, sex, art, and more. It also looks at how we are affecting the planet and other species.This might be my favourite Diamond book. I think the closer look at other species is what did that for me. I listened to the audio. "
71,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3428548-patrick-sprunger,4,"The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee holds up remarkably well for a work of general nonfiction firmly rooted in scientific disciplines, most notably physical anthropology. Jared Diamond cemented his status of educator-to-the-masses with his superb Guns, Germs, and Steel (of which there is some overlap in this book). Diamond's work is not only broadening the scope with which we look at anthropology and world history but perhaps the discipline of history itself. The modern student of history has shed much of the hero-worship of earlier eras' organization of history curricula in favor of a more social appreciation. The importance of battles and ""great men"" has been steadily downgraded over the past half century. Diamond shows us how science itself may one day be the focal point of how we approach many historical topics. The transition from primitive people to agricultural to industrial to technological societies was influenced more by written language, pathology, and introduced species that came along with migratory human groups than any principal figures or single events. Diamond has the rare gifts of interdisciplinary expertise across a staggering spectrum of academic areas and an intelligence receptive and creative enough to see the human story's multifacetedness and organize it into such clear lessons communicable to general readers. I think Guns, Germs, and Steel has broader appeal. But The Third Chimpanzee may actually be the superior work. Only two things prevented me from giving it the highest possible marks: (1) A pessimism pervades the latter chapters and (2) I found his chapter on drug abuse to miss the psychological nature of chemical addiction almost completely.**I think Diamond's theory on a biological origin for risky behavior involving chemicals is probably near the mark. But he only describes the biological origin. While Diamond reluctantly concedes that chemical abuse today takes the form of self-medication, he seems to be either naive about its profusion or lacking the candor to talk about how humans are thralls to our chemical susceptibility. He's either unaware or unable to confront the reality that we are are rarely using drugs for anything so noble as broadcasting intelligible signals of our virility as predator/rival deterrent - his thesis for biological origin. "
72,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45447490-guy-barnhart,4,"Jared Diamond, author of the popular Guns, Germs and Steel, takes a look at humanity’s animal roots and teases out precursor behavior in our closest relatives, the apes and also speculates how early hominids behaved. While he is mostly successful, I was constantly reminded that I am only getting one view rather than a more collective view of anthropologists in general. This is not a dig – most of the science presented is solid, even if it may be slightly outdated (book was first published in 1992) and you are definitely getting Jared Diamond idiosyncratic focus on the importance of geology and environment on how human culture evolved.As with Guns, Germs and Steel and Collapse, two of his books I read before this, Diamond’s prose is warm and compelling, it’s one of those popular science books that is hard to put down. Reading this was as pleasurable as it was edifying. It’s like sitting in the classroom of one of your favorite professors in college, taking incredibly complex subjects and breaking them down into bits that anyone with an inquiring mind wants to understand.I walked away from the book with a much greater appreciation for how grounded humans are on this planet. For me, it only emphasizes that our worst and best behaviors can be traced back to our animal past. In fact, even our penchant for utter environmental destruction is not a new development but something we have been struggling with since the beginning. However, Diamond doesn’t let us off the hook so easily. Knowing this, we are behooved that much more to resolve the current crises facing us today. While Diamond doesn’t sketch out policies or spin his wheels moralizing, he does point out our actions are not sustainable.Overall, you can tell this was Diamond’s first book. It almost acts as a summary for his later books where he went into much more detail. If you want a quick refresher on human evolution, biologically and cultural, this would be a great one-stop shop, however his later books are clearly from a deeper, more reflective perspective.For the curious mind, this book was a pleasure and I recommend it."
73,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40758735-miguel,4,"If one has recently read Guns, Germs and Steel and also Collapse from Jared Diamond, one will instantly recognize a lot of the themes that both books cover here in The Third Chimpanzee. One will then realize that The 3rd Chimp was published years before both of these more well-known books, so it will come as no surprise that a lot of these themes were more fleshed out in each subsequent book. As it is, The 3rd Chimp covers a lot of ground, from early human evolution to broad coverage of a lot of topics in Anthropology to Diamonds well founded concerns about habitat & species destruction at the hands of homo sapiens. It’s a good book throughout but if you’ve already come across his more well-known books it might not be an essential read. "
74,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146594-m-j,4,"Just before Easter weekend I finally finished Jared Diamond's 1992 book, “ The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal"". Jared Diamond is, of course, more famous now for his hugely successful 1997 book “Guns, Germs, and Steel” (GGS) and that was also how I was first introduced to works of Mr. Diamond. Having read GGS only a few months ago, it was hard not to notice how much this earlier book established for its successor: arguments made in detail in GGS are outlined throughout and even one line in a later section foreshadows GSS when it makes mention of the power of “guns, germs, and iron” (apparently it took five years for the iron age to give way to the age of steel).“The Third Chimpanzee” is an examination of humanity, not through the lens of human exceptionalism, but by how much we resemble our animal kin. His argument, leading to the title, is that humanity is merely a third form of chimpanzee (albeit wildly successful) and we can see a lot in our appearance and how we behave by looking at the path we've taken to get where we are today. It is, in essence, a book on evolutionary socio-biology and it is also incredibly convincing.The book is divided into five sections. The first deals with the details of our origins. The second deals with human sexuality and its uniqueness within the animal kingdom (one of the most entertaining sections and no doubt the genesis for his 1997 book “Why is Sex Fun?”). The third section is about language, art, drugs, existentialism, and farming (not kidding). Part four is about how well human groups live with other human groups (hint: not too well). And part five discusses what happens when you put nuclear weapons in the hands of a trumped up primate (hint: see part four).“The Third Chimpanzee” is well-written, intriguing and a pleasure to read. I think it's even the better book when compared with GGS. If you're interested in who we are, where we come from, and hints of where we're going then this book is a definite recommendation."
75,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5983551-neil-pearson,2,"I listened to the unabridged Audiobook version so possibly missed out on some diagrams but found it really clear. Basically, I could tell this was one of Diamond's first books as it did not compare well to collapse. It may well be due to the fact that I know a lot more about biology/evolution than I do about climate and ecology (I work as a molecular biologist) and therefore find it much easier to find holes in his logic or that he is either choosing to ignore some interpretations or is simply unaware of them. In fairness part of the problem could be the age of the book as Diamond can't be blamed for not knowing about discoveries that hadn't happened. To choose one failing, I'd say that he has a bad habit of projecting his own personal views (of which I'm in agreement) onto data (which I don't always agree with), which is fine but comes off as slightly hypocritical when he (quite rightly) points out that other researchers have done the same. Maybe if he'd occasionally started his interpretations with ""wouldn't it be nice if it was this way"" or something to that affect In a lot of cases it feels like he deliberately goes for more controversial options which with findings since make them seem a bit odd in hindsight. The other thing I found surprising by its absence was the complete lack of discussion of religion. I'm an atheist but I'd still put that on my shortlist of unique human characteristics and I'd have certainly been interested in it being linked with genetic/cultural evolution. I should probably find a book that does.Despite these issues there's enough interesting to discussion to still make the book worthwhile. I really enjoyed the chapters on language and how researchers have tried to uncover the original proto-indo-european language through linguistic trickery alone.I guess those who like his other works will enjoy seeing how Diamond himself has changed over the decades. One thing he has certainly got better at is not to preach and to gently push you into reaching his conclusion on your own - something that is often lacking in this book."
76,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam,5,"Jared Diamond's Third Chimpanzee doesn't fail to live up to the expectations set by his later masterworks, Guns, Germs and Steel, and Collapse. The writing is clear and compelling, and the book is overflowing with pertinent, fascinating information. I came to the book hoping to find some answers about early developments in human history, and he did make clear a lot of the issues that I was hoping he would resolve. For example, when I read Ernst Mayr's ""What Evolution Is"" a few months ago, I was confused by his supposition near the end of the book that universalized morality is a learned behavior-it seems naive now, I know, but it wasn't until reading Diamond's examination of xenophobia and genocides in human history that I realized that universalized moral codes are a relatively new invention. Not that they're particularly effective. That is perhaps the most crucial point of the work: despite all of the social systems we've devised that distinguish us from other animals, we are still animals ourselves, and our behavior has clear animal precedents and evolutionary causes. This is why, in contrast to Dr. Diamond, I am not optimistic about humanity's future. All of the behaviors that have brought us to the present brink are things we have always done, and they are things we do not because of our culture or our morality but because of the ways our genetic heritage interacts with our environments. Thus, just as the proclamation ""Thou Shalt Not Kill,"" applied to all humans equally, hasn't stemmed the tide of genocides, no environmental ethic or political policy will be able to make us treat our environment sustainably. In short, there's a lot of wonderful information here very conveniently presented, and the subjects are all extremely relevant to modern policy. Read it; you'll love it."
77,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821338-jake,4,"In this sprawling, fascinating book, Jared Diamond explores the place of humans in the animal kingdom. As in his later ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" and ""Collapse"", Diamond weaves together an enormous range of subjects: taxonomy and genetics (to establish how closely humans are related to chimps), evolution and sexual selection (to investigate the animal precursors to distinguishing human features like language, art, drug abuse, and genocide,) and geography and history (to establish why certain humans spread faster than others.) In the hands of any other author, this would have led to an unfocused mish-mash of science essays, but Diamond somehow makes it work. As in his other books, he draws on his astonishingly diverse experience as a research physiologist, bird-watcher, and geographer, and all the story-telling tricks he picked up as a popular science writer, and puts it all together in a simple argument that goes something like this: humans are animals, and even our most extraordinary abilities have roots in the behaviors of other animal species- what separates us is our highly evolved culture and technology, which has given us not just the ability to reshape the world, but also the ability to destroy ourselves. I only have one minor criticism here: if you've read either of Diamond's other two books (and you most likely have, because they were far more popular than this one, which went out of print until the others hit the best-seller list), you'll find some of the material later in this book a bit of a retread, since several chapters were the basis for GG&S and Collapse. But the lens here is so much wider (literally encompassing the whole history of the human race), and Diamond's writing is so engaging (and surprisingly funny, given the dark tone of the later books) that you won't mind that bit of repetition. "
78,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,5,"This was a very good book. Just the amount of topics Diamond intelligently delves into makes it worthwhile, with all of them being relevant to the title, namely The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal. It is true that the book is a bit outdated in relation to the dates of our evolution or the different theories postulated to explain human sexuality or certain traits, but it is nevertheless interesting and very important. In relation to Evolutionary Psychology (Sociobiology) for which this book is most renowned, Diamond examines the different theories that explain how we became social beings, how we lived most of our evolutionary history or what are the differences (if any) between male and female psychology, among several other topics. He is careful in tackling these question but at the same times asserts that even if the theories show that males for example, were more promiscuous in most of their evolutionary history than females, there is no cause for alarm, since science need not tell us how to behave in the first place. Our being alarmed is as strong an evidence that we are not bound by our genes and have almost unlimited control on our choices of how to live. There were very touching moments in this book, especially when he speaks about other species (especially chimps) and how we contribute to their extinction even unknowingly. Also, a painful chapter was on genocide for which alone I would recommend the whole book. There was a whole and detailed chapter devoted to languages and how Indo-European languages became dominant in the world today, all this while debunking racist theories about the supposed “superiority” of the Indo-European language. Other important topics included were the environment and its conservation, extraterrestrial life, drug abuse and art. A magnificent book on human evolution and future. Highly recommended. "

Tarzan had the talent to regress back the difference and could swing from tree to tree as the hairless white ape in the jungles of equatorial Africa. In his book ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee"" Jared Diamond has analyzed and beautifully presented the rise of Homo sapiens and progressed from just another species of chimpanzee - common chimpanzee, pygmy chimpanzee and human beings - to the top of the animal table. Well reasoned arguments, logical deductions and supported by archaeological / palaentological evidence wherever available, he takes us through our upward rise and progress to be the only species inhabiting all the land masses as well as inter-breeding unlike our closest relatives the gorillas or chimpanzees. the progress of Homo sapiens has resulted in the extinction of millions of species both through excessive hunting and destruction of habitats of other species over the last 50,000 or so years.In the present scenario, Jared gloomily forecasts the extinction of Homo sapiens due to environmental destruction - 150,000 species annually, degradation of Nature, human greed and a devil may care attitude. This he forecasts will lead to our extinction in the twenty second century,To prevent that from happening, we need to be pro-active and pressurise our rulers to stop the degradation and take up preservation of environment - Sage Advice. Will we follow through? is the million dollar question.I enjoyed reading the book and would recommend it to all persons interested in our roots and development."
80,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/352711-leftbanker,5,"I’m not a scientist and pretty far from it but I read quite a lot on the subject of human evolution which for my money is the best story on earth. I have been reading Jared Diamond’s books out of order starting with Guns, Germs, and Steel and then Collapse so would recommend reading The Third Chimpanzee first as it sort of lays the foundation for those later two books. Diamond dumps on his readers a tremendous amount of fact and theory so be prepared to jot down any interesting tidbit you wish to remember later when explaining how great this book is to your astonished friends. I love the fact that the author isn’t afraid of just throwing ideas out there as this field of endeavor is wide open, for the most part. It will probably be impossible to say precisely just what happened at many junctures in the evolution of the human species so making wild (and educated) postulations is almost required to advance the science.His chapter on contact with other planets was a fun read. It wasn’t really factual but just a really smart guy thinking out loud. I think that what Diamond does best is to prompt us to think about absolutely everything around us in the wild kingdom and consider how we got here and where we are headed. "
81,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2410849-juliet-wilson,5,"This is a fascinating book that looks at human evolution and searches for how it is similar to and how it differs from animal evolution. So there are chapters devoted to searching for the animal precursors of speech (eg chimpanzee vocalisations) and art (eg bowerbirds bowers), the overall intention being to determine how we became so different from the chimpanzees with whom we share most of our genetic information. Its not just positive attributes that are studied either, there are chapters devoted to genocide and environmental destruction, which although they are shown to be uniquely human in the extent to which we practice them, there are also animal precendents - such as in wars between rival troups of chimpanzees and rabbits that have eaten every last plant on an island. Diamond's writing style is engaging and intelligent and he has developed an excellent line in striking comparisons that really make the reader stop and think. I'm now on the lookout for Diamond's more recent book 'Collapse' which studies human civilisations, such as the Easter islands, that have collapsed after exhausting their ecological resource bases. "
82,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12486689-betty-ho,5,"Granted, humans are unlike all living beings, but there is only a 1.6% difference in DNA between the chimpanzees and us. The author points out that the cultural traits that make us unique are in fact quite common among animals. For instance, language, art, technology, agriculture, even drug abuse and genocide all have their animal precursors. Biological difference only contributes a small percentage of our ""humanness"" while the environmental factors actually did most of the work. We are, after all, big mammals. The only thing makes us unique is the ability to learn from our past mistakes without having to wait for the evolution to make adjustment/ improvement, which probably will be too late by then. I think this spirit applies not only to environmental protection but also to self-cultivation, i.e. how to restrain the one's animal natural for something more important.I'd suggest one to read ""The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins"" before this book, which can give you a microscopic perspective on animal behaviors. The next read is definitely ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" by Jared Diamond.  "
83,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5652296-jackie-brady,3,"I listened to this book because I liked Guns, Germs, and Steel so much and this was readily available from my library. I did not realize at the time how long ago the book was published (1991), but as I began to read it, it seemed like much of the information was outdated. I can't name any particular information that has added to our knowledge about evolution, but I am certain I have read more recent accounts that discuss things which had probably not been discovered when Diamond wrote this book. Therefore, this is a pretty good read if you know little about evolution, natural selection, sexual selection, and the like, but a more recent book would be far more informative, taking into account discoveries from the past twenty years. I also felt a little dismayed by Diamond's views on extraterrestrial life since he seemed to discount the possibility (and the desirability) of finding intelligent life elsewhere. I wonder if his views have changed in the intervening years, and I wonder how other scientists might respond to his arguments today. Despite these few disappointments, the book is well written and engaging."
84,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/795467-spencer,4,"Interesting book that was more like 3.5 stars for me. Jared Diamond is an incredibly fascinating guy and I really enjoyed his two more well known books (""Guns, Germs and Steel"" and ""Collapse""). In fact, this book was published before either of those and the last few chapters of ""Third Chimpanzee"" really laid the groundwork for both of the later books. The only thing I didn't like about this book is that Diamond cites minute examples of animals engaged in ""human"" behavior (such as using ""language"" or creating ""art"") to show that these are not uniquely human attributes. My conclusion was somewhat the opposite - the incredibly rare and simplistic nature of these bits of evidence more fully demonstrates to me the vast difference between humans and other animals, rather than showing our similarities. Overall, though, I did enjoy this book and found several of the chapters to be completely fascinating. If you haven't read any of Jared Diamond's work, I'd highly recommend taking a look (""Collapse"" was my favorite of his)."
85,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Brilliant with some flawsAfter the spectacular success of UCLA geography Professor Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. (1997) and Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or to Succeed (2005), Harper Perennial has reissued this splendid book originally published in 1992. I'm glad they did. In this ambitious work, Diamond attempts to define human nature in evolutionary terms and to warn us of the dangers ahead. He is particularly worried about the two clouds he sees as hanging over our heads, nuclear warfare and an environmental holocaust. (p. 350)In the early chapters, Diamond examines our nature and shows how we are similar to and differ from the common chimpanzee and the bonobo (AKA ""the pygmy chimp"" or as lately seen on TV, ""the sexy chimp""). His expertise is nothing less than stunning. Even though this book is nearly 15 years old, most of what he writes needs no update. In the later chapters he concentrates on a variety of themes, genocide, the ""noble savage,"" environmental loss, species extinction, etc. Here we can see the tentative ideas that later became the books mentioned above.In chapter one, Diamond compares the three chimps. In chapter two he documents the so-called ""great leap forward"" about 40,000 years ago in which humans became truly human as evidenced by cave art, better tools and the ability to improve upon previous tool design. He attributes this leap to the development of symbolic language. In chapters three through six, he examines human sexuality and reproduction. In chapter seven he explains why we grow old and die. Chapters eight and nine explore language and art and their expression in other animals. In chapter ten, ""Agriculture's Mixed Blessings,"" one of the best chapters in the book, Diamond shows us that life as a hunter-gatherer was preferable to life as one of the early agriculturists. With agriculture came the possibility of civilization and everything that civilization brings, which includes--in addition to art, technology and the massive harnessing of energy--herd diseases, malnutrition from monoculture farming, overpopulation, and hard and long work hours for most people. Average human height actually decreased following the birth of agriculture about 10,000 years ago.In chapter eleven Diamond begins to stray from what he really knows to what he thinks he knows. He posits here that we drink and use ""dangerous drugs"" because of a macho need to show how fit we are. He takes Amotz Zahavi's famous handicap principle and applies it to the Marlboro man. But the advertising for cigarettes and alcohol that Diamond sees as appealing to fitness are better seen as appealing to a false sense of glamour or adventure. Actually we use drugs because they alter our consciousness or deaden it; and we continue to use them because we become psychologically dependent on them. A way of looking at drug use that is consistent with evolutionary principles is to see drug use as a relationship between species, between plant (producer of, e.g., nicotine, tetrahydrocannibinol) and human, or between yeast (alcohol) and human which has not yet reached a true symbiosis.Another error that I think Diamond makes is his idea that intelligent species throughout the universe are unlikely. He uses the argument that intelligence arose only once on this planet and that if it was something that evolution could easily develop it would have arisen in other species, but hasn't. He even recalls an analogy that I've read elsewhere from woodpeckers. Noting that there are no native woodpeckers in Australia, it is postulated that although woodpecking is a fine subsistence niche, it requires such exacting skills that its evolution almost didn't happen on this planet. The same may be said for intelligence as an evolutionary skill. But the fact that woodpeckers already exist in the Americas and the Old World tends to preclude the evolution of other birds into woodpeckers. And who's to say what intelligent creatures might have evolved had we not come along (e.g., the Neanderthal)? And who's to say just how intelligent some dinosaurs were before they were wiped out? And who's to say what a colony of ants or bees (""swarm intelligence"") may become after we are gone?I also think Diamond is missing something when he declares that ""advanced extraterrestrials who discovered us would surely treat us in the same"" barbaric way we have treated other primates (or indeed other peoples). (p. 214) For one thing those little green men, considering the vastness of interstellar space, would have a hard time getting here, and any that did arrive here would be light years in advance of us not only technologically but probably morally as well.A recurring theme throughout the book is the human propensity to kill and our hypocrisy about that killing. From the mastodons to the children of the Middle East, humans have always killed while maintaining that killing is evil. Diamond does a nice job of explaining just how this Orwellian doublethink works. The main mental trick is to see those we want to kill as different and separate from ourselves. The taboo against killing humans, Diamond reveals, is really just a taboo against killing members of our own family and tribe. Once we are able to see others as outsiders, we can demonize them and trivialize them, turn them into subhuman objects and get on with the slaughter. Diamond considers how those of us on the sidelines, those of us who have not demonized the victims, can let this happen. His conclusion is that human nature can stand only so much blood-splattered horror before we become numb to the killing and turn away.Although Diamond waxes hopeful near the end of the book as he thinks of his children and grandchildren, the overall impression I got is that humans are probably not going to be able to prevent the twin nuclear and environmental holocausts to come.~ --Dennis Littrell, author of “Understanding Evolution and Ourselves”"
86,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4759747-ron,4,"Fascinating stuff from Jared Diamond. He covers a lot more ground than in the other books of his I've read: Collapse and Guns, Germs, and Steel. The book covers 4 mains areas: Human Origins, Sex, Rise of Civilization, and Fall of Civilization. He has written books that cover each of the last 3 in more detail. So much has be written on human origins that you can easily get it elsewhere. I appreciated the fact that even though I already read G,G,S and Collapse I didn't feel that he was just recycling the same material. The basic theories are outlined in this book but I still learned a lot of new information and I feel that they are complementary enough that this book is worth reading in addition. If you are new to Jared Diamond,  Guns, Germs, and Steel  is essential reading, but don't skip  The Third Chimpanzee for fear that it is a rehash. Great stuff. "
87,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19601611-brendon,2,"(1991 ed.) Disappointing so far. Too often uses populist or personal views for a book about science. Some theory seems supported (relative testes size in primates), some with no obvious purpose or conclusions (relative penis size in primates), some speculative without much scientific thought attached (menopause has evolved to give existing children a better chance of survival - assuming childbirth at 15-20 and menopause at 50, there is no logic in his argument), while the skin colour debate has been recently resolved by considering the prime evolutionary pressure, the ability to successfully pass on genes. Frequently describes characteristics as a design or intent of evolution rather than an outcome. Not as bad as pseudo-science, but a little too fast and loose with the scientific process for my liking. Repeating each point 3 times is an irritating style. Still, will persist to see if it improves..."
88,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28900628-spacebear,4,"The first of Jared Diamond's books seeks to lay out the evolution of human beings into their present form, as well as looking at the characteristics of this 'third chimpanzee' that set it apart from other animals. He discusses the rise of simple tools by Cro-Magnon, as well as the spread of conflict and fighting. He seeks to ask what really sets us apart from animals. It is not war or murder that does this, but rather, destruction of the environment and the desire for intoxicants.The book is very interesting, thought compared to his other books, it feels scattered. There are chapters where he very clearly lays the groundwork for his later books (Collapse, Guns Germs & Steel, Why is Sex Fun and even The World Until Yesterday are all drawn from arguments he made here). As such, though a great book, I can't help but feel when reading that is greatest strength was to lay the path for other work to come."
89,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/134400-kim,3,"Diamond does a good job of summarizing his beliefs of how humans evolved to where they are today. His book is complete in the sense that it touches on many areas of human development. However, his book is lacking in the fact that it does not acknowlege any of the other beliefs on this matter - and there are many. Much of his thoughts contractict other popular opinions today, yet he gives no mention of this. He states his ideas as fact without giving any evidence or referencing any other sources. It can be easy for the reader to forget that this is not a difinitive book of answers, but a collection of one man's ponderings. Keeping this in mind, the book is worth a good skim. If you enjoyed this book, I would also recommend ""The Naked Ape"" by Desmond Morris for other thoughts on the human evolution. "
90,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/373093-henry-manampiring,4,"This is my second Jared Diamond's book after 'Collapse'.One thing I admire from this guy is his amazing ability to weave history and science, and to write a 'grand scheme' of things. In this one book, he will write about the evolution of man from our ape-like ancestors, and all the way to our species came to dominate the earth. It talks about not only biology, but also language, culture, and environmental issues.One consistent theme with 'Collapse' is the warning of how our species has the knack for destroying our own environment that supports us - an ecological suicide.Reading this book is like travelling to 2 million years in the past, and then speeded up to modern civilization in a time machine. Fun, digestible, and illuminating. Very happy with it."
91,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6514081-james-johnson,4,"As usual, Diamond delivers a thought-provoking book. It was interesting to follow the evolution of our species, as compared with our chimpanzee cousins. I'm not sure of the scientific viability of his ""humans as a third species of chimpanzee"" hypothesis but it made for an excellent framework with which to shape the narrative.Much of the early book delved into evolutionary science but the author couldn't help but to slide back into subject matter from previous books (i.e. Guns, Germs, and Steel), with some evolutionary parallels. After reading this book, I was struck with the notion that humans (modern and ancient) are more alike than we often think. Overall, this was a great read; informative and entertaining."

I consider this to be a minor tragedy because The Third Chimpanzee is better in every way (IMHO) than Diamond's later works. This is not to say that GGS and Collapse aren't good. I really enjoyed both of them. They were both well-written, well-researched, and as interesting as anything scientific I have ever read. But The Third Chimpanzee was simply better. It was one of those rare books that I did not want to end. I never felt bored or overwhelmed at all -- just non-stop fascination."

I suggest that, if you have the opportunity, you read this before any of his other books, as it was his first and served as inspiration for the rest. As you get further along, the information becomes somewhat redundant if you've already read ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" and ""Collapse"". There is still plenty of sideline information here that doesn't appear in the other books, though, and the early chapters about the similarities and differences between humans and other large mammals is truly thought-provoking, forcing us to look at ourselves in a way that is somewhat unsettling but that rings entirely true."

He ponders the animal rights ethical dilemma which doing medical research on chimpanzees are... I think we are still different from animals because of our ephemeral human soul otherwise he is right we are just smarter bipedal apes without the soul.He further states that we were not the only human creatures on earth at the time which included at least 2 other humanoids. The mythological implications of this are interesting. What if the mythological monsters of old are simply our hominid brothers of years past that got past down through stories. Diamond postulates that the reason we ""inherited"" the earth and not the other hominids is due to a genetic mutation that gave rise to speech and the complex set of symbolism that that allowed such hunting big game species as well as making war with the ""hominid monsters"". With spoken language of course came brainstorming which can lead to innovation...spoken language also allowed culture to thrive which allowed new innovations to build on past innovations. Part 2 deals with how and why humans evolved a unique life cycle:Diamond reasons that humans develop pair bonds as their main source of reproductive success due to the way we eat. Unlike other apes, our young do not go off on their own to find food, human hunter-gatherers needed time to learn how to hunt and gather food thus, fathers needed to be there to make sure their young were able to learn to survive for themselves. Since fathers had to put a lot of effort in raising their young, they needed to know that their investment in time corresponds with the fact that it is 100% their kids. Perhaps, this the reason, I am not to fond of disciplining other peoples kids because I have no genetic investment in them. This in turn behooves a monogamous relationship to form. Also men are slightly bigger than women which gives the human race a basic monogamous relationship with occasional adultery features.The fact that men mate frequently with women but do not have to constantly compete to sire an offspring gives us medium size testes compared to apes. Also, our relative big penis is really a way for men to show off to other men that shows dominance.We are also unique in that women hide their ovulation cycles and we copulate in private. Diamond postulates that the reason this is for social cohesion purposes. Since men and women need to be cooperate, to be constantly jealous would destroy the social fabric of the society, so the ""married"" people would copulate in private to make known to others and to themselves that they are a couple. Whereas concealed ovulation makes sure that constant sex is present for the couple to pair bond in the event of a child. Contrary to popular belief, sex primary purpose in humans is not to procreate given that the act of sex only produces a child 28% of the time. The primary function of sex in humans and the reason it is so fun for us is to pair bond with the beloved which cements the relationship.Evolutionary speaking, cheating is present for men to spread more of their seed around; thus men primary reason to cheat is because he wants more variety in his life. Women cheat because they want their children to have a better gene pool so they are a lot choosier when they cheat. The main reason women cheat is they are not happy with their relationship.According to Diamond, mate selection are the happiest when the mates are a like with each other. Apparently, most humans choose their mates based on similar background (religion, socio-economic standing, education), personality and IQ, and how physically similar they appear to us. I think the whole physical similarity based to us is a stretch, I think a more accurate truth is we base our physical attraction on people we grew up with reinforced with media perception of what is beautiful. For example, the only time I think Filipina women are gorgeous is when I am in the Philippines.In combination with our mate selection, this book made me realize men's visual obsession with women genitalia. This can be explained by monkey's estrus cycle and the visual cue that female monkeys project when they are fertile (red butt) that makes the males become overcome with lust.Also, he states the reason we grow old and eventually die. In pre-literate societies, the tribe with the elder usually survived because the old person was the repository for information that was necessary for the tribes survival. Diamond also postulates the more stable a society is the more the body capacity for self-repair increases because it makes sense for the body to repair itself if their is no danger for the person to die. Just like, it makes sense for us to save if we know that the money will not be worthless tomorrow. Women also live longer than men because women are less likely to die while defending their young than men are. But eventually old age does catch up with us and people die when their body shuts down (evolutionary we have done our jobs).Part 3: What makes humans unique is our ability to have culture in order to pass down memes from generation to generation1) Language: Although there are animal precedents in language production to communicate to their species the danger of different predators and recognizing each other in their troops such as the vervet monkey, their lack of anatomy (voice box) in producing a wide variety of sounds limits them in their communication ability. Diamond also notes that the brains of human children are wired for creole grammar production in order to make complex sentences. This is seen in Hawaii when kids from different backgrounds with different languages come together in creating a new creole language from their parents pidgin language using their brains natural proclivity to create language. Pidgin is apparently used in trading cities in which people who do not live there trade but go back to their respective towns and dialects whereas creole is an entirely knew language used by people who grew up with different languages but live in the trading cities itself. Language of course is important in creating culture and the ability of innovations to build on previous knowledge.2)Art: Diamond states that artist and thus art signaled reproductive fitness because of the artist possessed and people who acquire art are people who are resource rich. Maybe that is the reason rich guys marry artist women because rich men are resource rich whereas the artist signal their reproductive fitness. Whereas male stereotypical artist are usually the womanizers who sleep with many women because men artist are resource poor but showcase their reproductive fitness by their art. 3) Agriculture: For most people, agriculture is a great thing that gave rise to civilization b/c with cheap and reliable calories population density increased and with an increase in population density it gave rise to specialization of what people were really good at as well as a standing army to protect its citizens. But the down side to agriculture is that specialization gives rise to class division as well as sexual division of labor. Elites in the civilization become healthier but the majority of the population became unhealthy. Also, the downside of an increase of population is that infectious disease became rampant. Apparently, hunter-gatherer people when they could get food were healthier than the vast majority of people in agriculture society (as seen by their longer life span 60 vs 40 yrs of age, lack of dental cavities, and stature). Although plentiful, agriculture diet with its focus on one or two staple crops and animals lacks the nutritional variety of hunter-gather people. Besides the constant malnutrition that the vast majority of people of agriculture people faced, the fact that these population focused their energy on one or two crops and animals means that they were more likely to die of famine if those crops or animals failed to produce in a given year. Even today, US policy toward agribusiness which subsidizes corn/soybean crops to depress food prices in the US to ensure overabundance of food supply at the expense of the US population which gives rise to the disease of civilization which in turn adds to the US expense in medicare/medicaid. Bottom line, the best diet is the hunter-gatherer diet. Part 4: deals with human beings as world conquerors - Diamond shows that cultures that have been economically superior to other cultures combined with technology advancements and enforced by a strong military tend to be the cultures that dominate the world. Traditionally, human beings have to competing impulses in seeing ""the other"" one is of trade and the other is of xenophobia. I think this is the reason why global capitalism is a great thing for peace because it forces countries who participate in international trade to think before attacking its neighbor since wars disrupt trade and traditionally forces a population to pay for its wars thereby depressing the standard of living of that population. This is the reason, why it is the US national security priority to incorporate these countries ( middle east) into the global economy. Also, countries that have incorporated a diversity of population into its culture have similarly thrived (US) because it causes regeneration of spirit and entrepreneurial impulse which I believe drives technology that makes the US prosperous.The reason why xenophobia is so rampant in traditional societies is because the human animal is very territorial and thus confines himself to their own geographical boundaries which were reinforced by their peculiar culture and language. This natural proclivity for isolation breeds cultural diversity (including art and language, institutionalized homosexuality, promiscuity, or prudery, and cannibalism). Furthermore, while Diamond acknowledges that the homogenization of language is necessary for trade to flourish and diplomacy to occur to prevent human extinction, he equates the lost language as the same as the lost of diversity of thought. I agree when he says ""languages differ in structure and vocabulary, in how they express causation and feelings and personal responsibility, hence in how they shape our thoughts. There's no single-purpose ""best"" language: instead, different languages are better suited for different purposes."" That is, something gets lost in translation. Furthermore, Diamond states the reason Europeans conquered the world is due to the fact they took advantage of their bio-geographical effect on cultural development. He states that Europeans due to their proximity to domesticatable plants and animals had a jump start on agricultural innovation that led to dense populations which led to a centralized state which led to a standing army this combined with immunity to endemic infectious disease from agriculture led them to easily conquer Africa and the New World. Diamond contends that were live contributes to who we are; I buy that because living in Texas in the summer time drastically changes my behavior as oppose to living in a walkable city like Boston in the summer time with a more agreeable temperature.Diamond states that most of the languages from Europe to India came from a Proto-Indo-European language that originated from the Steppes of Russia and were propagated because these people were the first to domesticate the horse. The horse used as a weapon of war was a devastating advance in warfare that gave these people enormous advantage this combined with the fact that these people were nomads and were centrally located in Eurasia allowed them to spread their language to places as far as India and Western Europe. He explains from a common ancestral language it diverged once people from the dominant culture settled in these new places thus creating languages of today. Genocide: Although genocidal killings have animal antecedents (chimpanzees), we humans have made these impulses a reality by our technological tools, combined with our strategic thinking, combined with our coordination via communication. Diamond states that genocidal killings have been the rule in human affairs not the exception and it occurs when we have an ""us"" vs. ""them"" mentality. Diamond states that the genocidal killings are justified directly via a struggle for power/land/economic resources or for purely ideological reasons such as based on politics, religion, or race. This is the reason, why I do not like war justified by religion because war is very animal impulse vs religion is divine. Also, this is the reason why I am queasy in mixing religion with politics because when religious conviction mixes with political imperative it creates a doctrine that is not easily amendable to compromise. Lorenz states that technological advances in killing allow us to be willing participants in genocide because we do not see the people we are killing and thus disassociate from the killings also distant killing does not harm the killer so the risk to himself is minimal.Diamond states that the Modern Universal Code against genocide can be circumvented by ""Blaming the Victim"" via the 1)Excuse of self-defense, 2) Being the ""wrong"" religion, race, politics, being regressive, and being from a lower form of civilization 3) Label the victim an animal that must be exterminated.Diamond does offer hope that the same technological tools that allow us to commit genocide has spawn tools that perhaps can prevent it such as the internet that allows us to blur the lines between what we consider us vs. them. I still believe the best way to ensure a long lasting peace on planet earth is if every country becomes like the US in being a republican country that is democratically elected with a capitalistic economy because people have a vested interest to work together and it inhibits our worse natures.PART 5: Deals with people's destruction of the ecology may in turn breed the destruction of our civilization. I think this part is important in seeking a balance between our environment and responsible population growth to avoid human species extinction.1)Diamond states that human being's destruction to ones environment is nothing new and it is the result of people creating a civilization and growing that civilization's population. From New Zealand to Madagascar, to 1st Clovis (fanned out from the Siberian straight to inhabit the new world) human founders kill the animals to extinction for food. Like other people with seemingly abundant resources, the Clovis were wasteful and did not care about hunting prey to extinction as long as they had food to eat. Furthermore, Easter Island, the Southwest Anazasi Indians, and Petra shows that people destroy their natural surroundings inadvertently to create their civilization but once those resources were gone their civilizations in turn get destroyed. The question now is how does human population grow and create a global middle class population in order for world peace to occur without destroying the environment and ensure our destruction as a species in the process?Diamond states that human beings who have lived within their environment are usually good conservators of that environment. 1) It is people who are recent transplants to an environment 2) Possess new technology that we do not know it's effect to the environment (gun to shoot animals to extinction) or 3) Centralized states or companies with power concentrated at the top and who do not live near the environment that cause the greatest havoc to the environment---> Logging companies who cut down trees for natural resources generally do not have a vested interest in preserving the environment in which they are logging/////likewise US government and oil companies tapping oil in Alaska do not live there so it is okay to tap oil in these areas because they do not live there. The only counter measure to oil profits are nature conservationist who in a democracy are the only check to natural resource depletion.Diamond cautions that we are in the midst of an environmental holocaust that threatens our existence. I believe it when Diamond states that mass-extinction of species is happening now via overhunting, new species introduction to new habitat, inadvertent habitat destruction,and the ripple effect from the above. I also believe that these things may inadvertently effect us and our food supply chain and thank God for conservationist who make us realize the circle of life so that unnecessary development will not be the norm but rather the exception.To solve this, he proposes 1) slow down population growth 2)preserve natural habitats 3) support conservation groups and special interest groups who check unwarranted economic greed in favor of a positive environmental policy "
123,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51588923-shhhhh-ahhhhh,5,"Jared Diamond doesn't disappoint. I believe he wrote this book before Guns, Germs & Steel (since it seems that title came from a line in this book that went ""guns, germs and iron""), so it's unsurprising that some of the themes here reflect that work. This is an incredibly information dense book and any summary of it will necessary leave out loads of valuable information, so I""ll preface this summary by saying that you would do well to read this book for yourself. The Third Chimpanzee charts our evolution into this planet's apex predator, destroyer of habitats and all around big bad using an approach rooted in analysis of evidence. Diamond evaluates all claims for what differentiates us from other species, including our capacity for language, our tool use, our social structures, our moral imperatives, our war-like nature, our sexual habits, and even our parenting, and finds comparison points not only in our close animal relatives but across the animal kingdom. He challenges the assertions of our uniqueness by implying that we're unique only in our composition of qualities extant elsewhere, not in those qualities themselves. In brief, some other animals have identifiable parts of speech that represent external phenomena (words but not grammar), some other animals have elaborate tool use (birds were one noteworthy example of construction skill), some animals wage war (chimpanzees and some insects were mentioned), some animals create art that is recognizably so by human standards (gorillas and elephants but only in captivity), etc. He uses evidence of our own physiology, compared with primate physiology and other species to come to conclusions about where our branch of species broke with our other chimpanzee relatives and other primates earlier on. He goes into detail regarding how testicle size and penis size, as well as human sexual behavior, relate to similar pair-bonding or mating strategies int he wild (hint: we've found that the optimal solution is mostly monogamous with a touch of extramarital sex, with women being generally choosier than men). He also went into detail regarding how cultural anthropologists can tell us a lot about the cognitive and societal capabilities of long-dead populations of humans and humanoids based on the artifacts we recover, and what things we can't learn from relics (such as language development/ evolution). Throughout the book, Diamond maintains an academic air of detachment, not only in asking relevant questions but in answering them. He fully exposes his assumptions/ the assumptions of the field, and gives us the gamut of evidence both supporting and challenging whatever the current consensus is. This is true up until the very last part where he begins to discuss current society, our current war capabilities, our current environmental behaviors (murdering off most of the species in existence) and our future, which involves a good deal of (evidence-based) speculation and more than a bit of emotional attachment. Though, given the fact that he's painted a picture of almost-certain annihilation, I would say that's something worthy of being emotional about. Read this book. If you've ever been curious about the story of humankind, read it. It's the best book I've read on the subject next to Guns, Germs & Steel and The Better Angels of Our Nature.Side note: I read this immediately after The Story of Earth by Robert Hazen and I could not have put together a better pairing if I had tried. It was as if Diamond was merely continuing the story that Hazen started. I recommend they be read together, followed by GGS."
124,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4304479-iain,4,"“The past was still a Golden Age, of ignorance, while the present is an Iron Age of willful bliss.” Jared Diamond's 'The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal (1991) tackles a broad canvas in the history of us as a species. Our present position is the composition of a much larger story. The evolution of human beings covers millions of years but the last 40,000 years is the focus of this book, our progress marked since the Great Leap Forward. “Suppose that an archaeologist who had visited us from outer space were trying to explain human history to his fellow spacelings. The visitor might illustrate the results of his digs by a twenty-four-hour clock on which one hour of clock-time represents 100,000 years of real past time. If the history of the human race began at midnight, then we would now be almost at the end of our first day. We lived as hunter-gatherers for nearly the whole of that day, from midnight through dawn, noon, and sunset. Finally, at 11:54 pm we adopted agriculture. In retrospect, the decision was inevitable, and there is now no question of turning back."" Meaning civilization, modern human history began about 10,000 years ago.The book is divided into five parts...Part 1 deals with the similarity between humans and chimpanzees over our shared evolutionary history. We currently share 98.4% the same genetic makeup. Part 2 examines the sexual dimorphism in mammals, and particularly humans, and the mechanics of sexual selection. Why we mate the way we do?Part 3 Sexual selection is extended into the effects on language, art, hunting and agriculture, through the idea of ""honest signalling - sexual signals that also cost the signer."" This is extrapolated to explain the appeal of drugs. Finally, the possibility of contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. Part 4 looks through modern human history and considers conquest. Why is it that the Eurasians came to dominate other cultures?Part 5 argues that civilizations sometimes get caught up in internal superiority contests, and deplete the environment to such an extent that they may never recover. The thinking of superiority allows them to destroy themselves. Two prominent examples are Easter Island and the ruins of Petra, a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan, both of which were victims of deforestation. ""Despite the broad canvas, the book manages to link together a coherent argument, much of which was novel at the time of publication. Borrowing insights from fields ranging from the humanities (history, linguistics, anthropology), to evolutionary biology, The Third Chimpanzee compiles a portrait of humanity's success and also its potential for disaster.""Keeping it real...“If our ethical code makes a purely arbitrary distinction between humans and all other species, then we have a code based on naked selfishness devoid of any higher principle.”A fascinating read if you are interested in the story of... us!"
125,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36852749-stone,4,"This book, though published much later, seems to me more like a precursor to Diamond's most well-known bestselling Guns, Germs and Steel for most theories laid out in that book could locate their genetic principle in this volume. Diamond proposed a series of revolutionary assumptions on the topic of the evolution of modern humans (Homo Sapiens); language, argued Diamond, instead of bipedalism or the growth of brain capacity, was the true watershed that marked the tipping point of the transition from primates to humans. The theory has since then been supported by more and more evident proofs excavated worldwide, both living and deceased; it has been generally accepted that the invention of language was the driving force in the development of agricultural societies, written scripts, arts, and most of the essential elements that defined humans. Diamond pointed out that, contrary to popular belief, we are much more similar to chimpanzees than we ever imagined, and this similarity explains a lot of our own behaviours, both individual and collective. Homicide and cannibalism, argued Diamond, were direct results of this linear similarity; in other words, the practice of killing one's own kind isn't a moral issue but a purely genetic outcome. Wars are hence impossible to be eliminated.Another recurring theme within Diamond's books is the rebuttal of an ancient Golden Age in which humans lived freely and joyfully with everything in the environment. Diamond considered such Golden Age myth a reflection of the life before agriculture -- as confirmed by archaeological findings, humans did live healthier lives before the arrival of agricultural societies -- but still far from the paradise described by these myths.Last but not least, Diamond reviewed the discussion already laid down in Guns, Germs and Steel regarding the success of Eurasia and the relative failure of Americas -- the geographical limitation of the American continent, which in turn influenced the spread of culture and innovations, is the ultimate factor that contributes to the diversion between the two world.Reading Jared Diamond's books is always an enjoyable experience, for he manifested his broad insights on a range of fields without falling into the trap of generality and superficiality; besides, because of his wide range of knowledge, he always seems to be able to devise groundbreaking ideas that are born out of the combination of fields.

126,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8227780-andrew-pixton,5,"Holy cow one of the most interesting books I've ever read. It's many things: history, anthropology, linguistics, paleontology, genetics, evolutionary biology, and archaeology. Sadly, it was printed in 1991, over two decades ago. So much of it is possibly outdated I would guess. He does present solid arguments so it's hard to imagine where it could be lacking but science has advanced pretty quick and I doubt those years brought nothing. I'll have to read his Collapse now and see if that adds anything new. This version ought to be updated though.I had to keep rewinding because he goes through so much information that I'd miss some few seconds and feel like I really missed out. (BTW, I finished it during my Waqrapukara trek in the Andes, great place to read about humans and nature). The key point he seems to make is that humans and animals aren't that different and that this should inform our way forward. Actually it focused very little on the future, which would've been disappointing had I not been in love with the flood of new info I was drowning in. His main conclusion *spoiler* was that we're causing mass extinctions. That was really his only future of the human animal. Kind of a let down given that he made zero mention of climate change (probably didn't have his attention in '91) or how social media and modern technology will shape us (didn't even exist back then). I was annoyed by the sole point being an environmental push at the end and I'm an environmentalist. Maybe because it talked only about extinctions and not climate change. He does go into genocide quite a bit, that was interesting but against everything else a little dull because it was hardly new, except the animal on animal killing.But you won't mind, because everything you thought you knew about animals and people will change forever- unless you already knew it somehow.I wish I could do a little list of all those gems, or explain them in brief, but there was SOOOO many you've no idea. Just read the friggin' book. I liked it better than his Yesterday book, maybe more than the infamous game changer: Guns, Germs, and Shit. He does cover a ton of professional ground here, and makes me wonder how, or how those professionals feel about his ranging into their territory. Actually, some of it I'd probably heard of before but forgot because I don't read as much science as I do history, philosophy, and fiction.Just read the book."
127,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26674095-gy,5,"“Nature, Mr. Allnut, is what we are put in this world to rise above.” KATHARINE HEPBURN, as Miss Rose Sayer, in The African Queen“Forget what you've heard about human beings having descended from the apes.We didn't descend from apes. We are apes.Metaphorically and factually, Homo sapiens is one of the five surviving species of great apes, along with chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans (gibbons are considered a “lesser ape”). We shared a common ancestor with two of these apes—bonobos and chimps—just five million years ago. That’s “the day before yesterday” in evolutionary terms. The fine print distinguishing humans from the other great apes is regarded as “wholly artificial” by most primatologists these days. If we’re “above” nature, it’s only in the sense that a shaky-legged surfer is “above” the ocean. Even if we never slip (and we all do), our inner nature can pull us under at any moment. Those of us raised in the West have been assured that we humans are special, unique among living things, above and beyond the world around us, exempt from the humilities and humiliations that pervade and define animal life. The natural world lies below and beneath us, a cause for shame, disgust, or alarm; something smelly and messy to be hidden behind closed doors, drawn curtains, and minty freshness. Or we overcompensate and imagine nature floating angelically in soft focus up above, innocent, noble, balanced, and wise. Like bonobos and chimps, we are the randy descendents of hypersexual ancestors. At first blush, this may seem an overstatement, but it’s a truth that should have become common knowledge long ago.”-“Sex at Dawn” – Christopher Ryan, PhD, and Cacilda Jethá, MD… and that’s the bare truth!The 355 pages of “The rise and fall of 3rd Chimpanzee” written by Jared Diamond is a masterpiece, chef-d’oeuvre if you want, that made me exude, made me laugh (multiple time during the read – laughing is good once you have to deal with some anthropological truths), but most importantly made my mind levitate out of book, and above, like the book was a kind of time machine, but moving nowhere, just standing still and calling, evoking the past, colorfully make it to spin in front of very eyes. This “out and over” meant those moments, when wandered with book in my hands over things that are out of the scope of Mr. Diamond’s book – by means, while following our evolving hyper violent and hypersexual ancestors through millions of years, in one moment I felt a space wave transferring me somehow into the cell biology, calling all what I’ve learned about cells to-do things: to survive, to reproduce, to specialize, and commit apoptosis if organism needs that sacrifice. It was a stunning experience every time when noticed I didn't read for hours, but just “looking out of head” and thinking…it was clear in one moment that I was so flabbergasted with life that I had to embark on search for miracle, to find causes, the drive, to comprehend the reasons of that rampant, raw dynamics to that we were and are permanently subjected to. The term “survive” had shifted my thoughts down for several powers, if you want zeros on micro scale , and soon found myself in genetics with professor David Sadava's lecture about fundamental genetics. Please don’t underestimate– myself, and we all know that we have to, and will do all the possible to eat in order to supply ourselves with enough chemical energy needed for sustaining our lives. But, during the read, while observing our ancestors struggling and doing all imaginable to stay in live, I felt obsession to go in details of life dynamics, to once for all comprehend the ancient drive that is forcing us to behave as we do – and then I’ve found what I was searching for: there are 20 amino acids, building blocks, that make proteins every living organism is built from! The vital ingredient part of every amino acid, among C, R and acid group is the amino group. Our issue with life is not just to eat in order to harvest chemical energy for cells to function, but also the fact that we are a kind of genetic mutants! The nature arranged our inner structure so that we can’t produce all the 20 amino acids needed for continuous building up of our organisms. From 20 amino acids, we are able to produce only 12. The main reason for this lack of faculty is our inability to harvest nitrogen from air needed and to produce amino group that is a building block of amino acids. The main cause is that only robust organisms can have capacity to withstand reaction between nitrogen and hydrogen. Some organisms have the genetic capacity to get nitrogen from the air (79% N2) and turn it into amino groups. So, some microbes can do, some worms can do, plants can do, we can’t! The missing amino groups (NH2) we humans can only get from eating other creatures! That’s what I’d call: the smoking gun! We must eat other creatures… there’s a drive, the mother of all causes! The engine that we are trying to fight the II law of thermodynamics with, the entropy, the pure disorder our organisms tend to destine.The 355 pages I felt like it is more than 1000 in its best meaning. It is full of theories, proven and unproven, it is a strong influencer, a motivator to breathe deep all the knowledge that anthropology ever revealed. The tale about rise and fall of 3rd chimp will lead the reader through ancient times of evolution, introducing the natural and sexual selections, colorfully describing all the theories of the crucial milestones along the history of human species, about our relations, correlations with our own and other species, and that all in very detailed way with high language precision. First time faced the importance of linguistics! It’s fascinating how one book can induce view changing impact on a learning mind.“The shift to agriculture, is a catastrophe from which we have never recovered.” – wrote author Jared Diamond!The moment when “the 3rd chimp” is making a sharp turn on evolutionary path is really a dramatic milestone! I experienced this as the second part of the book, very raw historical reasoning about mankind’s uniqueness comparing to other mammals. After shifting to agriculture, with continuously evolving language, culture and art, humans gradually rule and conquer the planet in its fully and truly worst sense of the word. The ancient drive to eat and survive, reproduce is following us along our entire history forcing us to do inconceivable things. The author will take some time to reflect on the universe, on our dream to find out is there anybody else lurking in the dark and about all what we might expect from eventual contact from alien life.Briefly, “The rise and fall of 3rd Chimpanzee” is a view changing, complex, with seemingly not so many pages very demanding, from time to time exhaustive reading. I've really enjoyed the magical power of the author to induce to I have open at least 2 or 3 other books more simultaneously, some related sociobiology, some to evolutionary psychology, genetics or cell biology..etc, while was in process of reading his book. For the readers about to embark, this book cannot be read as some novel. To get the best from it, one must apply techniques of artful reading. Don’t rush, take time, you’ll enjoy too.Thanks Mr. Diamond, well done!"
128,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116812917-ctep,0,"For the month of February, I read the book The Third Chimpanzee. This book details human evolution from the anthropological perspective, something I am very interested in. The book is broken up into five different sections that detail different aspects of humanity and evolution, beginning with our leap from apes to humans. I first picked up this book because I thought it would focus on early hominids but this book discusses so much more than that. Human evolution has not just been biological processes, but culture ones as well. The author takes the time to detail three of humanities most successful attributes, art, language and agriculture, as well as three of its most destructive, addiction, environmental degradation and genocide.A very important section of this book is the one that explains how humans have conquered the globe and how Europeans came to conquer most other humans. Despite what Europeans have taught for hundreds of years, they are no better or smarter than any other humans on the planet. Europeans evolved more quickly than other people solely because of their geography and I think this is an important lesson to learn for AmeriCorps. The lesson is that all humans are the same, no one is better than anyone else and it is important for us to know that because Minnesota is extremely diverse. Also, many of the people we work with face hardships because of where they are from or the color of their skin, they are considered “others” and it is much easier for humans to torment people that they consider “others.” I feel most AmeriCorps members already know this but it is important to reiterate because I know we all have a tendency to forget. Also, I am the kind of person who needs to know why things are they way they are. This book helped me see that and I know I will be more aware of what I say and how I teach from now on.This book dispels many of the myths about humanity and shows how closely related we still are to animals, and to one another. I would suggest this book to anyone as curious as myself or anyone interested in anthropology because it portrays many of the things we already know in a new light, plus it includes lots more interesting facts. I believe strongly in learning from the past to make a better future and you can’t get much more past than all of human history, but that is just me."
129,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19045959-mahsa-mehrdad,2,"It doesn't mean that I didn't learn anything from this book, so I start with what I have learned:- A great deal of information about how homo sapiens developed from apes, the differences between our ancestors (cro-magnon) and other H.sapiens species.- Very interesting information on the development of language and the links among different languages.- Natural selection vs. sexual selection. I found the notion of sexual selection very intriguing and got the answers to some questions I had in mind about human races.Why I didn't like the book:I have recently started studying evolution, so I am pretty new in the subject. Starting the book, I was very excited, however, I lost my excitement all together after the first two chapters. There are lots of claims without enough back up evidence or reasonable arguments to prove it. For example, in two chapters, the author explains why human has private sex or why adultery exists based on this claim that humans are monogamous. However, he specified only one paragraph with a feeble argument on why human are evolutionary monogamous. In another example, in chapter ""alone in a crowded universe"", he claims that humans are unique and alone in the whole universe. Now, in 2017, we know that is probably not true and yes! the book was written 20 years ago. But, just the fact that an evolutionary biologists (if we can call him that) brings up such a huge claim related to astronomy makes me think twice about his other claims.The other thing that made the book intolerable for me was that he tries to explain everything based on evolution and the links to other animal behaviors. It seems that he ignores the role of culture in human behavior all together. He argues that making art or drug/alcohol consumption are evolutionary adopted behavior (especially by males) to attract mates. Such a claim needs more evidence than just explaining one bird's (bower bird) tendency to make beautiful and artistic nests (Chapter: the origin of art). there are experiments showing that laboratory mice get addicted to cocaine and prefer to be awarded drug instead of food or water. It seems that mice find the pleasure of drug consumption and get addicted to it. It is not for sexual attraction."

To satisfy my curiosity, I got hands on author Jared Diamond's ""Guns ,Germs and Steel "" , in which Jared had elaborated about how we became what we are today , how the people on different continents are living as different cultures, economical and political situations which were not ramifications of the genes but of the geographical differences - a myth which he busted in his book. As impressed with his above book , I had to read his other literatures and ""The Rise And fall Of The Third Chimpanzee "" did not failed to impress me. In this book , Jared has told about his research on the three chimpanzees - pygmy and common chimpanzees and third chimpanzee, which is nothing but the us which deviated from other two during the evolution. Along with these two chimpanzees , our ancestors - Neanderthals and Cro- magnon - pre-modern humans were compared with gorillas, orangutans etc. Our sexual habits , social structures made the differences as well as some similarities with our ancestors from the different branches of the tree of our evolution. Author has described in the details how those parameters made the changes in evolutionary history of the humans. Jared throughout his book has made elaborated points about the things which we feel make us different from the other animals - Our art, language , agriculture,genocide and how these things are actually found in the rudimentary form in different animals and how actually minor difference in our genes(as we have only around 1.6 % genes different from chimps ) made us take the ""great leap of progress"" which made us modern human.  In the latter stage of the book, Jared has also talked about proliferation of our species on the entire Earth and how it caused extermination of innumerable species . Finally he has warned us about our future as we are the only species which is capable of exterminating ourselves but, he has shown some optimism about future as we are the creator of our own problems and we can find the solutionsl."
131,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17118570-dennis-ashendorf,5,"After reading ""Collapse,"" I encountered former Stanford President Donald Kennedy and asked him about Professor Diamond: ""Brilliant, but he overreached."" At the moment, I thought Dr. Kennedy was being too dismissive, but now I realize he was speaking about ""The Third Chimpanzee,"" Dr. Diamond's first book.""The Third Chimpanzee"" serves as a tour de force. Jared Diamond's scholarship in evolution, experience in New Guinea and deep understanding of geography, as it should be taught, yielded a book which substantiates all that it can and speculates on what in unknown with piercing insight.Basically, the text looks at humans as a space alien would: a branch of chimpanzees. He shows the precursors to human behavior, unusual aspects of human sexuality, and guesses that what allowed us to ""leap forward"" 40,000 years ago was the ability to speak with grammar (other animals speak). The leaping forward still retained animal behavior, however; which can be problematic.His final chapters focus on genocide, the unwitting overuse of natural resources and extinction.His concerns in 1992, never mentioned global warming or ""unusual"" climate change; because there was no need! Civilizations have disappeared before due to environmental mismanagement. Diamond doesn't suffer the fools who think that humans were environmentalists before Western expansion.If I may add my thought, to what should be a must read: the focus on climate change is itself hiding from the truth of what we are. We need to find ways of just not bettering ourselves, but those we see as the other; remembering that the other isn't so sweet either. The focus on group vs group or men vs women etc is truly a dead-end. The pathway to long-term environmental management eludes us currently. We need calmness with clarity in direction."
132,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23849290-jeffrey,4,"Diamond attempts to chart a history of humans - drawing from many fields including anthropology, archeology, linguistics, as well as zoology, he provides an interesting and entertaining synthesis. He attempts to show links between humans and our closest relatives, the other two chimpanzees"" as well as other humans, attempting to explain how we diverged in the past and where we may eventually end up as a species. Readers of Diamond's other work will see how he has expanded on his ideas in other books (the reason for European dominance in Guns, Germs and Steel, how societies collapse (for example those on Easter Island and in Chaco Canyon) in Collapse. Of course a lot of this is conjecture, but there is not much alternative (it is not like there are well chronicled accounts of early human history), and Diamond's conjectures are well reasoned.In many ways, his central thesis is that human history took an eventful turn with our ability to master language. In many ways, this is largely undisputed - similar theories are espoused by Harari in Sapiens. But Diamond's account is slightly broader than Harari's in that he goes back to trace the divergence from our chimpanzee ancestor, whereas Harari's account was an excellent summary of human societal history once we had developed the ability to master language. Actually I found that one of The Third Chimpanzee's weak points - it was slightly too broad and light on details. In particular, especially with the benefit of having read Diamond's books published after this, a lot of this felt liked slightly underdone. But again I stress that is only with the benefit of having read Diamond's other works, so perhaps it is slightly unfair. In summary an interesting read, but for those who have the time I would recommend them go directly to Diamond's works which he published after these."
133,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11840025-ryan-la-fleur,4,"Human beings have always liked to think of themselves as special. We are unique. We are distinctive in our actions, our bodies, our minds or our souls. The human animal is unparalleled among the creatures of Earth. Perhaps we are peculiar in all the known universe. Is it because of something in our genes, the very DNA that produces life, that we are rare? Or does it have to do with our ability to use language. The remarkable thing about us may be our minds; its ability to realize we exist and others exist separate from us. Possibly the miracle is a spark from some divine creator. We can see this belief in our mythology, our theology, and even in our early development and psychology. Perhaps what makes us different is not something special but something darker. Our propensity to hurt ourselves or others; to the point we are capable of destroying all life on our small blue globe.So what, exactly, is it that does make us special? What is it that makes us different - some would even say better or more important - than the rest of all life on our planet? Are we, in fact, special at all or our we just another - albeit less harry - chimpanzee? Not even a great ape but just another in a long line of upright standing mammal?This is the question Jared Diamond asks in 
The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal
. He asks it not with metaphysics or theology but with biology, geography and social science. He questions our unique construction, the places we live and how we interact; both inter-species and intraspecies, and which of these key components that can be measured may - or may not - either separately or in combination be the key that makes us human.I’ve read the other two books in what is colloquially known as Dr. Diamonds’ “trilogy”. With 
Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies
 and 
Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed
 Dr. Diamond expounds on the questions asked in this book. In Guns, Germs and Steel he concentrates on the geography of why human society, Western Eurasian society in particular, has spread across the globe. What was it that allowed European technology to flourish while African and American societies were hindered in their progress. Utilizing geography he demonstrates it was not any inherent superiority in the Europeans themselves but rather a quirk of good geographic luck. The wide open plains and steppe of Europe and Central Asia allowed the development of agriculture and animal husbandry; and hence advanced society, sooner in Eurasia. Likewise the sweeping continent allowed technological advances as well as disease to spread easily. Thus providing faster distribution of knowledge and immunity to a wider array of illness.Collapse focuses on the social and environmental impact of the human species on both itself and the the world in which we live. Looking at societies from Indonesia, Mesoamerica, South Pacific Islands and even Africa, Dr. Diamond demonstrates human beings often act shortsightedly. We fail to see or wantonly ignore the damage we are responsible for until it is to late. Often the damage takes a long time to accrue; as in the fertile crescent or Petra, once the breadbasket of the Middle East. It can also happen within a few generations, as on small South Pacific islands; where the new human arrivals use up scarce resources. The effects of human intervention, either ignored or mistaken, often last long after those who caused the damage have moved on or perished.The germs (if you’ll excuse the pun) of these ideas are found in The Third Chimpanzee. Dr. Diamond dedicates this book to, who at the time were small boys, his two young sons. He hopes that by trying to examine whether it is biology - the small 2% difference in DNA- or sociology - our use of language or development of society or propensity to hurt ourselves or others - which makes us more than just apes. With each exploration he shows we are not unique. Other animals use some form of language; tool use, while not wide spread, is there with other animals, even beyond primates. Even our use of drugs to our own detriment is not unique, and the trait we most abhor, the purposefully killing of another is practiced by other creatures as well. It seems we are different not in kind but only in quantity to the rest of the animal kingdom. We seem to have the broadest vocabulary of all animals. Humans create the largest impact on the environment. We, and only we, have the ability to completely wipe ourselves from the face of the Earth. With his exploration of our similarities to the rest of the animal kingdom, Dr, Diamond has hope that we can learn. That we are able to see our similarities as well as our distinctiveness and embrace our true position in the universe. As the third chimpanzee.If we look at our psychological development as individuals it seems to mirror the journey the human race has taken in its own understanding of our place in the universe. Starting out we are the end all and be all of existence. The sun rises and sets for us and about us. As we grow we start to see that there are other creatures around, but surely they can’t be anywhere near as important as we are. Later, some of us at least, come to realize that there are others and they are just as important as we are. The world does not revolve around us but we interact with a much larger world. If we are very lucky we discover that we really see some of these others as more important than ourselves. So important their continued existence is worth more to us than anything - including our own. These are the people we claim to love, honor, revere and cherish.If, as Dr. Diamond hopes throughout this book and the rest of his “trilogy”, we can learn to see beyond our simple means we can embrace not our uniqueness but our connection to the rest of the world. Then, perhaps, we will see this connection does not diminish us but broadens who we are as both species and individual. We can see that as a unique part of a greater whole we have a duty and a responsibility to think beyond or selfishness to the greater good."
134,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7470861-ali,5,"Another fantastic book by Jared Diamond, but chronologically it is one of his earlier books and several chapters in this one one are definitely the inspirations for his future books - particularly ""Guns, Germs & Steep"" and ""Collapse"" - so this is the nucleus of some amazing follow-up books!Here, he makes a very thorough (albeit slightly dated - this book WAS written in 1991 after all) analysis on evolution of our species and how genetically similar we are to our two closest living 'cousins', the common & pygmy chimps. I found this section of the book the most fascinating and interesting. The book goes on to how societies developed, proposing a very interesting thought at some point about whether we as humans were better off as hunter-gatherers than when we developed agriculture, society and so on (well, perhaps we wouldn't be prosecuting or exterminating people different than us, but I personally quite appreciate that we developed writing and I can read/listen to books like this). Other parts of the book then continue on to make the arguments which he has fleshed out in follow up books (why Eurasians society/language conquered the 'new world', and how some older societies collapsed) , before ending the book on chapters related to how we are really causing the destruction of our own future due to illogical actions.Either way, if you are a fan of Jared's other books obviously I do not need to recommend this book. But I also highly recommend it especially if you liked the more 'up-to-date' (albeit in my opinion, not as well researched) 'Sapiens' by Yuval Noah Harari."
135,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811366-esmeralda-rupp-spangle,3,"This probably would have been four stars had I read it when it came out, but the science is about 25 years old at this point. It's a good book, all in all, and has that particular Jared Diamond-y flair for being really empathetic, gloomy, but ultimately offering optimism. I thought it would be more about evolution but he spends quite a bit of time on many of the concepts he also covers in Guns Germs and Steel and Collapse (which I am familiar with so this was not new). His affection for the New Guineans he talks so much about in those other two books comes through here as well. There are chapters on the spread of the Indo European language and culture (great one!), the origins of behaviors and cultural complexity when compared to other animals, and human migration. He also spends an inordinate amount of page space on xenophobia, habitat destruction and environmental collapse, extinction, genocide, and the importance of specific resources that allowed our species to conquer the planet. None of these are unworthy topics, however, I was hoping for some more information about evolution, biology, our earliest ancestors and stone age through iron age history, rather than ending as it does on an environmental / sixth extinction type diatribe. Nevertheless, lots of valuable information, and as always, Jared's unique voice and perspective come through clearly. Read it if you like his other books. "
136,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,2,"This book is really broad, kind of impressive in scope. The organization is reasonably good for covering such far-ranging topics. There were some topics that I found particularly interesting and novel, such as the idea that sexual selection played a large role in skin color and it’s not entirely a result of proximity to the equator. I also really enjoyed the part about what geographical features could have given some civilizations on earth a head start (teaser for the later Guns Germs and Steel). From cross vs self-pollinating staple grains to the axis the civilization travels along, there’s a lot to consider. However the tone of the book is a little unscientific and overly-confident. It has the patriarchal air of a Victorian grandpa sitting you upon his knee to tell you his pet theories about the world and expecting your rapt attention because this is the first time you’ve heard any of this. The chapter about the human use of potentially harmful drugs struck me as especially rich in unfounded stretching speculation (it’s to show off our handicaps) and deep sanctimony. Also, does anyone else get the feeling he’s just dying to show you his vacation photos from New Guinea even though no one asked to see them? This is actually my first Diamond book, so perhaps he has since improved on this aspect of his writing. I’ll probably read Guns Germs and Steel next, since I found those topics from this book especially interesting. "
137,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2962393-chris,4,"The sheer breadth of the book is impressive, he easily could have written this as three separate books... oh wait, he later did (Guns, Germs, and Steel; Why is Sex Fun?; Collapse). So there is a fair bit of retread if you're familiar with his other works but it's not as repetitive as reading multiple Dawkins books because he has so many varying ideas. Diamond's arguments lie on a gradient from inspired (more animal domestication happened in Eurasia not the Americas because it was easier to spread longitudinally than latitudinally) to arse-pulling (explanation for why drug addiction is a thing). But generally enjoyable. The later chapters such as ""the Golden Age that Never Was"" is hugely depressing, showcasing how long the anthropogenic mass extinction currently underway has been going on. I knew about the evidence of human-caused large mammal and bird extinctions in North America and Australasia, but I don't think I've encountered such a list of examples as in this book. It creates a damning picture for the human species: if we were responsible for the loss of so many species when we were small in number wielding spear technology, what hope do we possibly have in the highly-impacted, resource-stressed environment we find ourselves? Probably not much, so I guess do what you can and appreciate the wonders of nature still among us. "

And same superfamily, homenaidea. But separate families. Homenaidea for humans, hongdae for chimpanzees.- other, where chronological time is consider, even consider within the same family and the same genus- ability to speak was what really change things- 3m years ago.

Had more leisure than farmers- impact on environment: had always been one of the causes to explain extinction and evolution. E.g. Spanish invasion in New Mexico.

The book covers a vast range of topics, such as how are humans qualitatively different from other animals and yet more than 98% of our genes match with chimpanzees, why do men do stupid things to impress women, why human females evolved menopause, why do people practice adultery, why do humans practice genocide, how did languages evolve, why do some people become addicted to drugs, why do humans produce art etc. Then, the author talks about why people from a certain geography (Europe) went on to conquer the world, how domestication of animals played a big role in this area.The book ends with the ecological harm humans have done to the planet, our genocidal tendencies and the extinctions of species that we cause. Diamond shows how none of these activities are unique to humans; each activity has some analog in animal behavior, as well.Of course, evolution cannot be termed as an exact science and there are a lot of speculations in this book. He makes sweeping generalizations that are not always held up by documented facts. But then, this is one area where you cannot prove your hypotheses by experimentation."

But evidence of progression of our bodies throughout 7 millions years of evolution from ape-like creatures, to bipedal erectus, hunters gatherers in the Safana, slowly to sapiens able to make sophisticated tools, domesticate animals and hybridyse plants, communicate through language and writing and art, are not just a beautiful story to tell but happens to be true.It was an easy mission to understand the biological process of humain evolution and the implication of our origin in every aspect of our social behaviour. The first chapters were softly comprehensible. But as long as I went through the book, things were getting harder. The rise of verbal communication and the diversity of human language were the most overwhelming parts. I have never been good at history or geography but Jared made it worth to try. Now I can say that every spoken word have a story of at least 40 000 years, and that the first spoken word was the lane to the rise of culture and technology. The latter, which progress is astonishingly fast, will lead our fall.

With his unusual mixture of insight and humor, he explores and explains our evolutionary behavior, origins and our species domination of the planet. After all, with chapter headings such as The Science of Adultery, Why Do We Grow Old and Die?, Agriculture's Mixed Blessings,and The Golden Age That Never Was, how can the curious reader be anything but intrigued? I found his comprehensive exploration of the origins and development of human language to be particularly compelling, probably because I had never considered what an impactful evolutionary step language was to the success of Homo sapiens. Diamond is an excellent writer as well as an insightful scientist and keeps even the untutored science devotee anxious for his next factual observation. This is an early book for the award-winning author (1993) and in the beginning, I had issue with some of his conclusions on human and primate relationships that more recent DNA analysis has called into question but at the end of the volume, he covers some of these topics under the heading: ""New Discoveries"". I've become a real Jerod Diamond fan and if you give him a try I think you will be too."

Although it would be impossible to recount all the information Diamond presents upon a first reading, his writing links human behaviors and origins together in a chain of associations so that one fact logically leads to another, making it much easier to recall the story of human development as a whole. I chose this book because of a marginal interest I had in anthropology and because I know that Diamond is a very popular science author, and he did not disappoint, even though this is his first book. When I pick up another one of his texts, I hope to see the same witty tone I found in this one.If you consider yourself to be the ultimate champion of political correctness, then try not to get offended- this 1992 book discusses human sexuality (among other traits) in objective, binary terms that do not glorify women, with no mention of homosexuality. For all the rest of you, give it a go. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is substantially interested in anthropology or the origins of universal human qualities."

I had already read “Guns, Germs, and Steel” when I started “The Third Chimpanzee”. He rehashes and extrapolates on a lot of the most interesting parts of “The Third Chimpanzee” in “Guns, Germs, and Steel”, so I would recommend skipping this book and reading that instead. “Sapiens” is sort of an updated version of this book and might be a better choice for a similar subject matter now. Although, it may be a fun exercise to read both and see how the thinking in this area has and hasn’t changed in the last quarter century. "

What is new is that such a prophecy is now true, for two obvious reasons. First, nuclear weapons give us the means to wipe ourselves out quickly: no humans possessed this means before. Second, we already appropriate about forty per cent of the Earth’s net productivity (that is, the net energy captured from sunlight). With the world’s human population now doubling every forty-one years, we will soon have reached the biological limit to growth, at which point we will have to start fighting each other in deadly earnest for a slice of the world’s fixed pie of resources. In addition, given the present rate at which we are exterminating species, most of the world’s species will become extinct or endangered within the next century, but we depend on many species for our own life support.” "

The Third Chimpanzee outlines what makes us more or less different from our close genetic relatives. In general, the unique impact of humans is more of a technological difference than one of unique capacities. Even more interesting is that you see the beginnings of Jared Diamond's most popular book, Guns, Germs, and Steel, in the final chapters of this book. This is where he begins to outline what became one of the most interesting takes on why humans spread across the world as they did. I also appreciated Jared Diamond's take on the role of humans on the extinction of flora and fauna and that there is good reason to believe that this was always the case wherever homo sapiens traversed. Highly recommended for those interested in anthropology, archeology, and geology and what it can tell us about our history as a species. "

And though I'm sure my ignorance of current research helped, I wasn't bothered by the book's age. Diamond makes his subject matter so readable, detailed enough to satisfy my curiosity without descending into dry tedium. I loved the section tracing the history of the Proto-Indo-European language (who knew their was a field called linguistic paleontology?). Some sections rehashed the theories of Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, which was still enjoyable as a refresher to that work.I would normally not have a work of non-fiction on my nightstand, but this was fun to dip into every night for a few weeks."

Just a few many interesting theories in the book:- Diamond maintains that one reason Neanderthals did not develop more quickly and innovate was that life expectancy was so short that they did not benefit from the ""grandparent effect,"" where older generations help teach younger how things were, and suggest how things can be with innovation.- Diamond pushes a sub-thesis of his book, which is that the development of agriculture has not been a total win for human society (much less other species).

It speaks specifically about our evolutionary climb from our common ape ancestor and covers the impact we've had on our environment, other species, and ourselves without becoming too philosophical or employing pages of math. It also ends on a note of hope, which is nice. I think the hope is a bit optimistic and unrealistic, but it's still nice. The book is, however, a product of its time. There are some casual uses of words that are now acknowledged to be racial slurs, and some science that has since been altered, but overall, this was an absolutely fascinating look at where we come from, and should serve as a bit of a reality check for those who deny that we're just smart animals with fine motor skills.

How exactly we started our journey and what are the main factors to shape us on how we are. The vast amount of knowledge the book offers is astounding and it's exactly what I will look for in a Non-fiction book.I don't usually compare books but this time I will make an explanation, this book has reminded me greatly of ""Sapiens a brief history of mankind"". But diverts in the terms that this book is more of a scientific kind than being appeal to the general audience, and that's not at all a bad thing because the author had greatly surmized everything complex into simple terms. Everytime I learnt something new I felt an epiphany of revelation and something about this world made sense to me. Overall this is a wonderful book where one can read again and again and again."

The final third of the book, however, was judgemental, damning, excessively pessimistic. Yes, the world is a tire fire, and yes we caused it, but the contempt that Diamond has for the human race seemed useless and needlessly strident. Given that some of the science in this is dated - for instance, we now know that most people of European descent carry Neanderthal genes, despite his assertions that he thought it unlikely - and given that many of his conclusions seem based a little too heavily on his own opinion, I don't know if I'd recommend this. Instead, I would suggest choosing something with more updated science."
151,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29560882-dave,4,"Jared Diamond's ""The Third Chimpanzee"" is well worth your time, despite being a 25 year-old science book. Its science remains top-rate, and the ideas and projections are not dated. The book jacket summarizes the book's content well. Be forewarned, however, Diamond pulls no punches in this book. Human propensities for self-destruction through environmental degradation, war with increasingly dangerous weapons, tendencies toward genocide, and a general unwillingness to learn from the past can make this book dreary if not down-right depressing. Also, I sensed a bit of pontificating at times (thus 4 instead of 5 stars). Its never-the-less a book that everyone, particularly our leaders, should read and contemplate."
152,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67604852-dessy,5,"Fyi, the one I read is the young reader version,Despite I spent a long time finishing this book, this book is very interesting because everything human did could be explained using the evolution theory. Now every time I watch science fiction film, especially the one about new species or monster or even Kaiju, I think about the book, because it has answers or a possible answers of what happened or what supposedly happened to them.I really like the quote: The past was still a Golden Age, of ignorance, while the present is an Iron Age of willful blindness. Well it is not a positive quote but I kinda agree on it, sadly."

There was so much information, it's not possible for me to process everything or evaluate.We are the third species of the chimpanzee and we are not that different from the other 2 chimp species or even other animal species for that matter.We do however, have been over-consuming and foolishly using up our resources, ever-reluctant to learn from the past and adapt. But the good news is that since it's all our doing, we are also the one with the power to make changes. It's in our hands if and whenever we are willing.In short, mankind is doomed. Unless we act smart, conserve and make amends."
154,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40342182-geoff-lehr,4,"A very interesting book, but dated by the nearly thirty years since its release.I was expecting a more biological / anthropological examination of the subject (namely, humans as the third species of chimp), and there is certainly a good deal of that, but there was also quite a lot of examination / justification of humans as (just) another species of animal (a premise which I grew up accepting), and the danger we are putting ourselves in by destruction of our environment. I suppose it is understandable, given that it was released in 1991. "

Or perhaps it was me, who read it without some breaks and I think this book needs breaks and time assimilate what it's telling you.Anyway, a very good book for serious readers in the topics previously mentioned."

But this was a pleasant surprise in that I found it neither boring or complicated. The author's load every explanation out thoughtfully and simply. I got the Young People's edition and I think the simplicity of it best suited me. Towards the end, it did feel a little off topic.

It’s a little all over the place a covers the entirety of human history which is a lot! I like the theories and ideas on the ‘great leap forward’ as he calls it when Cro Magnon advances rapidly around 40-50K years ago. The parts on human lifespan, language and sexuality where interesting, as well as the theories about drug taking. Additionally, the section about the spread and origin of the indoeuropean language was fascinating. It was a little pessimistic at the end, but overall a very interesting read."

It also came across as a bit of an information dump, which bothered me as some of the facts we were given didn’t really seem wholly relevant to the topic being discussed. The writing was witty and had the odd humorous anecdote, which makes a change to the usual dry writing style that is often seen in these sort of books.

There are many useful pieces of information in this book written in an easy to read style. However, there are as well strong and absurd statements. For example, according to the author, geography explains the degree of civilization (e.g., the difference between the advanced Greek culture and the tribes in the stone age is due mainly to different geography of Greece). This statement strikes me as naive. There are other utterances of this author that infuriate me, but I will not discuss them here. "

It is clear Diamond is just guessing and in doing so, making wild assumptions.His understanding of anthropology is primitive at best and his theories come across as very agenda-driven. This is not a scientific examination of evolution, sociology, sexuality, anthropology, biology or anything else. It is an author still learning about scientific scrutiny and research. His following books seem much more researched and much less conjecture."

It also taught me why humans are so advanced compared to other species. I couldn't stop myself turning the page. Even though it was nonfiction, this book had me wanting to know more every page. This book is a must-read for anyone who enjoys learning about the evolution and dangers of humanity."

However I felt some of the examples of animal precursors to specific human behaviour were rather weak. In particular his ideas around addiction/self harm.In a book that tries to draw on the similarities between man and our ape cousins, it still leaves a massive void as to why we are so very different beyond genetics and instincts?"
165,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51006420-jacob-blandford,3,The chapter on language was very interesting. At this point some of the information is outdated. The author is emphatic that humans and neanderthals never mated but we know now from DNA that this idea is wrong and there was breeding between humans and neanderthals. This information was not available at the time the book was written so the author is not at fault but it just highlights the knowledge of the time and how much we have learned since then.

As it is one of his earliest books I noticed two tendencies: Several chapters are to become his late books and some of the facts are already outdated ( he wrote it in 1991). For example the latest facts about Neanderthals vere more sophisticated as previously thought, especially with art and we Europeans share with them some DNA (3%)."

It's not quite on the level of GGS, but still a very readable and scientifically rigorous examination of our sexuality, language and art, and even destructive behaviors, that may be, though often are not, uniquely human. Best read before GGS, as it sets up that book quite nicely."

He writes very elegantly and delicate information, are precise and to the point. For example: when he compares the three chimps, and explains each trait, you get into phase of being physically present with him. It doesn't get boring or lengthy at any point through out the book. I would recommend this book to anyone, who wants to more about evolution and how we got to who we are."
171,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80039538-arnold,2,"Jared is very elaborate and mixes in many of his own experiences and opinions. However, these tidbits become tedious after a while and clearly come from someone who is from an older generation (no offense). This, combined with the fact that much of the information is outdated (book is almost 30 years old now), almost makes the book irrelevant. (Note that I read a translated version from the early 2000s. I’m not sure whether newer prints contain any updated information)"

After reading his later works like Collapse and Guns, Germs and Steel I decided to visit his earlier work and I am not disappointed. The Third Chimpanzee is some dense reading, but I gained so much knowledge and interesting bits of information. It was a slow, but rewarding journey. If you like his later work you will like The Third Chimpanzee."

Pretty wooly headed.
174,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3496816-marc,4,"Prof Diamond's works always teeter between research and logic-based arguments. I found a lot to find interesting in this book. I particularly appreciated the segments that describe how societies that superficially might be very different nevertheless have distinct similarities. It will almost certainly challenge something that you believe in, and for that reason alone, definitely recommended. "
175,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7101315-matt,3,"Definitely a pre-cursor to ""Guns, Germs and Steel""... very pessimistic about human nature, throws around the term genocide pretty loosely. On the upside, has a great (hilarious) observation about how the concept of convergent evolution and observations of woodpeckers can inform the coefficients of the Drake equation in the search for extraterrestrial life."
176,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56169217-darsh-bakshi,3,A good read especially considering it was his first book and that this was published 20 years ago.

The book tells the story of the genetic and cultural evolution of Homo Sapiens, since our species diverged from two our closest genetic relatives - chimpanzees - around 5 million years ago. The book tries to answer how very little genetic changes lead to such a different story of Homo Sapiens and Common and Pygmy Chimp. Then it tells the story of how the cultural evolution started to be more important than the genetic one. Although the book is old, the most of the book still holds true. Also it is worth to note, that Yuval Harari noted that Jared Diamond was his main inspiration for writing 'Sapiens' - so if You have liked that book, then You should read both books by Diamond."

258,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4485647-joni-baboci,5,"The Third Chimpanzee is an amazing work of science and erudition which no intelligent human being should even consider missing. Differently from the generic approach, Diamond tries to explain human evolution not only from a biological and genetic perspective but rather likes to connect biogenetics to the social aspect of our species progress through time. Furthermore his writing is peppered with cool facts which are often used to complement an argument and render it more interesting while giving it much wider perspective.What sort of man/woman do you find attractive and why?Why human males have the largest penis of all apes? Why do chimps have the largest testes?What's the evolutionary reason for menopause?How unique are humans in the universe?These are just a select few of the questions that will be answered - compellingly and argumentatively - while you read. The Third Chimpanzee is a goldmine of creativity. Just like Diamond did in Guns, Germs and Steel he provides original and often novative explanations to the reasons humans evolved the way they did. While GGS is more concerned with the adaptation of man after the major biological evolution had already occurred, TTC concerns itself with evolution at a larger scale at a both biological and social perspective. Most importantly Diamond is able to merge those aspects and therefore you don’t feel like you are reading a choppy and fragmented book but rather an integral and creative approach to evolution which although at times might feels not hardly grounded into fact (not because of a lack of wanting but because it is impossible to conduct practical experiments with human evolution), definitely sounds thought out and rational and well-researched.Now sure, some arguments may not fully convince you (the woodpecker/radios analogy was hard to accept for me), however, even when they sound too far fetched, Diamond does his best to make them engaging, interesting and most importantly continuously supported by real-world facts and examples.It is impossible to not create a web of connections with what you already know while reading. For example I found a number of interesting similarities between the modern sworn virgins of Northern Albania and Papua New Guinea’s specificity of cultural evolution. And then 10 pages after finding that kind of connection I found an actual reference to Albania proper: ""Anyone with time, money and desire can visit almost any country except for a few xenophobic exceptions, such as Albania and North Korea” - Kindle location 3607. However remember that this was written in 1991 (although I believe the republished 2006 version should have corrected this).It is obvious that there is some overlapping and repetition if you have read any of the other books by Diamond. So far I have only read GGS and have found a number of ideas and chapters resembling parts of that other masterpiece by Diamond - especially chapters 14 and 18 - however if you space the books some months apart you will find that the repetition will serve as a welcome reminder and review of the dense material.Like with GGS, I especially love Diamond's arguments on language development, diffusal and replacement. However I would argue that even though, say indo-European languages came from the same proto-indo-European language, the entropic process of dialects and language variations has produced languages as different as Albanian, Celtic and Indian, and giving it time will continue to do so in geometric progression. In retrospect it might be possible that language evolved only once, and then entropied into our current state - I believe this to be a fascinating illustration of some universal entropic patterns found everywhere in the universe. However since limited contact is a prerequisite for language entropy, a more globalized world might certainly slow if not stop the entropic process of language evolution. TLDR of this paragraph is DO NOT for any reason miss chapter 15 - it is just astounding.Conclusively, even the bibliography is amazingly put-together. The research for each chapter is narratively detailed and broken down. This book is a golden mine of creativity and inspiration, not only about human evolution, but about the universe in general. Diamond’s work inspires me."
259,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115760001-deanna-karapetyan,5,I would say this is the best written science book I've ever read.

There is a overlap between the ground covered by these two books and ""Guns, Germs..."" being book that was published later elaborates on some of the basic ideas that are mentioned in this book."
261,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53166645-murray-garrett,5,"Kind of like reading Darwin's Origin of Species. Such a wealth of examples to back up his point of view almost makes it a chore to read. Almost! I actually finished and enjoyed both of those books and also read Guns Germs & Steel. But I admit I welched out on ""Collapse."" I found that one just too hard, repetitive and depressing to finish. It got to be a chore I did not want. This book however, like G.G&S was great. Hard to argue against his logic and experience even if you were even so inclined. Wonderful stuff."
262,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1225357-kyle,3,"This is the third book I've read by Jared Diamond, and though I didn't think it was as groundbreaking as Guns, Germs, and Steel and Collapse, I still enjoyed the book. In fact, the ideas that were fleshed out in those two books (Why the European Culture came to dominate the world in the 19th century and why societies collapse) are both present in their infancies in this book.Basically, Diamond makes the case that man is nothing more than another chimpanzee. We share over 98% of our DNA with chimps, and Diamond shows that everything we consider to be uniquely human traits have animal precursors or equivalents (with the possible exception of drug abuse). Sure humans use tools, but so do some animals (such as chimps using sticks to get termites). Well, humans have language another person might say. So does a species of monkey Diamond discusses that have different vocalizations for eagles, leopards, and snakes. Humans lie! Diamond mentions that some of these monkeys will vocalize a leopard warning when their tribe is losing a fight with another tribe to send their rivals scurrying up trees.The list continues! Diamond showed that bower birds create ""art"" and that various animals commit ""murder"" and even genocide. He also speaks of how ants have domesticated aphids and use them as a food source, thus having a kind of agriculture. In fact, the only thing that seems to be uniquely human is drug abuse, and even that seems to have some animal precursors.Diamond's main point is that humans have clearly evolved from animals and that the dividing line that we tend to draw between ourselves and animals isn't as distinct as we'd like to think. In fact, almost all the behaviors that we consider to be uniquely human appear to have animal equivalents, or at least precursors.The next section of the book spends time detailing the evolution of man from our separation from a common ancestor with chimps and gorillas 7 million years ago to the arrival of Cro-Magnon Man 40,000 years ago. The speculation about the extinction of the Neanderthals being caused by Cro-Magnon Man is convincing and the discussion of the spread of languages is interesting as well.Diamond also takes some time to point out the flaws in the Drake Equation that predicts a universe teeming with intelligent life. The best part is when Diamond makes a compelling case that if we really thought there was intelligent life out there then we should try to avoid it as our history tells us that when two groups of humans meet the technologically superior group wipes out the other. So sending out a radio broadcast telling whoever is out there exactly where we are probably wasn't the best idea ever.Finally the rest of the book presents some early ideas of Diamond's that were expanded in Guns, Germs, and Steel and Collapse. If you've read those two books, you'll find some of this repetitive, but the first half of the book more than makes up for it and a little redundancy never hurt anyone.I guess my only other qualm is that Diamond tends to over exaggerate at times. He has a tendency to make statements like ""This evidence is indisputable"" or ""This theory is unquestionable"" which is obviously false. A theory that is not questionable is not a theory. I agree 100% with the majority of Diamond's theories and conclusions, but that does not mean that they should be beyond questioning. We should remember what Norbert Wiener knew at the age of 10 when he wrote of ""the impossibility of man being certain of anything"". "
263,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2337888-travis-struchen,3,"2/25/2009The Third Chimpanzee – Jarod Diamond cc1992A highly evolutionist book, after skipping the first section (60pages) the book got more interesting with Diamond’s take on why humans are attracted to each other, why we engage in acts such as adultery and drug abuse (and even genocide). We are attracted to the opposite sex that share are characteristics usually, from space between the eyes all the way down to length of forefingers. If we choose mates purely for sexual reasons the correlation is even greater, but when personality traits and stability are taken into account for monogamous, child rearing relationships the correlations weakens a bit. A study on extramarital relationships and married couples supported this theory.Our addiction and abuse of drugs was described as a way to show superior genes that has gone wrong from our animal ancestors. Certain male animals like peacocks have a huge hindering plume that show a female, “look at this handicap I bear and yet I still manage to stay alive and thrive, surely I must have some bomb genes” this has gone wrong in the human psyche and deep down on a subconscious level men that abuse drugs are trying to say, look I can take this drugs and still survivor, but yet they are harmful and usually people can’t thrive while on them. Also shown, in the kung fu masters of New Guinea (where author did much research and takes many of his stories from) that will drink a cup of kerosene to show that they still are strong and in control of their discipline. Male monkey have the largest testicles because of their frequent copulation and gorilla have the smallest of the primates because they seldom do, men, although much smaller in size have much larger penis and larger testicles then gorillas, as function of their sexual habits but also because of their machismo (like a male peacock).The Golden Age as people talk about in human society when man was at peace with nature and his environment is a myth. People say that until the industrial revolution of the 1800s people were doing no noticeable harm to the environment. Such posits are absurd if you look at fossils from continents where the first human remains can be found. Indians that came through the Americas left a blitzkrieg of animal destruction in their path, mainly of big mammals with no aversion to humans due to lack of contact. Wooly mammoths and saber tooth tigers are just a few. Australia had big mammals as well and so did Tasmania. New Zealand has some huge bird species like giant ostrichs that went extinct when the first people came there too. Also islands serve as great examples like Christmas island that supported a much greater civilization then has been recorded at one time as evidenced by the great stone faces, archaeology suggests that the forests had been cut by people until it was so bad that eventually every last tree of felled and the forest didn’t have a chance at replenishing, so the population died out. (to make canoes and rollers to move the stones)We are in a trouble unless people can learn from the mistakes of the past and make a change now to aver t certain doom of over population, natural resource scarcity, nuclear weapons, and pollution. Nothing learned and everything forgotten? Hopefully not."
264,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33017722-malcolm-little,5,"There’s just something about how Jared Diamond writes his explanatory prose that it clicks with me. Like myself, the polymath author loves delving deep into scientific subject matters that pique his interest. Granted, I only have a cursory interest in birds, but Third Chimpanzee is mostly about human evolution as described by the field of Biological Anthropology. I love digesting information on human evolution. And yes, I will be heaping lots of praise onto this book.Third Chimpanzee surprised me. It’s not only a treatise on the biological evolution of our species. It also delves into the evolution of our language trees, how our sexual taboos evolved with our sexual practices, and how agriculture adversely impacted our organism. The multifaceted aspects make the entire volume so rich in content, all of which is extremely well-researched for its time. Diamond is an accomplished & comprehensive academic, thus when he says he has “done lots of research” (an eye-rolling phrase often used these days to connote confirmation bias masturbation), he actually engages with empiricism and scrutiny of hypotheses. Diamond understands when evidence for a position is tenuous, and when it’s overwhelmingly strong. The aspects regarding the evolution of our organism certainly fall under the latter. Diamond does exceptional work in Third Chimpanzee of not only detailing the aspects from multiple angles, but he does so with such accessible flair of his prose that it’s a treat to read.I find Diamond, in each of his novels written for a general audience, intentionally adds something new and refreshing to capture the reader’s imagination and tickle their fancy. He doesn’t rehash arguments that have been discussed to death just because he needs to feed his ego by stressing what he considers a novel point of view. He doesn’t provide a plodding summary of the paradigms in the field, akin to a textbook in novel form that certain science communicators tend to sell. He doesn’t overextend the length of his novels so that it provides a comprehensive analysis that cannot be assailed. His taut analysis of the various topics can be assailed with criticisms. I for one was amused by his self-contradiction when it came to evaluating threats posed by potential extra-terrestrials: he previously described how we shouldn’t draw conclusions from a dataset of one (we have a dataset of zero for aliens), then goes on to assume advanced aliens will undoubtedly be detrimental to us because our species provides multiple instances of advanced civilizations devastating less advanced ones. It’s a rare intellectually lazy point by Diamond, and lacks nuance. Strangely enough, in his book Collapse, Diamond details how the advanced USA’s interactions with the less advanced feudal Japan in the later 1800s brought a mixed bag of good and bad for the Japanese. Nevertheless, it’s a minor quibble, and nobody searches out Diamond for expertise on Sociology.In its essentials, Third Chimpanzee is taut, compelling, and stimulating. Where it lacks in nuance, it makes up for in challenging ingrained perceptions of supposed superiority & uniqueness of geography, lifestyles, and behaviors of the creatures we call human being. It's interesting we don't refer to each other as primates, even though there are numerous valid arguments that we haven't abandoned much that defines the order. "
265,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11406523-ac,5,"Quoting directly from the book: Arthur Wichmann, a Dutch explorer and professor, penned in another context in 1912. Wichmann had devoted a decade of his life to writing a monumental three-volume treatise on the history of New Guinea's exploration. In 1,198 pages he evaluated every source of information about New Guinea that he could find, from the earliest reports filtering through Indonesia to the great expeditions of the Nineteenth and early Twentieth centuries. He grew disillusioned as he realized that successive explorers committed the same stupidities again and again: they showed the same unwarranted pride in overstated accomplishments, refused to acknowledge disastrous oversights, ignored the experience of previous explorers, repeated previous errors, and hence blundered into unnecessary suffering and death. Looking back on this long history, Wichmann predicted that future explorers would continue to repeat the same errors. The bitter last sentence that concluded Wichmann's last volume was, 'Nothing learned, and everything forgotten!'I felt that this book is an extension to Charles Darwin's ""Origin of Species"". While Darwin had focused his efforts on domesticated animals and other plant species, and then tried to strike a relation between them and the human race, this book, just takes the subject - ""Is the human species different from all the other animal and plant species living around us? And if yes, then how much?"" This is a no nonsense, to the subject account of all the stats involved in solving exactly the above questions. It traces back to the times, when the isolated human populations, suddenly came into contact with other human races, who were much technologically advanced, looked much different and who were totally unknown to them earlier. In today's date, u can compare it with something like an alien invasion of a continent. This point has been termed as ""first contact"". At this point of first contact, when these stone age men met Columbus's men, what happened, was just bound to happen. The stronger exterminated the weaker. And thats not just one instance. It has been happening all the time and all around the globe (its interesting that the third parties take so little interest to such genocides- which is also discussed in the book). The Tasmanian Aboriginies and the American Indians are the most well known out of these. But strangely still, NASA keeps sending radio signals into the space hoping that someone will discover us..and as our history tells us we all know what will happen after that. Lets just keep hoping that they never succeed. The book does not talk about whats right and whats wrong, it just states the statistics and gives you a platform from where you can for urself, judge whats to come. Towards the end of the book - chapter 17 and 18, Diamond discusses mostly about the number of species that the humans have exterminated and what impact this will have in the unimaginably near future. Infact its so near, that we are even scared to look...I read this book as an ""further reading"" to Sir William Golding's ""The Inheritors"" in which a Neanderthal tribe gets exterminated by the latest invading homo sapiens. For all those who have not yet read ""Sir Golding's book, I would also highly recommend it..."
266,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4154323-comrade-bazarov,4,"Jared Diamond is a professor at my alma mater UCLA, and he became famous outside the science world after the success of 'Guns, Germs and Steel', which apart from winning him Pulitzer, also made him a very wealthy man. This book was written several years before that mega-bestseller. 1992, to be exact. But it contains several ideas and themes that would later be borne more fully in GG&S. In fact, he even uses the phrase 'guns, germs and iron' later in the book when he touches upon the subject of conquests throughout the world. 'The Third Chimpanzee' is a very ambitious book. In it Diamond sets out to trace the long and complicated history of human evolution. The wonderful odyssey of Homo Sapiens from Australopithecus to Erectus to Neanderthalis is told with a great flourish. He examines this from several different angles: genetics, behavior, language, arts, war, agriculture, addiction, anthropology and genocide. The titular third chimpanzee refers to us humans. Using genetics Diamond argues that humans are so similar to chimpanzees that we should really be classed as the third chimpanzee species (or conversely, the two chimpanzee species should be classified under the Homo genus). Art, language, agriculture and war have been variously proposed as the characteristics that make humans unique and set them apart from apes and other animals. Diamond treats each of them separately, discusses possible precursor behaviors in various animals, and proposes mechanisms by which these features might have evolved to their more sophisticated forms that we see in humans today. He talks about bonobos using language, elephants making art (that was successfully used to dupe art critics into thinking some modernist painter painted), ants using fungi and aphids as 'farmers', gorillas murdering rival gorillas and other behaviors and links them to evolutionary advantages. He ends the book by discussing genocides throughout history and rings a note of alarm and caution over what he sees as rapid destruction of environment. Throughout the book he dispels numerous myths (such as the ancient civilization were environmentally friendly and were peaceful). He is a very persuasive writer and knows how to construct a convincing argument using hard science but without using too much jargon that would otherwise cause laypeople to lose interest. As a scientist in training myself, I find this ability admirable. Even though the book was written more than 20 years ago it doesn't feel outdated at all. Some of the genetic relations discussed at the beginning of the book have been more refined now (for e.g., bonobos, which are referred to as pygmy chimpanzees in the book, are now considered to be a separate species) and recent genetic analysis confirmed interbreeding and intermixing of Neanderthals with modern humans, which most likely led to the speedy extinction of the former. If you wish to embark on a fascinating journey through the sands of time and want to learn about language trees, kerosene-drinking martial artists of Indonesia, bowerbirds, micro-civilizations of New Guinea and Jackson Pollock-imitating monkeys, this is the book for you. Thoroughly invigorating read. "
267,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2751053-bakari,4,"The Third Chimpanzee is the second of Jared Diamond’s books I’ve read. The first being Guns, Germs, and Steel. Diamond. Diamond is a lucid writer who, for me, next to Karl Marx, seems to break down the origins of human behavior, political and social relations, and the consequences of our actions in ways we need to understand them.The Third Chimpanzee explains our over three million years of evolution from the pygmy chimpanzee as or closest relatives to the Homo Sapiens we are today. Many of the chapters of the book don’t seem connected, but basically Diamond tries to explain the evolutionary and biological origins of human behavior, from why and how we have sex, to how human language, art, and agriculture evolved, to the dire consequences and benefits of modern civilization and technology.Like a left or right leaning talk show host, Diamond is not about being neutral in his information and history. Though he’s a archeologist, he’s a scientist not afraid to support research with analysis and opinion. His last few chapters could be titled “Warnings,“ in which says: Until our own generation, no one had grounds to worry whether the human generation would survive our enjoy a planet worth living on. Ours is the first generation to be confronted with these questions about its children’s future. We devote much our lives to training our children to support themselves and to get along with other people. Increasingly, we’re asking ourselves whether all those efforts of our might be wasted.This jeremiad comes out of a study of nature, and human history and behavior which shows that we’re not always as rational and self-conscious as we might believe or hope. And because our existence on this planet is certainly not purposed and guided by some outside supreme being who has a place for us when we die, we best use books like The Third Chimpanzee to understand better who we are in relations to one another, and other species for whom must share this planet.This book is not a challenge to read. Like I said, Diamond is a very lucid and sometimes entertaining writer, but The Third Chimpanzee should be read in a study group or evolutionary biology course, because there’s so much information to absorb that it’s difficult to grasp it all if you’re merely reading rather than studying it. At some points Diamond can make almost sweeping generalizations about such topics as adultery and our use of drugs, while other times times he gets very detailed about the origins of human language. In reading this book straight through, I know there’s much that I could go back and read again to better understand. Nevertheless, I found The Third Chimpanzee pretty insightful, though it lacks a central thesis. It makes me interested in possibly reading his latest book, Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. The last few chapters of Chimpanzee seem to point to what Collapse is about. It’s a challenge to read books like Collapse because the issues addressed and explored are so huge and out of reach for most of us to deal with. But if we remain ignorant of past mistakes, we—as the adage goes— are doomed to repeat them."
268,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/671457-carin,4,"Fascinating book! A little dense so it took me a few days to read, but really interesting. In fact, since I started reading this book it seems like every other story I hear on the radio is about evolution, some are even on some of the exact topics in this book (which would be less weird if this book just came out but it was published in 1992.)What convinced me to read it was a tidbit about how one of the very, very few things that are unique to humans is our desire to have sex alone, in private. Most animals do it in public, surrounded by their peers. Sadly, Dr. Diamond doesn't have a really cool explanation beyond that it likely increases the bond between partners which is crucial for raising human children, as they take so friggin long to raise. But meanwhile, I got all sorts of other neat tidbits of info: why are ""bad boys"" so attractive? Do other animals use drugs? Was farming the beginning of the end for humans? How/when/where did we develop language? Basically this book isn't just about evolution as a fact. It's about the why behind it. Why did humans develop certain abilities, skills, or predilections and how were those things useful to us? Some are quite obvious such as domesticating animals, but others aren't such as murder. He looks at other species for answers which usually demonstrates how things we think are unique to humans really aren't, and it shows how truly useful ideas develop more than once. (Ants actually raise aphids like we raise cattle.) Another undercurrent throughout the books is how we have evolved to the point where we can now destroy ourselves and the whole world. Several times Dr. Diamond mentions his sons, and how he's worried about the future they're inheriting. Reading the book 18 years after publication gives these arguments both more weight and less. The likelihood of nuclear war has lessened, while climate change has accelerated. I would be very interested if they added a new afterward in a newer edition. I wonder what Dr. Diamond thinks of the world today. Interestingly, I came away from this book thinking how much like animals humans are (only 2% difference in DNA between us and chimpanzees). I told my friend T. about it, and she thought of the opposite - how much like humans animals are. (Yes, she is a big PETA supporter.) J. who recommended it was more interested in the history of the human being. It has a broad appeal and many people will get different things out of it.This book will stay with me for quite a while. Whenever I see someone smoking, guys getting into a fight, or a woman being hit on in a bar, I will think of different aspects of Dr. Diamond's theories, and how pretty much everything we do is in an unconscious effort to pass along our genes."
269,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,3,"I feel kinda bad giving this three stars, because I probably would have given it four or five stars if I read it in 1992, but some things just haven't held up. The style is a little egocentric, as when Jared Diamond feels entitled to contradict research based on his hunches and guesses to form his own theories in a field he's not really an expert in. It just feels a little long-winded and scattered in comparison to the sleek, concise pop-sci books being published today. Even Diamond's own hefty tome Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, which grew out of one of the chapters of The Third Chimpanzee, surpasses this earlier work in cohesiveness and is better grounded in research. However, I enjoyed the discussion of sexuality and the human life cycle in terms of evolution and natural selection - this was great content I haven't come across before. I also enjoyed the discussion of the Great Leap, in which humanity was transformed into the species we are today by the development of language (according to Diamond) and the explanation of how Homo sapiens differs from Neanderthals. And I really do appreciate the books conclusion: Diamond's earnest plea for humanity to learn from our past mistakes and preserve our environment. It's well-argued and passionate. But again, many of these research areas have advanced significantly since 1992 and I found myself feeling like it was worthless to read in this book about, for example, DNA and genetic sequencing. And what really rubbed me the wrong way was Diamond's high-horse moralizing about ""drug abuse"". Michael Pollan has a far more open-minded and interesting take on why humans have always sought out mind-altering substances in his fantastic book The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World. Diamond, writing at the height of the ""War on Drugs,"" would lump crack addicts in with Native Americans who used ayahuasca or peyote for spiritual journeys in his discussion of ""drug abuse"" as self-destructive behavior. From an evolutionary perspective, I believe that altering our consciousness to achieve new perspectives is a fascinating human behavior that is not purely self-destructive. In some cultures, in fact, it is seen as self-instructive or self-constructive. Perhaps this could better explain this trait's survival as we evolved."
270,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14821636-andrew-fish,3,"Human beings are remarkable creatures, unique on Earth, some believe unique in the universe. But what makes us what we are? Why have we developed art and science when other species seem not to? And are we unique in our negative capacities - drug abuse, war and environmental destruction? Diamond looks at the evolution of mankind, the third chimpanzee, with particular reference to those traits.The only trouble with reading books like this in our age is that misanthropy seems to be the fashion. Seeing mankind as a venal, destructive parasite without redeeming features is the cause celebre of the modern world. This lends a somewhat bitter taste to this as with many other volumes. Fortunately, it's more toward the back of the book, but still it's there. Diamond tells a fascinating story about what various forms of evidence can tell us about the rise of man and his spread across the world, but his biases tend to make him blind to other views. So, for example, when he projects the rate of species destruction in the future, he treats the rate as at best linear, at worst proportionate to the human population - it never occurs to him that as societies have become richer they have become more concerned about environmental issues, something which explains the much lower rate of species extinction in Europe in recent centuries. Similarly, when claiming that hunter-gatherer societies eat just as well as agricultural ones, he misses the point that agricultural societies free up large chunks of their populace to do other things - including writing books about how terrible we all are. Here and there Diamond also grabs the odd ""fact"" out of thin air, such as that sexual inequality is a product of agricultural societies. After chapters where he has explained in some detail why human females are unique in going through menopause, it seems jarring to throw out a statement like that without either proof or any kind of theory as to why it might be so, which means it comes across as a desperate attempt to ram in a point from a list he had accumulated before writing the book.All the negativity aside, the book reads well and gives an interesting insight into where we come from. It's not exhaustive - I'm still looking for a book which explains our sexual relations in anthropological terms, for example - but as a starting point it's worth considering."
271,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,5,"Jared Diamond has lived a fascinating life and has clearly enjoyed applying his curiosity and experience to the big questions. What would a physiologist with a side interest in ornithology have to say about the past, present and future of the human race? And what does this have to do with the tendency of humans to take drugs? In this book, Diamond writes a series of extended abstracts for the books he wrote later, such as collapse and guns, germs and steel. So. While a huge amount of ground is covered, most of the chapters are in fact relatively brief, but the span itself requires some perseverance.The main gist of the book is what makes humans form their closest genetic cousins the chimps. Yet genes seem to have a minor part to play, compared to the cultural innovations that have occurred. I liked the description of humanities gauntlet, the critical period during which language, tools and art were primed for the diaspora which saw Asia, Europe and Australia populated, and their major megafauna wiped out. This tendency toward environmental destruction, and destruction of our own species, is covered in later chapters, as extrapolation to the fate of our species is examined. This stuff is compelling reading. It is not heavily referenced, making it readable for lay readers, but the seriousness of Diamond's theses suggests that this is perhaps required (the extensive suggested reading doesn't seem to feel adequate somehow). The broad scope of diamonds interest makes verification for the lay reader difficult: where I have read on related topics, such as Tim Flannery's Future Eaters, the conclusions seem to agree (I also assume these guys know each other), but there are so many areas to check up on, I am left needing to believe his version is reliable. I am happy that everything seems internally consistent.Given that Diamond is still publishing - I received his most recent book on what we can learn from indigenous peoples for a recent birthday - I am happy to assume he is on to something. Either that, or it's a great way to read across the breadth of questions and hypotheses about the intriguing journey humanity has taken to get here."
272,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7029980-katie-doing-dewey,4,"Summary: This was a fascinating book that, despite being older, included some new information and made me think about things in new ways.Happy Darwin Day everyone! Since today is the anniversary of the publication of The Origin of Species, it seemed like the perfect day to talk about Jared Diamond's The Third Chimpanzee. The third chimpanzee, of course, is us and in this book Diamond explores the things we have in common with (the other two) chimps and the things that we typically think make us unique.In addition to the obvious topical connection, this was the perfect book for Darwin Day because of the author's dedication to answering even potentially touchy questions with science. As the author points out, answering questions such as why Europeans invaded the Americas, rather than the other way around, doesn't have to lead to racist answers. It can, in fact replace racist assumptions with far more politically correct, scientifically accurate, fascinating facts.Happily, even though this book was published in 1991 and sometimes posed open questions I'm know we've answered now, I learned some new things. The author also did a great job sharing information I knew in ways that made me think about things differently. For instance, although it's become common knowledge that chimps are our most closely related species, I thought it was interesting to think about the fact that we're their most closely related species too.The author did occasionally came across to me as trying really hard to be politically correct but falling just a little short on issues of gender, race, or, in one case, weight. In general though, I was impressed by how well the author handled the touchy subjects he addressed. He also did what I thought was a great job with the science, explaining concepts clearly and engagingly. Overall, I'd recommend Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel over the The Third Chimpanzee, but this was also an interesting read.This review was originally posted on Doing Dewey"
273,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,5,"We human beings share 98 percent of our genes with chimpanzees. Yet humans are the dominant species on the planet - having founded civilizations and religions, developed intricate and diverse forms of communication, learned science, built cities, and created breathtaking works of art - while chimps remain animals concerned primarily with the basic necessities of survival. What is it about that two percent difference in DNA that has created such a divergence between evolutionary cousins? In this fascinating, provocative, passionate, funny, endlessly entertaining work, renowned Pulitzer Prize-winning author and scientist Jared Diamond explores how the extraordinary human animal, in a remarkably short time, developed the capacity to rule the world . . . and the means to irrevocably destroy it. Diamond explores concepts relating to the animal origins of human behavior, including cultural characteristics and those features often regarded as particularly unique to humans. It further explores the question of how Homo sapiens came to dominate its closest relatives, such as chimpanzees, and why one group of humans (Eurasians) came to dominate others (Indigenous peoples of the Americas, for example).One of the interesting things I learned from this book: there is a field of study called ""Linguistic Paleoentology"". It is a linguistic and subsidiary historical discipline that uses linguistic data to derive information about the history and geographical location of the speakers of a particular language. Linguistic paleontology also aims to obtain information about the material and spiritual culture of the speakers in the preliterary period. Overall, this book is a fascinating read and recommended to anyone interested in the anthropological history of our species. Over five major sections, Diamond educates the reader on the core issues of evolutionary biology, explores these issues as they related to timeless moral questions, and examines the role our biology plays in determining our future."
274,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33646931-987643467881,2,"The book was a bit too anecdotal for my liking; there were too many personal stories and opinions in a book that I assumed would be about science/history. Even though there were some interesting ideas and points brought up, they were done in a really conversational tone (which is often a good thing, but that I didn't like in this book), and lines like the ones below made me lose trust in the author around half way through the book.My wife and I have been barraging my sons from early infancy onwards with grammatically correct English questions as well as statements [...] Today's samples from Max and Joshua include 'Where it is? , 'What that letter is? , 'What the handle can do? , and 'What you did with it?'Just imagine savage hunters, exhausted from searching for nuts and chasing wild animals, suddenly gazing for the first time at a fruit-laden orchard or a pasture full of sheep. How many milliseconds do you think it took those hunters to appreciate the advantages of agriculture?On 26 June I was sitting in a Boeing 747 jet, reading the magazines and catching up on the wonders of Western civilization. [...] I leafed through the first magazine. It fell open to a page with a photograph of a tough-looking man on horseback chasing cows, and the name of a brand of cigarette in large letters below. The American in me knew what the photograph was about, but part of me was still in the jungle, looking at that photo naively. That proximity of wolves and sheep spelt T-R-O-U-B-L-E.I think I sort of understand what he might have been trying to do with the book, I just didn't enjoy it. Many points were repeated several times in different ways (often in an emotive style, with populist phrases) and there were so many different topics covered in such a fast and loose way that it was hard to get anything too meaningful from it. It did serve as a great book for me to find other things to read about though, so I guess that was good. "
275,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4761355-andy-wixon,3,"Anyone who's read Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel will know roughly what to expect from his first book: big, wide-ranging, eclectic ideas all drawn into a discussion of a single theme.Should you be wondering, the 'Third Chimpanzee' of the title is Man, and the book is an attempt to look at our evolutionary history in the hope it will shed some light on our otherwise-mystifying tendencies towards self-destruction.The book is logically laid-out and developed and most of the individual chapters are fascinating and could stand alone, although the further Diamond strays from his own field the more questionable some of his assumptions and conclusions seem: particularly odd is the section on SETI research, in which he concludes a) that civilisations like our own are likely to destroy themselves before developing interstellar travel and b) any 'flying saucers' (the author's - revealing - choice of words, not mine) are likely to be crewed by extraterrestrial analogues of ourselves - ie. space-going conquistadors and destroyers of less advanced cultures. They can't both be true...As the book progresses from evolutionary science - which I would say was very nearly required reading for any budding SF writers trying to develop their own alien cultures - to a study of the ecological impact of civilisation, the tone grows perceptibly more serious, and towards the end it does seem like the book is going to become a full-blown jeremiad. The grounds for optimism Diamond ultimately presents seem rather trifling given the weight of evidence he's already produced, showing what an essentially violent and destructive creature a modern human being is.Some of the key arguments of Guns, Germs and Steel get rehearsed here, but there's enough new and different material here to make this a worthwhile read in its own right. Not the most cheery thing I've ever read, but credible and eye-opening nevertheless. "
276,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/914349-arthur,4,"This is the launching point for Diamond's other great, better known books. The early part of the book provides a quick description of human evolution, and explains the title of the book. The chimpanzees are our closest relatives within the animal kingdom, and according to Diamond, an unbiased taxonomy would call us just another species of chimpanzee. The first species is the common chimpanzee, the second is the pygmy chimpanzee, which is now known as the bonobo, and the third species is now called homo sapiens (erroneously, according to Diamond). After giving a quick review of human evolution, he describes the various differences between humans and the other chimpanzees. He tries to explain the evolutionary causes for the differences between humans and the other apes in sexual behavior and anatomy (which he explores later in a book called Why Sex is Fun). He then introduces the other topics that he devotes so much attention to later. He anticipates Guns, Germs, and Steel by discussing the various geographical factors that gave Eurasia such an advantage over America. He then anticipates Collapse by discussing how some societies have abused their environment and thereby caused their own demise.Although Diamond's later books cover these themes in much more depth, The Third Chimpanzee shows how Diamond relates all these themes to each other. Diamond does not yet have a book that explores human evolution in more depth (except for Why Sex is Fun, which is about the evolution of sexuality), but there are many other books about evolution. But for the other topics, Diamond's later books are much more focused and detailed. But The Third Chimpanzee is still a worthwhile read for anyone who has already read his other books, or for anyone who isn't ready to explore these themes at such depth."
277,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/149351-ben,3,"Having previously read Jared Diamond's more famous Guns Germs and Steel, I can't help but reflect on this book in comparison. I gave that book five stars and this book three, but that may say more about the order in which I read them than the books themselves, for in truth they're remarkably similar. The Third Chimpanzee starts out in a slightly different vein, talking more about early human evolution and our divergence from common and pygmy chimps (making us the third chimp species), then shifts over into various human societies' destruction of their environments over the years. It's this latter portion that Diamond later expanded into Guns Germs and Steel and Collapse. Though I understand Diamond is trying to show how our genes have led to some of our more disastrous traits (genocide, destruction of the environment, etc.), it feels a little disjointed. I like Guns Germs and Steel's more focused approach, but for anyone who likes Diamond's other books enough, who wants to read a slightly shorter book to understand his points, or who has a thing for chimpanzees, this book's for you."
278,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,3,"After reading some of Jared Diamond's other books (such as Collapse and his most famous, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies), I picked up this older one, from the nineties.This book discusses why humans are so different from the other Hominidae (chimps/bonobos, orangutans and gorillas), and in which ways we are so similar; starting of with the tired factoid that we share 98% or our DNA with them (it seems the number is a bit less though, 96% or so. Cfg. a cucumber, which is 96% water -- those few % do matter!)Diamond goes through many different fields (paleontology, linguistics, biology, sociology etc.), and the main conclusion is there are non-human precursors to just about any human behavior, but that the quantitative difference is so big that it becomes qualitative. And since it's a Diamond book, there are plenty of anecdotes about New Guinea.The books is interesting, but a bit outdated (e.g., non-Africans do have Neanderthal DNA); a more serious complaint that also applies to Guns, Germs and Steel is that the conclusions that Diamond draws are partly based on what he would like to be true, stretching the evidence a bit too far. Or focusing in on some interesting details, but that have little to do with the subject of the book, such as a lengthy discussion of the origins of Indo-European languages (also a part where Diamond does perhaps a bit too much 'original research')Anyhow, despite that, interesting book."
279,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1322312-lauren,1,"I can't honestly put this book on the ""read"" shelf, but that's where it will have to live until I can bear to pick it up again. That time may never come. This pop science jibber-jabber had me sailing along with it, going along with the egregious jumps over nuanced scientific discovery in the name of calling it ""pop."" Typical of books of this genre - the complex data is always glossed over and we're left with the ""big picture.""Then I finished the first chapter. Mr. Diamond decided to get into it with me right then and there, in the concluding paragraphs of his first 20 pages. At first he presents thought-provoking questions about the divisions between humans and animals - where those lines are drawn, why we draw them, what criteria we have used to divide ourselves from our animal kin, etc. THEN he proceeds to condemn scientific research on chimpanzees because humans, as it turns out, are the third species of chimpanzees (title, duh). Not only that, but research on any other non-human primate is not up for grabs either. Now this will probably make me a target for animal rights activists or zealots of some kind, but some of the greatest discoveries in medicine and science were made because of animals. Some of the humblest discoveries as well. I can agree to disagree, but it would have been nice for Diamond to have saved his soapbox wallop for later in the book. Lull me in with a false sense of security, even for a hundred pages, before you pull out the lightning flashes and thunder rumbles about the great modern sin of animal research.I hope Jared Diamond never gets brain cancer. He probably won't ever want to get a headache again either because the best pain relievers were tested first on animals, including primates. Sigh."
280,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26634995-doris-jean,5,"A wonderful profound and wide-ranging deep-thinking book. Humans are genetically so close to chimpanzees that objectively we are them. We differ most from chimpanzees in sexual behavior, sexual traits and sexual physiology. Some other differences unique to the human animal seem to be language, art, addiction and maybe genocide, although some of these also are seen in non-humans.I loved the overview of the recent past, from the end of the last ice age when culture escalated. The Cro-Magnons may have genocided the Neanderthals as migrations out of Africa exploded over the earth. The effects of agriculture and domesticated animals on humans were insightful theories. Humans in the Eurasian steppes had the advantage of domesticated horses and demolished other conquered cultures because of their horses. Dogs have evolved into psychological geniuses who are now the masters of humans who nurture and love them equally with their human children.Only herd animals can be domesticated and only a few of them. The author presents brilliant fresh ideas of how geography affected human domestication of animals and also of plants. Domestic agriculture presented the opportunity for government (dictator, king) to invent itself along with taxes which was impossible under a hunter-gatherer society. There were good ideas about different societies and some of the advantages and disadvantages of stable agricultural societies versus mobile forager-hunter societies.The author has presented the effect of geography on culture as no one else before. He has a different genre of mind which is refreshing and intriguing. I loved his ideas and his writing style which kept me continually desirous of picking up his book at every opportunity, in spite of its thought-provoking power. "
281,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32788699-deir-zahrani,5,"This is the spirit in which I dedicate this book to my young sons and their generations. If we learn from the past that I have traced, our future may be brighter than that of the other two chimpanzeesAs a person who doesn't have any evolutionary biology background, in other word, a total amateur, I enjoyed reading this book. They decided to use an easy to understand language to explain complicated things without making it sound dumb. They explained every bit of information to its smallest terminology. After all, the book was made for young people. It's written on the cover.It managed to make me do some retrospective thinking toward what I've done with my lifestyle that actually had a major impact toward the environment. They explained about how close are we to our related species, and what exactly made us so different than them. They also told me how catastrophic the impact of the development of our civilization so far. The extinction of gigantic animal in several places, until their descendants finally evolved the fear of our species as a way to survive. How brutal was that?I made bad reviews, I know. It's so easy to impress me, but this book literally made me want to buy and read another book about evolution."
282,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18346013-yasser-mohammad,4,"An enjoyable book.Diamond is charting a nice story for the rise of homo-sapiens (third chimpanzee in his terminology). There are some outdated information in parts of the book:For example, it is now well accepted that 3% of human DNA for people from outside Africa is Neanderthal's DNA while Diamond dismisses any possibility of inter-breeding between the new sapiens (cro-magnons) and neanderthals.Another example is the certainty about how did early sapiens who arrived to the America's arrive (through a bridge between Siberia and Alaska) and then spread (on foot using a corridor in the ice sheets that runs north-south which was open around 11000years ago). Both of these points are contested.Concerning the origins, there are rival theories based on the idea that ancient western Europeans could have crossed the ice-fringed Atlantic by boat or that Melanesians could have sailed across the Pacific to South America, and then migrated across Central America to colonise North America. The recent findings of a child with western-European DNA in Siberia may also mean that the origin of the hunters who crossed to America may have not been only east-Asian but with some western-European people in the mix. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/sci...Moreover, there are some theories that suggest that the passing from north to south happened along the shore mainly and that early Americans were naval people.Nevertheless, these points (and the few others) did not affect the main message of the book."
283,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1679771-eliza,5,"This book is clearly now a bit dated. But even so, it's not so dated that it's message is invalid. I learned so much from this book. Every chapter I started out with my curiosity piqued to discover how ""human"" characteristics really aren't so human after all. By the end of each chapter I was fascinated by the extent of human behavior that's demonstrated in animals, and the evolutionary benefits of these actions. We're not so unique, us humans. Monkeys have a primitive form of language, bowerbirds have art, ants have a sort of agriculture, nesting birds cheat on their ""marriages"". I also found it predictable & understandable that exotics like pigs & reindeer introduced suddenly to unsuspecting remote islands within decades completely destroyed their resource base & were left starving w/ nothing remaining to eat. It's not just us that promoted the extinction of 100s of species, but the rats we brought w/ us, which small mammals & birds were completing unprepared for in for example New Zealand and Hawaii. But at the same time it is our fault for accelerating this environmental degradation process nearing the point of no return. We introduce exotics, deforest, hunt, develop, take over.Jared Diamond is optimistic about the human ability to change all of their actions & move in the direction of stability w/ the Earth. He has faith that politicians worldwide will put aside their personal desires for wealth & power to look long-term at the bigger picture."
284,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15843630-stephen-dawson,3,"I didn't think this as good as Guns Germs and Steel, and in places it is now starting to show its age, having first been published 20 years ago. The author has lots of interesting views to put across, though I didn't find too much that was novel. At times he reminded me of someone giving a PowerPoint presentation, frequently telling us what he is going to tell us later rather than just getting on with it.In an odd approach, Diamond is boldly suggesting that humans should be regarded as the third chimpanzee (fair enough as a position, particularly one selected deliberately to provoke) but why then does he generally fail to include humans in either apes or animals, both of which are a much easier sell and, in context, pretty uncontroversial, even default positions?For a scientist, he is also a bit too keen on making assertions that things are obvious, or listing some evidence which tends to suggest something and then stating that something as a fact. His boldness in asserting that the atomic bomb attacks on Japan were genocide, without real discussion, is a view that is not unique to him, but I found it rather removed focus from his more general and illuminating discussion on humans' genocide and similar patterns among other animals.These niggles rather detract from what is otherwise an interesting and broad overview of humans and our similarities with and differences from other animals."
285,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,5,"The best way that I can describe this book is that it puts human beings in their appropriate context. What I mean by that is that Diamond is adamant about questioning all the ways in which we have claimed to be a unique unprecedented develop on the face of the earth. This can be appreciated from the get go as seen from his title, which foreshadows the brilliant argument by which he shows that biologically speaking we are more alike to the two subspecies of chimpanzees than they are to gorillas, our next closest kin. It is in this vein that Diamond continues to explore the animal precursors to almost all the things by which we claimed to be unique: language, tools, art, murder, etc. He similarly advocates for the importance of studying how we fit into the history of the world in order to avoid the present course to collapse to which we seem to be heading. He analyses the spread of humans, the key points of our evolution that put us into a course of world conquest and the difficult relationship we’ve had with our environment from the beginning. In all these discussions Diamond not only gives ample evidence but at the same time maintains the interest of the reader, even through some of the most gruesome aspects of our tendency for genocide. I cannot recommend this book highly enough to every thinking human being as it is vital for our understanding of our own place in the planet. "
286,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1281368-don,3,"The author is one of the better known anthropologist writers (Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies). Here is address how humans are similar and different to the animals the are closest to our DNAs.While secularists read Diamond like gospel, Christians who see a role for God in the origin of man can still benefit from Diamond's knowledge. Be forewarned that you will learn way more about chimps and other primates than you probably ever wanted to, unless you have a clinical curiosity for their mating habits. Diamond does lean green but he is not as dogmatic as some secularists who seem to feel the earth would be better of without any humans.As an aside to this book, Diamond is big on evolution and as to be expected ignores the presence of God in the creation and development of mankind. However he fails to address the fact that civilizations that embrace secular humanism are among the worst for mankind as we can see from the disasters of Stalin's Russia and Mao's China. Even modern post-religious Europe is a culture that is not sustainable as proven by their self-selected negative population. The evolution of man has worked best in societies who embrace Christian values. Lacking this, thing go downhill. Moral relativism makes for a poor foundation for the long term prosperity of society."
287,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7209023-gavin,0,"I haven't had the pleasure of reading GGAS yet, so I can't use that as a Jared Diamond touchstone like other reviewers here have, but I found The Third Chimpanzee to be a generally well-constructed, readable synthesis, even if it's a bit over-broad. Although its years do show at times (e.g. in the chapter on nuclear warfare, an arena that has shifted rather significantly since publication), most of the material cited seems to hold up pretty well.Diamond is at his encyclopedic best in his sweeping anthropological surveys — which, fortunately, comprise most of the book. It's only when Diamond divagates from this territory that the book becomes problematic. In the section on sexual behavior, for example, he (among other dubious instances of, well, prudishness) cites a cosmo-mag survey (or sales numbers, I don’t recall) to prove that large penis size could not possibly have arisen from female sexual selection. Later, he purports to know that the search for intelligent extraterrestrial life will be inevitably fruitless because somehow self-annihilation (nuclear or otherwise) is in his view the inexorable destiny of all intelligent life — and yet, strangely, he doesn't ever earnestly apply this same fatalism to humanity.Despite bewildering arguments like these that occasionally gurgle up, the book is great. The linguistic anthropology in the latter chapters is particularly fascinating."
288,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1266826-lisa,4,"I love Jared Diamond's writing. Every time I read one of his books, it resonates so clearly that I can't help but enjoy his thoughts tremendously. In The Third Chimpanzee, Diamond ranges widely in his thoughts of this odd third chimpanzee (us) and sometimes goes in rather unexpected places. Some highlights include how testes correlate with number of partners in sex and how public/private sex is, and the arts are a social method of sexual selection. The migration of some of human kind can be studied by the transformation of proto-Indo-European language, but he includes a fervent discussion of the loss of human languages as the few powerful languages consolidate their power and their populations on the world.He includes wonderful comments on genocide in chimps and genocide in humans across time. How we have permission to kill ""them,"" but we must attempt to refrain from killing ""us.""Most disjointed was his theories of life on other worlds, which covers a part of a chapter. What is most interesting is the echoes of his other writings you can hear in this book. Echoes in the sense that it doesn't matter if the book came before or after this 2006 publication. His themes have remained constant: Ecological collapse, success of an area and the people controlling that area based on resources, and domesticate-able plant and animal species."
289,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8952174-mirrani,4,"The beginning of this book was well written and fascinating to read. There were actually witty remarks that had me amused in parts, which you wouldn't expect from something so scientific. The explanations for how humans developed behaviors and the comparisons with chimps and other animals in order to help with those explanations were easy to associate with and really helped with the taking in of the information. The text didn't treat the readers like award winning scientists, but it didn't dumb everything up for the ignorant either.By the last 100 pages of the book I became frustrated, however. As long as the book was actually doing what was expected of it and comparing us to chimps and explaining our evolution, I was content, but once it switched to how we were destroying our environment, it became less of ""this is why we do what we do"" to ""this is how the demise of the world will come about."" There wasn't even really a connection to humans beyond that we killed things. I'm not saying it wasn't well written, but it simply wasn't as mind-catching the way the first 200 pages were.Definitely worth the read for the amazing revelations put forward about human nature and the ways of some animals. I know that I will forever have friends check the lengths of their middle fingers against their spouses from this point onward."
290,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15549757-scott-erickson,4,"The first section of this book (on human evolution) was an enjoyable refresher of my physical anthropology courses in college. The second section was a bit more difficult for me to get through, however, simply because Diamond's language was so incredibly heteronormative. I realize that my objections are purely semantic, and I actually found much of the material to be quite informative, but I can only read phrases like ""...of the opposite sex"" so many times before I start to get annoyed. Indeed, Diamond's only mention of non-heterosexual activity was to illustrate the promiscuity of bonobos! It would have been nice if he would have at least acknowledged that not all humans are driven by the instinct to reproduce with members of the opposite sex in order to pass along their genes.That being said, I'm glad that I decided to stick with it, because I had relatively no qualms with the rest of the book (although I didn't buy into his myopic theory about why people use drugs), and found it to be quite enlightening. In fact, I am now hoping to read all of Diamond's books at some point (with the possible exception of his book on sex, which I suspect would be even more heteronormative than this one). Over all, this book provided a substantial amount of food for thought, and if it weren't for the aforementioned issues, I would have happily given it five stars."
291,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7231894-chris-branch,4,"Just got around to reading this earlier Diamond book, and since it was published in '92, it's understandably a bit dated. Notably the debate about whether modern humans have Neanderthal DNA was still unresolved (we do). It's no less than the entire past and future of humanity that he attempts to address here, and it's not surprising that he felt the need to more deeply explore some aspects of that wide ranging topic in later books, so this book introduces and covers some of the material that is further expanded upon in Guns, Germs, and Steel and Collapse. In particular, his theory on the biogeographic factors that were the driving force behind the success of some civilizations and the failure of others is well-stated and convincing. As usual, his clear explanations and engaging writing are impressive, and I learned a few things I had not come across in other books along these lines. So I enjoyed this one quite a bit in spite of minor issues, though I'd recommend also reading the above-mentioned follow-ups for a more in depth treatment of this fascinating subject matter."
292,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1639163-eingram,0,"Not as good as Guns, Germs, and Steel, but still worth a read...probably. I didn't feel like I was learning awesome new things the whole time, as I did with the other. And some of the same ground is covered, or maybe I've covered it elsewhere.Eh, it's just not as well written, and it was published earlier so we'll have to cut him some slack. His conclusions don't follow as logically from his explanations, he repeats whole phrases from earlier chapters, like a textbook trying to drill a concept into your head or (more likely) like someone who hasn't read the previous chapter recently. Also, he picks out some good and bad human traits that (supposedly) separate us from other animals and discusses them. The bad ones are things like genocide and drug addiction. Not exactly equally bad, are they? I actually folded down a couple of pages to mark odd uses of words, like ""lacks"" as a noun, but I'm not going to look them up now.Fittingly, this review is badly organized.P.S. I just checked his wikipedia page for some fact and found that, between Guns, Germs, and Steel and The Third Chimpanzee, he wrote a book called Why is Sex Fun?"" I think the answer is ""So you'll keep doing it"", but there's bound to be more to it than that. Intriguing."
293,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7543137-peter,3,"This book is full of fascinating information, yet I give it only 3 stars (""liked it"") because the author it too scattered. It feels like he wanted to write at least 2 different books (which he subsequently did). I think his primary argument that the characteristics that make us unique arguably have animal precursors (e.g. rudimentary language of the vervets). However, his prose wanders. For example, when discussing agriculture, he points out that New World ants have indeed a system of agriculture, domesticating both plants and animals. Nevertheless, he then strays and devotes several pages to the argument whether agricultural or hunter-gather societies are better off. This latter section, though interesting, can be better discussed elsewhere. I also don’t understand the need for the chapter on other life in outer space. Sometimes, too, his writing is hyperbolic (e.g. progressed at an infinitely slow rate) and his logic unconvincing (e.g. saying that because we can estimate Malaysia has lost half of its fish species, we can assume the same percentage of loss in other species). I would prefer more counterarguments or at least footnotes along the way. Otherwise, it is an enjoyable book with important lessons for all of us. I look forward to reading Collapse in the near future."
294,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9127414-samantha,5,"Even as someone who knows we share all but something like 1.6% of our genetic material with chimpanzees, and as someone who isn't floored by the notion that by some taxonomic standards we could basically considered a particularly smart kind of chimpanzee, I still found a lot of thought-provoking and controversial material in this book. It concerns many of the facets of what differences that 1.6% makes--what makes us human. From Diamond's perspective our abilities to cooperate and communicate, to transmit knowledge across generations, is at times outweighed by our less savory characteristics: namely, our enjoyment of torturing each other, our propensity for drug abuse, and our (unprecedented in other animals) tendency to destroy our environment. He shows how even many of those characteristics have physiological roots in our animal brains. The chapters on language and art were some of the most fascinating, discussing whether animals can be said to create ""art"" or have ""language"" in instances where they appear to do so, and in the case of language in humans whether there is a hard-wired propensity for using grammatical rules (as evidenced in the similar grammatical structures of ""creole"" languages.) The range of perspective covered here is amazing."
295,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59855438-coen,4,"The only answer to why we've come together as a society is our big brains and our ways of sharing our knowledge on to the next person, but if science proves that we are 98% chimpanzee what are the differences from our ways and the ways of chimpanzees. Jared Diamond has created another wonderful book that is not too complicated to read but shows how complicated and explains thoroughly how in depth evolution is. The author shows the differences between man and ape caveman and human etc. The reader makes it very realistic in his language, such as comparing teens self destructive behavior such as alcohol to birds who grow long tails which could slow them down to the point of getting caught and eaten. This book shows why women live longer than men. This book makes the reader think differently about the human race in general by grabbing the readers attention and making us remember life as it was ten thousand years ago compared to us now completely oblivious to surviving. Anyone who does not know all they want about human society or wants a book I suppose no one but biologists know prove to any ordinary person thirsty for knowledge that there is more to our evolutions from our so similar ancestors."
296,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/305007-george,3,"A definite mixed bag. I LOVED his subsequent ""Guns, Germs, and Steel,"" but this one is far less compelling, partly b/c it seems cobbled together from disparate articles at times, but primarily b/c his reductionist tendencies are far more in evidence, and far more offensive, since he's dealing with areas of the human experience that are far less amenable to scientific (or even philosophical) reduction (""Guns"" deals with the science behind the rise of civilizations and the West's bloody triumph in that ""race""; this book is more about the science behind general human phenomena like sex, murder, art, etc.). At some point maybe I'll detail some of the book's good stuff (and there are definitely a lot of diamonds in the rough here), but for now I'd say that it doesn't add much to the imposing legacy of ""Guns"" or to the study of human behavior in general (though it's an interesting launching point for lay folk like me, I reckon). I suspect the follow-up to ""Guns"" (""Collapse"") is a better example of this chimp book's strong suits (i.e., the later chapters that discuss why civilizations collapse, particularly from an environmental standpoint), and I may well read it as a result."
297,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1844493-atenea-nike,2,"So far it's not really doing anything much for me. For one thing it incurs in one of my pet peeves: the author talks about evolution in a misleading way that can make the layman believe that evolution happens with a design in mind, so to speak, thus substituting the designing God of creationism with an unknown force of nature called Evolution that does exactly the same. Evolution does not have a design in mind - mutations happen, some of thsoe mutations are better at leaving copies of themselves so those mutated traits get passed along to the next generations. And so on and so forth, blindly, for thousands and thousands and THOUSANDS of years. Obviously the writer knows it but he resorts to simplificate his exposition and writing in ways that can be highly misleading to unsuspecting readers. Aside from that I fail to see any original ideas in the book, except for his allegations that chimps ought to be better treated because we share so much of our genome with them. He might have a point there. The rest of the content is not new to me and not particularly well written (but I am reading him in spanish so this last part might be the translator's fault)"
298,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178754-kate,4,"A good book, and worth reading. It mostly discusses two characteristics the author views as uniquely human: the tendency to commit genocide, and the tendency to wipe out one resource base after another when moving from place to place. The basic message seems to be that humans aren't doing anything new, and haven't become more evil over the past ten thousand years or so, but that our numbers and technology have advanced to the point where we absolutely must curb these inborn behaviors now. The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature covered a lot of the early evolutionary stuff in more detail, and Diamond's own Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed expands a lot on the environmental destruction, but this book is a very manageable and interesting introduction to the same material. I definitely recommend it."
299,0060845503,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26759794-diego-pagura,3,"If you, like me, approached this book looking for an explanation of our evolution from apes to our current condition; you may find yourself with mixed feelings. You can easily divide this book in two parts, the chapters that are great, easy to read involving the evolution process and the chapters that are related to Diamond opinion on different subjects (human genocides, nuclear war, sex, etc).On the first ones I really enjoyed is explanation on the newest discoveries and theories about where we come from and how we evolved as we did, why agriculture and animal domestication flourished in the old world but lingered in the new world and finally the explanation of our cause in the extinctions of the big mammals from the past. This is the part that I really liked and hoped to see more in this book. The second part is more difficult to read and felt more like his own personal opinion on the reasons and possible outcomes of our way of life. Although nuclear holocaust is an interesting topic this is not why I started reading this book. Having said that, it is a really good book, with interesting theories and very accessible to non specialists."
