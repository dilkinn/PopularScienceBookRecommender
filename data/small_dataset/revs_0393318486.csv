0,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3593962-kalliope,4,"This morning while swimming I thought of this book. And I thought also of a conversation I had recently with a friend. We were talking about human consciousness.Swimming is a perfect thing to do when thinking about consciousness. While sliding along the water we are deprived of many things, in particular of the full powers of our senses. There is very little to hear; smellandtaste are also kept at bay; what we can look at is reduced to a wall and a straight line on the floor of the pool; and the pleasant and refreshing water assuages our touch. So, even if we stop being ourselves since we are not in our natural medium, we can however only be ourselves. Consciousness runs galore.I actually read this book a while ago, and I did so also some time after I interrupted my studies in neurobiology. I had to stop because of personal reasons. But I remember two things clearly about this book.The first is that It was an excellent summary of what was known about the brain when the book was published, and which I had been studying in more detailed textbooks. Alas, I have not kept with further advances, but my guess is that it is still a very relevant read today.The study is very well structured as a survey of the various considerations on how the mind works, and it is written in a very engaging style. It is also engaging because it addresses our immediate and commonsensical concerns about how our mind works. Why we forget, how do we recognize faces, what falling in love may entail, what it is to laugh.. etc.The best part was the chapter on vision, may be because to me that is one of the most magical powers of our brain. How it can process what our light detecting organs perceive, and create vision in its rear part is a phenomenon that defies our senses.Pinker does not deal with language in this book because he devoted another book, The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Languagewhich I have not read yet. He designed them to complement each other.The second thing I remember is the conclusion. After examining scientifically the various abilities of the brain, Pinker finally gets to the idea of Consciousness, the most perplexing aspect of the brain. But then he gives up and admits that our human capacities are unable to understand how consciousness has come to be, nor what it is. He proposes that probably only an entity with higher abilities than those of our brain would be able to look down upon human Consciousness and understand what it is (does he mean a god, or a machine, or martians?).Of course, so far he is completely right. No one has, as yet, been able to explain Consciousness satisfactorily, and it has been approached from a myriad of fields. Is Consciousness created or has it evolved?. Is it only in our bodies, and therefore mortal, or can it transmigrate?. What is it anyway? So, the missing star is not because of what Pinker has written in this book but for its title. He does not really explain, fully, what he promises: how our mind works. In any case, I am going swimming tomorrow again, and my Consciousness is delighted with the idea, even if it does not know what it-self is."
1,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5130906-mikael-lind,2,"The book does not lack good qualities, but I generally dislike the technique of argumentation that is too often characterized by poor proof backed by a certain arrogance towards alternative explanations. The chapter on the sexes is particularly shoddily presented. The ""proof"" that Pinker refers to when trying to back his claims that (simply put) evolution and innateness alone explain the differences between the sexes when it comes to attitudes to sex (the male hunter/gatherer has logically a greater chance of spreading his genes since he doesn't have to carry the baby for nine months, and so on) is based on polls filled out by university students. That these students are also caught up in a social reality doesn't seem to have crossed Pinker's mind.Good scholars know where to draw the boundaries between science and speculation. Chomsky has said that one can learn more about human nature from reading a novel than from scientific psychology. In other words, he knows that his scientific field is limited to a certain aspect of human nature and language, and thus doesn't try to explain more than can be deducted by reasoning from the facts presented. (One can have opinions as to how successful Chomskyan linguistic science actually is, but that's another matter.) Certainly, Pinker is allowed to speculate, as is any scientist. The problem is that Pinker's speculations are sometimes presented as truths. Therefore, this book does, despite some interesting facts being presented in it, leave me with a bitter taste in my mouth."
2,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,1,"I started this, listened to 3.5 hours of the audiobook’s total of 26 and simply couldn’t imagine continuing. The first chapter (2.5 hours), which the author calls an “opening brief”, can in simple terms be seen as an introduction. This introduction was not concise; it was rambling and consisted of mundane generalizations. It did not clarify how the book would be organized nor in precise terms what the author wished to show. Nothing enticed me to continue. To better understand the field of cognitive science I am looking for a book based on solid scientific backing, not one based on speculation. I want at least a modicum of solid proof for what is being claimed, and I found not one smidgeon of that here. There was an excessive amount of criticism of other scientists’ views while at the same time the author’s own views were not made clear. I disliked the manner in which the author gave an enormous number of examples which supposedly were meant to prove the generalizations made. Many examples proved nothing. They referred to movie figures, characters in fiction, objects we use in our daily life and further generalizations about human behavior. The list of examples drowned out the statement that was to be proven. Even in the first introductory chapter there were statements made the validity of which can be debated. We are told that humans today no longer worry about robots / computer programs being made that function better than man. That is not true! In the news recently was a debate about the inequitable use of artificial intelligence programs. So I finished the unwieldy, long-winded, empty first introductory chapter and moved on to the second. Before quitting the book I wanted to check if perhaps the style of writing altered. It did not. The narration by Mel Foster started off too fast, but I got used to it. At one point I set the speed down to 75%, and that was too slow! Sentences become distorted. In a book such as this a listener needs time to consider what is being said so they can themselves evaluate what they are being told. The rambling, chatty writing style, the multitude of generalizations and the lack of both conclusive evidence and scientific backing are not what I am looking for. If I do not want to read a book, this says clearly that I did not like that which I read. I am giving this one star."
3,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a truly comprehensive treatment of the human mind. Pinker delves deeply into the reasons why the mind has evolved to make decisions in the way it does. There is very little discussion about the biology of the brain; the book points out that a good understanding of the origins of human behavior requires descriptions at a higher level--at the level of the mind, and how it evolved through natural selection. Pinker shows how natural selection has worked its way into every nook and cranny of the mind ... absolutely fascinating. Every chapter goes into great detail about how our belief system developed, our vision, our reasoning abilities, our family structures, and our emotions. Pinker describes how our minds are similar to computers and neural networks, and how they are different. I've read other books by Pinker, and they are all great. Highly recommended to every human with a mind!"
4,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1447864-joshua-nomen-mutatio,5,"I think this a great way of addressing a widespread misunderstanding about genetics, biological evolution and human thought & behavior.Slight background story: I was having a discussion with a guy on goodreads.com within his comments on his review of Why I Am Not A Muslim and eventually it came to this:Myself: ""It’s a categorical mistake to think this about biological evolution. To put it bluntly: our genes are selfish, but we are not (not necessarily, unconditionally so at least).""Him: ""One last question, so how are we different than our genes?""And my reply and the whole point of this post:This may sound mean, but it’s simple. You are not a gene, nor am I. We’re animals, unique and beautiful and ugly and all qualities in between, both as a species and as individuals.Here’s an explanation though:""But almost everyone misunderstands this theory. Contrary to popular belief, the gene-centered theory of evolution does not imply that the point of all human striving is to spread our genes. With the exception of the fertility doctor who artificially inseminated patients with his own semen, the donor to the sperm bank for Nobel Prize winners, and other kooks, no human being (or animal) strives to spread his or her genes. Dawkins explained the theory in a book called The Selfish Gene, and the metaphor was chosen carefully. People don’t selfishly spread their genes, genes selfishly spread themselves. They do it by the way they build our brains. By making us enjoy life, health, sex, friends, and children, the gene buys a lottery ticket for representation in the next generation, with odds that were favorable in the environment in which we evolved. Our goals are subgoals of the ultimate goal of the genes, replicating themselves. But the two are different. As far as we are concerned, our goals, conscious or unconscious, are not about genes at all, but about health and lovers and children and friends.""That seems to be enough to get the point across, but I think this is such a good point that I’ll type the next paragraph up as well:""The confusion between our goals and genes’ goals has spawned one muddle after another. A reviewer of a book about the evolution of sexuality protests that human adultery, unlike the animal equivalent, cannot be a strategy to spread genes because adulteres take steps to prevent pregancy. But whose strategy are we talking about? Sexual desire is not people’s strategy to progagate their genes. It’s people’s strategy to attain the pleasures of sex, and the pleasures of sex are the genes strategy to propagate themselves. If the genes don’t get propagated, it’s because we are smarter than they are. A book on the emotional life of animals complains that if altruism according to biologists is just helping kin or exchanging favors, both of which serve the interests of one’s genes, it would not really be altruism after all, but some kind of hypocrisy. This too is a mix up. Just as blueprints don’t necessarily specify blue buildings, selfish genes don’t necessarily specify selfish organisms. As we shall see, sometimes the most selfish thing a gene can do is build a selfless brain. Genes are a play with in a play, not the interior monologue of the players.""-Steven Pinker, How The Mind Works, pp. 43-44Also, for anyone interested in listening to the audiobook version:http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list...The reader sounds like one of those prototypical 1950's or 60's educational film narrators. It works pretty well."
5,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350004-josh-hamacher,3,"I finally finished this book. It took me far longer than I care to admit to do so. On at least one occasion I lost interest and put it down for several weeks before coming back to it.I have a hard time putting my finger on exactly why this was the case. It's not that it's bad - in fact, parts of it are absolutely fascinating. It's certainly not the writing; Pinker is quite good (despite a tendency to repeat himself frequently).I think it boiled down to two things for me, with both of them being closely related (and maybe even the same):1. Organization. This is a 565-page book with only eight chapters. Each chapter is almost a short book on its own, divided into many sections. While a common theme ties together each chapter the sections are often quite divergent. It was hard to maintain momentum when moving from one section to another that seemed only tangentially related.2. Breadth. The subject is the human mind, providing practically infinite material. I think for anyone there would be parts that are interesting and parts that aren't.Having said that, I still recommend this book."
6,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,5,"This book was an amazing read!I cannot get around the fact that it was written by one person, let alone one person with a lot of other books on the same topic, and yet more provocative each time. I loved the detailed and comprehensive outlook on each subject matter.It is not a textbook, It is a long essay that gives you a rational, up-to-date, coherent, general yet accurate, A frame for thinking about mind, cognition, and emotions, and also changes our day-to-day worldview about people in general.""The only complaint I have is that this book could have used more hierarchical structure."
7,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,5,"This is a very readable and influential synthesis of the cognitive science view of the mind with that of evolutionary psychology. The overall thrust is that the mind is a neural computer closely governed by feelings and desires that were shaped by natural selection for their adaptive value in the hunter-gatherer lifestyle of our ancestors. The book is lively, with lots of down to earth examples. He holds your hand when wading through many technical subjects, faces disputes in a non-dogmatic way, and addresses political spins on scientific matters in a forthright way.The heft and scope of the volume is daunting. Yet it is written to be accessible to the general reader as well as scholars. As the emphasis is on synthesis and not a unifying novel theory of mind dependent on the cohesion of all its parts, I feel that the average reader could benefit from reading only the chapters of interest to them. There are sections on visual perception, neural network modeling, passionate emotions, social behaviors, and cultural innovations. As with Wilson’s “Sociobiology”, many readers will be interested in what he has to say about biological roots of human violence, sexual behavior, family values, and the arts. This includes accounts of adaptive values for lying, self delusion, war, mass murder, rape, pornography, parent-child and sibling conflict, altruism, love, marriage, and friendship. Particularly fascinating is his coverage of the cross-cultural phenomenon of people going “amok” and tie-in with the “doomsday machine” theory of passionate emotions, the adaptive value of which lies in their service as “guarantors of threats and promises”. He makes a good argument that thinking conforms to a kind of language, or mentalese, with categorical, syntactical, and generative properties aligned with Chomsky’s conceptions. He places a big emphasis on the role of beliefs and desires in his perspective on the core properties of human intellect. He doesn’t hold out much hope in the explanatory potential of neuroscience, considering models at that level an inadequate reductionism: ""Even if neuroscientists someday decode the entire wiring diagram of the brain, human behavior makes the most sense when it was explained in terms of beliefs and desires, not in terms of volts and grams. Physics provides no insight into the machinations of a crafty lawyer, and even fails to enlighten us about many simpler acts of living things."" I agree that explanations at the level physics will not help understand the mind, but I feel hopeful that neuroscience can make much progress in merging biological and psychological models. As this book was written in 2007, it misses the neurological synthesis of the computational and emotional aspects of the mind achieved by Damasio in his 2009 book and the decade of great ferment in cognitive neuroscience due to studies using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.No matter how much it looks like he is on the pathway to biological determinism for so many “bad” human behaviors, he takes great pains to dissociate our inherited mental equipment from our systems of moral responsibility and vision of equal rights: ""To understand is not to forgive"". For example, understanding a human tendency to revile other cultures does not excuse the Holocaust. Biological determinism for even liberal values can be misguided, e.g. “The argument against persecuting gay people must be made not in terms of the gay gene or the gay brain but in terms of people’s right to engage in private consensual acts without discrimination or harassment.” In the case of the male tendency to mate with any women they can, even to the point of rape, rather than agreeing with one of his students that the key conclusion is that “Men are slime!”, he feels they still should be swayed by morality: “If … men are especially tempted to commit certain crimes against women, the implication is that deterrents should be surer and more severe, not that the crimes are somehow less odious.” Pinker further argues that environmental determinism is just as unfruitful. He feels feminists’ stance against discrimination and oppression of women can do without the position that their origin lies in brainwashing of children and youth by media, pornography, and child rearing and educational practices.A refreshing aspect of Pinker’s book is that he makes very little claim to explaining free will and sentience. He also places a lot of advanced cultural accomplishments of humans, such as art, humor, and religion in a category of having no likely evolutionary adaptive value. He suspects that these capacities are “along for the ride” and that “human brains evolved by one set of laws, those of natural selection and genetics, and now interact with one another according to another set of laws, those of cognitive and social psychology, human ecology, and history”."

Here is an example of a typical quotation from this book that i could only follow if i were drunk: ""The cobalt 60 nucleus is said to spin counterclockwise if you look down on its north pole, but that description by itself is circular because 'north pole' is simply what we call the end of the axis from which a rotation looks counterclockwise."" This is in the middle of a discussion, in which he puts down Richard Feynman, and concludes ""God is not ambidextrous after all."" I feel that Pinker presents his material in an annoyingly obtuse way and may be drinking when he writes. LOL"

10,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,4,"Very interesting. 20-30 years from now, I think most people will understand that there's nothing ""magical"" about the ""mind"", the ""soul"", religion, art, men, women, or any of the other sacred cows that continue to hold back humans from understanding themselves.How the Mind Works was published back in 1997, but I didn't encounter any of the points that Pinker made in High School or Collage, up until 2000. Pinker focuses on a ""computational theory of mind"", saying that the mind is a complex parallel information processing system.Of course Pinker doesn't have the ""final word"" on How the Mind Works, but he provides more evidence, more insight, and more rationality than the ""romantics"" and their leaders Freud Sigmund 1856-1939 Sigmund and Carl Jung.Pinker continues on many of the themes here in The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature.Unfortunately for Americans, Political Correctness seems to be a barrier to accurately seeing human nature, as human nature necessarily is different for different groups of people, particularly for men and women.My favorite anecdote is about the ""Coolidge effect"": … an old joke about Calvin Coolidge when he was President … The President and Mrs. Coolidge were being shown [separately] around an experimental government farm. When [Mrs. Coolidge] came to the chicken yard she noticed that a rooster was mating very frequently. She asked the attendant how often that happened and was told, “Dozens of times each day.” Mrs. Coolidge said, “Tell that to the President when he comes by.” Upon being told, President asked, “Same hen every time?” The reply was, “Oh, no, Mr. President, a different hen every time.” President: “Tell that to Mrs. Coolidge.”Pinker explains the mind by ""reverse-engineering"" it—figuring out what natural selection designed it to accomplish in the environment in which we evolved. The mind, he writes, is a system of ""organs of computation"" that allowed our ancestors to understand and outsmart objects, animals, plants, and each other.How the Mind Works explains many of the imponderables of everyday life. Why does a face look more attractive with makeup? How do ""Magic-Eye"" 3-D stereograms work? Why do we feel that a run of heads makes the coin more likely to land tails? Why is the thought of eating worms disgusting? Why do men challenge each other to duels and murder their ex-wives? Why are children bratty? Why do fools fall in love? Why are we soothed by paintings and music? And why do puzzles like the self, free will, and consciousness leave us dizzy?This arguments in the book are as bold as its title. Pinker rehabilitates unfashionable ideas, such as that the mind is a computer and that human nature was shaped by natural selection. And he challenges fashionable ones, such as that passionate emotions are irrational, that parents socialize their children, that creativity springs from the unconscious, that nature is good and modern society corrupting, and that art and religion are expressions of our higher spiritual yearnings.

Why has the mind evolved to make decisions in the way it does? why do we really laugh at a joke? Why does a face look more attractive with makeup? Why does our brain drive us to enjoy sex? Why is the thought of eating worms disgusting? Why do paintings and music alleviate the hunger and thurst of mind? Why did we invent religion, music and art? How did these items adapt in the long run if it serves to nothing from an evolutionary perspective? ... ... ...The book covers the computational theory of mind (mind is the computational product of the brain) and evolutionary psychology. There is a very little discussion about the biology of the brain but it still ponders over human natures to explain them from the biological adaptations and  the by-product of evolution  perspectives. The book was published over 20 years ago but Pinker is an engaging writer. So, at least the connecting experience with a first-rate mind might not be frustrating :)"
12,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/965367-dawn,1,"Let's be honest. I will probably never pick up this book to finish it. I began reading this because of my book club. But, I didn't think I would finish it to begin with, and due to many circumstances, the book club will not be meeting for this book. So, I have decided to put it down as one of those books I'll never finish.I didn't like most of what I read, not due to the subject/topic, but due to the way Pinker writes. His droning on on tangents and his shoving his philosophy, which is oh so right BTW [she said dripping with sarcasm:] was too much for me. I had a hard time staying interested, which was a shame, because most sections began with promise. But Pinker would, more often than not, find a way to make the topic at hand induce heavy eyelids (or eye rolling, depending).I wanted this book to be good and thought it would be interesting, being a Bachelor of Psychology graduate myself, but no such luck. Maybe in many years, when I have more time on my hands, or less sense, I will try picking this book up again."
13,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/873838-rita-t,4,"I read all bio-determinist arguments, no matter how sound their science, as a mandate to return to the 50's - those halcyon days when men schnoockered their secretaries while women bought canned foods and tended the young. Nonetheless, I loved this book. The early chapters, especially on the computational theory of mind, are incredible. Pinker is just unbelievably detailed and the linguistic spin he brings to the discussion of cognitive development is a great dimension. The later chapters are more of the men-like-variety-women-like-providers stuff that one usually hears but nuanced and entertaining nonetheless. I enjoyed this book a lot. "

Pinker starts out by claiming that he will explain the origins of human emotions, aesthetics, and belief in the context of the latest findings of evolutionary and psychological research. He does not really succeed in doing so. It is a succession of moderately interesting research reports, linked together with a glue of neat one-liners (mostly other people's), but without really coming to a killer conclusion and indeed occasionally resorting to sheer polemic (eg on gender). The section on neural networks is particularly dull, especially as Pinker admits that living brains don't actually function that way. [return][return]I found precisely two points of interest in the book, both pretty tangential to the main thrust of the argument. First, of interest only to those who also know her, is that an old family friend is mentioned in passing on the development of children's minds. Second, of more general interest, is the observation that all cultures tend to design ornamental gardens with unconscious reference to the primeval African savannah - lawns and flowerbeds interrupted by carefully placed features. Rather a pleasing thought! This observation is not Pinker's own, but he does give pretty full citations for it which the interested reader can follow up.[return][return]I hear that Pinker's other books are better, so shall continue to look out for them though without particular enthusiasm."""
15,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1360306-joshua-stein,5,"Pinker's treatise on the naturalist mind looks like a science textbook, but the combination of computer programming and physiology laid on top of sociological metaphors and applicable understandings makes it a fantastic read. His ability to diffuse archaic arguments about the nature of the mind without appearing argumentative is what defines him as a great academic, and his ability to explain things to individuals with only a high school education (like me) is what defines him as a great writer.The assaults on the superstitions of Freud are particularly interesting, and his breaking down of the purely linguistic issue of Searle's ""Chinese Box"" problem leads you to come to the same conclusion that Pinker does as Pinker is unfolding the problem.Anyone who likes to study the nature of mind, who enjoys reading authors ranging from Dennett to Proust will like this book, and those who like to discuss the topics will find themselves better informed and far more capable of explaining things with Pinker's metaphors."

He also makes a misstatement about free will.""Sentience is not a combination of brain events or computational states.""""Free will is not a causal chain of events and states by definition.""This is frustrating because I feel like he ran a 3 minute mile but stopped just shy of the finish line!He's wrong on both counts.

21,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42189561-abu-hayat-khan,5,"there is two contending interpretation exists among academia on Darwinian Evolution: Gradualism vs Punctuated Equilibrium. they strikingly disagree on the question of “how a phenotypic trait evolves”. in gradualism (Richard Dawkins and others), any phenotype must have an Adaptive value (here the definition of ""adaptation"" is very strict, it means reproductive advantage only) i.e. a trait that increases the chance for more living offspring evolves slowly through selection pressure. on the other hand, proponent of punctuated equilibrium (Steven J Gould and other) don’t accept the idea of “adaptation”, rather they theorized something called“Exaptation”, which says that a trait may arise through natural selection for one purpose but later organism may find another way to use it which doesn’t give any survival value (i.e. doesn’t provide reproductive advantage). such traits or phenotypes are called evolutionary byproduct. Mr. Gould’s called them “Spandrel”. Spandrels of San Marco are famous for their beautiful art, but originally these spandrels were structural components of the basilica which later turned into artistic masterpieces. Unlike slow Adaptation, Exaptation happens in punctuated manner, i.e. out of sudden in the geological timescale. Epigenetics is considered to be one of the mechanisms for such punctuated evolution (please see, ""Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst"" by Robert M. Sapolsky).if we consider human mind as a phenotype that comes from an organ called the brain, and if the brain is an evolved organ through natural selection, which interpretation should we take to explain human mind? is mind adaptive? a trait that helps multiplying offspring? Or is mind exaptative, i.e. an evolutionary byproduct?in his influential book ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"", Daniel Kahneman demonstrated that human mind is by default irrational, rational thinking is a very expensive process hence turned off most of the time. instead, our brain uses shortcuts, know as heuristics or biases to solve any given situation. this line of research and academic findings tipped the view of human mind toward exaptationism. i.e. prominent view is that human mind is an evolutionary byproduct which explains why it is such irrational. in this view, it is considered that human mind was evolved to survive in predator-prey paradigm in which rational thinking would result in predation and death. our concept of art, music, language, etc is simply a byproduct of a formal survival machine called the brain. now enters Steven Pinker. Mr. Pinker argued that mind is an adaptive phenotype. so the only way to understand it is through evolutionary history not by chaos theory or reductionist physical approach. which implies that the irrational throughs are not useless at all. rather our cognition biases and irrationalities are very important to increase the change of our reproductive success. and that is exactly how human mind should work.I consider Steven Pinker and Gerard Diamond as the best two scientific writer of our time. other writers like Yuval Noah Harari, Richard Dawkins etc are popular but not even close to these two giants. in this book, Mr. Pinker destroyed exaptationism, though not without criticism. some of his descriptions just flown over my head, nonetheless, this book turns out to be the most informative book on evolution I've ever read."
22,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,3,"The title of the book should have read ""How the Mind Works (According to Steven Pinker)."" The picture he paints is not wrong, per se, but vastly overestimates the power of current cognitive modeling.There is quite a bit of good material here reviewing computational theory of mind, modularity, evolutionary psychology, and related material in cognitive science written in Pinker's usual conversational style. However, I have to hop off the bandwagon at the halfway point on this one. Sure, computational theory of mind has produced a lot of fruitful research. The mind is, to some degree, modular. The brain, like all our other organs, is shaped by evolution. My main problem is in his jump from the modularity at ""low-level"" cognition (e.g., basic sensory input, certain parts of language) posited by Jerry A. Fodor to ""massive modularity."" There are some functions that are very localized in the brain that fit with modularity, but we would expect the brain to look very different if massive modularity were true. The brain is actually very plastic with many higher-order functions that aren't strictly localized. The same thing goes for his evolutionary explanations. I will happily agree that many cognitive systems and functions are adaptive -- having eyes and a visual system is obviously beneficial! When it comes to more complex social behaviors, we're in far more speculative territory.As an introduction to cognitive science, it does present the material in an accessible way. However, it will be difficult to for the layperson to pick apart where Pinker's description is backed by solid evidence and where it lapses into questionable claims and rank speculation. There's a bit of fluff, too, especially near the end when it begins to cross over into the more overt political rambling characteristic of The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature.Fodor's The Mind Doesn't Work That Way: The Scope and Limits of Computational Psychology (http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Abstracts/Fodo...) makes for a decent corrective, though I have problems with it as well. I'm in total agreement on one point with Fodor, though: When it comes to cognitive science, we're just getting started."

24,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772528-ben,4,"A very good book, albeit not the quickest read ever.I’ve read a few popular science books and have been disappointed when they seem to rely more on anecdote than science -- ok, fine, what I really mean is I can’t stand Malcolm Gladwell. How the Mind Works certainly feels much more solidly founded in science while still maintaining the how-science-fits-into-real-life perspective of a popular science book.It’s not a perfect book. Given the enormous breadth of the topic that Pinker is attempting to cover, it’s forgivable, but still the book does drift occasionally into generalizations that seem more a subjective (though plausible) opinion than convincing fact. Given the great complexity he describes in the lower-level workings of the human brain, I felt surprised at how often he seemed to be over-simplifying higher-level human psychology; at the the same time, of course, I did realize he couldn’t preface every sentence with, “As a generalization that obviously does’t account for all specific details, ...” All in all, it was quite a good, convincing book that felt comfortingly more bound to science than some others I’ve read."
25,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2459318-deniz-cem-nduygu,5,"So many great paragraphs that they make up for a few places where he gets lazy and spells out conventions. As the number of notes I took goes, this book is a winner; in addition to all its original content, it has the best summaries I've encountered of many complex ideas/theories. He is remarkably devastating against standart social sciences and postmodernist thinking. The book may get a little monotone in the technical chapters, but it's a must-read for anyone interested in psychology, evolution, nature-nurture debates, or mundane questions like ""Why do men and women want different things?"". (No, the differences are not ""socially constructed"".)I just wish he was more open to the meme theory; then he could be perfect."
26,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6888635-ryan,4,"In order to understand ourselves and others in a meaningful and accurate way, we need to be informed on how the human mind works. Steven Pinker lucidly explains what we can know about how the mind works and why it happens to work the way it does. The explanations he presents are supported by fascinating experiments and observations from the fields of psychology, neuroscience, biology and anthropology.Reading this book requires a fair bit of grinding, but I think that some people who persist will find it deeply rewarding and satisfying. The paradigm presented in this book is interesting."
27,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,5,"The best science writers have an understanding of the subject on which they write that is both deep and broad along with the ability to express these ideas in a way which is both clear and connects it with ideas and experiences that resonate with the general reader. Pinker is, along with Brian Greene and Sean Carroll in physics and Steve Jones and Richard Dawkins in biology, amongst the very finest of these. "
28,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,3,"It's been years since I've read this, so I don't reliably remember all the arguments in Pinker's book. I remember finding it very interesting at the time, but since then, I've become a lot more skeptical about evolutionary psychology.I'm not actually sure that I read the whole thing, considering I can't remember much of it..."
29,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11132464-t,4,"Excellent! Had to stick with it but was really rewarding. Pinker is one of the brightest science writers, on par with Dawkins. I hope to read more books on evolutionary psychology, but for now this the clear leader on that subject."
30,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12063010-rebee,1,This book is out of date. I chose not to waste any more time listening to it when I realized it was written in the mid 1990's. 
31,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626390,3,"This was a good book overall, but it did not live up to my expectations, especially in the last few sections, which I felt were more like filler material; which is not to say that they were of little interest in and of themselves. I understand his need to make an argumentation in favor of evolutionary psychology, considering the current political climate and the constant denial of the existence of ""human nature"" on the extreme left, but I think it simply did not belong in this book.Apart from the section where the author detailed the human sense of vision, and how the brain processes visual information to build a 3D image of the environment (with all kinds of tricks and assumptions to solve problems that are technically unsolvable), in addition to the introduction of the Computational Theory of Mind, there was little talk of ""how the mind works"" actually. We learn more in this book about how the human brain might have evolved, and the environmental pressures to which it might have been subjected during that process, as well as the consequences of this evolution on human traits and behavior, than about the modules and processes within the brain that convert sensory data to meaningful information, actions, and qualia.There are whole sections dedicated to conflict between individuals, groups, sexes, parents and children, and how this might have directed our evolution, but little in the way of an explanation of what the brain is doing as it processes data about one's social standing, social relationships, etc, to generate emotions, actions, reactions and conscious decisions.The earlier sections about the modular and hierarchical nature of brain structures, and the combinatorial nature of its processes, were interesting as a refresher, but by no means offered any new ideas to me personally. The introduction and argumentation for CTM on the other hand left a greater impact on my intellect, and I'm enthused to learn more about it.Perhaps Pinker's relative failure in this book (compared to ""The Language Instinct"") is due to his attempt to tackle subjects outside of his area of expertise.That being said, it was still a enjoyable read, and was by no means devoid of good insights."
32,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2233542-mike,5,"It's hard to absorb and review a book this big. I think of it as something like a one semester college course. Some parts are very difficult and I can't say I understood them all, and others are just fun. But it's not really ""How the Mind Works"" in the sense I was looking for. I was hoping to learn how all those neurons, glia, synaps and axons work together to make thoughts and actions happen. That's not this book. This book is more about how natural selection (Pinker uses the word ""adaptation"" a lot) and the Computational Theory of the Mind result in the capabilities that our brains have, like vision, other senses, and solving problems. Much of the book is thought exercises (however clever) to suss out how a particular brain capability could have resulted in greater reproductive success. Along the way, you get a heavy dose of how amazing the mind is given the difficulty of the problems it can solve almost instantly. The penultimate chapter is all about sex and relationships (and decidedly un-PC), which is fun to read, but really strays from ""How the Mind Works"". In the last chapter, Pinker tackles, probably as well as anybody, the problems of mental activities that don't seem to have any evolutionary purpose, such as art, music and religion. Lastly, he discusses consciousness, somewhat unsuccessfully in my opinion, but who has ever tackled that one successfully?This book reminded me a lot of Jarad Diamond's writings, particularly ""The World Until Yesterday"". Like Pinker, Diamond believes *almost* all behavior and customs must serve some evolutionary purpose, i.e. increase the reproductive success of the practitioners. I can't blame these guys, after all, there is no other coherent scientific theory, but to be truthful, ""How the Mind Works"" sometimes made me doubt that the theory of evolution explains everything.I would love for Pinker to update this book. Written 20 years ago, I think he greatly underestimates the eventual capabilities of computers. While I agree that the mind is unlike any current computer, advances in AI, such as language recognition and visual interpretation might steer his thoughts in a different way."
33,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97471543-alessandro,5,"I prefer to hear the bad news before the good, so let’s begin with the negative feedback:Through the whole book, Pinker often engages with a certain subject by stating the inaccurateness by thinkers that are not mentioned. For example (p.509): ”Many intellectuals believe that primitive warfare is rare, mild and ritualized, or at least was so until the noble savages we're contaminated by contact with the Westerners. But this is romantic nonsense.” This argument is repeatedly used in the book as a way to introduce the various subjects. I would agree that we should directly mention other thinkers’ faults, instead of fabricating something less ”hurtful”. Secondly, Pinker often falls in his own traps. In one of his later books, The Sense of Style (2014), he introduced the book by stating one of the primary reasons for bad writing; the Curse of Knowledge. This cognitive bias refers to the phenomena that the knowledge that we have gathered becomes obvious: you forget the time you weren’t yet aware of that particular information, so you rest on the assumption that others presumably know it as well. In non-fiction books, we see this bias when the authors don’t explain concepts that are self-explanatory to them. You just can’t always predict what kind of readers will read your book. Just like (barely) every author of non-fiction books, Pinker also makes use of this bias. As a psychology student myself it’s less difficult (but I have to admit, I don’t know everything), but my dad who works in insurance had a hard time reading a few pages. As you can see, I gave this book five stars. So it can’t be all bad. Firstly, most of the (psychological) knowledge is still very relevant in today's psychological (and more importantly, political) environment, even though it’s at least 20 years old. Whether you like it or not, Pinker deserves credit for this. Many of the ‘assumptions’ that reviewers mention, about are equally as valuable after two decades. Some of these assumptions can’t be classified as assumptions anymore. The now politically incorrect value that some of the paragraphs hold (mostly in the chapter: Family Values) are very effective in debates that for example show the (biological/psychological/reproductive/etc.) differences between men and women. Lastly, as I’ve stated, I study psychology. This book was a great way to go over the different subjects and building on existing knowledge. The subjects can often be perceived as dull and technical. But Pinker does a great job by adding humor and information of different academic fields to make these subjects easily consumed. Incorporating various disciplines does not only tells you something about the interests of the author but also about (in this case) psychology itself: that psychology is not only composed of psychology. When Pinker writes about an economic concept, to me, it feels as like he is really interested in the whole discipline. This makes me want to read more different books on different subjects to increase my field of interest. The ’power’ to make you want to read more books is (for me) probably the most valuable feature of a book. Have a great new year’s eve! "
34,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98058161-daniel-solomon,5,"This may be the best books summarising the interaction of neural networks/neuroscience, psychology, biology and sociology that forms modern cognitive science for the non expert. In part, that's because there aren't that many books trying to do that.The key ideas are the computional theory of the mind/mind=brain as a computational system using inputs from reality and mental models and languages to generate mental representations/pictures that guide our answers and choices (but quite different in several ways from a digital computer), and natural selection/evolution generating a species/humans that specialise in survival due to superior cognitive abilities. There's also an introduction to neural networks as how the brain implements the mind, a decent discussion about consciousness, emotions, bounded rationality and cognitive biases, but those discussions are relatively short and the topics better covered in other later books (e.g Kahneman's Thinking Fast Thinking Slow for cognitive biases, Dahaene's Consciousness and the brain etc...).Much has been made about the power of artificial neural networks to learn and even outperform humans in some restricted domains, and the computational theory of mind and its focus on innate knowledge has been dismissed by some of the researchers involved. But behind the scenes many of those successes rely on good data that is similar to providing the networks to strongly informative Bayesian priors and state of the art AI is putting more emphasis on organising neural network learning via good models and the equivalent of innate knowledge or prior probabilities. The basic idea of a computational system processing inputs into various propositions/representations implemented by (deep) neural networks remains a decent synthesis, though the last 20 years (this book is from 1998) have seen big improvements in both neural networks and more structural models such Bayesian networks."
35,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68621721-karol-ujueta-rojas,5,"So happy to have finally finished this book. It's a long and no an easy one but so worth it. Nowadays we know how the brain works, we know how the parts are connected and what they produce in our bodies but we still know nothing of how the human mind works. What parts of the brain makes us be aware of the world and ourselves? are we really aware of ourselves? do other animals with similar brains have different type of awareness? why does our brain makes us enjoy sex? how come we invented music, art or religion if it serves to nothing from an evolutionary perspective? or perhaps it does serve to something? why did evolution gave way to love, hate, embarrassment, sarcasm? what do these types of feelings really do behind the curtains of our awareness of them ? why do we really laugh at a joke?.... These and more are questions answered in this book and I'm so excited that we can now talk about all this thanks to the evolution of artificial intelligence and the ""computational theory of mind""."
36,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7807167-ayman,5,"This book explains how the human brain feels and thinks from an evolutionary biology stand point. How we see, smell, hear, perceive, abstract and memorize has all been shaped by tangible survival needs of our ancestors. However, the surprising and interesting part of the book is about how our emotions and social skills were also a product of evolution. Even romantic love!! :)However, there was a point ~60,000 years ago when evolution (a very slow process that works over millions of years) became secondary in shaping the human mind who started to discover itself and the world around it. We were the first species to have such advanced mental faculties that moved on from solving survival problems to ask fundamental questions about the meaning of the world itself. The problem is our brain is not biologically built to answer these questions and therefore we probably need a different mind or type of mind (an AI maybe?) to attempt such answers."
37,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52456731-lynn-derks,5,"As of this post, I am pursuing an M.A. in music and worship. My thesis is going to be something about music as language, so I was particularly interested in reading Pinker's ""The Language Instinct."" I stumbled upon HTMW before purchasing a copy of TLI, so I read HTMW first. It proved to be a valuable basis for understanding Pinker. I think Pinker might be surprised to hear that Scripture does not conflict with many of his beliefs (Scripture and science work well together - but that's another discussion). Here's an interesting issue: Pinker believes emotions to be adaptive (they were developed for survival and replication of the organism). He asserts that music is strictly a device for communicating emotions. He believes music is not adaptive (music does not aid in survival or replication of an organism). Does anyone see the problem here?"
38,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91751604-roy,4,"According to Dr. Pinker, the mind's functioning can be explained by the computational theory of mind, that is, the theory that the human mind is the product of complex neuronal activity shaped over thousands of generations through natural selection. This theory posits that the mind is comprised of specific problem solving modules each designed to tackle problems of survival. The book could have been titled the evolutionary theory of mind since much of it is focused on natural selection and the propagation of genes as an explanation for how human mental modules came to exist. It is an entertaining attempt to explain many facets of human behavior, but I think the book could have been half as long. Of particular interest is the final chapter in which he attempts to shed light on the arts, music, humor, religion, and philosophy. These areas of life he argues have little adaptive or survival value and he attempts to use the theory to understand why human beings hold these things in such high esteem. Finally, he presents the idea that perhaps the human brain did not evolve the capacity to solve the deepest mysteries of human existence."
39,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24500782-sampath,4,"3.5/5.The book has really interesting things to say about the mind when it comes to things like vision, memory, social dynamics, arts and consciousness. I felt the first half of the book was a drag. There were a lot of places where analogies or explanations about computations the brain does were augmented with cultural references which I didn't care about or didn't understand. I thought that it muddied the point that was attempted to being made and didn't help me understand the overall structure of the chapter.The second half was an easier read since there isn't much of the computation explanation going on but, is still riddled with cultural references."
40,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4048835-rebecca,3,"I really enjoyed the chapter in computational theory of mind and the discussions of intelligence and mental representations. Other chapters, not so much; low-level vision science is woefully boring (that’s a personal preference though) and using evolutionary theory still remains a “grand theory of everything” that can be used as a post-hoc explanation of some but not all interpersonal phenomena."
41,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/251567-karen-ng,3,This book is a little harder to comprehend than other Pinker books... I will not recommend it as a neuroscience primer. Incognito by David Eagleman is so much better.

43,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/218323-becky,4,"Very interesting, well-written, and comprehensive. I appreciated the overview of both computational and evolutionary psychology in one tome of a book; computational psychology is pretty much awesome, and though I must confess that I skipped some of the technical examples in an effort to prevent my brain from breaking, Pinker's writing was for the most part clear and explanatory. I learned a lot!I would be interested to find out whether any of the specific evolutionary theories have become passe over the last ten years, since a great deal of new research must have come out since then. A second edition would be great if necessary.I still have reservations about the conclusion of the book. Basically, Pinker says that the computational view of the mind means that consciousness - the ability of the mind to actually experience stimulus and thought, like the taste of a strawberry or the redness of red - has no apparent function. People could go through the complex computational steps of mental activity without experiencing any of it. There is no way to prove that the person sitting next to you is not a ""philosophical zombie,"" who acts like they think and feel but is really just a mechanical thing.Not only does this mean I have no solid proof that all of you aren't just automatons, but no can explain why we experience things to begin with! Very perverse philosophers have attempted to argue that experience is an illusion, but of course this makes very little sense. Pinker is forced to conclude that our brains are just not smart enough to solve a peculiar problem like the nature of consciousness and self, along with some other potential philosophical problems like the possibility of absolute morality or the ability of language to refer to real things (don't understand the problem with this last one myself.)I'm not saying that I can prove Pinker is absolutely wrong in this conclusion, but it is deeply unsatisfying. Our minds are, apparently, the product of a lawful universe. Logic is able to tackle, if not solve, every other problem with which we have been presented, from pulsars to microorganisms. The only exception is strange, peripheral problem of where the universe came from to begin with. Why should our minds be another such exception? If we can't explain our minds as a logical evolutionary adaptation, doesn't that call into question evolutionary psychology as a theory? How could human awareness not be the product of evolution (the ultimate logical process)?Pinker tries to compare our failure to understand the mind to an autistic person's failure to understand the existence of other minds or a dog's colorblindness. But the problem with an autistic person, as I understand it, is not that they can't have the existence of other minds explained to them, but that they don't intuitively act as if they exist. Similarly, if the dog were more intelligent, they could obviously believe in and understand what color is, they just can't imagine what it is to see it. If we were blind to the nature of how sentience interacts with the rest of the universe, we should not realize that we have this blindness until it is explained to us. As it is, we are aware of a blindness and can't think of how to see what we know we know must be out there to be seen.Finally, if Pinker is right that science has failed us regarding the problem of human consciousness, it's rather questionable for him to argue that religious or mystical explanations are out of the question, because if that were so, it wouldn't be an unsolvable problem after all. Either the logical forces of the universe to which we are all accustomed are responsible for consciousness, or Something Else is. Pinker is right; it would be presumptuous and unscientific to call the Something Else God or Divine Energies or what have you. But we cannot discount these hypotheses outright, and the notion that our consciousnesses apparently work apart from the causation that is evolution at least means that the universe is a much stranger place than we have been led to believe. Really I would rather believe that my mind is the result of scientifically knowable causes, I like science, but if I am to believe Pinker, then another, very weird solution is out there.Very interesting read, but the ultimate difficulties brought up by the theories are much more frustrating than the elegant solutions they provide! Mostly I just don't like giving up on a scientific solution to a problem; it seems wrong."
44,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21015158-sam-caldwell,4,"I was surprised at just how comprehensive and compelling the two theories presented in the book are:1) the mind is an information processor, i.e. computer2) many characteristics of the mind can be explained in terms of the selective pressures on humans living as tribes of hunter/gatherers.Some bits that stand out are viewing emotions as facilitators of cooperation, in that they offer difficult-to-spoof insights to someone's state of mind. They also implement a doomsday-device-like deterrent; an infuriated person acts in a way that seems clearly not in their rational self-interest. The (credible) possibility of such a rage acts as a deterrent to those who might consider exploiting the subject.One thing I didn't like is the author's tendency to take potshots at different groups."
45,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4780400-ismail-n,3,"This book started out great then dragged on. The first 200 pages pair really well with ""Godel, Escher, and Bach: The Eternal Golden Braid,"" by Hofsteder."
46,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,3,"To a large extent the answer to the books title is that we have learnt a lot but still have a long way to go! The first part of the book digs into the 'mechanics' of the brain and the mind that 'inhabits' it. Discussion of he phenomenon of concsiousness is undertaken early on and given a naturalistic solution later in the book, although it is not a very satisfying one. While I enjoyed he attempt to identify the mechanics of concsiousness, the 'answer' seemed to rely more on philosophy and a natural selection - based hypothesis about how it might work. Other chapters in the early part of the book were also concerned with mind mechanics, and the discussion of how we see and the way the mind gets involved is excellent, if mind bogglingly complex. In the latter part of the book, as refered to earlier, the flavour relies less on measured infofomation abou the brain, instead inferring what goes on through pschology studies interpreted with a natural selection lens. The arguments made are soundly reasoned and reveal uncomfortable truths for many idealist viewpoints on 'human nature' in both left and right camps. It certainly presents an alternative perspective that deeerves a more prominent place in public discussion, although it carries the risk of misinterpretation and abuse, and the message that ethics lies in a different sphere would need o be given equally clear emphasis. however, regarding the scientific underpinnings of the conclusions, these sections seemed lacking, - the argument seems to be ""because of our primitive survival and reproduction needs, our emotions are tuned to follow these basic intincts"". Connection with how this connects with the mind and how competing instincts are resolved was given little attention. The final chapter attemptsto explain the religious instinct and felt particularly ad hoc. Much of what I've wrtten is critical - the book was challengin and thought provoking. It is certainly worth a read although it is reatively long and requires some perserverance. There are a few other books around which may add to some of this (i is relatively old now - 10 years or so) and certainly makes GEB more concrete and as a reslut is prbably a good place to start for modern unerstanding of the brain."
47,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14237878-david-metting,5,"I'll admit it, the title drew me to this book, and, having finished reading the entire book, I can say it's pretty apt! I'm a liberal arts major who never even took Psych 101 and this tome did a great job filling me in about the different modes of the human mind. This book by turns fascinated me, astonished me, and caused me to marvel, all great things. Having a book kindle one's curiosity is always splendid, especially when the objects of that curiosity are the myriad amazing things our body does each moment of each day but whose wonder we become desensitized to. In HTMW we learn that ""The mind is not the brain, but what the brain does...The brain's special status comes from a special thing the brain does which makes us see, think, feel, choose and act. That special thing is information processing, or computation"" (24). Pinker bases his book on two scientific theories: the Computational Theory of Mind and Evolution through Natural Selection. Basically, he argues that the mind is an adaptation that evolved to help humans outwit the environment, animals, objects, and human beings. In the opening chapters he explains these theories, and then for the rest of the book applies them to several of the mind's many modules, such as: the visual system, ideas, personal emotions, social emotions, and philosophy, religion, art, and music (""Auditory cheesecake""). I learned a ridiculous amount from this book and often felt ecstatic reading it. His arguments are very convincing and copiously documented. And his prose is very rich and memorable. I re-read many sections in sheer delight and things stuck with me due to the engaging way he wrote them. I plan to re-read portions of this book for a long while to come. The chapter on personal emotions, ""Hotheads,"" was a highlight for me, looking at why we feel at all, where different feelings come from in our evolutionary past, and what emotions are and are for. He discusses all kinds of feelings such as anger, happiness, grief, and disgust. It's a fantastic chapter!Overall, this book enhanced my worldview through a detailed look at the human mind's inner workings and boosted my curiosity, both invaluable assets! I am looking forward to reading more of Mr. Pinker's works."
48,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1571969-billie-pritchett,4,"Steven Pinker's How the Mind Works is a long book and a Book about Everything. Although the title suggests it's a popular psychology book, the discoveries of psychology and especially psychology understood as evolutionary psychology are used to explain all aspects of human life. Most of the first part of the book is not technical but might be boring to its readers. For example, there's a long explanation about how vision works that was a complete snooze-fest. From about halfway on in the book, I think the readers would be interested. There, Pinker writes about how evolutionary psychology helps explain societies, and, later, our leisurely appreciation of beauty and excellence like that expressed in art or music.Part of what the book is driving at, although it is not expressed explicitly until a later work, The Blank Slate, is that the human mind is richly endowed with these innate faculties for understanding ourselves and the world but they are, by design, limited in the ways that they allow us to interpret the information we receive from the senses. Even our faculties for scientific discovery seem to have an upper limit on them. He proposes near the end of the book philosophical questions such as ""How can free will exist in a deterministic world?"" might be a mystery for our species because our brains weren't designed to handle that kind of question. The characters in the book Flatland are two-dimensional shapes who live in a two-dimensional world. Any person would be free to leave the world they live in called Flatland if only they left through the third dimension. But the people in flatland are only familiar with two dimensions: forward/backward and left/right. Their minds can ask the question but they could never understand what it would mean to move in a third dimension (up/down). Because of the human mind, we're in a similar position. No reason to be pessimistic, though: The human mind is awfully rich as it is."
49,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46497366-isabella-victoria,5,"How the mind works is a very interesting and eye opening book, What I liked about the book was that it talks about our biology, what is inside of us like our genes from our past ancestors and how that affects many generations in the lifestyle and decisions that they make. It also throws out there crazy concepts or that at least seem unordinary in our society such as raping individuals in our genes. What I also liked about the book was that it presented factual evidence on most of the topics discussed in the book. I also liked that it talked about evolution because that is one of my favorite topics to discuss and learn more information about because it astounds me how we can come from the forms that we come from and how we adapted to our environment and what we were exposed to. The thing that I didn't like about the book was that it came out bias in some aspect of the book just off the wording they were using, it seemed one sided at times and I like more when its holistic and you look at all the different aspects and keep your opinions to yourself that others may be sensitive to in a way. I learned a lot from the book such as the mind is so complex it holds within it what your ancestors may have embedded in your brain and what knowledge and information you have obtained through the years. Learn to understand the scientific side of life. Yes I would recommend this book to others because it gave me an array of information in just this 500 page book that I might have never learned in school because our system is censored at time and they don't like to discuss a lot of different challenging topics."
50,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,5,"Steven Pinker is a world famous liberal evolutionary psychologist. As most intellectually focused psychologists I try to read everything he writes. It's the basic psychology science presented in a simple but intellectual way.Pro:This is a huge book. It really goes into a lot of psychology topics and most of them are well illustrated. It's one of those books that is a bit hard to get into and read, but you want to read it again because there are so many good nuggets here. I feel like I may have missed a few great points.Con:If you have read a few evolutionary psychology books this will feel very familiar in many chapters. I was zoning out quite often as I he kept presenting topics I already had read about like mating, men, women and basic psychology. This also means that it's a great intro book into psychology. I will for sure recommend it to people getting into the field.Another thing is that it's a bit old. He is often talking about blank slate thinking and how it's bunk science, but old psychology is often more blank slate than current psychology. Since the 90's we have had a lot of gene and heritability studies that showed that most of the factors we thought were mostly environment are actually mostly genetic. Politics, personality, parenting, intelligence. We have had a lot of great studies on the heritability of these traits and they really ought to be included in such a book. It does feel a bit environment focused and it's predictable for a book this old. But it's not the end of the road for psychology knowledge anyhow and you ought to continue reading up on it. For anyone reading up on modern psychology this is it, but presented from a slight liberal view point which probably makes it a great intro book for people who are left of center and have a hard time getting into the hard science.It's a typical Pinker book. If you like his writing it's a must read for you."
51,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,4,"'How the Mind Works' is an ambitious book. Pinker addresses an insane medley of topics: if it pertains to the mind in any way whatsoever, it's fair game. This variety of topics discussed is the books greatest strength, but also it primary weakness.Firstly, the bad: this book isn't clearly connected by an overarching thesis. I suppose everything has to do with 'the mind' - though this is debatable, as there are long stretches where you'll be prone to forget this book is supposed to be about 'how the mind works'. If each of the 8 chapters (some of which span upwards of a 100 pages) had been published as a self-contained book, no one would have been the wiser. In this sense, some cohesion would have been nice. The material is presented in a somewhat haphazard manner.Now then, onto the good: the material presented is totally awesome. Pinker is a terrific writer, and just about everything covered in 'How the Mind Works' was intensely interesting. And cover a lot he does: you'll read about your brain's insane ability to make sense of visual input; about the importance of 'irrational' emotions (and why they're not so irrational after all); and about the evolutionary underpinning of sexuality, to name a few topics of interest. I didn't agree with everything said, and some of his opinions, presented as fact, are decidedly controversial. But most importantly, all of the topics were interesting, and his conclusions are almost always well supported. 'How the Mind Works' was never boring, and that's high praise for a book of this scope.Should you read this book? Maybe. It's pretty ambitious, and unless you're fairly stoked about the material, you might be better of finding something more focused and concise. But if you're willing to take the plunge, you're in for a treat - How the Mind Works is an intellectual tour de force."
52,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20023237-melissa-hurtado,5,"Book ReviewPeriod 2Melissa HurtadoA Level Psych They say the mind is a beautiful paradox because it uses itself to understand itself. This quote has chased me around my high school years like a leopard hounding after its prey. Ever since my youth, I have noticed my skepticism on the human capsule. I often wondered if rigorous science labs brought up such an idea as the human mind. Although, childhood beliefs kept my thoughts grounded to an absolute that a grater power was the innovator. How The Mind Works was food for my thoughts. Steven pinker did not answer all of my unending questions but did satisfy some of my mysteries. He starts off by stating about the importance of the cognitive niche. He also states how vision is one of the many factors that have allowed our minds to go to such far extents. I do agree with him in this. Vision has allowed us to make buildings as high as mountains, paintings that capture feelings, and better yet help us find a mate. In the book he explains illusions and different visionary test to see how our mind correlates to our brain and mind. The human mind has been a topic of discussion for over many centuries and I believe Steven Pinker simplified the structure of it in a way that's both enjoyable and informative. Although Pinker had such a great way of easing us into the wonders of the mind, he worked too much on certain topics such as individuality. He did not believe that culture, race, etc.... plays a part in our molding decisions throughout our lives. Those who wonder off into the next levels of the mind's philosophy should read this book. I highly recommend to any who is skeptical about how everything comes together. In the way that this book has helped many readers, it has also helped me add to my knowledge of the mind and the little details that come together to make it up."
53,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3239706-gordon,3,"A daunting book for the casual reader. I found most of the chapters individually readable, interesting, often controversial. But, there were few transitions from one theme to another, which I found distracting. Steven Pinker's overall thesis is that the mind is a neural-based computer that reflects the results of evolutionary psychology - meaning that the basis of much of what we do and why we do it has its roots in our historical hunter-gather origins and how we have evolved (through adaptive, natural selection) since. Pinker does not present a unifying theory of the mind, but does present interesting examples of many aspects of human behavior that he aptly explains according to his evolutionary gene-based model. I found much of what he said logical and believable, although some of the sections were less convincing than others. He spends an inordinate amount of pages on explaining gender, and by extension societal, behavior, which I found more entertaining than completely solid. The most controversial claims that Pinker makes have to do with his thoughts on the arts and religion. Pinker states that the arts have no intrinsic evolutionary value, but are outcomes of our desire for pleasure. Similarly he concludes that religion does not contribute to explaining how our brain has evolved and argues strongly against ""creationism"" and the value of religion in general. I'll conclude by sharing a quote from Pinker's book that sums up his thesis “human brains evolved by one set of laws, those of natural selection and genetics, and now interact with one another according to another set of laws, those of cognitive and social psychology, human ecology, and history”."
54,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23344184-sudnya,4,"Note that this book was written in the nineties before reading the book or this review.This book raised more questions than answers for me but that is not necessarily a bad thing.Pinker covers a wide range of topics from biological, anthropological to social constructs that have shaped our human mind and behavior. I found the chapter about the place of humor in evolution fascinating (maybe cause I have never read about it before). This book also clarified the notion of Richard Dawkin's 'selfish gene' in a broader context than just biological/evolutionary i.e. it is not animals that are selfish due to their selfish genes rather that their brains and behaviors are designed by the influence of the selfish genes. At times they will, in fact, make sacrifices which might seem altruistic from a societal perspective.Overall this huge book was quite difficult to digest and should be paced to read and ponder upon. It won't answer your questions but will provide a good framework to explore the questions whose answers you seek.The reason I knocked off a star was because I felt like it ended a bit abruptly when it was time to discuss human consciousness. It is a tall order to expect the author to provide answers but I wish he spent more time talking about it."
55,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49863781-steve,4,"Written by one of the world's foremost cognitive scientists, it's an eight-chapter deep dive on the human mind and how it functions. Starts with the physiological properties of the brain and its components - how language is processed, how physical environments are understood - and slowly transitions to the more abstract notion of the mind, including human behavior and evolutionary theories about how we got to be the way we are. I'm reasonably interested in psychology and social studies and evolutionary biology, and as such, I found the second half a lot more page-turning than the first - especially since Pinker uses all kinds of unfortunately dated computer analogies early on that were surely more apt back in 1997 than they are today. (An updated version of this book might be able to milk a lot more out of ""computational algorithm"" metaphors, particularly given the huge advancements made in artificial intelligence and machine learning over the last two decades.) Still a fascinating read with plenty to offer, and if you ever get a chance, check out some of Pinker's lectures and debates on YouTube. The guy's pretty good at what he does!"
56,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2815504-isaac-kerson,1,"This book has been made mostly completely obsolete by the field of epigenetics. The type of genetic (over) determinism espoused here was always questionable -- the author tries to explain 90% of human behavior through the narrow lense of the ""selfish gene"" -- but, epigenetics has shown that environmental factors can cause the body to put certain genetic expressions on hold for generations. The idea of genetic determinism if not flatout wrong, is at the very least deeply flawed. This is too bad because the book starts (Chapters 1 & 2) with an interesting and still-relevant discussion of modular brain functions, before it spins off into fantastic, disproven speculations which to a large extent are only tangentially related to ""How the Mind Works"". Your average Wikipedia page is better sourced than the last 5 chapters of this book. Not worth your time. Instead read: How Emotions are Made, The Ego Tunnel, or The Epigenetics Revolution"

I've been a fan of Steven Pinker's since the ""The Blank Slate"", and he does an amazing job of distilling complicated technical subjects in a way that is easily digestible and interesting to a layperson like myself. The first section of the book, which analyzes how the brain is like a computer, is a bit of a slog. In some ways it was the most interesting for me, however, since everything he dealt with was new and cutting edge. If you get through that part the rest is a real page turner. For about a month this book turned me into a Steven Pinker quote machine (""Emotions are just a doomsday device!"", ""Marriage is just mate-socialsm!"") This, of course, makes you either highly fascinating, or the most annoying person on Earth, depending on who you talk to. Either way, I highly recommend this book. It really makes you step back and reconsider our your outdated beliefs about how people think."

It builds mental models and frameworks with strong explanatory power for understanding the human mind. This book impacts the way you view your own behaviour and the behaviour of others by exposing you to a deeper evolution-based grounding to the very complex topic of the human mind.It is a big book containing just 8 chapters approaching 80-100 pages each . The conclusions arrived at bring insight and enlightenment and are well worth the journey - but be warned - many of these conclusions are preceded by the slow and careful development of ideas, which on occasion can be painstakingly dreary to the reader with non-specialist expertise in this topic (e.g. me). However, the journey (even the dreary bits) is worth it - this book can open your mind - there is much to be gained in reading it."

I enjoyed mostly the chapter that mentioned how we would convince aliens that we are intelligent beings if they were to arrive. How they would differentiate us from cats and dogs and animals. It also answers questions about why robots cannot be created and I recommend it because it asks some questions that I have not really thought about before and it was very interesting to view the perspective of Steven Pinker since it very much is not similar to mine."

This was due in part to this one book having more width and depth than all the psychology courses I took at university put together. I almost wish that I had skipped Uni and read this instead, but then again I doubt I would have understood this book without the basic grounding their courses kindly provided.A rare mixture of luminous thinking and clear writing is how I would summarise this book.I'm not really feeling in a mood to be verbose about psychology and philosophy today so you're going to have to be content with this.If you want more then scan through my 'reading progress' notes - they give more detail."

A hard read (read it with a pen and make notes in the margins), but absolutely mind-blowing.I especially love how he illustrates heavy academic material with easily accessible examples from pop culture. While you DO need to have a, you know, 'mind that really works' to read this book, you do NOT need any kind of previous scientific training or understanding to grasp the concepts."

Today I decided to abandon it, even though I was already at the last chapter.Very interesting topic, but the book gets really obsessively detailed and repetitive at times. While Pinker have a way of explaining things, I am just frustrated that none of the things he explains have actual hard evidence backing it. It is fine to be able to come up with a seemingly logical explanation for certain human behaviour, but the lack of real evidence just don't cut it for me."

When I pick up a science book, I expect a clear statement of the main argument and a straightforward, organized presentation of evidence. I would think that to be a good scientist one would need clear thinking skills and a good grasp of logic, and an ability to express that clarity in writing. Just a few pages into this book I knew I would not be disappointed. I suspected that by the end I would know very little about Steven Pinker and a lot about the mind. Reading this before reading Tooby and Cosmides is probably like reading Dawkins before Darwin. But that worked for me, because the later writer interpreted the former so well that it increased my understanding of the underlying principles. I have bookmarked evolutionary psychology material by Tooby and Cosmides to read later.Though this book is written for the non-scientist, nothing here is condescending or glib. When he uses a term, he states which definition he is using. I really appreciate these efforts. This book is filled with the most complex and esoteric ideas, yet it was a pleasure and a joy to read.""The idea that parents shape their children is so ingrained that most people don't even realize it is a testable hypothesis and not a self-evident truth."" What I found truly striking is that many common beliefs about social science are just plain wrong. We base public policy on them, but the evidence doesn't bear them out. One is that parents have a lot of influence on their children's personalities. Evolutionary biology predicts they have very little influence, and studies confirm it. But it's not a popular idea in our society. We want to think we have influence over our children. We also want someone to blame when children go bad. So the myth persists.""It's not that the claim that there is an interaction between innate structure and learning (or between heredity and environment, nature and nurture, biology and culture) is literally wrong. Rather, it falls into the category of ideas that are so bad they are not even wrong."" ""Evolution and learning can also go on simultaneously, with innate structure evolving in an animal that also learns.""I just finished the first chapter. Wow. He begins with the robot challenge, demonstrating just how difficult it is to mechanically replicate even the simplest things people do. He describes the problem of understanding human vision as the difference between what information our eyes gather as contrasted with what our brains interpret. (I ""see"" things differently after reading this part.) He shows how what we consider ""common sense"" is far beyond the ability of any robot we've constructed so far. There are revolutionary arguments here, and some inflammatory statements. No wonder he's controversial. He discredits a lot of popular concepts in psychiatry and psychology. He talks about ""modules,"" but not in the simplistic structure/function way you might expect. He says our minds are produced by natural selection, but that doesn't mean we are limited to our biological drives. We have ""a complex mind that is designed to mesh with what is in nature.""He argues against the popular notions of biology or culture being causes of our behavior, saying, first, that the biology/culture dichotomy is a false one, and second, that it is used as an argument to abdicate personal responsibility. (He can't help it: he was born that way, or he ate too many Twinkies, or it was the system, or he was abused, etc.) Personal responsibility, however, would seem to require free will, whatever that is. Whether our decisions are based on random causes, intentional causes, or uncaused causes, free will remains a mystery.Most importantly, he portrays the brain as an information processor, saying information theory has revolutionized the study of neuroscience. Even with all the analogies, I'm having trouble grasping idea of the computational theory of mind. What I can comprehend is that it's central to understanding consciousness and intelligence without resorting to a magical explanation. Using Dennett's analogy, the brain as a machine can be explained by breaking down complex processes into ever smaller tasks until even the most stupid homunculus, or demon, can do each of them. Then, put millions of these tiny steps together, and speed up the process, and intelligence results. (I think.) On the other hand, apparently sentience is simply is a construct of our consciousness and doesn't bear scientific examination. It's another mystery.He argues, quite effectively I think, against popular theories of mind such as associationism and connectionism, saying they are not alternatives of, but adjuncts to the computational theory of mind.The next argument is for the theory of natural selection, as if it needs defending. It turns out it does, and not just against creationists. He picks apart opposing arguments, such as macromutation and random drift. After carefully showing how the human brain could be the result of natural selection, and that humans, rather than being its pinnacle or ""goal"" (because it has no goals) are just another, different product, he goes into how and why humans differ from the other animals.Again he examines the complex ways we think and plan and he mentions the ""cognitive niche"" proposed by Toobey. He writes about the tracking ability of the modern hunter gatherers (!Kung) showing they use abstract thinking. It made me think about the claim by James Gleick in The Information that cognitive thought as we understand it could not exist prior to written language (a claim that one reviewer of that book said has been largely discredited). Pinker may have been one of those who discredited it, perhaps in The Language Instinct. However, I may be confusing ""abstract thought"" and ""cognitive thought."" I had this aha moment when I thought abstract thought is what people do without language, but cognitive thought is what happens when people put those thoughts into symbols (words) that can be expressed or communicated. Basically, I think cognitive thought is ""thinking about thinking."" I imagine this isn't an original idea. I probably just figured out for myself what cognitive science has known for decades.After some stuff about our understanding (or rather lack of it) regarding math and physics beyond that needed for survival, and some treatment of the language instinct, we arrive at what is a more interesting topic for me: emotions. The claims are that the triune brain theory (reptilian brain) is wrong and that emotions were essential to our survival and are not nonadaptive baggage. He says, ""intelligence is the pursuit of goals in the face of obstacles"" and ""emotions are mechanisms that set the brain's highest level goals.""While reading the section of chapter 6 on food taboos, I kept seeing parallels with religion. Disgust at certain foods is grounded in avoidance of poisons, yet it differs between cultures and is mostly irrational. Children up to two years old will put almost anything in their mouths. They learn from their parents what is disgusting and they pass that knowledge on to their children. Many food taboos are religious, and the principle can easily be expanded to other religious beliefs and practices.One thing I take issue with is that he keeps using wording that hints at teleology. He says, ""'selfish' means 'acting in ways that make one's own replication more likely.'"" I would word this more passively, something like, ""'selfish' means being able to live long enough to replicate, having inherited the characteristics that allowed one's parents to survive long enough to replicate.""The section headed ""The Doomsday Machine"" is particularly interesting. It's about emotions, especially those of honor and vengeance, and the advertising of them by facial expressions. It's about the genuineness of those expressions, which Pinker says is evidenced by the fact that they are handcuffed to our involuntarily physical processes (and therefore maybe the triune brain theory does have validity). There is much speculation here, but it's food for thought.And here's a thought: that grief is a useless emotion unexplainable except as a doomsday machine (to ensure people have an interest in protecting people they love).Cheesecake, pornography, and the arts.I found the honesty of the last chapter refreshing. Pinker says it like it is -- that the arts are not biologically adaptive; that they are shortcuts we created to excite the pleasure circuits of the brain that ordinarily would be stimulated by activities that increase fitness. That view is unpopular today. People don't want to admit that art, like fashion, is a matter of status. People who have the wealth and leisure time to spend lots of resources on the arts want to justify their obsession. They're influential people, which might explain why popular culture (and some science writers) indulge that wish. The book I mentioned at the outset of this review is one such treatment. The author, who is admittedly obsessed with music, argues that music is not just ""auditory cheesecake""; that it is biologically adaptive. Now I know why I felt it was such a waste of time. When my book group discussed it, a member told us that he has taught himself to appreciate Schönberg by repeatedly listening to recordings of his work, to his wife's annoyance. (I heard a Schönberg piece at a symphony performance, and once was enough for a lifetime.) I don't feel any need to pretend to like something to impress anyone. I can't think of any other reason one would do it, especially now that I've read Pinker. Humans do other biologically functionless activities. The intellect itself may be nonadaptive. Religion and philosophy. Psychology. I'm sure the irony is not lost on Pinker that his own education and profession fall under this umbrella. He doesn't denigrate these activities; he just says evolutionary biology doesn't explain them."
81,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8173124-george-marshall,4,"I very much enjoyed the book. The topic is more ""Why The Mind Works"", and with that being the author's actual stated aim, the book seems misnamed. The author is making a case for seeing the mind as an evolved consortium of mental modules. Much of the thought in the book is not necessarily his own - the book is abounding with quotations, some in defense, some to rail against. The quotes, frankly, are frequently more interesting than the surrounding detail. He even points out early on that he is not adding new information, but seeking to bring it together in a readable form. Despite, he balances things fairly well and brings a coherent whole out of it.Pinker is a little full of himself. He can be dismissive. He will mine the sources for whatever can be used in support of his point, even if the authors themselves disagree with him, sometimes pointedly. One example of his unique way of handling other viewpoints stuck out to me:""When I mentioned the theory of parent-offspring conflict to console a colleague whose two-year-old son had become a pest after the birth of a younger brother he snapped. ""All you're saying is that people are selfish!"" Sleepless for weeks, he could be forgiven for missing the point. Clearly, parents aren't selfish; parents are the least selfish entities in the known universe. But they aren't infinitely selfless either..."" (p.442)To which one can only remark that while studying psychology and the mind, Pinker had forgotten or ignored the example of Job and his rather unhelpful set of friends. He had been a terrible friend and/or colleague, offering up his ""wisdom"" in place of the sympathy requested. I chuckle, though I am probably as bad at times, but he seems unaware of how pompous this recounting makes him appear. ""He could be forgiven..."" The temerity! Ah, well.But back to the point, he is usually successful in making his point. He presents a pretty compelling case for how many of the modules we see at work in the mind could have been ""designed"" through adaptive means. But in a number of instances he ends by simply spitting out a multitude of possibilities to answer the open question. This he does while maintaining the certitude that adaptive means can account for all we could want to know about the inner workings of the mind.Until it isn't. With music, specifically, he seems to get into weeds, giving all manner of technical details of harmonics and such, as if, lacking a good argument for how we adapted a sense for the pleasures of music, he might bore the reader into acceptance through fine print. In the end, music in his opinion is non-adaptive, ""cheesecake"" in his words - a pleasureful cocktail that plays off of the other modules, but was not itself selected for. At least he admits the picture he paints of our musical inclinations is ""speculative"".Of course a book that tries to treat the whole of the human mind and its development will have to address the subject of religion and our propensity towards it. Pinker comes off derisively, from the introduction to the bitter end, but most of the time it did not distract from the meat of what was being said. While arrogant, he is as dismissive of religious practitioners as he is of feminists unable to square their moral convictions with the reality of the evolved nature of our minds (for good or bad!). Though, he does apologize - backhandedly - to the feminists:""I wish I could have discussed the evolutionary psychology of sexuality without the asides about feminist theory, but in today's intellectual climate that is impossible...These kinds of arguments combine bad biology (nature is nice), bad psychology (the mind is created by society), and bad ethics (what people like is good). Feminism would lose nothing by giving them up."" (pp.492-3)The book naturally flows from the fundamental modules until it reaches the point where one is not sure what is adaptation and what is the working of culture with the framework it has been given. In turn he discusses vision, body adaptation, language, logic (of a sort), probability (especially in the sense of cheat sensing), mating and reproduction, friendship, and onto arts and literature.Getting to the big question of sentience, he spends very little time in throwing out a ""we can't know"", as if that is somehow better than the answers he dismisses so quickly and easily. An unsatisfying ending. But this does not overcome the mountain of enjoyed reading that makes up the book."
82,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57079482-chuck-kollars,3,"This book is quite long, and glancingly touches on a very wide variety of topics. Even such an abstruse question as why the art of painting might have more appeal to social elites is discussed a little. This variety shouldn't though obscure the fact that some very basic views about human thinking provide the main focus of the book and tie it all together. The author clearly made a mighty attempt to organize the mass of ideas and evidence in a sensible way; nevertheless the end result feels a bit scattered, probably mostly because the topics covered range so widely. It seemed to me (a more careful reader might produce a more accurate summary) the book's central ideas were:1. The human brain is a melange of fairly separate parts.2. Many of the parts are quite sophisticated. For example interpreting the visual data of 3D objects under variable illumination is nearly impossible, yet the brain manages to do it with ease. 3. The procedure by which the human brain decides which course of action to take when different parts of the brain come to different conclusions is simple, straightforward, and effective. 4. Almost all the operation of the human brain is ""automatic"" in the sense that it's not available to reflection/consciousness at all no matter what. 5. The operation and sophistication of each subsystem of the brain can be directly explained by evolution, typically with reference to the way humans lived in hunter-gatherer groups five thousand years ago. (Here I have a quibble, as the book just _assumes_ without evidence that human biological evolution has pretty much stopped.)6. Ideas that fit well into any one of these subsystems tend to take over, resulting in what we call ""cultural evolution"". (Or to put it in cruder words, there's something to the ""cultural meme"" hypothesis)7. Many of our most cherished things (for example ""cheesecake"") are in fact hacks that exploit some sort of quirk in each of several different brain parts. 8. Our taste for aesthetic/artistic things does _not_ indicate some sort of higher level of consciousness, _nor_ is it the ""purpose"" of life. Rather, it arises simply as an unintended side effect of the way the human brain is organized. (It may also arise from the evolutionary results of pressure to reproduce.)(Interestingly, the idea that -compared to ""reasoned"" responses- ""emotional"" responses that come out of a human brain are ""heuristic shortcuts"" that are much much faster and right often enough to be useful, is most definitely _not_ among those used by the book. The book doesn't ""disgree"" with this idea; a better description is the book simply ""ignores"" it, presenting its case without recourse one way or the other to this idea.)A fair amount of evidence from the results of experiments is presented to support these ideas. At the same time, an implicit case is made that these ideas make sense when taken _all_together_, that they support each other ...a lot. Much of the research stems from a rather small group of investigators. The _possibility_ that putting these ideas together is in fact revolutionary and is not yet generally accepted even by many academics is not discussed at all. The book provides a good overview of an entire subject area at a level deeper than a journalistic article but not nearly as deep as the original scientific papers; a little deeper even than Scientific American (and much longer:-), but not so arcane it feels like reading a graduate level textbook."
83,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,4,"Whew! This has been on my to-read list for years, and I've been trying to read it for months, but people keep recalling it from the library. At nearly 600 pithy pages, this book is more than worthwhile despite its age -- now 20 years old! My primary takeaway from reading this was learning how to frame each of our human traits in the context of evolution (natural selection). The ""computational theory of mind"" fits neatly with the pressures of natural selection, evolving us as beings highly adapted to solving problems of survival as foraging peoples. It is fascinating to look at traits not obviously related to survival problems (love, religion, music), although you have to wait until the very end for these juicy tidbits. I do have some criticisms of the book. One is that you really have to slog through some theory before getting to the meat of the book, and I could see a lot of people abandoning the book in the first 100 pages due to this unnecessarily detailed discussion. Another is that Pinker gives outsize focus to the subjects he is seemingly most expert in, like vision, but cultural aspects like music get tacked on at the end in a very superficial way. Also, leaving out the language component simply because he already wrote about it in another book is a pretty big flaw in this one.As a musician, I found the section on music to be woefully lacking, with many of the statements highly objectionable. For example: ""Many movies and television shows literally orchestrate the viewer's emotions from beginning to end with quasi-musical arrangements. They have no real rhythm, melody, or grouping."" Grouping? Does he mean form? Any undergraduate music student could tell you that movie scores consist not only of rhythm and melody, but of form on multiple levels. Pinker goes on to refer to the ""Jaws"" and ""Mission Impossible"" scores as ""pseudo-music."" If the Mission Impossible theme isn't music, I don't know what is! Also, although I enjoyed the discussion of the overtone series, he accepts Schenker as an inherent fact of music rather than a Western construct. He uses the word ""perhaps"" about twice per paragraph in this section, a clear indication that he's going out on a limb when trying to write on this subject. It made me question what specialists in the other fields think about the sections on visual arts, emotion, etc.Finally, I have to take issue with the statements about women and the treatment of gender roles in this book. No matter how many times or how elegantly Pinker qualified his statements as not being what is ""good,"" simply what natural selection has evolved, I could have used a much more nuanced discussion about this in a contemporary context rather than defaulting to referring to the mother as the one responsible for raising the young. Also, where is the discussion of homosexuality and nontraditional family structures? I get that this is probably outside of the scope of this book, but the way these subjects were treated sometimes felt so backwards that it was hard to swallow.But still, read it."
84,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"In this book, Steven Pinker describes our mind - more precisely: our mental faculties - as a complex set of algorithms, sculpted by natural selection. Pinker uses two theories - the computational theory of mind and the theory of evolution by natural selection - to accomplish this amazing feat.According to the computational theory of mind, our mental organs are composed of algorithms, built up out of simpler subroutines which are in turn built up out of subsubroutines. This goes all the way down to the most basic, simplest algorithms that are digital: yes/no, on/off, etc. What it means, in essence, is that we come equipped with pre-programmed mental software with which we perceive the world. This software works is based on certain assumptions - based on the stability and the continuity of physical laws - and it's in the moments that the assumptions don't hold that we are tricked or fooled by our own mind (i.e. cognitive illusions).The other building block of Pinkers story is evolution by natural selection. Evolution shaped all the organisms on this planet, including us. Homo sapiens is unique in its mental capabilities, even though our mind is just one way to solve the natural problems (some others being strong, quick, etc.). I think the theory of evolution by natural selection has been described by excellent writers such as Dawkins, Dennett, Ridley and Zimmer (not to mention Darwin himself, even though his theory of inheritence was flawed), so I will not dwell on it here.Now to Pinkers main thesis: to understand our mind, we have to reverse-engineer our mental organs. In other words: for every psychological trait or phenomenon we have to ask the question 'what was its adaptive function in our ancestors' environment?' It is precisely this question that cuts deep through the delusional paradigms of modern day academicians and intellectuals. The mantra is ""culture determines who we are"". In other words: men rape because they are raised in a culture that's hostile to women. Instead of letting ideology guide science, Pinker approaches the problem from a scientific viewpoint: first describing the facts, then using the simplest theory as possible to explain the data and after this making moral statements. Some examples:In the chapter on Family Values, Pinker tackles the conflicts of interests between parents and offspring, husbands and wives, men and women in general and siblings. He explains these conflicts in terms of different evolutionary strategies between men and women. It pays for men to seek out sex as much as possible; it pays for women to be very selective who to mate with. This is a biological truth that even feminists and neo-marxists/blank slaters can't deny. This fundamental difference leads to competition between men for sexual access to women and to the pursuit of looking young and fertile (i.e. beautiful) between women. One of the most overlooked facts that Pinker mentions in this chapter is that a lot of the incentives for war, rape and murder are sexual motives. Maybe the men joining the army are not so crazy after all: throughout history, one of the most important rewards of victorious armies has been the genocide of men and kids and the mass rape of women. Pinkers paradigm offers new insights into our urge for agression.But this is not all, Pinkers paradigm also offers new insights into our urge to have friends and seek out honest reputations. Evolutionary speaking, it paid to cooperate. The only problem is that this presupposes cheater-detection mechanisms, which are prone to be exploited. One of the most important parts of our social life is the earning of an honest reputation; this shows others that you are a reliable cooperator. A third interesting aspect was the chapter on vision. Pinker analyzes the geometry of paintings and other visual art forms. One of the common threads is the presence of open landscapes with a broad horizon and some places of shelter. This was the environment our ancestors evolved in, it explains our like for these sorts of paintings and surroundings and our dislike for thick forests and deserts. A fourth insight is the way how our ideas are formed. We come equipped with mental software to perceive the world - including the other minds in this world - and to make decisions. These algorithms are heuristic in nature. In other words: they are based on assumptions that normally held in our ancestors' environment. Sometimes we encounter situations where these assumptions don't hold and we fall prey to cognitive illusions. For example, it is commonly known that the frame in which a logical problem is placed determines the effectivity of our judgments.A final important subject to note is the function of our emotions. Our emotions guide are actions, they are the incentives that lead us to chase pleasure and avoid pain. The objects of pleasure and pain are goals, set by evolution. We enjoy sex because organisms (i.e. our ancestors) that enjoyed sex had more sex and thereby had more offspring than organisms that didn't enjoy sex. We enjoy certain foods because our ancestors enjoyed those foods - and those that didn't had less offspring. In a sense, Hume was right when he wrote ""reason is the slave of our passions."" Our passions motive us to seek out the things we enjoy and avoid the things we hate. To summarize: Pinker tries to show that by looking at our psychology as mental organs, consisting of algorithms, that were sculpted by natural selection in the past eons, we have a new paradigm to understand our mind. A paradigm based on two of the most accepted theories in science and one that excludes ideology. Only a realistic understanding of our mental constitution can lead us to appreciate what is good and what should be changed for the better. An informed ethics presupposes evolutionary psychology. Even though I completely agree with Pinker's message and am interested in evolutionary psychology, I can't really recommend this book to laypeople. It would be better, before reading How the Mind Works, to school yourself in evolutionary biology and psychology, because Pinker's style of explaining is not for the faint hearted; he makes use of many terms that presuppose a lot of prior knowledge about the subjects involved. And a thing that annoyed me is the sheer mass of this book: 660 pages. Some chapters contained 90+ pages, which is way too long (in my opinion). But I should not end this review on a sour note, this was a pleasant read and value the various insights I gained from this.On a sidenote: Pinker's treatment of free will and consciousness is confusing. On the one hand, he makes valuable distinctions. So when he deals with consciousness, he makes a distinction between self knowledge, access to information and sentience and explains that the first to senses are in theory explainable by science. This is helpful. On the other hand, Pinker offers no route to answers himself and seems to retreat in a very un-academic mindset with regard to these topics. So in the example of consciousness, even though the first two aforementioned senses are explainable in scientific terms, sentience is not. Even stronger: our mind has been shaped by natural selection to deal with everyday problems and situations, offering the solution to the riddle of sentience not being one of them. In other words: the problem of consciousness is unsolvable in principle and we should not waste any more intellectual effort on this futile search. A very un-scientific mindset. (In 1542 people thought the earth was the centre of the cosmos; in 1543 Copernicus showed the earth to be just another mass of iron orbiting the sun; in the 20th century we discovered that even our sun is not so special: we live in an increasingly expanding universe in which we are just a temporary spec of dust)."
85,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6149613-marcus,3,"As so often is the case with popular science books I’m picking up, I feel that any attempt to review this volume must be done from two different perspectives – literary and in terms of content.If we start with the literary experience, I’ll put it plainly – it was far more difficult read than it had to be and the blame for it rests squarely on the shoulders of the author and the editor. When a book is titled ‘How the mind works’, it shouldn’t come as a big surprise that the reader expects some sort of introduction to the topic defined on the cover. Professor Pinker decided however that the best way to start his book was by launching a vigorous defense of his position on the topic, without really stating what that position is. Next, just to make things even more confusing, he continues with another defense speech, this time around regarding validity of Darwin’s theory of evolution. This ‘introduction’ to the topic at hand takes up about one fifth of the book. I have to admit that while struggling through it I mostly wondered when, if ever, we’re going to get to the actual ‘human mind’ part.Well, we did get there… eventually. The ‘good stuff’ starts off with a discussion about brain and how it (possibly) works on most basic neural level. Next the discussion moves on to sight and its absolutely central role in functionality of human brain and therefore also human mind. And then the course of discussion makes a rapid final change of course and we embark on a guided trip through different aspects of human mind, or in my opinion at least, human behavior. This final part of the book does indeed feel more like a guided tour than deep and meaningful discussion and to be perfectly honest, most of the time left me quite unsatisfied.Content-wise, I suspect that whether or not this book will be to a reader’s liking will depend on one single thing – degree of acceptance of the claim that computational theory of mind is the correct one. The author is one of main advocates of this theory and this volume, once all the unnecessary tangents are peeled of, is nothing more than presentation of its fundamental concepts.Personally I found this book to be a bag of mixed blessings. Perhaps half of it was simply fascinating – I don't necessarily agree with all of the ideas presented by the author, but as long as he stuck to the actual 'explanation', I found it both informative and thought provoking. I was far less impressed by his tangential rants, which in my opinion fail to serve any purpose in a popular science book intended for general public."
86,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,4,"Twenty years have passed since this book was originally published in 1997. And this is still a worthy read for anyone interested in human psychology. Steven Pinker, IMHO, is one of the best science authors of the past decades. His book ""The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined"" is one of my all-time favorites. ""The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature"" is also a brilliant book I often recommend. ""How the Mind Works"" would rank lower on the list of my recommendations simply because the pace of neuroscientific discoveries has accelerated in the last 20 years, and this book, given its magisterial title, lacks discussion of what we have learnt in recent years, for instance, through functional magnetic resonance imaging, etc. For that, please, refer to a truly profound ""Behave"" by Robert Sapolsky, published in 2017. ""How the Mind Works"" focuses quite a lot on human behavior, but Pinker develops this topic in his following books in a much greater detail. Still Pinker packs a lot in this volume. And this will surely be of interest to a lot of people eager for his brilliant style of writing and wit. Read this book if you want to learn about a computational theory of mind, which is still a solid view, not without criticism, on how our brain functions, positing that it is an information processing system, and thinking can be compared to computing. Pinker covers a few other alternative theories, too. I found really fascinating this book's insights on why we like certain art, music, entertainment, colors and music. It is much more rudimentary than most people imagine and is connected quite a lot to whether our vision or hearing processing can cling to some straightforward geometry or sounds. When it was published, it was met with both praise and criticism. Pinker has responded to some of it in ""the Blank Slate,"" which is a great follow-up and, as I mentioned, a perfect read by its own merit. However, if you have time for just one Pinker's book, ""Better Angels"" is his masterpiece. Really looking forward to his next book ""Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress"" due out on February 27, 2018."
87,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68837787-mart,5,"If you are looking for a neurobiology book which would explain how electric impulses and neurotransmitters become thoughts, this is not what you are after. Pinker presents a comprehensive and well documented series of theories, studies, experiments, reasonings and proposals and uses them to build a fully evolutionary view on the psychology of our species. His explanations are grounded on scientific and neurobiological information, in the sense that he takes them into account and doesn’t contradict them, but they work on the psychological level. As a matter of fact, he states that this book is purported to explain how the mind works and not how the brain works. I wouldn’t say though that this is a book recommended for people who are not familiar with the theory of evolution and its contemporary understanding. The book refers to other findings and scientists and employs concepts which in lack of some deeper background in the subject may sound loose or needing specific proof. The style may seem vague or giving things for granted for people who are not familiar with the field and its regular set of internally undisputed facts. All things said, Pinker provides a comprehensive list of notes where all his statements and experiment summaries are linked to a reference or more detailed explanation. This makes the style easier to follow, as he is discussing complex issues which need a lot of focus. The book does take a lot of time to rebuke very common misconceptions about the theory of evolution which would undermine a proper comprehension of its content. This could be seen as useful or as useless, depending on whether the reader needs ir or not. I believe the biggest advantage of this book is that it presents a totally coherent, well researched and thoroughly documented explanation of what we do scientifically know about our minds. If this is what you are looking for and you already know a little bit of evolution, ethology and psychology, you will find it here. Everything that is just a proposal is presented as such, and what is unknown is claimed to be so as well, so you won’t be lured into believing every speculation. "
88,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038815-jc,3,"I don't think this is Pinker's best work, even if it was a best seller and a Pulitzer Prize finalist (so whad-do I know??). My complaints are, I admit, picky. A major work on a complex and broad topic like this needs a a couple of things: a meaningful introduction or opening chapter (his short preface does not suffice) laying out the book's goals and major themes; on the other end, some sort of afterword bringing together the themes into a coherent thesis. Getting to the meat of the book, I did not feel that most of the first chapter was necessary. Chap. 1 kind of wandered, in parts bordered on incoherent, and sometimes seemed to be part of a different work altogether. Again, maybe a serious introduction, final tie-it-all-together chapter, or an afterword may have explained how Chap. 1 fit in. This is significant as the opening chapter (mostly dealing with A.I.) takes up more than 10% of the book. I actually felt that in the opening chapter he strongly contradicted some of his major themes in the rest of the book. However, once I finished schlogging through that, I found most of the rest of the book fascinating (if still in need of some minor editing). The only theme that carried through from chap. 1 to the end was ""reverse engineering,"" and I found both his definition and use of the phrase to be weak. I have heard Pinker lecture more than once, and like much of his other writing (and look forward to his next work, ""Enlightenment Now,"" due out in Feb. 2018), so I don't mean this as a knock on Pinker, his views, or his public output. However, I think here he was trying to do a bit too much in one volume, and kind of stumbled over himself a bit. [it WAS good enough that I did read it all, but I think he has presented the science, and his interpretations of that science, better elsewhere]"
89,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70100482-zo,4,"I probably would give this 5-stars if I hadn’t encountered many of the ideas it discusses already, but there still was a lot I had not considered or new ways of presenting things that made them worthwhile. I found the section on vision/perception fairly boring, but other than that Pinker consistently found interesting ways to discuss the mechanisms of human behavior. It’s one of those books that covers so much that I don’t have any specific strong takeaways, but I am most interested in the idea that some of these explanations which seemed so solid at the time have since been revised by new discoveries (though I’m having trouble remembering what theory comes before what / what is “actually” right on some Q’s). Particularly as I’m almost done with Henrich’s book right now I am very interested in the way he revises many of Pinker’s claims, and how definitive/testable Henrich’s revisions are (for some of them I’m also not sure how much he actually differs). I think generally Pinker’s explanation of feelings and social behavior are most accurate, but his explanation of “higher” human callings, while certainly providing part of the answers, still seems lacking (or maybe that’s just wishful thinking). Also interested in reading how Miller’s book revises some of the survival-based explanations Pinker offers. Curiously, I did find myself at times descending into nihilism about what to do with the knowledge Pinker offers, and the semi-determinist conclusions they provide about human behavior. I’m not sure if that is a product of current mental states, simply having read too much of this stuff recently, or something about the way Pinker presents it, but it at least got me thinking productively about how to integrate these explanations into moral philosophy debates. Look forward to more Pinker in the future."
90,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78846946-chris-hall,3,"A friend of mine gave me this book about ten years ago - only now have I got around to reading it.He raved over it - even going so far as to buy a second copy when he realised that he was unlikely to get back the one he leant me.Having finally read it, I'm not entirely sure why he was so keen on it. It isn't a bad book - it's just dull in places - despite Pinker's genuine efforts to make it otherwise. I suppose it's possible that I didn't get as much as I'd hoped out of it because my background meant I was already familiar with the concepts underlying Artificial Intelligence and natural language processing; if these areas are new to you then there's more to get out of the book.Some thoughts:(*) I was disappointed with Pinker's approach (or rather lack of approach) to transcendent consciousness. This had the potential to be the most interesting part of the book however he largely brushes it aside saying that not enough is known about it for it to be looked at seriously.(*) I don't think Pinker appreciates the extent of the plasticity of brain activity. If he had he may well have considered the existence of some sort of overarching control mechanism that oversees and manages it.(*) While he talks in depth about the mental processes involved in drawing conclusions about the world around us, he doesn't address the question of how it's known when a conclusion has been found."
91,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69405631-steve,4,"Whew! Pretty heavy-going in places. Parts philosophy, computer science and evolution all under the umbrella of cognitive psychology. I learned that the adaptive mutations of evolution produced the brain (neurons, etc) and that the mind (thinking, decision-making, creativity) is the product of the brain. An aha moment came for me when the book said autistic people are ""mind blind."" They perceive the sensory world and can operate in it but (generalizing here) don't understand the world of other people's thoughts or shared ideas. Concepts such as the ""Roaring Twenties"" or ""grace under pressure"" or ""spring fever"" are not singular physical things one can point at like an egg or brick, yet the mind grasps them and their myriad manifestations whenever someone brings them up. How it does that is pretty amazing. Also, though brains across the animal kingdom are made of the same meat, it is the arrangement of that meat that matters--just as books are all made up of letters but the arrangement of those letters leads to vastly different stories.This is one of Pinker's earlier books and it feels a little uneven, diving into complex optical science for seemingly endless stretches, then pulling back to muse on art, music, and humor in light of evolution. I struggled to tie it all together. But I'd like to read it again to make better sense of it all."
92,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2621914-bruce-black,5,"One of the best books I've ever read. Highly recommend. How and why we think and act. And by we I mean everyone, past, present, and future. Evolution isn't a contribution, it's the sole explanation. For everything we do. (HINT: Evolution doesn't really care about your happiness.). That alone is worth reading the book.Some evolution topics covered I found fascinating:•Peer influence vs. family influence. •Conspicuous wealth, conspicuous waste, conspicuous leisure (e.g., art and liberal art degrees!), even conspicuous outrage (current political climate).•War and violence.•Language... Understanding Evolution but lays the ground. Pinker goes much farther. Using computer / computational science and advanced ""thinking"" models / Artificial Intelligence he breaks down the micro programming of the human brain.This is a very readable book, thoroughly researched and written with precision and wit. My only minor qualm is his short chapter on humor. Feels short-shrifted. Someone as witty as Pinker could mine much more here. But, as E.B. White’s said in 1941, “Humor can be dissected, as a frog can, but the thing dies in the process and the innards are discouraging to any but the pure scientific mind.” It changed how I see the world and myself."

And with a bit of philosophy thrown in the mix, naturally, unavoidable when talking about the human mind.Pinker is not only presenting the accumulated knowledge gathered by thousands of scientists and philosophers that came before him, but also grouping the knowledge in a way as to make sense of how it all comes together to define different areas of humanity and human mind.And all of that in enthusiastic but humble way, acknowledging the complexity and uncertainty of what he's trying to do.I'm sure he would have a couple of more worthwhile things to say nowadays, given the rise of AI and a bit more progress science has achieved on the mind and genetics front. This is the only thing I could hold against the book, the fact it could've been longer if it was written yesterday.Great read, keeping the spark of curiosity and thirst for knowledge alive."
94,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75157556-lucas-h-golding,4,"An interesting observational look into the workings of the mind and the deceiving aspects of our senses. There’s no doubt in my mind that Mr. Pinker is a very thoughtful writer. He’s very good at analogies and painting a clear and concise picture of the message he’s trying to portray. I’d say my favorite part of the book is the last chapter which deals with everything from how music supercharges our emotional states to the meaning of humor. The most philosophical argument of the book comes in the explanation of why we as humans have the ability to ask such philosophical questions when paradoxically our brain evolved because of natural selection for solving problems that are related to survival(flight or fight) or reproduction(feed and breed). Why then do we ask ourselves questions such as “Does everyone see the color RED the way I see the color RED?” Pinker appropriately does not try to answer such questions, because most likely there is no answer. Yet it’s hard not to be in awe of the complexities of the mind and it’s inner workings, something this book definitely makes you think about."
95,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,3,"This was an interesting and eye-opening look into how exactly our minds do all the things that we take for granted. Pinker goes through everything from the experience of consciousness to how underlying assumptions behind the way our eyes interpret the world lead to visual illusions. While he sometimes goes in too much death, as in the overly-detailed way that he detailed how our brain interprets visual illusions, he is usually concise and engaging. Similarly, while he firmly plants his arguments in a biological/evolutionary framework, he gives the best explanation for the naturalist fallacy that I’ve ever read. Drawing exact distinctions between what “is” from what “ought” to be and not shying away from arguing how an evolutionary understanding of rape in no way condones the behavior. He emphatically stresses how the same way in which we thwart our genes by putting on condoms before intercourse we can use moral and legal means to thwart what is a morally aberrant mating strategy. I highly recommend this book to anyone who had been curious just how exactly our brains make up our experience of consciousness. "
96,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40215344-mike-hovis,0,"This book is filled with contradictions. The author states up front that he wants to convince the reader that the mind is not the product of some godly vapor or single wonder principle. He maintains the mind is the product of evolution. And yet he cannot talk about the mind or the eye or the ear without words such as “designed”, “engineered”, or manufactured”. I do not dispute that the mind, the eye, the ear, or any other parts of the human body are designed or engineered. The very complexity of these things is evidence of design. But design requires intelligence, a mind that can conceive, design, and bring into being what it has conceived. Natural processes such as natural selection do not possess a mind. A process itself is evidence of a designer who conceived it and set it in motion. That process can only repeatedly do what it was designed to do. Who is the designer of the highly designed eye, ear, mind, etc.? “his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made.” (Romans 1:20 ESV)."
97,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,4,"How the Mind Works is neither a book you can rush through, nor the most updated of texts - the '97 publishing date makes some of the technological metaphors insufficient or full-on outdated. I cannot say I understood everything - in fact, I'm happy with a rough 50% and the self-promise of a reread. Regardless, in my view it's very well researched and written, and gives the reader a new way of seeing everyday things through the lens of evolution and brain mechanics. The first few chapters are somewhat more technical, but form a basis for the more flowing later chapters, which apply the general notions to topics like family and humor.I'll leave some (serious and funny) quotes here, in case I lose the many sticky notes I littered the book with:
[...] the dichotomy between ""in nature"" and ""socially constructed"" shows a poverty of imagination, because it omits a third alternative: that some categories are products of a complex mind designed to mesh with what is in nature.
 - p. 57
We joke that you can't be a little bit pregnant or a little bit married, and after a Canadian survey reportat that married women have sex 1.57 times a week, the cartoonist Terry Mosher drew a woman sitting up in bed beside her dozing husband and muttering, ""Well, that was .57."" 
 - p. 127
Left and right shoes look so alike that children must be taught tricks to distinguish them. [...] Even the English language likes to collapse left and right: beside and next to denote side-by-side without specifying who's on the left, but there is no word like bebove or aneath that denotes up-and-down without specifying who's on top.
 - p. 277
Objects designed for definite purposes can, as a result of their structural complexity, perform many other tasks as well. A factory may install a computer only to issue the monthly pay checks, but such a machine can also analyze the election returns or whip anyone's ass (or at least perpetually tie them) in tic-tac-toe.
 - p. 301
Space and force pervade language. Many cognitive scientist have concluded from their research on language that a handful of concepts about places, paths, motions, agency, and causation undelie the literal of figurative meanings of tens of thousands of words and constructions, not only in English but in every other language that has been studied. The thought underlying the sentence ""Minnie gave the house to Mary"" would be something like ""Minnie cause [house go-possessionally from Minnie to Mary]."" These concepts and relations appear to be the vocabulary and syntax of mentalese, the language of thought.
 - p. 355
People everywhere beseech gods and spirits for recovery from illness, for success in love or on the battlefield, and for good weather. Religion is a desperate measure that people resort to when the takes are high and they have exhausted the usual techniques for the causation of success - medicines, strategies, courtship, and, in the case of the weather, nothing.

It is easy to read, true, but the simpleness of his writing comes at the cost of rigor and depth, satisfying itself with easy answers and haphazard conclusions, which becomes more pronounced in the later chapters dealing with evolutionary psychology.Pinker does raise good points, but unfortunately this does not absolve his poor reasoning, creating a ""sugar with poison"" problem that requires the reader to discern relevant information from utter bollocks, not unlike another Canadian Psychologist that comes to mind, who employs a similar rambling argumentative style instead of backing up his assertions with concise evidence.Regardless, it is what it is, popular science, and I would argue that the sacrifices made are not worth the costs on this one, but that a critical reader will nonetheless be able to take some worthwhile ideas from it."
99,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46735931-daud-khan,4,"An indispensable book if you wish to understand - truly understand - how the mind works (as far as a non-specialist can). The author explains illusions, 3D vision, the structure of language, the combinatorial nature of a brain, and so much more. The central theme is that all of these just cannot be understood without invoking evolutionary psychology, for the simple reason that all of our mental apparatus and or morality, came into existence as a result of evolutionary pressuresSometimes, the author goes into a little too much depth for a book written with a lay audience in mind, but it's mostly extremely lucid.Even if you read nothing of it, the chapter titled ""Family Values"" is an absolutely essential piece. You'll learn why men and women differ, why mothers care for their child (and why fathers are less likely to), why adultery evolved, and when does it not in certain animals. It's truly eye-opening"
100,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul,4,"I think Pinker provides a fairly convincing story for most aspects of this. I was already more or less convinced of the overall concept of the computational theory of mind, and I think Pinker makes some good points about the specific details.Overall it seems well-organized, and the main detraction I see for this is that a lot of his points are ""evolutionary psychology adjacent."" Still, he seems to be on the reasonable side of evolutionary psychology. Ev-psych perspectives that are all based around, ""We do X because it is well-adapted for early human life"" tend to be much less believable, and based on more and shakier premises, than perspectives based on selfish genes, evolutionarily stable strategies and resource allocations in general."
101,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61633703-shannon,2,"I have enjoyed the detail and careful analyses of Pinker's other books and was so excited to read this one. Unfortunately, this book seems full of arguments and strawman fallacies without much empirical support. I was especially disheartened when the topic delved into evolutionary psychology. I was looking forward to an objective and holistic conversation about this topic. Yet, this book only provided the same trite evo. arguments I've heard so many times before without really unpacking the complexities. Furthermore, criticisms to these theories were completely ignored or superficially sprinkled into the conversation (e.g. Eagly & Wood). I wish the book was more balanced with less rants or biases. "

Some of it went over my head, but the majority was a very understandable look out how our minds work.The following is probably the excerpt that sums up the book:""The task of evolutionary psychology is not to weigh in on human nature, a task better left to others. It is to add the satisfying kind of insight that only science can provide: to connect what we know about human nature with the rest of our knowledge of how the world works, and to explain the largest number of facts with the smallest number of assumptions.""For a more practical snip:""A large industry of self-anointed seers hallucinate trends in the random walk of the stock market."" "
103,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72492979-edward-sudall,2,"There is so little substance to this book. The mind processes inputs which results in chaotic yet predictable outputs. The mind is what the brain does. The brain and all brains are evolutionary products which determine the material which is shaped by environments, differently but still can be studied. Okay. Yet saying that the alternative explanations for how the mind works are bad, aren't really explanation, doesn't actually explain how the mind works.If anything this book explains why the mind works - Darwinian selection favoured our intelligent brains. But it's ridiculous long pages of hot air of what statistics show, which is what and not how. To actually know how the mind works (as much as one can) read Robert Sapolsky's Behave. "
104,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11019520-keith,3,"Since I teach AP Psychology, I felt compelled to finish this book in spite of its flaws. The biggest one is the author’s dismissive, embattled tone toward all competing theories and many cultural movements (think feminism or 60’s counterculture). He just often has a strong “get off my lawn” flavor, which is a shame, as his arguments are overall very persuasive. Some parts of the text can be a struggle, in particular his neural models of information processing toward the beginning of the book. I would recommend pushing through (or skipping ahead), as his explanation of vision and description of evolutionary differences between the sexes are much more readable. (Not saying you have to agree with him, though.)"

Behavioral Psychology and the Science of the Brain research together makes an impressive argument for Conscientiousness and the many attributes to the evolution of the mind over 10,000 generations. Wow is all I can say to the amount of research and information The final chapters of the book also expand thoughts on why we are here in the first place as well as the meaning of life. What else can one ask for but a through scientific and psychological study of our thought processes and feelings. I highly recommend this during your time isolated with the COVID-19 scare."
106,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93177186-bicky-marquez,5,"This book navigates the cognitive theory from biological, anthropological, psychological, philosophical and occasionally physiological points of view. The author tries to be highly descriptive, but from time to time mixes a lot of random information. This way of writing is adequate but quite tiresome for the reader, especially when there are ideas that do not require overly elaborate metaphors and complementary examples to make them clear. With this comment I do not try to criticize the author knowledge and all the evident work that this book entailed for him (who seems to me a very brilliant person), I only try to comment on how problematic it can be to read concentrating on certain topics."

Then he goes through several facts knitted together by both theory of evolution and theory of computation to show us how the mind works. Of course the focus is on how our brain has been evolving to cope with all the social interactions needed to thrive within human societies (reproduce?). Let us bet that in few centuries a robot will read this book and laugh-out-loud wondering how such funny people managed to create such fantastic machines."

That's what Steven Pinker tried in ""How the Mind Works"" (1998). Unfortunately the first part of the concept harms the second a bit too much: it's just too much stuff to cover in too many fields, and so, the argumentation has invariably to remain shallow and often reductionistic. Especially when regarding literature and arts, the author proves himself a great neuroscientist (and that's not a compliment).My favourite part is the last one though, about the meaning of life."
109,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7487616-peter-aronson,3,"I would probably given this book four stars if it hadn't been so bombastic at times. Pinker occasionally rants about people whom he feels have wrong ideas, which is unnecessary and distracting. Sorry, but I don't share his outrage. He does do a plausible job of describing a reverse engineering of the human mind using evolution and psychophysics, but doesn't actually prove much of anything. But it is interesting speculation. (BTW, the Kindle edition falls down badly in the matter of the end notes. They are linked from the note section to the text, but not from the text to the notes which makes them essentially useless!)"
110,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75440802-jonatan,4,"Pinker does an amazing job in summarizing the mechanisms of the human mind. His sense of humour makes the long read (565 pages) worth it, but the length of the book is in my opinion also its weak spot. Since almost every single page is littered with such knowledge, you really don't want to rush through this book in a hurry. It ended up taking me three months to get through the whole thing, which to me is quite a lot of time. Did I learn anything? I sure did. Would I read it again? Not from cover to cover, no. But a chapter at a time every now and then, perhaps yes. I have a feeling this title will be a great piece of reference literature in a not too distant future."
111,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75046551-will,5,"Very good book. Very informative. I found that some of the sections on morality and male-female relationships were a bit oversimplified. He almost disregards anything not directly tied in to evolutionary biology as an explanation for our behaviour. The last chapter wasn't great for me. At every single point in human history a problem was touted as ''beyond our understanding'' or ''incapable of being deciphered'', only that to be proven false years later. We might not have figured out how to frame the problem of consciousness correctly, but I am sure someone will figure it out."
112,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85068346-rahul-shah,4,Difficult yet stimulating readThere are books where you come out knowing fully well what you've learned and then there are books which are difficult to reduce to 2-3 key insights. I would put this book in the latter category. Pinker is a great wordsmith but at some places his wizardry comes at the expense of deep understanding of the subject matter. Wish he could have been more accommodating of less eloquent folks like me. Having said that his understanding of his craft is top notch and there are quite a few insights that are gonna remain with me for a very long time. 
113,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75189921-jens-egholm,4,"How the mind works is a compact tour-de-force of psychological principles, and how Pinker believes they relate to the physical matter. The book is packed with analogies, experiments, historical anecdotes and interesting research, and provides a good overview of the complexity of the field(s).The degree of compaction makes the book hard to follow, and many of the presentations are unfounded. While I'll definitely recommend it if you're interested in psychology and cognitive science, I'd suggest starting with other, more accessible books on the topic."
114,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2894543-amin-delshad,5,Yet another brilliant book by Steven Pinker. I was skeptical at first to read a book about evolutionary psychology twenty years after its publication. Surely there have been new research into workings of the mind that would undermine some of the arguments in the book. But it was an entertaining and well-written book nonetheless.Mr. Pinker has definitely been a big factor in my worldview in the past few years and I would like such ideas to gain more mainstream attention.

A great read that brought together a bunch of different research at the time, and still holds as a great foundation in how our minds work (ie, the foundations of human nature).One of my all-time favorite books as well, which I re-read every few years."
116,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47967457-jos,3,"words,words, words...I think I stay with the first chapter definition that ""the mind is a system of organs designed by natural selection to solve kinds of problems our ancestors faced in their foraging wayof life."" And Pinkers whole set-up of the book is to prove that psychology is nothing else than reverse engineering of the brain. After that the book lingers on in endless meanders of thoughts, ideas, opinions, trivia etc.. A bit of a disilusionment as the title promised more. Or the book could have done with 400 pages less. I enjoyed ""enlightenment now"" much more. "

Yet, the humorous style and overall level of quality content make this book still a good piece of popularized science literature. "

It seems like every time I picked this book up, it had something to say that was relevant to something in my daily life (I read it over a period of several weeks). The beginning part was a little bit of a slog, but the book as a whole is well worth it. Anyone interested in cognitive science shouldn't miss this book."

I had read the author's latest book watched a number of his online videos, all of which had to do with either language or modern social issues. This is an exceptional book, offering a thorough and particularly-well-written account of everything we knew about how the brain works at the date of it's writing (1997), from descriptions of language acquisition, to the quest for a ""mechanistic"" understanding of visual processing, to an evolutionary analysis of emotions (this analysis, on chapter 6, was particularly interesting to me).I very much hope the author decides to do a thorough update for a future edition."

199,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5347840-sean,2,"I gave this 5 stars when I first read it several years ago. It struck me while scanning my bookshelf recently that skimming through it again would be an interesting gauge of how much my perspective has changed since.I can't believe how polemical and flimsy it is.I still enjoy some of the meatier middle sections that explain various cognitive/neural machinery, analogies to AI problems, vision, language, illusions, the strange and illuminating phenomena that occur in stroke victims with specific brain areas damaged, and so on. This is the stuff i remember being mindbending the first time. In fact, this book would have been fine about three times shorter, without the overarching thesis or most of the (purported) evolutionary psychology.Why does Pinker have such an axe to grind against feminists and postmodernists? He doesn't seem to know anything about their actual ideas or their critiques of his. He never seems to actually quote any feminists or postmodernists, except little entertaining quips tangential to anyone's argument, famous enough they don't indicate you read the source material. The positions he ascribes to them are the most blatant straw [wo]men. Ironically, in a book arguing that stereotypes are generally accurate, he fails, due to his manifest ignorance of feminism, to see how his own views, style, and attitude would be the stereotype of an elite straight white male liberal, if elite straight white male liberals didn't have the privilege of blissfully considering themselves normative, rather than a minority that can be stereotyped.""Why are masculine-looking women less attractive?"" he asks, without a hint of self-consciousness about the layers upon layers of assholery (it looks slightly less douchey in context, but there's only so much context can do). A sizable chunk of this book is devoted to answering questions like this, or, perhaps equivalently said, asserting the premises of such questions to actually be facts, and not just any facts but biological facts.It gets hard to tell when he's treating stereotype as data and when he's referring to some sort of documented findings. When you do know he's referencing some kind of data, it's not always clear how cross-cultural the samples are (was it just one observation of one tribe? was it a media poll? a survey of elite American college students? oh, but they are the most enlightened possible subjects, best prepared to defy stereotypes! so we don't need to look at anyone else), and you rarely are told any actual numbers. In most of the instances i lose sight of why any given evolutionary explanation isn't a just-so story, what are the cognitive and neural mechanisms involved, and other such roadblocks to greedy reductionism. There's no quantitative nuance nor critical analysis of the assumptions involved with the data. There is just a lot of blanket statements of the form ""men are this way and women are that way.""In one case where he does describe in detail a study purporting to show extreme sex difference (male vs female college students' responses to being asked by ""attractive"" strangers if they'd be willing to have sex that night), he rules out any cultural (as opposed to evolutionary) explanation of the women's 100% refusal rate compared to the men's 75% acceptance by noting that ""when the studies were conducted, contraception was widely available and safe-sex practices were heavily publicized."" Right, evolutionary neural hardwiring is the only imaginable reason the awareness that condoms exist might not be enough to make a woman on an American college campus in 1979 feel safe agreeing to fuck a random guy who just propositioned her on the sidewalk.He rampages across all this controversial territory reinforcing one sexist stereotype after another, with no sensitivity other than the occasionally repeated disclaimer about the naturalistic fallacy and how his choice of words is just adaptationist shorthand. I apparently took these caveats to be more genuine the first time i read it, but i couldn't read it so charitably this time. I considered myself a feminist then too, but i was clearly a naive one; it's interesting the effect that a few years of shifting interests from mainly science and analytic philosophy to literature, history, art, and cultural theory have had on me."
200,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9809633-matthew,4,"As I have said before when reviewing non-fiction, it is difficult for me to write a very effective review on a subject that is not my area of expertise. If you wish to read a detailed analysis or critique of Steven Pinker’s opinions, then this review is probably not your best starting point.However, I did find the book very interesting and will offer a small number of observations about it. The title may prepare the reader for a study of psychology or even philosophy. However, this is not Pinker’s speciality. For him, understanding the mind is a matter of understanding neurons. Everything about our perception and understanding (in Pinker’s assessment) comes from the way that neurons have evolved within our brain, and this is how he seeks to understand everything, including visual perception, intelligence, consciousness, emotions, personality, human relationships, war and art.Of course many of these items are offered tentatively, and it is possible to reject the theories offered by Pinker, even while continuing to share his belief in neurons. Indeed, some notions take quite a bit of stomaching, including his notion that art is purely a maladaptive by-product of the neurons designed for something else.In fact, there is much in Pinker’s views that will be unpopular with many sections of society. He rejects the narrow behavioural models of Skinner et all, arguing that the neurons form a more complicated assessment of human reactions than simply responding like automata to stimuli. Feminists will not be comforted by Pinker’s insistence on genuine natural gender differences fired up by the neurons, rather than by society. Indeed, any functionalist view of society falls foul of Pinker’s ideas that root the development of everything from sibling rivalry to warfare in an understanding of neurons and the mind. Indeed, Pinker even appears to believe that our genetic make-up is more important to our personalities than the quality of parenting that we receive.This is not to say that Pinker denies human responsibility however, and he certainly does not argue that all bad things are ‘human nature’ and cannot be changed. He points to the many areas of our existence that can be changed, while holding a realistic assessment of the way the mind works on this, and that some of this lies in our genetic programming.The religious will not be greatly comforted by Pinker’s analysis either. Pinker expresses his awe for the wonderful creation of the body, and points out that robots still have not achieved the visual and motor skills of the human body, or the ability to make abrupt decisions by processing the data.However, this does not inspire an awe for a Creator, and Pinker firmly attributes this to evolution. Pinker is more likely to look to Darwin, Dawkins and Dennett for solutions, not Genesis, Jehovah or Jesus. Pinker is dismissive of religions throughout. He refers to religion in his final section on maladaptive practices brought about by neurons. Even in his section on why religions have different beliefs about foodstuffs that do not have any basis in health considerations, he suggests that possibly the reason for these distinctions is to keep people from different religions apart since they cannot eat together.The last section of the book is about the Meaning of Life, but of course we get no answer offered to this question. In considering our inability to process moral and philosophical conundrums in a consistent way, Pinker breathtakingly comes to the conclusion that this is outside the perceptual values honed by evolution in much the same way that some forms of vision would be outside the range of other species.I will not say anything more about the sections of the book but will leave you to read and judge for yourself. Much of the book is accessible, and raises interesting questions, while bringing in an impressive range of educated and cultured references. I could not follow all of it, due to my dull unscientific brain, and I may have occasionally not felt persuaded by all Pinker’s views. However, the book is certainly one that stimulates thought, and has made me more consciously about how I mentally shape the world around me."

202,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38063199-ferruccio-fiordispini,4,"The author is a well-known and recognized expert in psychology and cognitive neurosciences. He is an absolute authority at an academically level. He is also an excellent speaker, the web is full of his lectures, conferences, interviews, all of them very interesting.Very interesting is also this book dedicated to the human mind and how it works. It’s a well-documented book, rich of data and information, which is based on two fundamental theories, both of them fully embraced by Pinker. The first theory is about the ""computational brain""; the second theory is about the ""selfish gene.""The first part of the book, the longest and most informative (and sometimes too boring and detailed, which is the reason why I am giving only 4 stars to this book), is in fact devoted to the explanation and mechanisms of the computational brain (Pinker is actually the major champion of such a theory).According to Pinker ""the mind is a system of organs of computation (designed by natural selection to solve the problems posed to our ancestors by their status as hunter-gatherers) that allowed our ancestors to understand and outsmart objects, animals, plants, and each other”. The mind is what the brain does. In particular, the brain processes information and thinking is a kind of computation. This allows us to do many comparisons and connections between a human brain and a compute, and open the way to the concept of artificial intelligence. However Pinker shows, in a very clear and effective way, why a robot very unlikely will ever have a brain that functions even remotely to that of a man, despite the similarities in their working mode.Furthermore, according to Pinker, intelligence is the pursuit of objectives beyond obstacles. Without goals, the same concept of intelligence is meaningless. This idea opens the way to the pages that include the emotional and relational aspects, those based on the theory of the ""selfish gene"" (theory formulated by the biologist Dawkins, as a way of expressing the gene-centered view of evolution). This is the richest and most stimulating part of the book, in my opinion, and it definitely deserves the 5 stars.Beyond any adherence to the philosophical part of this theory (which apparently, but only apparently in my opinion, leads to an absolute atheism, which Pinker professes as a convinced Darwinian), the ""selfish genes"" explain very well the cognitive and behavioral patterns of the human brain. Hence the importance of evolutionary emotions, overcoming the abstract concept of the triune brain proposed by Mac Lean many years ago.The genes are ""selfish"", in the sense that they are equipped with a sort of ""natural instinct"" of self-assertion and self-reproduction, and thanks to the mechanism of natural selection they ""wire"" the human brains (and those of other animals) in such a way as to reach their goals. The ""wiring"" consists of the neuronal patterns that are created at birth and grow stronger with the experiences of life. According to Pinker, ""behavioral and cognitive tactics as assertiveness and conservatism are attributes like any other and, after having invested many resources on them during the childhood, a young person becomes increasingly reluctant to go through the learning curve to grow new strategies to relate to others”.In very concrete terms, Pinker acknowledges that human personalities described by psychologists, namely those of the model B-5 (expressiveness (extroversion-introversion); neuroticism (anxiety-stability); amiability (agreeableness -antagonism); conscientiousness (reliability-superficiality ); openness (imaginative-closed)) are the results of: 50% genetics, 45% chance and only 5% environment and especially parents education.I have bluntly summarized what Pinker explains in a much more articulated and argued way. Certainly I strongly suggest reading the last part of this book to all those who are interested in psychology and neurosciences."
203,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8715301-nderson,2,"A huge book attempting to demonstrate that the human mind (and pretty much all humans know as reality) is the product of evolution and does not involve any kind of intelligent design or purposeful sequence of events.PROSIf you want a really comprehensive book on the nature of the human mind, look no further! This book really takes the time to explore different aspects of this area of study. Each one of the chapters can easily be considered a book on its own, exploring topics as diverse as kinship, vision, arts and even music. After finishing it, you will certainly feel you have learned some things you did not know; or even better, you will feel that the author has given you a new perspective in different elements of human life and the world. I found his description of relationships between men and women to be as straightforward as it can get, and because of that it was interesting to read; especially because the author has a sense of humor that (although approaching offensive sarcasm too nearly) will give you a smile once in a while during the reading. Lastly, this book is well documented and you will get the feeling that the author is well prepared to deal with the issues he proposes.CONSThe author has a tendency of offering more examples than necessary to the point that it becomes boring and one almost feels he is just trying to show-off. In fact, any person wanting to read this book should know that the author’s intention is not that of opening dialogue about the nature of human mind, he is not interested in knowing anything about other people’s opinions unless they support his, or serve as a good example of how ridiculous it is to differ with what he is presenting. I found it amazing that for more than 500 pages this man truly attempts to prove that virtually everyone out of his field and posture is wrong. He really has a great mind and the reader will notice it, but after a while the feeling will not be that of having a teacher wanting to teach you something, but that of a scholar who is so embedded in his own thought that could not care less about his students. This literary pride is well manifested in his treatment of the humanities and arts as something of minor importance and a mere exercise that entertains humans who attempt to gain significance. Music, art, and faith, for the author all fall into the futile attempt of humans to think that they are actually significant in any way. As a religious scholar, I particularly found his treatment of Christian faith and Scriptures to be irresponsibly amateurish at best. As I read I could not help but wonder what would the author think if someone out of his field would speak with the same boldness about his areas of expertise.CONCLUSIONThis book is the perfect example of what can be accomplished when a person delves so much into his field of studies that he slowly forgets the need for any other sources of scholarship. The author’s effort and presentation are commendable, indeed this will probably be his “Magnum Opus;” Nevertheless, his lack of sensitivity to the heritage of humanity and his ardent affinity to pure logic (I do not even say science for many of his concepts depend heavily in assumptions that he simply considers to be logical without much ado), lessen the impact of this book dramatically. Indeed if you come from the same school of thought as the author, or if you are easily persuaded, you will take this as one of the greatest books you have ever read; but those of us who do not exude the same trust in our mere intellection and who think they can learn from diverse positions, will soon find this this book to be pretentious and unnecessarily long. If you are really eager to be convinced that all you are and know is nothing more than a random accident of evolution in millions of years, and you have a lot of spare time, then this book is clearly for you."
204,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893735-joseph-sverker,0,"I would say that this is the best book by Pinker. The Language Instinct is excellent in explaining language and works well as a compliment to this one since it is Pinker's main area. In this book Pinker combines his understanding of language with his view of the computational theory of the mind and then adding on evolutionary psychology. He does this in a interesting and at times thought provoking way and even succeeds to be enlightening. And this is done with less of an axe against sociology and 'culture theories' than in The Bland Slate. And I can't for the world understand how he could write The Blank Slate after this. I really struggle to see what he says in that one that isn't already in this book. Talk about writing the same book twice.Anyway, I think Pinker is strong in explaining language and I find his argument against the argument that language controls our thinking (Wittgenstein, Derrida et al) is worth taking note of. He argues instead that language shows how we think and he does this convincingly. I also think that Pinker put forward a worthwhile theory on our thinking. I am not sure that our thinking can be summarized by the computational theory of the mind, but I do not myself have arguments to refute it. So I suppose he does a good job.Then enters evolutionary psychology and I have to say that I do think myself that biology and bodies must have some affect on who we are and how we act, and when Pinker is a little more humble in his claims I think it can be correct. But evolutionary psychology always enters the same beaten track - we evolved in a foraging environment and our psyche is completely formed by that so..., or so... And yes, something of our evolutionary history must affect who we are, but evolutionary psychology as a theory of everything about human psychology (and culture) that really is stretching it for me and I think that shows when it comes to Pinker's writing on art, culture and religion. The argument is coherent, but it feels as if it is lacking in substance and complexity. It is nowhere near in capturing what art, literature, music and religion is, or could be, or probably is in the human society. In this case my view is that the evolutionary perspective works as a Procrustean bed and Pinker makes the concepts fit his argument. And my view is that this comes down to Pinker being very unwilling to giving any influence of culture over the individual mind. Culture, for Pinker, cannot work as a power of influence over people, but culture is the sum of individual choices and minds. I disagree with that and think also that this view is inconsistent with Pinker's own thinking when it comes to morals.Pinker is making a strong distinction between is and ought in his writing in order to save himself from the accusation that what we find in nature is also how we ought to act, or behave (male sexual instinct rampaging unchecked for example). I agree with him, but Pinker argues for this distinction based on a social contract theory, which is to my mind some sort of appeal to the power of culture. Anyway, I suppose there will be more developed thoughts on this in my dissertation.On the finishing note I must say that I enjoy reading Pinker and much of that comes back to a slight unwillingness to completely subscribe to easy solutions. He is, first of all, well read, although I suspect he hasn't read the philosophical references all that deeply all the time and he tries to give a somewhat nuanced picture of a fair number of issues. But he is of course fully convinced of his evolutionary naturalist worldview, so the nuances doesn't stretch terribly far at times. But I do like the fact that he acknowledges the real problems of the question of free will, sentience, meaning and knowledge. That is certainly to his credit."
205,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41639988-pouria,1,"I tried to read this book. Tried twice.In 2016 I started looking for books about brain/mind and this book came up with high ratings. I read the first chapter but I couldn't even finish it.Again in 2017, disturbed by the fact that I know so little about the mind I decided to re-read this book. I read Consciousness Explained by Denett before it but it was too difficult for me.I'm now in chapter 4 and can't go any further. I'm quitting, forever, for the same reasons that I quit the first time I tried to read this book:Lack of structureThis ~700 page book consists of only 8 chapters. And the writer gives you no clue about what these chapters are going to be about or how the book is organized. No roadmap, no summary, nothing. I'm just a layman reading. I need to know what's going to happen next. I need to be guided through the book. But Pinker doesn't do that.Extremely bad at keeping the reader engagedIt's like he is talking to himself. The book doesn't present problems as it should. Doesn't care if you are still interested after pages and pages of unnecessary explanations. I feel like I'm sitting in a class where the professor has his back to us, talking about things that he finds interesting and writing things on the blackboard for hours without even turning back to see no one is listening to him any more.Loads of unrelated materialI was just reading chapter 4, The Mind's Eye. For pages and pages and pages he keeps telling us about the history of optical illusions. Who invented which, how they work, how 3D glasses work, how they came around the problems with the 3D glass, how VR glasses are different from them, etc. I am not interested!! Just get to the point. A single simplified example suffices for God's sake. You don't need to explain every single aspect of optical illusions to me just to make a point about how the brain unifies the pictures from the two eyes. Which is in turn just to illustrate something about the mind.Also in chapter 1 he goes into very long details about how a robot perceives it's surroundings and stuff like that.In chapters 2 and 3 he goes to LENGTHS to justify his view about human nature, and also explain how natural selection works and how everything else is wrong. I AM NOT READING THIS BOOK TO LEARN ABOUT NATURAL SELECTION! Just get to the point. He goes on and on to prove why this school of psychology or that view about evolution is wrong. This constitutes most of chapters 2 and 3. Being bad at explaining thingsAnd after all these, when he actually tries to explain something about ""how the mind works"", he fails. I cannot understand what he is saying.I have had the pleasure of reading The Fabric Of The Cosmos by Brian Greene. He explains things magically. The Selfish Gene is also an amazing book. I knew a lot about physics and evolution after reading those books. And they also don't dumb it down too much.But when reading this book I feel like I'm reading an unknown language.The unrelated parts about how robots see or how 3D movies work are easy to grasp. But when he gets to the real thing he really sucks. Maybe that's why he keeps going on and on about unrelated things.PS: This is my review after I read this book for the first time more than a year ago. After reading 3 more chapters than the first time it's now obvious to me that it's not me, it's Pinker:Does this book even have an editor? It looks like Pinker has written all of it in one sitting, not having a picture in mind or looking back to realize how off-topic he is going. He is explaining something and in doing so he goes to explain something else and something else and so on. This book has no structure. Not to mention all the unnecessarily long explanations of details.Left reading it because couldn't learn anything from it."

208,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4474523-ashleearev,5,"Pinker’s book How The Mind Works is a very interesting book for those people who are interested in the science of the mind, like psychology or neuroscience. The only thing I could say was a downfall is how long the book is; reading this book took a lot of time but other than that I would totally recommend it. This book makes you think; why do memories fade? What makes us laugh? Why do fools fall in love? Why do we need robots when we are the actual living things that have the ability to read? The brain is such an important organ in our body and according to Pinker we don’t give it enough credit. He explains a lot of about our minds, and how common sense is not common. Confusing? Not really because common sense is different in every person so really its not common. He explains what the mind is and how the brain is not the mind, how it evolved, how it allows us to see, think, feel, and ponder the mysteries of life, between other things. He wrote, “The mind is a system of organs of computation, designed by natural selection to solve the kinds of problems our ancestors faced in their foraging way of life, in particular, understanding and outmaneuvering objects, animals, plants, and other people” (p. 21). And he compared the human mind with machine computation to show how humans can design a computer to appear to be thinking, when it fact is it not. One of the most interesting topics was the genetics it also talked about, for example, the parent/child conflict, sibling rivalry, and the development of personality. It was an interesting part because it focuses on the genetic of the child. So two twins that were brought up separately would have a similar personality, while two adopted children brought up in the same household would not share a common trend, and are as similar to each other, as two random children pick from a list. And also the computational theory of the mind that allows us to keep beliefs and desires in our explanations of behavior while planting them squarely in the physical universe. Basically, Pinker says that the computational view of the mind means that consciousness - the ability of the mind that experiences stimuli and thought- has no apparent function. That people could go through the some sort of mental activity without experiencing any of it. He says there is no way to prove that the person sitting next to you is not a ""philosophical zombie,"" who acts like they think and feel but is really just a mechanical thing. Now ask yourself, am I real? Is your teacher, your pet, your friend real? I learned that without the computational theory, it is impossible to make sense of the evolution of the mind. And that even though Pinker tries to explain as best as he can how the mind works, no one really knows.Overall, I found this book to be very interesting, I even learned that President Reagan was shot because John Hinckley, the shooter, wanted to impress a girl! I don’t regret reading it since I would like to study neuroscience in the future and this has certainly helped understanding the brain and how it works. I definitely recommend it if you are willing to devote your time to learning and understanding a little bit better how the human mind works. "
209,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1899624-zach,4,"When it comes to non-fiction, I'm always on the lookout for the next Big Picture Book -- a book with a simple thesis that possesses startling explanatory power into how the world works. For modern economics and culture, there's Naomi Klein's No Logo: No Space, No Choice, No Jobs. For world history and ethnography, there's Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel. For the human brain, there's this book.Pinker's thesis is very simply stated: the human brain is an organ designed by natural selection to equip our ancestors to survive and reproduce in a very specific environment, and is therefore adapted to particular tasks. For brain functions as diverse as image processing, language, and abstract thought, Pinker lays out a very compelling reverse-engineering argument as to how these capabilities must have been selected for among our primate ancestors. His basic goal is to establish a clear-cut case that a ""human nature"" exists, and to describe how it was sculpted by natural selection. This idea is incredibly offensive to a large part of academia, who embrace the ""blank slate"" model of human behavior, and so Pinker spends quite a lot of time preemptively defending his thesis from these critics.One of his most interesting chapters involves what he calls the ""cognitive niche,"" the evolutionary space that allows a large problem-solving organ like the brain (which uses an incredible amount of our bodies' calories) to be a positive adaptation. Pinker makes a strong case that the kind of general-purpose intelligence that we possess is anything but inevitable in an evolutionary process -- after all, it has only evolved once so far. It might seem a prosaic insight, but it flies in the face of a thousand years of thought, including most post-Darwinian theorizing, that touts such metaphors as the ""great chain of being"" and the ""evolutionary ladder."" Rather, our intelligence came to be (and could only have come to be) in very particular circumstances, after a number of prerequisites had been fulfilled -- including good stereoscopic vision, social living, hands, and hunting.The book's main flaw is that Pinker doesn't seem to understand who his audience is. Passages alternate between pedantically technical and ploddingly simple, as if he's writing for a layman one minute and a biologist the next. This gets especially bad during his bizarre, lengthy defense of natural selection as the agent of evolution, as well as when he's explaining neural networks. Frustratingly, these long, dense passages only exist to show that the status quo is wrong in some subtle respect that he never fully enunciates.All in all, though, this book is an excellent introduction to evolutionary psychology, and shouldn't be missed."
210,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7231894-chris-branch,4,"I first read this after it came out about 15 years ago and was already becoming a big fan of Pinker. Reading it again now, I see that I'd forgotten much about his forceful defense of evolutionary psychology - probably because it was only a few years ago that I recognized that it needed defending. It's such a powerful explanatory tool that there is clearly some truth to it, regardless of the exact details about the mind's modularity. So at the time I read this, it was a fascinating introduction to what I assumed would be the accepted state of the art of scientific thought in this area. Now, with critics bashing EP for reasons as much about political correctness as they are about rigorous science, it's worth re-reading Pinker's clear and confident assurances of its validity.There is extensive discussion of and reliance on the knowledge of evolution in general, which of course is exactly how it must be - to understand why a body part looks or behaves the way it does, it has to be viewed in light of the process that it resulted from. The mind is not exempt from natural selection, and it's strange that many people who know better claim that it should be. While the basics of evolution may be already familiar to readers from other sources, and some of the material, such as the list of hominid ancestors, may have become outdated in recent years, Pinker's writing is so good that it's nevertheless a pleasure to read.He also managed to brilliantly shut down the free will debate back when I was obviously still fuzzy on it (since I later went on to read Dennett's overly complicated attempts at justifying claims of its existence) on p. 55: ""...ethical theory requires idealizations like free, sentient, rational, equivalent agents whose behavior is uncaused, and its conclusions can be sound and useful even though the world, as seen by science, does not really have uncaused events"". Seems like I would have gotten the point if I'd been paying better attention!There are numerous other surprisingly clear explanations of initially mysterious phenomena, from stereo vision to emotion to categorization. On the other hand, some of the explanations do seem a bit overly laborious now, either because some of what he explains really has become accepted and now goes without saying, or maybe just because the computation related explanations are common knowledge among software professionals. But you have to admire the well-structured way that the reader is led through the arguments to their logical conclusions.Bottom line: as bluntly audacious as the book's title may seem, Pinker actually does achieve his goal. The explanation in this book really is, to the best of our knowledge, how the mind works."
211,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,4,"The beginning sections of this book on consciousness, visual perception, cognitive structure, and how the structure of language can illuminate the way that the brain actually processes information are excellent, and worth the price of the book right there. In particular, I don't think you will find many more interesting discussions on how seeing works than Pinker's description of why so many people are frustrated by Magic Eye diagrams (personally, I've always despised them, and now I know why!). As a hardcore work on intelligence those parts don't reach the heights of Marvin Minsky's godlike book The Society of Mind, as few books by mortals can ever hope to, but they're still quite good. The later sections of the book, however, are much less focused and seem to be more about social structure - i.e. the interaction of many minds - than about the mind, per se. I suppose they're justified because most if not all social behavior can be explained as epiphenomena of the way that our brains are wired, and he did find ways to ground things like incest taboos to the evolutionary explanations he brought up in the first few parts, yet I kept wishing he would go back to talking about all of the neat things psychologists have learned about how to fool our systems of perception and what that says about the brain rather than snarking about academic debates over gender roles. As a side note, I can't help but think that Pinker must have been a huge hippie back in the 60s and 70s, and is working out some issues with that part of his life in his works. The Family Values chapter in particular is rife with a peculiar mix of open contempt for the peace-and-love sentiments of stuff like John Lennon's Imagine, along with heavily qualified semi-assurances that the stifling conservative cynicism that John Lennon was opposing is equally misguided and not supported by any natural or biological laws. Pinker never contradicts himself, exactly, you just definitely get the impression that maybe he had recently found some pictures of himself in bell-bottoms or something and is trying to exorcise some bad memories through popular science non-fiction by taking a ""the answer is in the middle!"" half-stance. It definitely doesn't have the same sense of scientific rigor that the first half of the book did, anyway. Thankfully he expanded the better parts about the history of violence into his recent excellent book The Better Angels of Our Nature (which still has some questionable hippie-bashing, yet is still a cohesive work on its own). Overall I would recommend to inhale everything up to the Hotheads chapter, and then afterwards try to keep an eye out for buried gems like his discussion of the brain's mysterious relationship to music, which is a nice complement to full-length books like Daniel Levitin's The World In Six Songs. Overall quite good."
212,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7590182-msimone,4,This book is a keeper- thought provoking and informative about how language ability develops from an innate instinct in homosapiens. Pinker debunks evolutionary theories such as by disproving whether chimpanzees communicate as humans do through universal language. I particularly enjoyed the discussions about Sign Language and spoken language that illustrates how the use of signs is a grammar of its own developed as spoken language and as meaningful. Pinker is a student of Chomsky but separates from his theories of transformational generative grammar in several ways.His arguments are easy to follow throughout and I highly recommend it to those like myself who have questioned how all languages evolved from one language into many dialects across the world. It is fascinating to discover that universal language grammar underlies all languages.
213,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26117407-david-schwinghammer,4,"Steven Pinker, director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at MIT, argues that the mind is a computational computer. He uses Darwin's concept of reverse engineering to show how most of man's mental and emotional traits evolved.Pinker also shows how the mind was designed by natural selection to solve the kinds of problems our ancestors faced in their hunter/gatherer existence, which may be why we have such trouble explaining such esoteric concepts as consciousness and sentience.Pinker does not have a whole lot of respect for Freud, B.F. Skinner, or the Standard Social Science Model, which views the mind as a blank slate at birth. He disdains a moral approach when discussing natural selection, which gets him in trouble with feminists among other value-laden ""isms"". Instead, he argues for a ""module-packed mind"" that ""allows both for innate motives that lead to evil acts and for innate motives that can avert them.""When discussing the computational mind, Pinker spends a lot of time on the eye. He shows how the eye evolved from light sensitive skin tissue, how humans developed stereoscopic vision leading to a bigger brain, how the brain tricks us into believing that matter is solid, and how seeing in color and in three dimensions led to more brain capacity. Pinker even shows us how the ""Mind's eye"" works. The eye connects to the brain, but the brain also connects to the eye.Emotions began with the family and extended to non-family because foragers lived in groups. We love people who carry our genes. Pinker shows how the emotions evolve from the family to non-family relationships using reciprocal altruism. If you grant a favor to another (such as supplying him with meat) and he later returns the favor, you like him. If he cares for you when you are sick with no apparent compensation, you grow to love him. Cheaters inspire other emotions such as anger and resentment and the list grows. Guilt happens when we're cheating and we know it. Sympathy is an emotion for gaining gratitude. Body language ensures that emotions are hard to fake. Most people have scam detectors; you can tell the difference between a real smile and that of a beauty contestant.Pinker also discusses bi-products of natural selection such as religion, music, philosophy and art. As mentioned earlier, we are blessed (or cursed) with a forager's brain. ""The intellect evolved to crack the defense of things in the natural and social world,"" not answer such questions as ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" We are lucky our stone-age minds do as well as they do when tackling complex scientific problems."

215,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6141341-nikolaos-korasidis,5,"In writing this book, Pinker does for the mind what Maxwell did for electromagnetism; he assumes axioms, he derives propositions and he submits them to empirical tests. The axioms are physicalism and the tenets of evolution, that is, the mind is the product of the brain and the brain is --as every other trait of the human body-- an organ designed by evolution. The propositions are assertions about the senses, perception, abstract thought, human psychology, consciousness, personal relationships, ethics and so on. The empirical tests are findings reported in books and papers published in the fields of cognitive science, evolutionary psychology and similar.This is such a unique approach to the human condition, that the book would be invaluable even if the endeavour failed. It is hard to imagine what an explanation of the mind would look like, yet this book provides a bold, wide and exclusively scientific prototype. It is surprising how many issues about human psyche can be illuminated just by framing the questions as evolutionary 'objectives': ""how does trait X help people survive and reproduce in a pre-modern society""? By asking questions in that way again and again, Pinker frees himself from irrelevant stuff (like political correctness, historical contingencies, etc) and allows us to focus on the problem at hand. The shift in attitude compared to classic psychology, with its emphasis on subconsciously repressed thoughts accompanied by myriads of ad hoc syndromes, is drastic.Even more stunning is the fact that the book delivers; all that elegance and simplicity does actually get the job done. The explanations offered are crisp, the deductions are easy-to-follow, the nature of the phenomena seems finally uncovered. There are no appeals to obscure ideas, there are no apparent problems from which the author hides away and there is scarcly any proposition that is not also borne out with experimental data. In nutshell, the book reads (and feels) like a cognitive tour-de-force, a hallmark of evolutionary reasoning applied to the most perplexing component of our biological design.I enjoyed both the axiomatic approach as well its success, and reaped a lot of methodological and factual insights. I fully recommend it to everyone that is eager to investigate the implications of evolutionary theory on human condition, as well as to anyone who feels unsatisfied with the current exegesis of how Homo Sapiens came to be."
216,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856337-mark,3,"There have been hundreds of reader reviews of HOW THE MIND WORKS, published way back in 1997. What I have to say won't add much to the discussion. Nevertheless, here we go! Considering Steven Pinker's arguments in HOW THE MIND WORKS and beginning to comprehend the author's thought processes have certainly been interesting and rewarding challenges. The book got me thinking and challenged me in many new directions. I would recommend this book on these bases alone!Having said that, I may have discerned more plausible (albeit indirect) claims to truth arising from the fictitious novels of Charles Dickens, which I happen to be reading and re-reading over this same one-year time period (Yes, I've been digesting Pinker SLOWLY!). Dickens doesn't actually ""prove"" any of his inferences about the human condition, but then again Pinker's so-called ""reverse-engineering"" of the mind according to the principles of evolutionary and behavioral psychology does not really do much of that either.Both a strength as well as a possible weakness of this author is his ability to think out loud in ways which the average reader understands. He is brilliant. However, this results in a book which is unnecessarily lengthy (673 pages for the print version-- I plodded through EVERY page) and at times more than a little self-congratulatory. Though rather humble compared to some of the authors he likes to quote, Pinker sometimes can be found in these pages to be preaching to his choir. He at times sets up straw men, and takes unjustified cheap shots at those with whom he disagrees. His casual treatment of a few religious texts is unprofessional for a supposed scientist. What makes these occasional unsupported cheap shots more abhorring is that he rarely supports his own arguments with actual substantiated data. Though extremely interesting and a window on the direction of future scientific discovery, there seems to be lack of solid evidence and support for many of the enticing (and seemingly in line with common sense) ideas about love, family, taking care of siblings-- even the basic assertation that the mind is a computational machine. Other ideas are just old rehashes. In conclusion, however, let me reiterate that this is still a book which will challenge your thinking. Keep working through it."
217,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5883146-eric-wallace,4,"Pinker aptly summarizes his book somewhere in the last chapter thus: ""The mind is a neural computer, fitted by natural selection with combinatorial algorithms for casual and probabilistic reasoning about plants, animals, objects, and people. It is driven by goal states that served biological fitness in ancestral environments, such as food, sex, safety, parenthood, friendship, status, and knowledge.""To expand on that a just a bit: through the eight long chapters of the book Pinker tries to cover major systems of the human brain (visual, memory, logic, deduction, etc.) and brain-related human characteristics (social behavior, emotions, art), considering specifically their ""adaptive design"" -- that is, how such a thing could have come to exist as we know them now through eons of natural selection. Throughout he leans heavily on the ideas proffered by John Tooby and Leda Cosmides, who invited him to spend a year with them at the Center for Evolutionary Psychology at UC Santa Barbara, spawning this book. (He argues the fitness of their theories quite well, perhaps increasing their chances of survival, if you will.)Conspicuously absent from the many facets discussed is that of language -- but of course he has more than thoroughly covered that subject in his earlier book, ""The Language Instinct"". If you are at all interested in languages and linguistics, I'd highly recommend that read.Alas, while Pinker does make comparisons with various models of machine learning which try to emulate some portion of the mind's reasoning ability, he is hardly able to explain the ""how""of ""how the mind works,"" as the title might lead you to believe -- perhaps in part because we understand so little about as of yet. But in accepting the task of laying out so much of what we do understand of the mind's functions -- and explaining them in such a way that the reader does not require expertise in cognitive science, psychology, and biology -- Pinker has given us curious readers quite a gift."
218,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6645592-mark-seemann,3,"Metaphorically speaking, this work starts with much hemming and hawing. It's clear that Steven Pinker has written, taught, and spoken about the subject of the human mind before, and that he's had his share of run-ins with people who strongly disagree with his view on the matter.Much effort is spent refuting hypothetical nay-sayers; Freudian psychologists, religious authorities, politically correct activists, prejudiced people, and so on. Pinker's agenda is to be as scientific as possible, which means attempting to explain the human mind by forces of nature and biology.As a scientifically inclined, atheist reader who's already read Dawkin's popular introduction to the subject of evolution (The Selfish Gene), I found the first couple of hundred pages hard to come through. All that pre-emptive defence against counter-arguments runs in open doors with me; it only gets repetitive.It didn't help that the language required my entire attention. In some sense, I think the book is well-written; it uses helpful analogies and metaphors, it's satisfactorily technical when it needs to convince me, and sprinkled (sparsely) throughout the text is a sophisticated, although dry, wit. In another sense, the language is sometimes hard to decipher, and I had to read many sentences twice or thrice before I could pick up the meaning.It does get better once it gets going, though. The chapters on relationships and sexuality were both insightful and compelling, so I'm happy that I kept reading.In all, I think this was a tour de force of a work. As always, I write my review immediately after completion, while I'll only know how much I got out of the book when the dust has settled. I think, however, that I learned a thing or two. Still, it was a long book, and, for long stretches, a dry reading experience."

The first few chapters covered material I already knew and thus moved slowly, but once we got into material I wasn't familiar with, the book was pretty interesting. There were a few places where the author's own biases were on display, but that's true of all of us.The book is twenty years old, so it's out of date with current research, but I don't think that would impede the enjoyment of the casual reader. I'd recommend it if you are interested in the subject (with the caveat that I have not looked to see what else is available on this subject that is more recent - I was actually looking for a different title by this author at my library and picked up this book in its stead)."

I don't agree with his strong leanings towards Evolutionary Psychology in terms of the strong modularity thesis of mind, or the Pleistocene environment of evolutionary adaptedness, but I think the push for evolutionary explanations of our psychology is a useful one.My main issues were with style/structure. Pinker covers a huge range of material in a fairly haphazard fashion, with only minimal use of subheadings etc. to mark out where we are in his larger argument. Some chapters were over 100 pages and felt like they were filled with unnecessary detail. Much of it was interesting in its own right (such as the formal structural rules of music), but did nothing to further his view. Instead of a directed argument, it felt more like a meander across a landscape of neuroscience, psychology, behavioural ecology, anthropology, musicology . . . any tangent that seemed interesting.I also found the title misleading - instead of finding out HOW the mind works, in most cases were were examining WHY the mind works - the possible evolutionary puzzles that could have led to particular aspects of our behaviour. In most instances, the exact mechanisms of cognition were left aside, which was disappointing. If he really wants to make the case that we have specialised modules for particular aspects of cognition, I think more attention needed to be paid to how these might function, not just why they could have been adaptive.Lots of interesting ideas (I loved finding out exactly how Magic Eye illusions trick our brains, and how disgust functions), but you definitely have to work hard to uncover them."
222,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163039-kevin-hanks,3,"My 3-star rating of this book doesn't reflect so much on the book, as my mind-set while I read it. I didn't get a whole lot out of the book and wasn't in the right mood to get much out of it. Add to that the extreme length of it (22 hours in audiobook format), and it wasn't that great for me. I started listening to it at 1X speed, increased to 1.25, then eventually just wanted to finish the thing so I could move onto something else so I listened to the last half of it at 2X speed, not paying attention well and not comprehending much.One positive take-away that I did have was a recurring theme in any book that talks about the brain/mind: Computers and Artificial intelligence are almost always mentioned. I have several theories as to why this is a near-universal thing, but my favorite is that it wasn't until the computer boom in the 50's, 60's, and 70's when some really brilliant mathematicians and scientists wanted to create computers and robotics that would mimic human behavior and thought, essentially Artificial Intellience. But in order to create a computer program that mimicked what the human brain and mind were capable of, it sparked the natural question of what exactly does the human brain and mind do?! It's like reverse engineering a problem, and in an attempt to copy our brain, scientists spent ever-increasing amounts of resources into a study into how and what makes our brains tick. Hence, most of the books I've read attempting to unlock the inner workings of our brain will mention (or even devote chapters to) artificial intelligence, robotics, and smart men like Pascal, Alan Turing, and Isaac Asimov.I hope I can re-read this someday when I can get more out of it. "
223,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17942027-lage-von-dissen,4,"In a nutshell, Pinker explains how the mind works. Certainly that is a bold statement, so to clarify, Pinker summarizes a body of evidence from cognitive neuroscience, psychology, evolutionary biology, and evolutionary psychology that pertain to how our mind functions. He is a strong proponent of the computational theory of mind, and provides a series of strong arguments to support that position within the study of human cognition. He explains quite a bit including many details of how the visual system works and also its relation to the visual arts, the auditory system and its relation to our appreciation of music, how our emotions may not be so irrational after all, and ultimately how the way we see, think, and feel largely result from a battle between competing mental modules that evolved through natural selection to serve specialized purposes. He also reminds the reader that not all products of culture are evolutionary adaptations, and so Pinker also examines some that are likely to be adaptations (and some that are likely not) and also how they pertain to how our mind works. Pinker also discusses some of the differences between men and women (and between other family members), and that because of the different genetic investments of each, evolution has created unique emotions for each sex pertaining to offspring, infidelity, and other human affairs (no pun intended). My edition was 565 pages, and every page was worth reading. While a lot of it wasn't new information to me as I've dabbled in a few of the subjects before, Pinker did a great job keeping me engaged regardless. A good book indeed."
224,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1918660-alex-csicsek,3,"This is an interesting book that - as those who skip the title page may be surprised to learn - describes to us laymen how the mind works. Pinker uses an evolutionary framework to explain not only the functions of the brain but the reasoning for why it works in the way it does. Topics range from the physical to the intellectual to the emotional activities of the brain, although I thought he didn't do a great job exploring the links between each.Evolutionary psychology has much to teach us about the way humans work and how we got to where we are now, but the deeper thinker will find it unsatisfying. It leaves unanswered some important questions about the human condition because it sees no reason to pose them in the first place. Yes, the concept of natural selection has some interesting things to say about the phenomenon of love, but we must move beyond that to fully grasp what it means for the individual. (Please note that I am not arguing there must be something else to these profound phenonena just because we humans want there to be, but rather because the subject aspects are sometimes more important than the objective.) How the Mind Works actually does much to demonstrate my point: his final chapter grapples with the meaning of life, and but I suspect most readers put it down thinking there is something more. Evolutionary psychology is not wrong, but it's not the full story either.That said, this is an engaging and readable book that I recommend. I feel smarter having read it"
225,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964960-george,2,"Pinker's ""How the Mind Works"" revolves around two central themes -- the computational theory of mind and natural selection. In the beginning, he devotes a lot of time and energy to shooting down other theories, which would be fine if he wasn't such a jerk about it. Most of his targets don't really seem to merit all that much energy, and his criticisms become simply a showcase for academic aggression, like a prizefighter working over some random guy picked up off the street. Strangely, he seems to devote more time and energy to showing why others are wrong than to convincing the reader why the theories he believes in are right. After about 200 pages he settles down a little and actually starts getting into some practical discussions of how the mind works. He addresses topics like vision, emotions, and relations with other people. At times, I was fascinated, for paragraphs or even pages. But Pinker's ambition is a little too grand, he's set himself too large a project, and the book grows thin in places. He gets diverted pretty easily, and those diversions rarely worked for me. A grand example of this is his theory on the development of food-related religious laws, which were apparently intended to keep people from fraternizing with neighboring groups. The book did engage me at times -- I found myself arguing with him more than once -- and he raises some provocative ideas here and there, but part of the problem with him calling so much attention to incorrect theories at the beginning of the book is that this serves as a reminder that most theories eventually get brought down."
226,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6663546-ho-manh,5,"I have to give this book 5 stars for it is certainly the most painfully enlightening book I have ever read.It takes me like 4 months to get through, very slowly. There is nothing obscure about Steven Pinker's explanation about the human mind, though it could take very long to vaguely piece all the information together. He thinks about everything and applied modern psychology, evolutionary psychology, computational theory of the mind to explain it. The information in this book is massive. You can find all the reasonable explanation of how human works in this book : the visual system, the linguistic system, emotions, family values, art, music,....almost everything. There are so many things that we take for granted, but it is such a difficult engineering problem for the mind to work that way. Now I can understand why our intellects could sometimes relinquish its power to our emotions, or why there is visual illusion, or the cognitive niche:social living, color-seeing, 3D-seeing, language-using, hand-using,.... that gives rise to human intellects (according to S.P), so on and so forth.What is great about reading is that you can thinking other people's thought. What is great about thinking is once you do it you cannot unthink it. I feel glad I have tried to finish this book, because now I come to see the world with much more scientific and rigorous view. Needless to say, I will have to read it few more times to grasp it fully. I wish to learn it well enough so I can see the faults in his reasoning. But so far, I feel happily though vaguely enlightened. "
227,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,4,"I know the book has definite shortcomings. For one, it is mostly second and third hand information, that is, he relates different experiments and different theories that he agrees with and tries less (thought he does try) to bring diverging viewpoints into the discussion. Secondly, the book is indebted to Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene from which he draws most of his conclusions in evolutionary genetics and the relevant experiments which make up half of the book (the second half). And finally, the book betrays its age, as current advances in computer pattern recognition are way beyond the limits of what he envisaged back in 1997.However, the book is based on something else which is, I think, Pinker's most important contribution. This is the computational theory of mind, which he painstakingly tries to explain, along with the concepts associated with computation. Less generally accepted, but very stimulating for me, were the discussions on evolutionary psychology and (to a lesser extent) evolutionary development. The data to support these claims are less than concrete and draw different conclusions in different theoretical frameworks, but to me the conclusions are satisfying answers (so you can say that this is mysticism I can relate to) and hold the promise of future discoveries which can either confirm them or make changes to them."
228,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51560629-rebecca,5,"Discovering this book for me is like finding a bible I can believe in. In a sense it is a collection of books after all. Each chapter can stand alone, and the whole is more than an sum of its parts. Pinker is an evolutionary psychologist, linguist, cognitive scientist etc. His marvelous facility with language and his skill at pulling his research together into coherent, even humorous and lively explanations - though often hammered home at excessive length, but who dares to be his editor??? - make How the Mind Works a treat for my brain, a one that is usually starved for information, insight and delight at this level of understanding, evolution and sophistication. Parralax, geons, prisoner's dilemma, cognitive dissonance, repleteness: words and concepts such as these that I find extremely tasty fill the book. I also have Pinker's ""The Better Angels of Our Nature"" both from the library. After renewing twice, both are due tomorrow. I got so hung up on working through the chapter called ""Thinking Machines"" that I made very slow progress - like trying to struggle though Genesis. In the interest of speed I skipped to another ""book"" and discovered ""Family Values."" I highly recommend that if you are not a scientist, you read this chapter first. It has the sexier passages. That will reel you in to concentrate on the more challenging investigations. My favorite typo is on the bottom of page 361 (1997 first edition): ...azlso!"
229,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4497443-tom,4,"Like the two other books of Pinker's I've read, The Blank Slate and The Stuff of Thought, this one is just as excellently written, entertaining, and profound. He gracefully takes complex topics and explains them with thoroughness and understandability without dumbing them down.I wasn't aware to the extent that this work would deal with evolutionary psychology, however. I know that Pinker is a firm advocate of the stance, and I share his position, but I'm already well acquainted with most of the research done in support of the field. Pinker elucidates all of it elegantly, and I don't have any criticisms regarding any of his explanations, but it's just that most of it was old news to me. I was hoping that more of the book would deal directly with the visual system and the explanation and implications of the computational theory of mind, which took up only the first few sections of the book. He does seem a bit too hastily dismissive of criticisms of the computational theory, too, which could have been taken more seriously and been given more space. There's also an odd lack of coverage given to consciousness research, which was puzzling.Anyway, anyone that's read and enjoyed Pinker's other books would probably like this one, too. This is also a great as start as any for an introduction to the thinking behind evolutionary psychology."
230,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10305846-kevin,4,"When I began the book, he said he would prove that the brain is an evolved organ relies on a lot of very specialized processing equipment. I already believed the former, and I believed that there were some instances of the latter.I definitely raised my estimate after reading his book. But nudging a numeric estimate isn't exactly paradigm shifting for me.On the other hand, he throws in quotes, and experiments, and a lot of philosophic and linguistic arguments. Who thought philosophy had anything to offer? I always thought it was the anti-science, always chasing the biggest questions with no hope of grasping them, never bothering with answerable issues. He makes pretty good use of it! And jokes. He throws in a lot of great, quotable jokes.And he thinks about EVERYTHING, applying his theory to it. So, a lot of that is rushed, or weak, but all of it is interesting and thought provoking.Of course evolutionary psychology theories are hard to test and easy to offer. That may not be great science, but we know that's where the answers must lie. If we evolved then our brains and minds evolved too.It is over long. Although I loved reading it, eventually I tired and reached for something lighter. When I got back to it, I was so glad. But a few pages later, I was done. Turns out, about the last 30% of my ebook was footnotes and citations."
231,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7872563-nathan,5,"This approachable and highly informative book on the mind and its development through the eyes and mind of Steven Pinker was worth the effort on so many levels. His wide reaching analysis and humor made the very specific topics and material radiate with clarity. This book was purchased in 1998 by me at the Legion of Honour in San Francisco, California and was interestly showcased at the retrospective the museum had up on the artwork of Francis Bacon. Very fitting material for reading next to the psychologically challenging work of Bacon if you are to ask me!This book's breadth of material can be best summoned up by the author himself:'This book is {about how} the mind owes it power to its syntactic, compositional, {and} combinatorial abilities (Chapter 2). Our complicated ideas are built out of simpler ones, and the meaning of the whole is determined by the meaning of the parts and the meaning of the relations that connect them: part-of-a-whole, example-of-a category, thing-at-a place, actor-exerting-force, cause-of-an-effect, mind-holding-a-belief,...'If the mind is of interest to you from the vantage point of a pre eminent professor of psychology and director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology should be read with careful consideration and an open perspective."
232,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,4,"I appreciate that Pinker doesn't pretend that his exploration and analysis of the brain doesn't really explain consciousness, self-awareness, and that he admits that nobody has explained them, even if they claim to. So right away, I get that he gets it's a tough problem, and it's too easy to say consciousness doesn't exist.It does.The early chapters, then, are pretty interesting. So were the later chapters, but Pinker seemed to forget what his book was about when he got into the chapter about families and sexual behavior. Interesting, but too far away from how the brain works. And really long.Then I liked the last chapter again, especially the ending. If philosophers for millennia haven't been able to reconcile self-awareness with meat and electrical impulses, maybe it's not the problem is unsolvable, but only that our brains aren't made to think like that. We evolved to do what we do well, and things that are visual (for instance, geometry, our understanding of time) are right up our alley. Maybe, just like most people can't really imagine 4 dimensions the way they are, because our brains just aren't made for it, so we can't really understand consciousness. I'll keep looking, but maybe that's correct, too. "
233,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1631969-oli,5,"How the Mind Works is an introductory book to the theories of the mind advocated by Pinker. Two major parts can be identified. First a computational theory of the mind is laid out. Pinker explains how the mind can be understood as being composed of computational modules that correspond to physical structures in the brain. In the early development, an individual learns to use these modules for their intended tasks such as recognizing speech, seeing in 3D using stereoscopic vision and so on. The crown jewel is chapter 4 “The Mind’s Eye”, a rigorous treatment on how the mind solves very complex vision problems. People who do not have stereoscopic vision, such as myself, may find this a bit of a discouraging and confusing read. The latter half of the book discusses to a large extent behavioral and social issues and how these can be understood from the evolutionary point of view as well as from the computational and modular model of the mind. The ideas and arguments are interesting and entertaining, but the rigor is not comparable to the first half. I recommend the second half as an easy reading about an evolutionary understanding of behavior. Read the first part if you are up for a somewhat detailed exposition of the computational theory of the mind."
234,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3605371-susan-visser,4,"I loved the book! At times I thought I was listening to the manual for life. The book is about the evolution of the mind and very convincingly explains why we do / think most of what we do. Parts of the book were way over my head, but I listened anyway. I should have posted my review of each chapter as I completed it. There are so many gems in the book that I'll keep with me for ever.A couple of examples. The description of the evolution of the eyes and how stereo vision was rather complex, but then I attended Open Doors Toronto and at the Campbell House there was an exhibit of stereograms. The coincidence was astounding and really enhanced my appreciation of the exhibit.The other one that will stick with me was the simple ritual of dating. It goes something like this.... dates consist of food, entertainment and affection. At the beginning of a relationship, there is more entertainment than affection, but there is food. As the relationship gets more serious, the affection becomes the entertainment, but there is always food. The descriptions of how the mind processes music was way over my head. I'm sure that those who have a music knowledge would better understand that chapter.I loved the book and am glad I listened to it. I may listen to it again...."
235,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5443661-joe-krudys,3,"Definitely a good and interesting book, but I liked ""The Blank Slate"" a lot better. Having just read (listened to) Dawkins' ""The Selfish Gene"" right before this one, I got to see just how much of Dawkin's book is rehashed in Pinker's. That's fine, of course, as a solid understanding of the ideas of Dawkins (and Darwin, et al) are needed to understand Pinker's elaborations from a more psychological and sociological level. There were some very interesting sections of the book, most notably the part about vision and the brain, including the explanation of how our minds interpret and allow us to see autostereograms. I also liked the section on religion, and the end of the book regarding the questions that we do not yet have answers to. Other parts of the book were a little less interesting (especially if you already have a grasp on ""The Selfish Gene""), and at least one part was hilariously boring (music and sound).The book is obviously a little dated, especially with all the advancements in this area since the time the book was written, but this was addressed in the Afterword, and I am sure also in some of his more recent books. But all in all, this was and interesting and mostly satisfying read."
236,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies,5,"A very thorough and well-written book regarding the specific importance and evolutionary purpose of the human brain, presented via the engaging and intelligent authorship of Steven Pinker - who's book 'The Better Angels of Our Nature' (about the decline of violence in human society) is one of the best books I have ever read.This book examines a range of aspects of the human mind, providing scientific explanation of the nuts and bolts of how these processes work biologically, and then the importance of these abilities are discussed in the context of evolutionary biology and sociology to provide insight into just how important these adaptations are. Language, stereoscopic vision, altruism, music, social constructs, emotion, imagination and pleasure-seeking are all discussed with use of numerous illustrative examples and quotes (I turned over so many page corners with important insights on, I forget which of the numerous were most impactful!) at a level that cleverly doesn't alienate the non-expert nor patronise/bore the scientifically well-educated such as myself.I would recommend this to anyone wanting to read about the importance of the human brain in how we have evolved to become the dominant species in the current world."
237,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153169-mommalibrarian,4,"This is a huge book which cannot be skimmed. The basic idea is computational theory of mind rather than neurons, synapse, and chemical reactions. I found the computational sections interesting but really bogged down in the parts where he illustrates his theories on mind biology in terms of natural selection as reserved in the genes rather than any learned or taught via psychological response. ""The mind is a neural computer, fitted by natural selection with combinatorial algorithms for causal and probalistic reasoning about plants, animals, objects, and people. It is driven by goal states that served biological fitness in ancestral environments, such as food, sex, safety, parenthood, friendship, status, and knowledge."" p.524 What matters most is ""mechanism that brings about effects that would increase the number of copies of the genes building the nechanism in the environment in which we evolved."" p.526The cultural references were age appropriate for a boomer and will date this book for younger audiences and in the near future. For example, Bob Dylan, ""When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose."""
238,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7833883-si,5,"Brilliant book. I can't recommend it enough. Lucid and readable. The computational theory of the mind is just great. It makes so much sense, and is much better than some of the other views of how it works, e.g. what I see as the false dichotomy between reason and emotion. From why people do silly things, to a fascinating chapter on how the mind sees. He often describes some of the different views, and then tells us which he prefers, all backed up with excellent evidence. I get so tired of evolutionary evangelists and fundamentalists (e.g. that annoying pillock Dawkins), and when Pinker introduces his view of evolution it's well thought out, refreshing and more to the point realistic, and so is a great backdrop to some of his theories. He does waver towards the end of the book, coming out with less than convincing arguments, and it seems that he may not have studied some of the areas so closely, but then maybe these are more difficult to test in isolated lab situations. Took me a long while to read as the stuff Pinker comes out with requires thought and discussion down the pub. However absolutely worth the effort. "
239,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9327536-mike,5,"It's been said by many others that Pinker writes about complex subjects in a very accessible way, and this book is no exception. His descriptions mix scientific elegance and precision with down-to-earth metaphors and examples from daily life. I've found myself thinking about many of the concepts he illustrates in the context of my own life; as an example, he explains that experiments with infants have shown their capacity to recognize separate objects and their innate sense of how the world works. In the experiment, two dolls are shown to the infant, then hidden by a screen; the experimenter secretly moves one of the dolls out of the baby's field of vision, then removes the screen. The baby will stare, recognizing that it does not make sense for only one doll to be visible. When I was playing with a friend's baby the other day, I tried a modified version of this myself, and it seemed to keep her attention, which I thought was pretty cool.This is just one example of the numerous fascinating illustrations of the mind's structure and relation to the world, explained in language that informs without overwhelming - if you're looking for a flood of jargon, look elsewhere."
240,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"A good book for many new facts, ideas and theories, but jumpy and without radical new conclusions. The title of the book is a misnomer. The author frequently gets excited about explaining evolution, whether in organs, thoughts or behaviours. He tries to justify these wanderings by vaguely linking to the mind but if there is any central theme in the book, it is less related to the workings of the mind than justifications of evolutionary theories.That said, the book's rich details are exciting for anyone with patience and desire to learn. The book does get difficult for non-experts in parts (particularly the section on eye), but the breadth of the topics covered is still fascinating and shows the efforts put in by the author. While the author refrains from taking strong assertive stands (so are minds automatons with all experiences an illusion? something the author tries to support indirectly without taking a firm stand), the author - like most critics - has more fun poking holes in alternate theories including religious or Freudian varieties."
241,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1775648-jonathan,3,"This book is by no means bad. In fact it is very good at what it does, which is reduce life and consciousness to bits of junk (my interpretation). If you want to feel insignificant, read this book ... by the end you will feel as important as a brick. Please don't think that this makes this book any less impressive ... it is an awesome collection of state of the art research into human consciousness, neural networking, artificial intelligence, and thought. If you are able to learn the brain/mind to the point of striping it of all emotion (in my opinion, taking the ""life"" out of life) without feeling reduced, then this is your new favorite book ... I, on the other hand, want to forget what little I was able to understand from this opus. I want to experience life, not compute it. "
242,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3529634-rafael-bechelli,4,"This book first chapters were very easy and nice to go through, but there are a few chapter somewhere in the first half of the book that were not so interesting to me. I don't know exactly what happened but getting through these few chapters took me months. Then the book became once again pleasant and inteligible and went like this to the end.My highlights are on:A few pages dedicated on how mathematical concepts and thoughts are processed in our brains.The discussion about the processes that control our emotions and why they evolved to be the way they are.Despite a few boring chapters the book is very valuble to everybody who want to build up a strong scientific background. Most of the time the language is very accessible, and I believe, Pinker managed very well to put things on a simple language without oversimplify and distort meaning (this is very commmon in books on modern physics and related topics)."
243,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26211610-tim-jin,2,"Discovery Channel used to have Shark Week. PBS Nova should have a full month on ""How the Mind Works"" base on Steven Pinker's theories. While it was interesting to read, it was also frustrating to finish because the subject just got draining after a while. Some of his examples, like family incest, almost became unbearable to read. I really wanted to skip that part because it seemed like Pinker went on for over an hour on incest. It just seemed like that they author was being infatuated on incest and I still don't understand how the mind works on this disgusting sexual taboo. This book is hard to understand because there are so many examples that you will be overwhelm and after a while none of it makes any sense. I still don't understand at what I read. There are far better books out there on this subject, like ""The Mind and the Brain"". That book has a better structure and course of plan to tell you what you need to know."
244,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1356377-jay,4,"For the first five chapters Pinker employes a sometimes over technical and hard to follow (the biology of the eye, how cameras work, 90's computer tech, etc) explanation of how and why the mind might have evolved via natural selection. His attack on ""psychological correctness"" is nice. The second half of the book is much more interesting as it ventures into human nature, parent child conflict, gender differences, and more. If you are looking for an explanation for various neurosis or a self-help manual, this is not the book for you. If you're interested in evolution and biology, and nice little attacks on academia, you'll probably enjoy this one. Three stars for the first half, four for the second half. *EDIT* I changed my review from 3 stars to 4 because I got into a debate about evolutionary psychology shortly after finishing this book and found that I had a much larger tool box at my disposal. "
245,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"In ‘How the Mind Works’ Steven Pinker (Harvard professor of psychology) looks at various aspects of the brain, how it evolved, how it develops from infant to adult and a few theories about how it works. Pinker is a proponent of the ‘computational theory of mind’ which proposes that the brain acts in a step by step fashion, manipulating symbols in order to arrive at an output. The first few chapters are a bit of a chore as Pinker jumps from topic to topic in such a dizzying scattershot of distantly related topics that one struggles to grasp the point of the discussion. Eventually he settles down and begins to lay out his ideas in way that proceeds logically and the book markedly improves. Overall the book is ok, though I’d point out that there are more current books on the topic available (this one was written in 1997) and ones that are better written."
246,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1064644-nathan,2,"A bit too ambitious. Pinker displays all his wonted amiability and accessibility, both of which are sorely needed in a book (partly) on evolutionary psychology. No amounts of either can sustain a book of this bulk, however. His cocktail-party style is singularly ill-suited to the sheer mass of material he tries to address: no number of witty one-liners can adequately handle (sometimes simultaneous) discussions of religion, evolution, ethics, sexual politics, biology and psychology (among others), but that's what Pinker tries to do. I never felt that I got a solid grip on one area before he zipped off to the next. That's a shame, because his clear and readable style seemed to be the perfect medium for making these complex understandable. So much potential- actually, too much potential."

Otherwise, if the subject matter interests you and you have the time and patience, by all means go for it - it'll give you plenty of food for thought."

Strongly based on two concepts, the ""computational theory of mind"" and natural selection. Doesn't get very deeply into brain chemistry but focuses on the why we do what we do. It may occasionally be accused of beating a concept to death - though not blatantly so, and the conversational writing style compensates for this quite well.I do wonder how some of the conclusions would change based on technologies, particularly regarding social networking, that have surged in popularity since 2009 when the book was released, FMRI advancements and advancements in artificial intelligence - and in fact, part of the afterward does acknowledge this possibility. A very thorough investigation of the topic and certainly worth the time if you want to better understand yourself, and those around you."
249,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2713415-andrew,3,"I would give this book 3.5 stars. Dr. Pinker does a good job providing the evolutionary underpinnings to how the mind has evolved in its functionality and utility. He provides a lot of detail on myriad issues with the mind (e.g, how the mind the mind works similarly to a computational model). This book is a very dense read and I still came away not understanding as much as I expected, although the mind is very complex, which the author reinforces. At times, he gets very technical and complex in his descriptions on topics that I was not able to understand (how the mind deciphers the image of the visual autostereogram). However, I feel this is due to my own limitations more than anything else. I enjoyed his provocative questions and appreciated the nexus between evolution and the development of the mind. "
250,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34049748-jerrod-carter,4,"Great book on what we know about how the mind works. Lots of conjecture in here, too, and it's sometimes hard to tell the difference between fact and supposition. And, as we know, even the facts tend to change in fields like this one as we learn more.The thing that irritates me the most about books like this is how much the atheists have to do their proselytizing. Too many, including Mr. Pinker, believe that because they know how something works it's obvious there can't be a being such as God. It's especially ludicrous because they know they're only scratching the tip of the iceberg, yet that little alone is apparently enough to make God irrelevant.Anyway, what he presents is done well and really helped me understand what we know about brain science and how our brain mechanics affect our behaviors.Really liked the book."
251,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21689794-konstantin-okonechnikov,5,"The book describes in detail how the natural selection turned human brain into a perfect machine to solve a number of required tasks, starting from simple functionality of body to survive and finishing with complex adaptation inside family and community. Computational options of the brain ( math, language, etc.) and activity of emotions (disgust, fear, happiness, etc) are outlined deeply. In my opinion, the best part of the book is the last chapter characterizing the roles of art, music, literature and humor. The main hypothesis suggests that these activities are just brain errors (“bugs”), however rather pleasant and sometimes useful. Notably, the book also provides hundreds of references and it is easy to find additional information about any interesting topic. I’ll just finish with a citation: “Our mental life is a noisy parliament of competing factions”."
252,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9731922-sarah,4,"Possibly a bit out of date (I remember noticing that he cited a study about rats consuming addictive substances if they were freely available which has since been shown to be mostly because they were put in isolated cages and not because animals will inherently choose to be blissed out if given the choice), but it did have some interesting stuff in it. A little hard to read at times because of the way in which he uses language (very brusque) and they way he talks about human behavior as if the way we evolved to do things is the ""right"" way (while he does have a disclaimer about this saying that he's not making moral judgments before he starts doing it, it's very hard to read it differently from how it's written).The book has several asides which are somewhat interesting in and of themselves but seem to somewhat distract from the main purpose of the book.

253,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5752751-ana-maria-bujor,4,"As always in the case of Pinker's books, this has been a long, instructive journey. I've learned a lot of things about the manner in which the brain works, which is a great part to read when one feels down - it turns out people, even in their first months of life, are quite amazing creatures. Also, the aspects about why we behave the way we do towards other people, about why we like art and why we fear certain things are definitely revealing and give great insight into human nature.However, this book did not blow my mind exactly the way The blank slate and Better angels of our nature did, I am not sure why. Maybe because I was already aware of most of the information from other sources? Or because I felt it was a lot more technical than the others. Either way, do not be discouraged, but check it out - there's something in it for anyone with a healthy curiosity."
254,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7022676-herman,2,"Pinker writes well, that is for sure. I loved his other books (The Language Instinct and Blank Slate). But somehow I am really struggling to get through this one.The anecdotes and metaphors are mildly interesting. There are also a few interesting scientific tidbits here and there. But at 80-100 pages a piece, the chapters are just too long. On top of that, if you have read The Language Instinct or Thinking, Fast and Slow (Daniel Kahneman), there's very little new here.This book is also much more from the perspective of psychology than it is from biology or neurology. If you are interested in how the brain works, as I am, this book is not for you. If, however, you are interested in finding some better metaphors for thinking about thought, this might be interesting to you. As for me, it's 2 stars."

I felt the first half of the book was stronger, more salient, and supported with biological evidence than the second half, but overall Pinker succeeds in presenting a broad subject with clarity. His explanations of AI, the development of the eye and its ability to process images, and introductions to both computational and evolutionary aspects of neuroscience were very well done and rooted in research. However, as the book progresses, Pinker relies more on philosophy, loosely connected theories, and does not draw any new or striking conclusions. Still, I found the book to be enjoyable and informative. "

It can explain how we use logic and memory, but not how we interact with the world, with other humans, or with ethical and moral problems.[Based on Brazilian Portuguese Edition:]"

A reader without a strong science background might have some trouble with the technical vagaries of the evolution of vision and Pinker's ""computational theory of mind"", but surviving those chapters pays off in the end. Grand in scope--everything from vision to thought process to sibling rivalry to belief in the supernatural is analyzed. What emerges is both evocative and inspiring."

Within that box is a greyish organ with the texture of jelly, the size of a melon (canteloupe, not water) that controls pretty much everything that I do. Billions of microscopic connections allow me to generate thoughts, process input, communicate, control posture and interpret data with a speed that is not matched by the fastest and biggest computers we have yet invented. The brain is a phenomenon and should be a thing of constant marvel but we take it for granted as long as it does what we expect. Steven Pinker has written a fabulous, dense book to try and generate a level of knowledge about the Mind that increases the sense of wonder whilst explaining some of the processes involved."

I came to this book hoping to learn about the science of thought. While there was valuable science in this book, much of it was taken up with polemical railing against straw man opponents--rabid anti-evolutionist academics, deluded feminists--who in my experience are both rarer and wiser than Pinker portrays them. I chose to read a book on science, because I already accept the scientific worldview. I do not need to spend huge portions of the book reading about basic evolutionary science, much less in the form of an angry tirade. Thank you, Dr. Pinker, for your book. I highly valued the information within it, but please, next time, tone down the rhetoric."
260,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020047-larry-hansen,4,"The first half of the book was pretty mediocre as the author tried to explain how various aspects of human nature resulted from natural selection from the obvious to the controversial. Seemed to be a 3-star book until the last third where it really became interesting because he addressed questions I had often wondered about. In particular, the relation of evolution to music, art, prestige, altruism and other things that don't seem to be part of the ""survival of the fittest"" scene. He had interesting observations and I don't think all of his answers were correct but I don't think anyone has all the right answers in explaining human nature. Also, interesting information on sex, mating, male and female from a materialistic view. "
261,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10023470-leonardo-garc,4,"A very good book that doesn't really solve many of the questions that you may have before reading it, and perhaps hope to solve by reading it, but instead gives many new points ofview, as well as a wealth of data and insights for you to try and figure out answers for yourself, if that is even possible. The focus on experiment results, as well as the chapter dedicated on how toddlers perceive the world around them is specially interesting, as well as the one focusing on human inter-relationships.Would recommend reading this, but also, be prepared to want to read other points of view on the subject. Definitely, the idea of the book is for you to open your mind to new ideas, not to embrace any idea that you might think this book could contain, and declare all your doubts quenched."
262,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31104786-dave-peticolas,4,"Pinker reviews the current research and theories on the workings of the human mind. He explains current theories on the evolutionary basis of vision, hearing, emotions and common sense physics, psychology and morality. He also explores the evolutionary basis of non-adaptive behaviors including listening to music and watching movies.His explanations are lucid and well-written and this book is a great pleasure to read. However, in the very last section, Pinker seems to completely lose his nerve and, in a short passage with no science and a small amount of shaky philosophy, Pinker announces that the hardest problems of the human mind, like sentience, are beyond the grasp of science and the human intellect. It's a disappointing ending to an otherwise excellent book."

The first half lays out the challenges and wonder of the brain. It felt like good source material if you were going to program AI. The second half was more a generalised on the topic of human misconceptions and brain tricks.The material and references felt slightly dated, mainly around those directed at computers and their march towards better replication of aspects of humans.If you've haven't read any psychological books before, this is the perfect place to start. If you have, then there is probably not enough niche subject matter analysis.Overall: 4 stars for quality of research and delivery, but could have been shorter and punchier."

In its structure it is split into 8 distinct chapters and split further into a number of sub-chapters. The book talks of how the mind works and provides insight into the Evolutionary reasons of why. This book doesn't pull punches with how it views feminism and courtship and all of that stuff. In general, I enjoy books that make me think and expose unflattering truths about humanity, and this book also does both.All in all, I could read this again and again if I didn't have other books to read. Perhaps I will read it again in 10 years. It might be pretty dated by then, but human nature doesn't change overnight and a lot of these observations will still be accurate 10 years from now."

As one example, the long drawn out explanation of how a computer would figure out who a person's uncle is went on and on until I wanted to throw the book out of the window. Often the only purpose of these over-explanations seems to be to be able to say at the end of it all, 'and gosh, our brain just does that, better, and in a fraction of the time.' which is amazing, but still. The part about babies and what they are capable of discerning at just a few months old was really interesting. In fact, all of the content was generally interesting. I just with there was a condensed version available."

I have heard some talk about the ""Pinker fallacy"", such as those statistical errors committed in ""the better angels of our nature"", and I struggled to spot as much here. Perhaps Pinker is in safer territory in this realm of psychology vs social sciences. The writings about art, music, family values, religion etc were insightful but some things are better to be experienced and lived than to be analyzed, a paragraph about a piece of art can never compare of the piece itself, perhaps this book will inspire me to get my a** to an art museum or the like. All in all an enjoyable read and I would recommend. "

But if our minds are part of nature, that is to be expected, even welcomed. The natural world evokes our awe by the specialized designs of its creatures and their parts. We don’t poke fun at the eagle for its clumsiness on the ground or fret that the eye is not very good at hearing, because we know that a design can excel at one challenge only by compromising at others. Our bafflement at the mysteries of the ages may have been the price we paid for a combinatorial mind that opened up a world of words and sentences, of theories and equations, of poems and melodies, of jokes and stories, the very things that make a mind worth having."

While some of his other books dive deeper into some specific areas touched on in this book, ""How the Mind Works"" covers a lot ground while clearly articulating Pinker's take on the computation theory of mind and how it ties into evolutionary psychology. He describes many ways we humans use our brains to form what we call our mind, how more fundamental mental processes might have been cobbled together to help us do what we do, and examines dozens of facets of the mind along with how and why we may have come to possess these mental ""modules"" in the forms we do. He presents a fascinating and convincing argument for his thesis and I highly recommend this book to anyone interesting in thinking more about how we think. One of my favorite books by Pinker."

This book heavily influenced me, the way I thought and analysed the world, skepticism about religion, understanding human behaviour etc etc.Pinker is a fantastic science writer. I was told that I should have read The Language Instinct first, but I picked this book up using my 'randomly open a book at the book-store and see if you can read it for more than 10 minutes' strategy of choosing books when I was a kid and I didn't regret it.The first chapter on how the eye works is complicated, and almost put me off reading later chapters. If you can get through that you'll much enjoy the rest of the book. Well worth it."
270,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/439908-none,4,"How The Mind Works is a national best seller. It is a book portraying the elegance of the human mind. It is a collection of Pinker’s hard work and his analyses of human behavior. He portrayed human beings and human minds as the ultimate being and I didn’t quite agree with that concept. But besides that, his ideas were revolutionary and challenging to understand. The title is somewhat misleading. It is not all about the brain. This book contains more than 600 pages, but more than 30 percent of the contents are about the evolution of human behaviors. I learned way too much to be able to write them all on this book review. I will be done with the book shortly."
271,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/938364-brian,3,"Alternately technically impenetrable and grossly over-simplified, Pinker nevertheless delivers interesting insights into human behavior. Don't be confused, this book is about how the ""mind"" works, not the brain. Pinker tackles diverse mental functions from stereo vision to emotions to social interactions. His broad theory is that the way we think evolved as an aid to human survival, and that many behaviors we think of as ""societal"" are actually innate functions of the mind. Some of his theories, especially on gender roles and religion, are controversial but compellingly intuitive.This book left me thinking, to paraphrase The Big Lebowski: ""You're not wrong, you're just an asshole."""

This is in no way a ""light"" read, even the book feels heavier than it should. I think that there were quite a few points where it would have been helpful if Pinker had either eliminated the complicated examples in favor of one that was easier to understand OR inserted any example into pages and pages of information. Don't expect to read this once and fully understand everything, if that's your goal plan on reading it multiple times. That is not to say that you can't take away quite a bit off of one careful reading, you can but it'll require lots of concentration."

275,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13359826-scott,5,"Another of Pinker's awesome books. This book synthesizes and describes studies of the human mind. Academic disciplines such as biology, psychology, cognitize science, and the arts are categorized with examples of how knowledge of human capabilities has been built. Topics such as language and speech, visual phenomena, logic and reasoning, quantative measurement making, likes and dislikes, social science, art appreciation, and philosophy are covered. The vast range of topics, and Pinker's unique way of describing things, make this an awesome book for both educational and personal knowledge development."

Plus, even in paperback, the tome is hefty and not suitable of commute-reading. I really appreciate the Notes and References at the back. I nearly abandoned the book after reading Chapter 2. I suspect there are concepts on computational thinking that I just am not familiar enough with to understand, but also Pinker took on a combative tone that was equally incomprehensible. Overall, however, the ""big picture"" Pinker presents is enlightening - well worth sticking it out to the end."

Covers everything about how and why our mind developed and works the way it does. Mostly based on the Computational Theory of Mind with various additions. The books answers many questions such as why spacial metaphors are so natural to use, why eating certain foods is gross, how 3D Magic-Eye pictures work and why is falling in love leave us powerless and blind.I had problems understanding the explanations on what gives us consciousness and free will.

The title is kind of a misnomer or at least it can be misinterpreted easily. Going in I read the title and thought, ""Cool a book about how the different parts of the brain work."" That's not what its about, its really is about How (and why from an evolutionary standpoint) the Mind Works.Interesting ideas on how we've evolved to enjoy music, go to war, hold reciprocity in such high regard, have gender-specific sexual preferences, and much much more.Definitely worth the week it took me to read this."

Pinker essentially lays out the (rather compelling) case for evolutionary psychology and the computational theory of mind. In the decade since the book was written, these ideas have become even more popular amongst psychologists. The ""blank slate"" approach is becoming increasingly rare among those who should know better. Soon enough, its only supporters will be the stubborn souls at your local Sociology department. Pinker's writing is extremely easy for the interested layman to follow. This is probably why 'How The Mind Works' was the quickest 800 page book I've ever read."

The book covers many topics including how your eyes work, the computational theory of the mind, self deception, kin altruism, sexual selection, the psychology of war and art and ultimately the concept of free will. The book itself is designed to get you to think and it does so in the most attractive ways (like lots of great references to pop culture and literature). "

While the book presents a number of interesting ideas, they are more speculative than having any scientific basis. Strangely, Pinker frequently uses ideas from fiction to illustrate his arguments - It is noticeable how little psychology and other social sciences have contributed to an understanding the mind. Pinker frequently presents theories only to subsequently show their shortcomings.A disappointing book offering few insights."

I didn't agree with it all. I was offended at times. I've read some of the vignettes/studies before. And yet, there was enough new material and innovative thought to be intriguing and keep me reading. I especially liked the information on attraction and relationships. In fact, the book gets better and better as it nears it's end. I doubt I will read more of Pinker's work because his expertise is in language and I'm much more interested in mathematics, but I found this a good read and will share it with friends."

It is not about the physical processes of the brain, nor, at least directly, about why people think weird things (as I thought it might be). Instead, the author tries to explain how we got to thinking some of the ways we do based on what made these thinking algorithms useful to our early ancestors and how that plays out in today's world.There are a lot of complicated ideas in here, yet this book is reasonably easy to understand and a lot of fun to read. I highly recommend it to anybody who likes to think about thinking."

290,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6947705-jeffrey,4,"So, it took me months to complete this book, but sometimes other things in life get in the way I guess. Nevertheless, great read. It is a really dense book filled with fascinating information and research that if you take time to consider, and as I often do with this type of book, underline passages for further research, it will take you a while to get through in it's entirety. Enjoyed it tremendously and now have a list of other books he references that I want to look into. Well worth the time and effort. "
291,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31302406-lori,4,"A great book that argues—well—how the mind works, how its functioning is inextricably intertwined with our biological meat suits. It tries to make abstractions over brain processes, bringing in computing terms like daemons, and so forth. Quite good, quite a lot of information that's tightly packed. I have one problem with this book: the author doesn't go through enough lengths to delineate speculation from what is actually known; which makes it difficult for the reader to get a clear picture about the world."
292,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/187502-soren-maleficus,5,"Pinker's second masterpiece (after Language Instinct, which I have yet to read for lack of time). The human brain is easily the most complex structure in our bodies and also the most misunderstood. Pinker takes data from the past 3 or so decades and constructs a theory of thought which is remarkably fluent. He explains where our brains came from via evolution, and how they enable us to interact with the world around us. A technically difficult read, but well worth it in the end."
293,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/599339-dmitry,4,"The theme of the book is ""human mind as a naturally chosen neuro-computer"". The book starts off with a detailed description of the computational model of the human mind, continues with a rather detailed discussion of human vision and then moves on to a rather schematic description of various aspects of human existence, such as emotions, kin relations, humor, religion etc., depicted as devices of natural selection. "
294,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1769586-katie,0,"This is an interesting read for anyone interested in an approachable book about cognitive psychology. I have seen Pinker lecture twice, once for The Blank Slate and just recently for The Stuff of Thought. He is amazingly eloquent and I find myself constantly checking to see when he will be coming to Seattle. Unfortunately my timing has been off on this book (I began reading it a week before beginning graduate school), but hopefully I can finish it during one of by school breaks."
295,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/936557-paul,5,"This is great work by Steven Pinker, I think I picked the right first book of his to read. This book presents theories and insights into all aspects of the minds of us humans from many sources that are quite convincing. I take away a better understanding of myself and others after reading this book and that is something of the highest value in my opinion. Ignorance may be bliss, but I value understanding more, and ""How the Mind Works"" is fuel for the latter."
296,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/705887-broodingferret,4,"This book was very well done. While the subject material is complex, Pinker's writing style is quite clear and detailed. He also imbues his material with wit and humor, which saves it from becoming just another dry academic treatise on neurology. While it doesn't possess the detail of an actual academic course, How the Mind Works is a good source for a basic introduction into evolutionary psychology and the computational theory of mind."
297,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2896671-jennifer,0,How the Mind Works describes what the mind is and how it evolved -- discussing everything from how we see and why we laugh. This book is enlightening and interesting. Dispels the nurture or nature myths and why it isn't an either/or proposition. Pinker calls it reverse-engineering the mind (and/or the brain). The insights and examples are from all areas of science making it incredibly fascinating and convincing.
298,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2459103-ogi-ogas,5,"My ratings of books on Goodreads are solely a crude ranking of their utility to me, and not an evaluation of literary merit, entertainment value, social importance, humor, insightfulness, scientific accuracy, creative vigor, suspensefulness of plot, depth of characters, vitality of theme, excitement of climax, satisfaction of ending, or any other combination of dimensions of value which we are expected to boil down through some fabulous alchemy into a single digit."
299,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4150291-d-nnis,0,"Again as with his another book ""The Blank Slate"" you need to soldier on through first several chapters full of filosophizing until you reach your ultimate destination - a wealth of eye-opening, thought-provoking and simply mind-boggling facts, experiments and conjectures on brain, conscience, society and what it is to be a human, collected from all over the world and from all walks of life. A sheer feast of ideas and revelations!"
