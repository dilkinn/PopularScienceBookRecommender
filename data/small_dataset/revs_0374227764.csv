0,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23067416-julie,2,"I wanted to like this book -- I really did -- but unfortunately it just didn't do much for me.First of all, my background and the book's. I studied bio with an emphasis on evolution. This book is about the evolution of octopus brains: a system only distantly linked to our own. An octopus is really the closest thing we have to a truly alien intelligence whereas mammals and birds have similar systems in play. We were a match made in heaven. I was thrilled for this book and even tried to get a friend to read it with me.Unfortunately that's where the love affair ended. The book started interestingly enough with a discussion of life in the Ediacaran (Pre-Cambrian) period. This, the author asserts, is when life started being able to sense and we got the first bits of nervous systems. Super interesting, though of course largely speculation: when looking at these fossils, most squishy things are gone. There's also questions as to why the nervous system developed in the first place. The author is a little slow in describing the more commonly known bits of evolution (i.e. vertebrates), but I also recognize that ""And then vertebrates developed as you might expect"" would be enough for me.This is where the books starts to lose structure. The author just begins discussing anecdotes of octopus behavior, but seems to just ramble without a clear goal in mind. First he discusses many experiments with octopus and many surprising anceotes from those experiments, but he largely seems to gloss over what those experiments meant or what they told us about octopus behavior or thoughts. The author recounts similar tales of wild octopus, again mainly just to demonstrate that they have higher intelligence.There's an interesting bit when the author discusses whether octopus have the same ""centralized brain"" as we do, or if it's more of a sum of its arms/parts. However the author never really goes anywhere with this. He briefly discusses a maze experiment than proves that this exists, then discusses a few more stories that indicates this exists and then... nothing. For a straight biology book this may have been acceptable, but this is biology and philosophy! What does this mean? How does that make life different for an octopus? Well, there's not any answer to that.About then, the book grinds to a screeching halt as the author ponders consciousness and it's painful. While there are some truly interesting experiments mentioned, a lot of it just gets into the navel-gazing of questioning what consciousness is. This section is nearly unreadable at times.I keep coming back to that metaphor [of consciousness as white noise] when I'm trying to get my head around this topic. It is a metaphor--very much so. It's a metaphot of sound applied to organisms that, at least in most cases, probably could not hear at all. I'm not sure why the image stays so consistently with me. Somehow it seems to point in the right direction, with its evocation of a crackle of the metabolic electricity, and the shape of the story suggested. That shape is one in which experience starts in an inchoate buzz, and becomes more organized.That paragraph does nearly nothing to advance the book. Others are virtually incomprehensible:In our own case, looking inside, we find that subjective experience has a close association with perception and control -- with using what we sense to work out what we do. Why should this be? Why shouldn't subjective experience be associated with other things? Why isn't it brimful of basic bodily rhythms, the division of cells, life itself? Some people say it is full of those things-- more than we realize anyway. I don't think so, and suspect there's a clue here. Subjective experience does not arise from the mere running of the system, but from the modulation of its state, from registering things that matter. These need not be external events; they might arise internally. But they are tracked because they matter and require a response. Sentience has some point to it. It's not just a bathing in living activity.Yeah... that paragraph needs some serious editing. A lot of these more philosophical bits are nearly unreadable. Perhaps I just lack the background, but I can't be the only one. This is from the same author who really went over the fact that vertebrate evolution happened in near boring level of clarity just a few chapters earlier.There is a super fascinating section on cuttlefish and squid and how they are able to change colors. Then, the shocking revelation that these animals are likely colorblind. The author does a wonderful job here, though admittedly our understanding is woefully incomplete. The author does a great job here and diagrams are genuinely helpful!Then there's another section, this time about the use of language in consciousness and thinking. Why was this not with the other section on the human mind? Also, why are we discussing this? The octopus and cuttlefish completely lack language... why is it in this book?This is shortly followed on speculation on aging and the octopus's short life span. This is adequate, although I found the author's explanations lacking. Again, the author went through the evolutionary tree in detail (a couple times now iirc), but really can't explain the major theory of aging in any adequate fashion.Shortly following this chapter on aging, there's a chapter on how the octopolis (a group or city of octopus) formed and then suddenly the book is over on page 204 of 255! When reading I was expecting another chapter to really wrap everything up nicely and give me the overarching picture. Nothing. Instead the rest of the book is full of notes on what the author was talking about earlier in the book. Was there any indication of these endnotes? Nope. None whatsoever. Some are clarifications, others are just sources. I read none of them because why would I read a note on something back on page 57 after I finished the book?All in all, it's not what I wanted. Perhaps it should have been titled ""Unusual octopus behavior and essays on philosophy"" and that would have been closer to the truth. Only about a third of the books is about octopus and that's really a problem considering how much it's marketed on that. I think the author missed an opportunity to really delve into octopus and mollusk evolution, but instead only talked about bilaterally symmetrical evolution and when mollusks and vertebrates split. How do you have an organism with blue-green blood, jet propulsion, three hearts, and a digestive system that passes through its brain and you fail to discuss the evolution of any of it in favor of discussing the role of language in thought?! Yeah, it just doesn't make any sense. (There may have been a slight discussion of the limbs and nerves, but definitely falling short). I was also looking for more in the way of how octopus responded differently than mammals or birds, but there wasn't much of that either.The book I got just didn't gel with the book I was promised. I don't know whether it was over-marketed, or the author wanted to say more, but lacked data. Either way, the end product was a bit of a mess. Sorry, but this was not the book for this bio major. It really didn't cover much about octopus intelligence or evolution in any way I was hoping it would....With the possible exception of the cuttlefish.I could never be mad at you."
1,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"This book is explanation of our development, the evolution, from single-celled beings to the complex creatures of today. The author says that the chemistry of life is aquatic. That's why we are made of such a large volume of water with a delicate salt-balance ourselves. I knew this, but had never thought of it quite as ""the chemistry of life is sea-based"".The author is in love with octopuses and cuttlefish and describes them from observation, from laboratory anecdotes and from a scientific point of view. The most amazing thing, which I have witnessed myself but did not understand until I read this book, is that squid can be very friendly to people. Their skin, which is like a computer monitor with a million pixels that can light up in a millisecond in many colours and patterns, can also see. It is not understood how. It is also thought that molluscs are colourblind which wouldn't make any sense. So I prefer to interpret that, as does the author, the mechanism for perceiving colour in molluscs has not yet been discovered.Years ago, I was snorkelling around a very small reef and I saw a little squid, it stayed still in the water and was rapidly changing colour. So I stopped to look at it. Then it was joined by another, then another until there were about 7 of them of varying sizes from about the size of your hand up to forearm sized all in a row and all rapidly cycling colours and patterns, waves and clouds and spots and electric stripes. I called out to my bf to come and see but come slowly not to scare them. I didn't think they would stay. He swam over and by then there were about 11 squids and it was apparent to both of us that they were staring at me. They were as curious and interested in me as I was in them and they didn't go away for quite a few minutes. They were no more shy than I was and as I had called my ex, so they had 'called' each other to come and see me.Until I read this book I hadn't known that squid could be very friendly to people and were curious and interested in them, and I had indeed been right, they were checking me out in exactly the same as I was them.And therein lies the nugget at the heart of the book. The development of consciousness. Which we know nothing much about, in ourselves included. We do not know how we process thoughts. We know that we have a short term memory (much as a computer) for present tasks, that we have interior dialogues both conscious and unconscious and for some the only way to still the inner voices is by meditation. We know that all of this is evolutionary, consciousness did not start with us, but what is it, and how do we pin it down?Wonderful book, just for the explanation of development from single-celled creatures to ourselves, and for showing how evolution, how the mutation of cells is an everyday process, nothing special, just some mutations are useful and stick, and others either cause harm or just go nowhere. The writing is a bonus. It's scientific, tells stories, draws from the vocabulary of artists and above all else communicates the great enthusiasm the author has for his subject to the reader.10 stars. The book ended too soon."
2,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,2,"Octopodes, or ""the floppy floppy spider of the sea,"" (source: ZeFrank)  are pretty freaking amazing. Godfrey-Smith agrees, which is how this book came about. As he notes on page 9, ""If we can make contact with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of shared history...but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.""Unfortunately, he tried to marry it with one of his professional passions, the philosophy of consciousness, and that's where this falls quite short. The beginning chapters have a quick explanation of the evolutionary tree, and then start tracing the origin of life and neurons through a brief look at the fossil record. This is supposed to impress upon us how different we are from octopodes, but if you didn't already know that, I don't know how you would have selected this book. So that was weird to me. Each chapter has a teaser opener of a real-life octopus situation, then goes into theory.Julie has a very solid, thorough analysis on what went wrong, and why, and I strongly suggest it if you are wondering whether or not this is for you. I am occasionally in the mood for philosophy, but grow quickly tired of discussions of perception of pain, consciousness, and possible perception of self. To me, consciousness and pain quickly boils down to experience: I see something witness and try to escape potential pain/pain; therefore it experiences it enough that it deserves consideration, does it not? Does it actually matter if it conceives of itself as an individual? Whatever. That isn't the point: the point is that these conversations quickly grow tiresome to me because it seems the ultimate in superiority complexes, all the more ironic coming from a race that can't manage to not to destroy its own environment. And now I'm off track again. Anyways, here's what's interesting:-octopodes can recognize people. They also tend to squirt water at things they don't like. There's numerous anecdotes of them specifically targeting a person they don't like with a jet of water, or all new visitors to the lab.-the Ediacaran period had peaceful creatures that were basically like bathmats that crawled around munching and seemed to not have sophisticated sense organs or protective armament. I have no idea what this has to do with octopodes, but it's a super fun visual image. I picture a herd of bathmats grazing on my lawn.-cuttlefish are also cool, and may actually be color-blind, although they have the astonishing ability to blend with their environment.-there's a secret octopus garden on the east coast of Australia. Or in a Beatle's song. Which is awesome.There's some neat colorplate photos in here, as well as some black-and-white drawings and illustrations in an attempt to help the reader with visuals (ie., evolutionary tree, the fossil record). The end chapter where he talks about studies at Octopolis are genuinely interesting, and I would have read much more about what's coming out of there. Actually, now that I'm listening to it again, watching ZeFrank is a quicker, and more fun, and references many of the same octopus facts that were in this book."

Cross-pollination and flexibility to squeeze into other academic boxes always pleases me. So, when I discovered a book that looks at the philosophy of cognition by examining the brains and evolution of cephalopods (primarily octopuses and cuttlefish) I was excited. One reason is my love for octopuses (while almost accidental) goes back nearly ten years. For most of the time I've had an Audible account, my avatar has been an octopus. Friends buy me Cthulhu masks and plush dolls (I'm still not sure what one does long-term with a Cthulhu doll. How long can you appropriately cuddle with an Elder God doll before it becomes creepy?). Anyway, Godfrey-Smith uses the development of the cephalopod brain as a way to highlight our own brain's development and also as a way to explore different ways cognition may appear in other life forms. The unique neural patterns/structure in octopuses makes the way they see the world significantly different than the way we see the world (despite our separately evolved, but similar eyes). As Godfrey-Smith also points out -- an octopus is probably the closest we will come to examining another mind: ""If we want to understand other minds, the minds of cephalopods are the most other of all"" (p10). As YouTube shows, part of the appeal of octopuses is how they, for an animal so different from us (it is closer to a slug than us biologically) seems to flirt with behaviors that are both close to us (playful, clever, petty) and also completely foreign. They seem to exits in a weird uncanny valley that attracts and repels us. How can we not be fascinated by something that seems to have almost dropped her from another planet, but acts a bit like a feline? Octopuses, and their brains, reminds me of the famous Montaigne quote about his cat:When I Am Playing With My Cat, How Do I Know She Is Not Playing With Me?Indeed. When we are watching octopuses on YouTube, they seem to be equally fascinated with us. It is strange and lovely, and opens up a lot of questions about what it means to be alive, to think, to have a subjective experience. Peter Godfrey-Smith moves well along this path and asks most of the big questions I would want asked. Many answers, however, seem largely unanswerable. But like a philosopher is want, he still asks.Next up in cephalopod reading: Vampyroteuthis Infernalis: A Treatise, with a Report by the Institut Scientifique de Recherche Paranaturaliste"
4,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,3,"Despite what might be gleaned from your Star Treks and Dr Whos, the evolution of intelligent life is – as far as I can get my head round it – infinitesimally rare and unlikely. The emergence of cells, the development of eukaryotes, the first multicellular organisms, the start of sexual reproduction, and finally some kind of freak evolutionary drive towards increased intelligence – all these things happened once only, and didn't have to. It's presumably happened somewhere else in the universe (which is a sizeable place), but I wouldn't be surprised to learn that we're the only example in the 200 billion solar systems of this galaxy.People interested in such things have spent a lot of time trying to put concrete numbers to the odds of these things happening. That last step – the development of intelligence – seems among the most unlikely, but one of the implications of this utterly fascinating book is that perhaps it isn't so unique after all. Enter – by jet propulsion – the octopus.Invertebrates are not generally known for their brainpower. But octopuses (and, to a degree, all cephalopods) are an exception. In terms of sheer neurons, they are well up there with many of the mammals – they have more neural connections than cats, for example. As Godfrey-Smith puts it, they are ‘an island of mental complexity in the sea of invertebrate animals’.That does not mean that the way they think is comparable to us, though, or to your pet Persian. Although a few of an octopus's neurons are gathered into a walnut-sized ‘CPU’ of sorts, most of them are dispersed throughout their body: each of their eight arms can, in a very real sense, ‘think’ and act independently.Godfrey-Smith, though often wearing a marine biologist hat, is a philosopher by training, and he spends a lot of time here addressing the question of what it might feel like to be an octopus, without a centralised ‘self’ in the way that we understand it. I thought I would find these sections irritatingly speculative (which is my reaction to most philosophers, if I'm honest), but in fact they were so grounded in scientific data, and just so interesting, that I was more than happy to go along for the ride.Ultimately, though, the differences are perhaps less significant than the similarities. The most recent common ancestor of humans and octopuses lived upwards of five hundred million years ago, and was probably some kind of very simple worm-like thing without any neural network to speak of. That means that natural selection has, completely independently, developed complex ‘intelligence’ of some kind twice.‘Cephalopods and smart vertebrates are independent experiments in the evolution of the mind,’ Godfrey-Smith summarises. The implications are genuinely awe-inspiring. And looking at an octopus is, in all likelihood, as close to meeting an alien intelligence as we'll ever get."
5,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,4,"Cephalopods are among my favourite animal species. They are amazing and yet so much of them remains mysterious. I was thrilled to learn of this book when a friend recently reviewed it. On the TBR list it went!Peter Godfrey-Smith is a philosophy professor who spends his spare time studying cephalopods. In Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness he takes us underwater to explore these magnificent creatures and to ponder the origin of intelligence and consciousness (I know, you already got that from the title!). Because our evolutionary paths diverged so long ago - about 600 million years ago in the form of a flattened worm-like creature - we know that intelligence and consciousness evolved at least twice. What does that say about intelligence? What does that say about consciousness? Is it inevitable that life forms develop these traits? And exactly how smart are cephalopods? Mr. Godfrey-Smith explores these questions as he relates what we know about these mysterious and awesome sea creatures. A few fascinating facts about octopuses from this book:•There are around 300 known species of octopus at present•The giant Pacific octopus, the largest, weighs in at 100 pounds and can span 20 feet from arm tip to arm tip•Octopuses have blue-green blood (pumped from their three hearts) due to copper, not iron, molecules carrying oxygen•Octopuses seem to distinguish between short-term and long-term memory, as we humans do•Octopuses can squeeze through a hole as tiny as their eyeball!Then there are cuttlefish! Wow, those things are AMAZING! Aside from their apparent intelligence and curiosity of the world around them, they have the ability to change their bodies to all colours of the rainbow. Sometimes this is in patterns such as stripes, other times cloudy. They can change their entire colour scheme in less than a second! ~Australian Giant Cuttlefish by Richard Ling, Wikimedia CommonsClick here to watch a mesmerizing video of Giant Cuttlefish off the coast of NSW, Australia.If you're curious about the strange and awesome creatures which are cephalopods, you might want to pick up this book. It's both informational and philosophical, exploring what intelligence is and why it has evolved.  It is well-written, awe-inspiring and thought-provoking.  Oh, and it also has lots of cool photos! "
6,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"Strangely enough, this book -- which could have turned into a free-for-all metaphysics/philosophy speculation-fest -- actually turned out to be a relatively careful, thoughtful science book that poses, but does not attempt to prove, that octopods may be the real deal.Intelligence does not need a spine. Hell, to me, this should be rather obvious.I appreciate how the old scientific prejudice and just plain annoyance with the creatures might have skewed clear thinking about squids. I also understand that very little in the way of extensive research has been done on them.But what really fascinates me is the hints at what they really could be. Their short lives notwithstanding, they seem to have perceptual powers that are astounding. Every inch of their skin seems to be hyper-aware and the chromatophores (skin pigmentation changes) are wildly expressive and responsive.What I think, and what the book is careful not to speculate on, is pretty fascinating: deep communications are going on in the visual medium. Indeed, since octopods' neural structure is across their entire bodies, we can make some really interesting suppositions. Like full-concept transmissions, learning, teaching ... perhaps even more ... between these short-lived creatures. Maybe consciousness.Me? I love this. The author doesn't take it there, but leads us to this doorstep. It's up to us to dream. :) I love dreaming. :)"
7,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,5,"One of the best books I read this year and not one I had been planning to read. I skimmed a few reviews, which were interesting but did not leave me thinking that I needed to read the full book. But then I started a sample on a whim and was swept away by the carefully observed descriptions of octopuses (and to a lesser degree cuttlefish) and the use of that as a springboard to discuss evolutionary biology and the philosophy of the mind.Octopuses are a type of mollusk and, like all invertebrates, branched off from the stream of animals that led to humans enormously long ago--and well before the evolution of central nervous systems, eyes, or much else of any sophistication. But now octopuses have large collections of neurons, rivaling mammals, but they are evolved largely independently of ours. And they have important differences, for example most of their neurons are distributed in their arms rather than collected together in their brain. This leads Peter Godfrey-Smith to speculate about what this says about intelligence and whether we should think of body parts as having their own autonomous intelligences (in the form of reflexes or even higher order thought in octopuses). Some of the interesting speculations are about how humans benefited from the feedback loop between our sensing of our own actions (e.g., we can hear ourselves talk) while octopuses and cuttlefish can make impressive color displays but are themselves colorblind so they do not see their own displays nor do they use them to communicate with others.Towards the end the book turns poignant as Godfrey-Smith relates how this highly curious and interactive animal, the closest thing to an alien we have on earth, only lives for about two years--much less than anything else its size and intellectual sophistication. This leads into both the evolutionary biology of aging and its link to reproduction and ultimately an homage to the ocean and conservation that is less original than much of the book but powerful for how much he learned about the human mind from swimming on the bottom of the ocean."
8,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,2,"Gosh, I wasn't crazy about this. Godfrey-Smith is an Australian, Sydney native, teaching at City University in New York. He began studying octopus in 2008 by following them around in scuba gear. He is a philosopher, not a scientist. I did not grasp that when we began. There were some very un-scientific notions presented that struck me as weird ""[Cephalopods and baboons] are both partial cases, unfinished, in a sense, though one should not think of evolution as goal-directed.""I should think not. There was some other strange stuff about a gentleman who became aphasic occasionally but still had to express himself, which he did by pointing. Godfrey-Smith thought the man's aphasia 'proved' the man no longer had the capacity for language...despite the man being mentally aware and was pointing to things. Just seems a notion the author is floating that doesn't really bear scrutiny.Look, the man had some terrific times observing squid, giant cuttlefish, and octopus and has some terrific stories (and even some photos) to tell about them--the way they morph shape, texture, and color and look interested to be around humans. We learn that the cephalopods live about two years, which does seem exceptionally short, though Godfrey-Smith goes off on another philosophical tangent about why such a big-brained animal would live so short a time when the dopes of the animal kingdom live comparatively forever.Not the right questions for me. "
9,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/697616-renata,5,"Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, And the Deep Origins of ConsciousnessOther Minds is one of the most remarkable books I have read - ever!There is much I loved about this book, much that fascinated, intrigued, puzzled, flummoxed, and thoroughly delighted me in this wonderful treasure, but none of that would have happened without the extraordinary writing by Peter Godfrey Smith.  So I may have been drawn into the book by the title and my fascination for the octopus, but the other half of the title was equally compelling: the deep origins of consciousness. Where does our consciousness come from? How do we distinguish between mind and action? And, of course, how do our animal cousins experience it? I think we’ve all observed what we feel is consciousness in our mammal friends and certain birds – but in the lizards in my yard? In the fish (etc.) in sea? And, really, who hasn’t wished they could deeply communicate with a beloved pet or some nearby critter?  Smith regales us with delightful, startling, endearing stories of the cephalopods of the sea, primarily the octopus and the cuttle-fish in the waters around Australia. He is a marvelous story teller, a passionate diver, and in those chapters you are hardly aware of reading NF because his narrative voice is so warm, curious, observant, and illuminating. Heck, I didn’t even know what a cuttle-fish was a few years ago and now I’m thinking they are the cutest, most talented little critters to grace the sea (OK – after dolphins). Godrey-Smith describes his experiences swimming with cuttlefish, especially the giant ones. He writes:  “ A cuttlefish looks like a giant octopus attached to a hovercraft. It has a back shaped a bit like a turtle shell, a prominent head, and eight arms coming straight out of the head…This animal is three feet long with a skin that can appear just about any color at all and can change in seconds, sometimes much faster than a second. In the case of large cuttlefish, the entire body is a screen on which patterns are played. Not just a series snapshots, but moving shapes, like stripes and clouds. These seem to be immensely expressive animals, animals with a lot to say. IF SO, WHAT IS BEING SAID AND TO WHOM? And WHY? HOW DOES IT HELP THEIR SURVIVAL? Godfrey-Smith peppers the book (perhaps rather salts )generously with frequent questions, both his own and those of fellow scientists, to engage his readers in continual reflection on the topics being explored. I loved this feature of his writing, it kept my mind actively engaged and gave me the feeling of being a part of this scientific process of open inquiry. The author moves back and forth with a conversational voice that completely pulls the reader into the examination of his philosophical quest. I felt like I was enrolled in a graduate seminar, small and intimate, with a relaxed and warmly conversant professor who knew it really is all about the voyage. And he charmed me with his descriptions of diving experiences like the octopus leading him by the hand in Octopolis, that surprising community of octopuses where we can vicariously delight in their occasional power struggles of who is king of the mountain – now imagine that scenario with two eight-armed creatures! How can you not love the creative spirit of this philosopher scientist who names the cuttle-fish after artists like Matisse and Kandinsky based upon their colorful displays: The author includes both colored photos of the octopus and cuttlefish as well as simplified diagrams to help readers with less of a science background (readers like me) grasp some of his more complex explanations. I found these to be very helpful and was able to bounce back and forth between the written words and the diagrams to build a deeper understanding of new knowledge. He is a patient and able guide and I found myself laughing often at his humorous asides after a particularly complex explanation. For example, one of my favorite chapters was A History of Animals. Godfrey-Smith presents a variety of theories on how scientists formed two views of the evolution of the nervous system: ""Possibilities abound. One nervous system develops on top, and tracks light, but not as a guide to action. Instead it uses light to control bodily rhythms and regulate hormones. Another nervous system evolves to control movement, initially just the movement of the mouth. And at some stage, the two systems begin to move within the body, coming into new relationships with each other. What an amazing image: in a long evolutionary process, a motion controlling brain marches up through your head to meet there some light sensitive organs, which become eyes."" Now really, that just made me want to jump up and cheer! If you have a high tolerance for questions and uncertainty and are willing to go along on a ride of reflecting on possibilities, this book is for you.  Godfrey-Smith ends this book quietly and gently reminding us that the effects of human actions from the past two hundred years are far more hazardous and complex than even the most knowledgeable of experts has imagined them to be. Just this week I read an article on the high levels of toxins that have drifted down into the deepest areas of the Marianas Trench. We have too long held the belief that the rescources of the sea are endless, that the seas are so vast they can withstand all that we put into them; but we are learning that is not so. “The mind evolved in the sea. Water made it possible. All the early stages took place in the water: the origin of life, the birth of animals, the evolution of nervous systems and brains, and the appearance of the complex bodies that make brains worth having.diversity and our alien cousins – the octopus and cuttle-fish. I highly recommend this engaging and thought-provoking book to all who are curious about the spectacular variety of life in our world and how we are all connected by such an insignificant percentage of DNA. Splendid!"
10,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31384949-ian,3,"I decided to give this a go after seeing a glowing recommendation for it in an online article. I suppose those sorts of reviews are a double-edged sword. They get you to read the book, but on the other hand the reader can start with overly high expectations, which is what happened to me in this case.The author’s starting premise is an intriguing one. The complex brains of humans and other mammals are all “variations on a theme” and arise out of differences between quite closely related species. The last common ancestor between humans and molluscs was a worm like creature about a millimetre long, which lived more than 600 million years ago, and yet the octopus also has a complex brain and nervous system. It follows that the octopus brain has developed along a separate evolutionary route, and that evolution has selected complex nervous systems more than once.In fairness the author doesn’t try to overstate his case, commenting that the nervous system of the octopus contains around 500 million neurons, compared to 100 billion in humans. We get some fun descriptions about the intelligence capabilities of octopuses, including that they can recognise individual humans. One laboratory octopus apparently took an inexplicable dislike to one of the researchers and drenched her (and only her) with jets of water whenever she passed too close to the octopus’ tank. Another worked out that lab lights could be put out by shooting jets of salt water at them, and got so good at this the octopus had to be returned to the sea (very “Finding Nemo”-ish).There was a some thought provoking stuff about the nature of consciousness, and the evolutionary basis of aging, but on the whole I felt the author was better at posing questions than delivering answers, and a fair amount of the book seemed speculative."

The attention to detail, the personal approach towards scientific stories -hard to do and well done- and the never ending exhilarating, addictive examples. The only reason it does not get five stars is the ‘other minds’ subject. There is a promise in the beginning that we will dive into another world of consciousness and intelligence with the octopi. The book -for me- does not really deliver on that promise. "

The premise:
Basically, a philosopher tries to parse out how and why cephalopods (octopus, squid, cuttlefish) developed intelligent minds when they split from all other animals we consider to have intelligent minds (e.g. vertebrates like cats, dogs, parrots, monkeys, humans, etc.) so very, very long ago. These are parallel evolutions; our minds and octopoid (it's a word) minds developed completely independent of each other. How? Why? And what does this say about what a “mind” is? Basically, octopi (yes, I know ""octopodes"" and ""octopuses"" are preferred, but fuck off, look how cute ""octopi"" is) are the closest thing we have to alien intelligence.The kind of intelligence octopi have seems, to me, to be similar to the intelligence humans have: adaptivity. For instance, octopi have been observed stealing halved coconut shells- presumably cut in half and discarded by humans. They put one half of the coconut nested inside the other half, and carry this around while moving around the ocean floor. Then when they want to- to catch prey, or for shelter- they put the coconut shells together and go inside. The ability to disassemble, carry around, and reassemble a compound shelter like that? Is there any comparable behavior in any animals other than primates? Like us, octopi play with things that are clearly not edible and have no real use, just out of curiosity. They have long and short term memory. Odds are good they have REM sleep (the sleep in which we, and other mammals, dream), since their cousins cuttlefish appear to have REM sleep (it’s still not demonstrated that octopi do though). But unlike us, they have three hearts and bluish-green blood (we use iron to carry oxygen; they use copper!), no bones or shells. I think my favourite takeaway from this book is the lasting impression you get that, although we may think of ourselves as a clearly dilineated being- one whole individual cohesive self- it is more accurate to think of ourselves as a variety of cells clumped together that coordinate their behavior, through the intake and outtake of chemicals, to perpetuate their own survival. Like the first multicellular life on earth- individual cells that got stuck together and had to learn to use their conglomeration to survive, eventually by some cells doing one biological task and other tasks assigned other tasks. 
My favourite octopus anecdote:
 lab octopi are often fed things like frozen squid, when they much prefer crab. One day, a scientist was distributing frozen squid to a row of octopi tanks one by one. When she got to the end, she turned around and went back the way she came. The octopus in the first tank had not eaten its squid, and was holding it in a clear, obvious way, and appeared to be waiting for her. As the scientist stood there, the octopus made its way across the tank to the outflow pipe, watching the scientist the whole way. Then, still watching her, it dumped the squid down the drain. "
14,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11995655-daren,5,"This is a really well planned out book, which tried to explain in thorough detail, but in ways the general public can understand a wide array of scientific research - primarily evolutionary biology, but also aspects of behavioural science - signaling, communication and a whole bunch of other things that factor into the evolution of octopus and (giant) cuttlefish - which form the largest part of this book. In passing it also deals with comparable animals (including humans), such as bees, pigeons, squid, other mollusks - but only where applicable to octopus and giant cuttlefish.The author is Australian, and for the large part is observing octopus and giant cuttlefish in the ocean near Sydney, but the experimentation and research he quotes is from much further afield. With a strong philosophy background, it does seem that the author does come up with some philosophical conclusions which seem a stretch from the direct scientific research, but almost all of this steps beyond my ability to really process at an an intelligent level. By this, I mean, that I can happily follow what I am reading, and understand each point made, but I don't form a basis in which I can challenge any of the conclusions, and probably now would only have a few scattered (probably incorrect) facts on what I have read to re-share. I read for relaxation, and enjoyed this book a lot, but I don't really retain such knowledge in the long term - I have too much other stuff taking up my limited brainpower. This if course is no criticism of the book, just my excuse for not fact-sharing in this review.5 stars - short and punchy, but constantly interesting."

That book leans heavily on this one; enough so that I recommend that to readers of this and vice versa.I must admit that I came to this with some trepidation given that it's ostensibly about consciousness and by a philosopher. Neither of those things creates an expectation of anything concrete or evidence-based. So primed with an expectation of woolly thinking on anecdotal evidence I ended up being surprised. This one is evidence-based to the core and approaches the basic questions of ""what is it like to be an octopus?"" with a great deal of hard science and observational and experimental evidence. Questions around subjective experience are obviously difficult to talk about scientifically, but if it's at all possible this is the way to do it. And along the way we get a huge helping of what exactly is known about the intelligence of octopuses and cuttlefish.One of the better science books I've read lately."

One of those intelligent books which deftly flows between science and philosophy. Godfrey-Smith is a good writer who handles complex ideas with ease. He has researched well and quotes liberally from many scientific and philosophical sources - adding his own compelling interpretations.But 3 stars rather than 4. I know I am idiosyncratic and inconsistent in my grading. In this case I really wanted to enjoy the book more than I did. It's a great topic, well written and nicely presented. The problem for me is that I'm not sure whether Godfrey Smith wanted to write a book about other minds, using the Octopus as an example - or about the Octopus and it's fascinating nature, including its highly developed nervous system. This may sound like I am being picky, but I found because it flipped between the two it was not quite as good as it could have been.Nevertheless a worthy read whether you are interested in finding out more about sea life or improving your understanding of the problem of other minds."

Godfrey-Smith takes you from the beginning of life on Earth to the present, stopping along the way to point out important developments not just in octopus consciousness, but in our own as well. You'll find charming anecdotes of octopuses outsmarting their scientist captors and giving high-fives to human divers in the wild, as well as descriptions of intriguing experiments in human and animal consciousness.In the end I'm glad I took the plunge into non-fiction.

18,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"""Other Minds"" by Peter Godfrey-Smith is an amazing, thought-provoking book that bridges science and philosophy, notably the question: 'What is consciousness? And how do you know when something is sentient?' Godfrey-Smith addresses this thorny problem by studying the 'other time' intelligence evolved on earth, notably the cephalopods. These animals, which include octopuses and cuddle fish, are intelligent, especially the octopuses. They solve complex cognitive tasks as readily as magpies and monkeys. They show adaptiveness, inventiveness and tool use. Their skins contain glands that allow them to change colors in a variety of patterns, often mimicking their surroundings to a discerning degree. And yet, for all their smarts, they seem alien to us. Because the cephalopods have a decentralized nervous system. But he does not leave us there. instead, he goes on to illustrate how we humans also have decentralized nervous systems. Though we tell ourselves inner 'stories' that make it seem like there's a ""me"" in control, much cognitive science research shows otherwise. For instance, I'll ask you to play along. Now sit still, but raise your hand whenever you want. Humans experience this as a their ""me"" deciding, after some random interval, to raise their hands. And yet MRI scans of brains show that the hand is raised BEFORE the conscious deciding parts of the brain come into action. So perhaps, octopuses aren't as alien as we think. Which leads to the flipped-around observation: the more we study human cognition, the more alien it appears. The biggest drawback to this book for me was that it meandered in places. Some of the information presented seemed to lack focus and neither strengthened the author's arguments nor rebutted contrary theories. Regardless, though, ""Other Minds"" is a great science read. Especially for people using science to explore realms 'beyond science' where scientific research can illuminate issues but can never provide answers. Like, 'is this moral,' or 'is a doc sentient?'Four stars."

21,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65154201-clare,4,"OVERALL AVERAGE RATING: 3.8Content: 4/5So last year I read The Lightkeepers by Abby Geni (excellent book by the way), and one of the things that stuck with me from that book was the octopus that one of the characters kept as a pet. Geni had described it as such an enigmatic creature that I immediately wanted to read more about them. With that said, this book was extremely detailed and informative, covering a span of topics from the evolutionary history of cephalopods to current research that’s being done on these animals. The author, a philosopher interestingly enough, also took an insightful stance on the cognitive lives of cephalopods, juxtaposing it with that of humans and other animals.Organization: 4/5Organization worked well enough. The chapters are organized into key topics, including how cephalopods evolved, how their body plan is related to their cognition, and matters regarding their lifespan. I didn’t know that most cephalopods only live up to an average of two years! There was probably one chapter in the book where the author went on a bit of a tangent about other minds and theories of consciousness but it eventually came full circle.Writing: 3.5/5I would say that the writing style probably a little dry. I’ve read nonfiction before with authors who were engaging and/or humorous storytellers so this one, unfortunately, paled in comparison in this aspect. Entertainment: 3.5/5Despite the dry writing style and the fact that this book took me an unnecessarily long time to read, I still enjoyed it overall. It certainly fulfilled my curiosity about octopuses, and gave me a new appreciation for these amazing creatures. It ended a little more sadly than I was expecting, wrapping up with a cautionary tale about the importance of preserving our oceans but the ending was perfectly appropriate."

I was absolutely enthralled by the author's discoveries made at a site he calls ""Octopolis,"" a community of octopuses on the seafloor near Sydney, Australia.One of the most interesting facets of the book to me was its explanation, in terms of existing evolutionary thought, of how and why cephalopods, animals that live a single mating cycle on average, developed the astoundingly complex signaling behaviors and apparent cognitive abilities they have. It's a wonderful and involving story.That makes this sound like a four-and-a-half star book, doesn't it? I'm not going to beat about the bush, it would have been had it not wandered waaay too far down the human-mind-brain-consciousness rabbit hole without reaching any sort of conclusion that felt solid. In the space of this book, just over 200 pages of text plus index and notes, there is no chance that this could occur. So say ""listen, there's about a bajillion petaflops of data I can't begin to pretend to digest for you, but here in 500 words is what *I* want you to know so you can see where I'm going with the parts about cephalopods.""The glossy-magazine version, in other words, would've served this book better and been less simultaneously overinforming and underrepresenting a hugely complex and contentious area of human-consciousness study. But I recommend reading the book because damn it feels good to learn about something unique from someone so warm, wise, and witty as Peter Godfrey-Smith."
24,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"[29 September 2018]This fascinating short book is about octopuses, the development of consciousness in both humans and other animals, why living creatures die, and other interesting topics. A strange mix, you think? Yes, but very well done. This is not a scientific work. The author is not a scientist, but a philosopher. However, he might also be called a naturalist, one who observes nature closely and reports on it. And he does it well. His writing style is relaxed, almost conversational, and very sympathetic. He loves him some octopuses and pulls the reader in to that fascination. But he also is very smart and thinks deeply about other topics that are tangentially related to octopuses. He makes a pretty good case for octopuses having a certain type of consciousness and describes pretty clearly how consciousness might have developed generally. His descriptions of why creatures, including man, die are a little more opaque, but still mostly make sense. Strongly recommended."

But this book does make a strong case that the octopus and the cuttlefish (Godfrey-Smith definitely has a crush on cuttlefish) are quite intelligent. And because we parted ways evolutionarily quite a long time back, he says, we can study them to understand our own path to consciousness. It sounds like the science is far from settled but he sketches out a few different theories that seem plausible and make you think more concretely about what consciousness even is. He also writes eloquently about his encounters with octopuses and cuttlefish and their interesting behaviors."
26,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24679550-ashley-c,4,"Godfrey-Smith marries his passion for octopi and other cephalopods and his expertise and work on the philosophy of consciousness in this short and readable book. It's interesting how every reader, according to the reviews I read, tackles this book from a different angle. Some are here for the cool colour-changing squid and embodied intelligence of the octopus. Some are here for the discussion of evolution. Some are here for the philosophy. I can't speak for everyone else, but for someone who's interested in an introduction and an opinion piece on the philosophy of consciousness by discussing human and non-human animal consciousness, this is a pretty solid book. 
""If we can make contact with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of shared history... but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.""
The idea is this: as much as we like to think we do, we don't know a hoot about consciousness, what it is, and what it isn't. Any intuitive, gut-feel opinion you have about what consciousness definitely is would not hold up once you start breaking it down. We try to learn about our own consciousness and that of animals by understanding its history ie. when we think it was formed, and by pitting the two of them at each other (much more complex than that of course but this is beyond me). From there, it leads to other relevant, practical issues, like animal ethics, and... well, all the decisions that the human society have collectively ever made based on our current understanding of consciousness. For someone who loves exactly what the author is passionate about, this would be the perfect book. Which is to say that it feels like the author wrote this mostly for himself and other enthusiasts of this particular melding of topics. There's something very inspiring reading someone's work that they wrote because they're so very interested in the subject and telling everyone about it. However, I do agree with some other commentors that this book became quite disjointed because of that. I find myself struggling to interest myself in the author's long descriptions of the scientists' findings at the Octopolis. But a small price to pay for the rest of the book.I end my review here, but I've written down some notes for myself:
""In the Ediacaran, other animals might be there around you, without being especially relevant. In the Cambrian, each animal becomes an important part of the environment of others. This entanglement of one life in another, and its evolutionary consequences, is due to behavior and the mechanisms controlling it. From this point on, the mind evolved in response to other minds.""""From the early Cambrian onward there was definitely predation, together with everything that predation encourages: tracking, chasing, defending... The revolution in behavior seen in the Cambrian also occurred, in large part, through the unfolding of possibilities inherent in a particular kind of body.""
Very interesting revelation here. Considering how embedded in our layman understanding or attempted justifications of morality, societal roles, and many other things is the idea that there is a natural order of how living things or animals or nature that we should somehow emulate, and how it's 'commonsense' that this natural order has always been a prey-predator set-up that is timeless, it's definitely revelatory that there was a period of time not too far removed from nature as we know it that the prey-predator system was evolved from what was once not. Surely we can use this as a learning point to examine our deep-seated beliefs on the 'natural order of things', and step away from giving this argument any sort of weight in our everyday philosophies. 
""The octopus, indeed, has a “different embodiment,” but one so unusual that it does not fit any of the standard views in this area. The usual debate is between those who see the brain as an all-powerful CEO and those who emphasize the intelligence stored in the body itself. Both views rely on a distinction between brain-based and body-based knowledge. The octopus lives outside both the usual pictures. Its embodiment prevents it from doing the sorts of things that are usually emphasized in the embodied cognition theories. The octopus, in a sense, is disembodied. That word makes it sound immaterial, which is not, of course, what I have in mind. It has a body, and is a material object. But the body itself is protean, all possibility; it has none of the costs and gains of a constraining and action-guiding body. The octopus lives outside the usual body/brain divide.""
Perfect summary to a great chapter Mischief And Craft. I appreciate how the author uses the octopus to present an alternative view to the two mainstream and competing schools of thought on mind-body cognition."

If we want to understand other minds, the minds of cephalopods are the most other of all.
 The tagline for Other Minds is: A philosopher dons a wet suit and journeys into the depths of consciousness. And that's exactly what this book is – a philosophical (so, thought experiments rather than empirically sciencey) look at consciousness, and despite the monstrous octopus dominating the cover, cephalopods are so little understood that rather than truly making them the stars of this book, author Peter Godfrey-Smith recounts what we understand about the evolution of human consciousness and then holds up the octopus as an example of “other”; we don't know how or what (or if) they think, but it's not like us. As a scuba enthusiast, Godfrey-Smith has spent a lot of time under the sea watching octopuses and cuttlefish, so this book features many beautiful pictures and eyewitness anecdotes, and there are several lab-based octopus experiments discussed, but this isn't really a book about octopuses. The bottom line is that this wasn't the book I was expecting, I wasn't entirely engaged by Godfrey-Smith's writing style, and I was often bored – but still don't regret reading it; there are enough interesting nuggets along the way.
Cephalopods are an island of mental complexity in the sea of invertebrate animals. Because our most recent common ancestor was so simple and lies so far back, cephalopods are an independent experiment in the evolution of large brains and complex behavior. If we can make contact with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of a shared history, not because of kinship, but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien. 
 After making this intriguing statement in the book's introduction, I mistakenly believed that Godfrey-Smith would then explain to me this alien mind, but he really can't – octopuses can seem curious, display novel thinking to solve problems in the lab, even recognise familiar human faces, but scientists have no idea how they do any of it. Godfrey-Smith goes over the best guesses we have about the evolution of sentience in vertebrates – from simple attract/avoid responses to stimuli, to the body/mind divide, feedback loops and afference, interior monologues as a precursor to language, etc. – and stresses there's no reason to believe that our interior experience is anything like that of the cephalopods. He cites Thomas Nagel and his seminal work 
What is it like to be a bat?
, and really, if Nagel's point was that conciousness is so subjective that humans will never understand the experience of being a related creature like a bat, for example, how could we ever hope to understand the experience of being a creature like an octopus that developed brains in a process completely independent to our own? Godfrey-Smith is constantly asking questions he can't quite answer: Octopuses and cuttlefish engage in nonstop, ever-changing, colourful displays, but are colourblind; why do they bother? Octopuses and cuttlefish only live a year or two before breeding and then suddenly dying; why invest resources into a costly large brain if it's not for a long learning curve? With most of their nervous system distributed through their tentacles – which operate without the central brain's command or even awareness – just what is the role of that central brain?In an octopus, the nervous system as a whole is a more relevant object than the brain: it's not clear where the brain itself begins and ends, and the nervous system runs all through the body. The octopus is suffused with nervousness; the body is not a separate thing that is controlled by the brain or the nervous system...the body itself is protean, all possibility; it has none of the costs and gains of a constraining and action-guiding body. The octopus lives outside the usual body/brain divide.Is that an answer? In the end, I suppose, it's the questions that matter most to philosophers, but I didn't find my own mind expanded by what I encountered here; and that's what matters most to me."
28,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"The mind is a complex entity, we have only scratched the surface in comprehending how it works and what it is capable of. The neural networks that make up the brain are capable of absorbing vast sums of information and making sense of them fast. The intelligence that we have, and can see in other mammals and birds, in particular, other primates, cetaceans, and corvids. There is another set of animals that seem to have also benefited from a large brain and complex neural networks and that is the cephalopods. You’ll probably know them better as cuttlefish, squid and the octopus. These are quite amazing creatures, not only are they aware of all that is going on around them, they can open jars to get the treat inside, have been known to squirt lights with jets of water as they don’t like the brightness and have been found crawling across the floors of laboratories in an escape bid. The skin operates like a high-res video screen as it is able to mimic its surroundings and ripple with colours depending on mood. They have been proven to recognise individual members of staff, even when in the same uniform, so much so that a person they took a dislike too would get drenched when they walked past.Peter Godfrey-Smith first came across them when someone introduced him to a place they had called Octopolis. This was a place that had many octopi that had brought and discarded scallop shells and begun to make it a safe haven from the predators around. There were a large number of the creatures there that seemed to tolerate each other most of the time, but every now and again there would be running battles between some of the males and Godfrey-Smith was fortunate to capture these on video. Godfrey-Smith though is a philosopher of science, not a biologist, but it got him thinking; just how had this creature had evolved down a separate branch of our shared tree and had ended up at a level of sentience which was quite advanced. The octopi that he regularly sees as he scuba dives off the coast of Sydney are willing to come up and interact with him and the other divers, It is an interesting book comparing our understanding of human consciousness with a creature that is so alien that we cannot fully get a grip on what it is thinking. There is a lot on the biological makeup of cephalopods and how their brain and nervous system works, as well as a couple of chapters on the evolution of consciousness and how the need to be aware of your surroundings has driven the development of the brain. I would have liked to read more about the observations that they had conducted on Octopolis as the chapters that were there were fascinating. Definitely worth reading for those that have an interest in marine ecology and peering into the dark recesses of the mind."
29,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1510665-steven-peck,4,"A fantastic look at one of Earth's alien creatures. The book was strong on the evolution of consciousness and cephalopods. The author whose work I am familiar with from philosophy of science stuck to the science and did not speculate much beyond. I sort of wish he had. I think a more speculative chapter would have been fascinating given the author's background--especially on the origin of, say, qualia. The author's experiences with this group of animals was especially interesting and it was nice to see a philosopher in the water with this subjects. In a late chapter, he wanders from the subject with a look at senescence which if you don't know anything about it is worth reading, but as a biologist I thought the chapter a distraction from his main exploration of consciousness. Overall well worth the read, and I might come back to this a time or two. "
30,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4802663-deborah-ideiosepius,5,"This was a marvelous book, I enjoyed every page, regreted that it was going so fast and I learned so much from it in such an enjoyable fashion!The title and subtitle very accurately lay out it's contents: It explores the mental worlds of Octopus and other Cephalopods, their intelligence, how they might think, what the internal and external worlds of an animal so different to us might look like.I read a lot of marine books, anything to do with Cephalopod's in particular I seek out, this book is one that I found quite exceptionally unique among those I have read. This unusual element I think, can be traced to the fact that the author is a professor of philosophy who has done a lot of scuba diving (I can't describe how jealous I am over all the time he has spend diving Octopolis is New South Wales). And so, as a philosopher, hanging out with marine biologists, observing one of the most amazing animals in the ocean, the book as well as it's subjects, is unique.The first part of the book tells us a little about the evolution of animals from non-complex forms of life to complex, it describes the early ammonites and belemnites and their descendants, who having ditched the huge shells, became the relatively unprotected octopus and cuttlefish of the modern seas. This was all well written and interesting, interspersed as it was with octopus stories it was lovely to read, but not startlingly new to me. Having a marine biology degree this was more of a refresher for the parts of evolution relevant to the story of octopus that was being told. Though the way in which it was told was fascinating.Later in the book however, when the author addresses colours? That was a brilliant (pun fully intended) section, there was so much new information and the author brings together beautifully all the small bits of research relevant to the points he is making about octopus intelligence. Anyone who has every marveled at the amazing colour changes and displays of octopus or giant cuttlefish should read this section, I can't imagine it better described.I think that part of what makes this book so spectacular, at least to a cephalopod nerd like myself, is the beauty and clarity with which it is written. There is all the unfussy clarity and accuracy of an academic for the information, the enthusiasm and the anecdotes of a diver mixed in with the unique perspectives of the philosopher. The last portion of the book, where the exploration of 'minds' really takes place was the most complicated reading for me, I have read a little psychology, and ethics philosophy but not that much or that recently. Again, the author draws from diverse writings relevant to development of 'mind' and then ties it all in to what we know, or think we know about octopus and cuttlefish.All in all, a marvelous book. I was in equal parts dismayed and delighted at it's end, I wanted more but the ending was a natural one. This is a book I will definitely re-read, in total and in parts. Also the academically precise notes give me a whole list of further reading, if I can get my hands on any of them."
31,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,4,"The author's primary goal is examining how evolutionary biology might contribute to our understanding of consciousness. This examination combines scientific observation with philosophical theorizing, and it is not always easy to follow.I found the first four chapters fascinating. The narrative starts with single cells, perhaps 700 million years ago, hovering in a water column. Their proximity might be conducive to a sensing of surrounding cells. How did these single cells unite to form multicellular organisms?  “Most likely, the origin of animals did not stem from a meeting between lone cells who drifted together. Rather, animals arose from a cell whose daughters did not separate properly during cell division.” (p.29)Godfrey-Smith writes in an academic style, although he avoids the pitfall of littering his prose with technical jargon. Typically, he poses a question, provides a reasonable and widely held hypothesis, points out flaws, and offers alternative hypotheses. He does this when he offers up a proto-comb jelly rather than the sponge as the earliest branch of multicellular organism.  “Again we start with a clump of cells, but then imagine that this clump folds into a filmy globe-like form, swims in a simple rhythm as it lives suspended in the water column. The evolution of animals proceeds from there — from a hovering ghost-like mother, rather than a wriggling sponge larva who refused to settle down.” (p.21)Godfrey-Smith moves on to question the familiar model of the sensory system as a means for motor control (the sensory-motor model) He points out that motor control is not a simple matter, but a complex system of micro-actions that need to occur in sequence. Coordination, not merely stimulus and response needs to occur. He calls this the action-shaping view of the nervous system.Conceptual distinctions like this fill this book. They are important questions, but often interrupt the evolutionary narrative Godfrey-Smith is telling at the same time. Just when and how these complexities evolved are only vaguely tied to the transition between two contrasting periods. Life in the Ediacaren Period lasting from 635 to 542 million years ago consisted of passive organisms grazing on an undersea carpet of vegetation. In the next period, the Cambrian, there was an unaccounted for explosion of differentiated organisms with a variety of body types. More important, there is evidence of sensory development designed for predation and defense: antennae, shells, claws, and what biologist Andrew Parker believes was the most significant development, eyes.One of the most interesting concepts examined is that of perceptual constancy. We view an object from multiple angles and from multiple distances. We interpret these as images of the same object. In order to do this, we need to have a sense of self that's different from the external world. He gives an example of a fish sending out electrical pulses.  “The self-produced pulses will affect their own senses, though, and it may be difficult for a fish to distinguish the pulses it has made from electrical disturbances that are due to external things. To deal with this problem, whenever a fish emits a pulse it also sends a copy of the command around to the sensing system, enabling that system to counteract the effect of the pulse it has produced.” (p.83) Implicitly there is the faintest hint of memory. There is an on-going dialogue comparing a perception a nano-second before and a perception of now. This will be the foundation of consciousness.By now, the reader will be wondering, what about the octopus? The octopus and its relatives the squid and the cuttlefish are almost incidental characters in this evolutionary drama. Readers interested solely in these animals should focus on chapters 3 (“Mischief and Craft”), chapter 5 (“Making Colors”), and chapter 8 (Octopolis). A series of color photographs are included at the end of the book as well. While reading this book I was struck by how interesting Godfrey-Smith's behavioral observations were. They are a reminder that often the most interesting questions and hypotheses arise from observation rather than experiment. In these chapters, the curiosity and potential of these mysterious animals was captured most vividly. He concludes that because of their short life spans and inability to use their color changes as a communication tool, the cephalopods lead lives of circumscribed possibilities. Were they to think about this, they might say the same of us: circumscribed by our lungs and goal-oriented ambitions, we will never experience the wonders of the sea in the same way they do.

The joins between the two are pretty seamless, so they lead into one another and contribute to one another — if you hate philosophy, this would probably still be okay for you, because it does lean a little toward the science end. To my mind, anyway. If you don’t have a strong grounding in either, it’s still accessible and fascinating, as long as you have some level of interest in the subject.What we know about cuttlefish and octopus minds is just astounding — their intelligence is almost uncanny, and yet we know very little about how they experience the world. There were a few surprises here for me — their typically short lives, their decentralised control of movement, the seeming personalities of the animals the author observed…There’s a lot of anecdotes and such, so if you’re looking for hard science, this isn’t really what you want. But if you’re casually interested, then I recommend it. And if you can end it without wanting to dive and meet some cuttlefish and octopi for yourself, you must be made of stone. (Not really, but. I’m left so curious! That’s a thing I love in a book.)Originally posted on breathesbooks.com."

It touches on psychology, physiology, biology, and evolution. I was inspired to ask questions about topics which I'd yet to think deeply upon.A couple of warnings:1) If you are disturbed by depictions of animals being harmed, there is a brief section in here that speaks about experiments performed on animals. Some may find this upsetting to read, but it is a very tiny portion.2) If you only have a Kindle Paperwhite or original Kindle, be aware that this contains some lovely color photos (in the middle in the dead-tree, at the back in the digital). I simply pulled up the photos on a Kindle app on my phone, but this should be a factor to consider when deciding which format you want.I received a complimentary copy of this book via a Goodreads giveaway.

34,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28230750-adam,5,"Cephalopods are an island of mental complexity in the sea of invertebrate animals. Because our most recent common ancestor was so simple and lies so far back, cephalopods are an independent experiment in the evolution of large brains and complex behavior. If we can make contact with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of a shared history, not because of kinship, but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.I've always found them creepy, but I didn't realize the octopus was so fascinating. Consider: The most famous octopus anecdotes are tales of escape and thievery, in which octopuses in aquariums raid neighboring tanks at night for food. Those stories, despite their charm, are not especially indicative of high intelligence. Neighboring tanks are not so different from tide pools, even though the entrance and exit take more effort. Here is a behavior I find more intriguing. Octopuses in at least two aquariums have learned to turn off the lights by squirting jets of water at the bulbs when no one is watching, and short-circuiting the power supply. At the University of Otago in New Zealand, this became so expensive that the octopus had to be released back to the wild. A lab in Germany had the same problem. This seems very smart indeed. However, one can also sketch an explanation which may partially deflate the story. Octopuses don’t like bright lights, and they squirt jets of water at all sorts of things that annoy them (as Peter Dews discovered). ...This case illustrates a more general fact: octopuses have an ability to adapt to the special circumstances of captivity and their interaction with human keepers. Octopuses in the wild are fairly solitary animals. Their social life, in most species, is thought to be minimal (though later I’ll look at exceptions to this pattern). In the lab, however, they are often quick to get the hang of how life works in their new circumstances. For example, it has long appeared that captive octopuses can recognize and behave differently toward individual human keepers. Stories of this kind have been coming out of different labs for years. Initially it all seemed anecdotal. In the same lab in New Zealand that had the “lights-out” problem, an octopus took a dislike to one member of the lab staff, for no obvious reason, and whenever that person passed by on the walkway behind the tank she received a jet of half a gallon of water in the back of her neck. Shelley Adamo, of Dalhousie University, had one cuttlefish who reliably squirted streams of water at all new visitors to the lab, and not at people who were often around. In 2010, an experiment confirmed that giant Pacific octopuses can indeed recognize individual humans, and can do this even when the humans are wearing identical uniforms.Stefan Linquist, a philosopher who once studied octopus behavior in the lab, puts it like this: “When you work with fish, they have no idea they are in a tank, somewhere unnatural. With octopuses it is totally different. They know that they are inside this special place, and you are outside it. All their behaviors are affected by their awareness of captivity.” Linquist’s octopuses would mess around with their tank, manipulating and testing it. Linquist had a problem with octopuses deliberately plugging the outflow valves on the tanks by poking in their arms, perhaps to increase the water level. Of course, this flooded the entire lab.Another tale that illustrates Linquist’s point was told to me by Jean Boal, of Millersville University in Pennsylvania. Boal has a reputation as one of the most rigorous and critical of cephalopod researchers. She is known for her meticulous experimental designs, and her insistence that “cognition” or “thought” in these animals should be hypothesized only when experimental results cannot be explained in any simpler way. But like many researchers, she has a few tales of behaviors that are baffling in what they seem to show about the inner lives of these animals. One of these incidents has stayed in her mind for over a decade. Octopuses love to eat crabs, but in the lab they are often fed on thawed-out frozen shrimp or squid. It takes octopuses a while to get used to these second-rate foods, but eventually they do. One day Boal was walking down a row of tanks, feeding each octopus a piece of thawed squid as she passed. On reaching the end of the row, she walked back the way she’d come. The octopus in the first tank, though, seemed to be waiting for her. It had not eaten its squid, but instead was holding it conspicuously. As Boal stood there, the octopus made its way slowly across the tank toward the outflow pipe, watching her all the way. When it reached the outflow pipe, still watching her, it dumped the scrap of squid down the drain. Godfrey-Smith uses his own fascination with the octopus to ask questions about human consciousness and communication.Interesting bits:(view spoiler)[When biologists look at a bird, a mammal, even a fish, they are able to map many parts of one animal’s brain onto another’s. Vertebrate brains all have a common architecture. When vertebrate brains are compared to octopus brains, all bets—or rather, all mappings—are off. There is no part-by-part correspondence between the parts of their brains and ours. Indeed, octopuses have not even collected the majority of their neurons inside their brains; most of the neurons are found in their arms. Given all this, the way to work out how smart octopuses are is to look at what they can do.

Once at a site close to this one, an octopus grabbed his hand and walked off with him in tow. Matt followed, as if he were being led across the sea floor by a very small eight-legged child. The tour went on for ten minutes, and ended at the octopus’s den. (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[To use an older term, if it feels like something to be a squid or octopus, then these are sentient beings. Sentience comes before consciousness. Where does sentience come from?It’s not a soul-like substance that is somehow added to the physical world, as dualists think. Nor is it something that pervades all of nature, as panpsychists believe. Sentience is brought into being somehow from the evolution of sensing and acting; it involves being a living system with a point of view on the world around it. If we take that approach, though, a perplexity we run into immediately is the fact that those capacities are so widespread—they are found far outside the organisms that are usually thought to have experience of some kind.  (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[ Octopus skin itself can both sense light and also produce a response that affects the skin’s color. ... What could it be like to see with your skin? There could be no focusing of an image. Only general changes and washes of light could be detected. We don’t yet know whether the skin’s sensing is communicated to the brain, or whether the information remains local. Both possibilities stretch the imagination. If the skin’s sensing is carried to the brain, then the animal’s visual sensitivity would extend in all directions, beyond where the eyes can reach. If the skin’s sensing does not reach the brain, then each arm might see for itself, and keep what it sees to itself.The Ramirez and Oakley finding is an important development, but it does not yet solve the problem I emphasized above, the problem of color perception. The photoreceptor in the skin of Ramirez and Oakley’s octopuses is sensitive to the same wavelengths as the photoreceptor in the eye. Even if the whole body can see, it seems that it must be seeing in monochrome. The problem of color match remains. I suspect, though, that the Ramirez work will lead to a resolution of this problem. A hint was offered in the older paper by Mäthger and her colleagues. They noted that even if the photoreceptors in the skin are chemically the same as the ones in the eye, their light sensing might be modulated by the chromatophores, or other cells, around them. This might permit one kind of photoreceptor to behave like two. Some butterflies use a similar trick. ... Suppose that by changing its colors a cephalopod affects the light that reaches sensors within its skin. Then some of these ongoing low-level color changes might be a way of surveying the chromatic environment. (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[Ordinary speech functions both as input and as output. Hearing provides the mind with input; our speech is an output. We both speak and hear, and we can hear what we say. Even talking to yourself out loud can be a useful way of approaching a problem. I’ll now tie these familiar facts to a concept that has become increasingly important in the brain sciences: the concept of an efference copy. (The word efference here means the same thing as output, or action.) The best way to introduce the idea is through the example of vision.When you move your head or shift your gaze, the image on your retina continually changes, but this is not perceived as a change in the objects around you. You continually compensate for your own eye movements, so when something does move in the environment, you register it. This requires that you keep track of your own decisions to act. With an efference copy mechanism, as you decide to act, sending a “command” of some sort to your muscles, you also send a When you move your head or shift your gaze, the image on your retina continually changes, but this is not perceived as a change in the objects around you. You continually compensate for your own eye movements, so when something does move in the environment, you register it. This requires that you keep track of your own decisions to act. With an efference copy mechanism, as you decide to act, sending a “command” of some sort to your muscles, you also send a faint image of the same command (a “copy” of it, in a rough sense of that term) to the part of the brain that deals with visual input. This enables that part to take into account what your own motions are doing. (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[The sounds we cook up in our heads, including the sounds of words, are broadcast in our minds in something like the way that many ordinary perceptual experiences are broadcast. Once a sentence of inner speech is composed, it is exposed to the same sort of processing that would apply to a sentence we hear. A novel combination of ideas, or an exhortation to act, is thus made available for consideration; it can have the same sort of effect that an ordinary spoken sentence can have.  (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[When you write something down in order to remind yourself to finish a job later, you are making a mark that your later self will sense—something you’ll perceive. In that respect it’s like the sexton and Revere. But that mark was made by your present self to get your later self to do something that completes a task. In that respect it’s like the internal coordination of activities—action shaping—even though the coordination makes use of a causal loop that runs through the external world. The coordination involves making a mark that will later be sensed.Some of these useful loops run outside the skin, and some run inside. Efference copies are internal messages, activity in the nervous system. When you move your head and the world seems to remain still, that is achieved by internal means. Here an internal message is used to solve a problem that arises from the effect of action on sensing. But these internal arcs, like the external ones, can also provide opportunities and novel resources. That is how things look within the model I gave earlier for the origins of inner speech. Copies of things you plan to say can give rise to silent actions of their own—inner actions that raise possibilities, put ideas together, and exert self-control. Inner speech can feel a bit like reafference—like the result of an action that affects your senses—but inner speech is confined inside, hence not really heard (at least when things are working as they should). If inner speech is a kind of broadcasting of information in the brain, it resembles the loop of reafference seen when you talk aloud to yourself or write notes to yourself. But this time the loop is tighter and more confined, invisible rather than public, a field for free and silent experiment.When we see the human mind as the locus of countless loops of this kind, it gives us a different perspective on our own lives and those of other animals. This includes the cephalopods discussed in this book. Their expressive medium, colors and patterns, does not lend itself to complex loops. (That’s true even setting aside the ironies associated with their alleged color-blindness.) Making skin patterns, no matter how complicated they might be, is more of a one-way street. The animal can’t see its own patterns in the way a person can hear what they say. There’s probably not much role for efference copies that involve skin patterns (unless some speculative theories of the role of chromatophores in skin sensing are correct). Cephalopod displays have enormous expressive power, but as long as we’re looking at a single animal, rather than a pair or a group, these displays are not embedded in a lot of looping feedback, and perhaps could never be. The human case—an extreme case—suggests that the opportunities associated with reafference help to drive the evolution of a more complicated mind. Cephalopods are on a different road.And this is not the only aspect of cephalopod life that circumscribes their possibilities. (hide spoiler)]"

So I was a bit disappointed to see that it was mainly about octopuses and cephelopods. Though the focus was on them, the philosophical discussions it offered was novel and arguably universal. So I was eventually satisfied."
37,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31467977-tom-quinn,4,"Every Internet user past 2009 has seen the video of the octopus carrying a coconut shell around. It delighted viewers and, according to the various captions and Buzzfeed article titles, stunned scientists. I've been intrigued by octopuses and squids since I was a young boy and particularly pleased to see them occupy a bigger space in animal behavior studies lately, so this title was right up my alley.This is a book about convergent evolution—that is, the independent evolution of similar features in species of different lineages. Consider flight: bats do it, and birds do it too, but in each species the talent arose separately. Now consider the mind. People have one. Octopuses seem to. They arose separately. So what can we learn by examining this weird and wild quirk of evolution? Philosopher and self-proclaimed ""cephalopod-inclined hobbyist"" Peter Godfrey-Smith takes us on an exploration of consciousness and sentience found in as alien a creature as you're likely to find sharing planet Earth. It's a really interesting topic brought out of the dusty realm of the thought experiment and into the real world, combining Biology with Philosophy. First we get a quick and dirty explanation of evolutionary processes. Then the author moves further into the exploration of sentience, gently scolding Tom Nagel for asking what it is like to be a bat—the ""like"" in that question is confusing and misleading, he maintains, as it locks us into comparing ourselves to something else. Instead he wants to know not what is it LIKE, but more purely: What IS IT to be a bat an octopus? Then the whole thing is capped off by an interesting look at aging from an evolutionary point of view and a lot about cephalopod behavior and oceanic ecology.4 stars out of 5. Engaging and even exciting at times, written with flair and occasional but understated good humor and wit. My only complaint is the overtly academic writing tendency to refer to what will be talked about in a future chapter and to ask us to recall what was talked about in an earlier chapter."

It proved to be a fascinating mix of ‘stuff of about cephalopods’ and philosophical musings that suited me quite nicely.

The truth is I didn’t like it and sometimes I felt like it dragged over and over and went into many different directions that made no sense, so I thought of abandoning many times. However, I am not sure if it was because of the audiobook format (I’ve listen to two audiobooks over the past weeks and my experience has been quite meh, to say the least), or that I was misled by its cover –I was expecting a book about octopuses and their ‘intelligence’ and I got a random mix of biology, psychology, philosophy and environmental issues. Prior to starting this book, I did not read the caption, and I just went with the title and the idea of learning of the level of consciousness of these cephalopods –I thought there were going to be descriptions of real cases of interactions between humans and octopuses… and well, the truth is that there is very little of it. This book is more of an essay of how consciousness evolved in some species deep in the ocean and how it might be linked to our own evolution? I am not even sure. My attention was lost in many parts. It’s just like… honestly, I am not interested on philosophy or consciousness and I was looking forward to descriptions of experiences with these peculiar animals. My curiosity was not filled but that does not mean the book is bad –it was simply of a theme that does not interest me. ____Creo que mi calificación que di a este libro puede no ser totalmente justa. La realidad es que no me gustó y en muchas ocasiones sentí que ahondaba demasiado en muchos detalles e iba en distintas direcciones, lo cual me hizo pensar abandonar la lectura. Sin embargo, aquí es donde no estoy segura si fue el formato en audiolibro (las últimas semanas he leído varios así y en general me han parecido mediocres) o que me engañó la portada, porque estaba esperando un libro sobre los pulpos y su inteligencia y lo que obtuve fue una mezcla de psicología, biología, filosofía y temas ambientales. La cuestión es que no leí la sinopsis del libro y me dejé ir con la idea del título y de aprender algo sobre el nivel de conciencia de estos cefalópodos –pensé que encontraría descripciones de casos reales de interacciones entre pulpos y humanos. La realidad es que el libro no se trata de esto y es más un ensayo sobre la evolución de la conciencia en algunas especies de las aguas profundas y cómo ello se vincula a la propia evolución de la conciencia subjetiva humana. ¿Creo? En verdad que no estoy muy segura ya que en muchas secciones me distraje. Honestamente, no estoy interesada en temas de filosofía o conciencia y lo que yo quería era descripciones de experiencias con estos animales peculiares. Por lo tanto, mi curiosidad no fue satisfecha, si bien esto no significa que el libro sea malo –era, sencillamente, de un tema que no me interesaba."
43,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,3,"I enjoyed this book, as I find modern science is learning more and more about the intelligent behavior of animals. I also learned a lot about the lives of cephalopods, some of which was quite surprising:* most octopuses only live a couple of years; a female reaches maturity, mates, hatches a brood and then dies, often in a matter of months* speaking of mating: the male octopus or cuttlefish literally hands over his sperm in tiny packages (spermatophores), placing it in a notch in the female, where she can break it later to fertilize her eggs! (Who knew?)* the nervous system of cephalopods is distributed throughout their bodies, and their limbs are semi-autonomous* these creatures have various skin layers, some of which are sensitive to light and colors that they sense and display back in ways which are not entirely clear. It may be a form of subtle communication, but the author has even noticed cephalopods talking/coloring to themselves...What was somewhat disappointing, was the lack of discussion about the nature and ""deep origins"" of consciousness. Although the author spent some time outlining the evolution of cephalopods, and how their nervous systems and brains may be akin to other species, such as ours, I had hoped he would have talked more about the nature of consciousness itself. Other than some interesting discussion of sensation and the nervous system, that headlined topic really wasn't delved into to the degree I was hoping, especially as Godfrey-Smith is primarily a philosopher rather than a biologist. The latter tend to get hung up on consciousness as an epi-effect of the brain and nervous system, so I was hoping for more philosophical insight on the nature of thought, even if from the difficult to know perspective of an octopus.All things considered, a good, interesting read!"
44,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,4,"A delightful fun book. How much do you know about octopuses? Beyond Sponge Bob and the Beatles I knew relatively little about them. Did you know they are quite intelligent? Well, they are, but in a way quite different than you would expect from a dog or a dolphin. And that is the point of thoroughly intriguing book from Peter Godfrey-Smith. The book starts as it should at the beginning, about 600 million years ago. It was a time known as the ediacaran period, that stretch of millions of years before the cambrian explosion. During this period all the animals were soft, so fossils are rare and indistinct, but there is evidence that the line that would become mollusks had already split from the line that would become humans and all fellow creatures with spines. The cambrian ""explosion"" appears in the fossil record as a ""sudden"" dramatic change mainly because during this period life developed shells and other solid structures making the fossils much more distinct. For a period of time it appears that mollusks pretty much ruled the oceans. He actually starts earlier, and follows bacteria to form colonies, and sponges, and finally true multi-cellular beings. Yup, both humans and octopuses are both true multi-cellular beings, but that is about all we have in common because everything after that came along differently. He writes about the role of the nervous system as it evolves with and beside other structures of the body. Larger multi-celled animals need a nervous system to operate.He then switches gears and spends a good part of the book telling stories about his research on octopuses as well as squid, cuttlefish, and a few other related creatures. He did a lot of observations at ""Octopolis"" a place off the coast of Australia where a large number of octopuses live in close proximity, marked by a large collection of discarded shells. (Absolutely no mention of why they didn't name this place the ""Octopus's Garden"") He tells a lot of stories of caring for octopuses in laboratory tanks. They can recognize new visitors to the lab even when they all wear the same uniform! They clearly understand that they are in an aquarium, and understand there are things going on outside the aquarium. The stories imply not only that the creatures are smart, but that they as ""sneaky"". They seem to know whether you are paying attention to them or not, and they tend to sneak away just when you are not looking.Their bodies are very very different than those of vertebrates. The skin not only changes color, but also can change its shape and consistency. The ability to camouflage is spectacular. How does it figure all this out?Their brains are not like out brains though. Instead of a single centralized unit in the head, their brain appears to be more distributed through the body, and especially in the tentacles which is after all where they probably need most of the smarts anyway if it is involved in camouflage and manipulating things.Octopuses and squid have eyes that are surprisingly similar to human eyes, but they clearly evolved completely separately, and they have notable structural differences. They only have one kind of photo receptor implying that they only see black and white. Cuttlefish put on dramatic, colorful displays to each other and what use could this be if they can only see black and white? What I found amazing is that they also have the photoreceptors in their skin. Furthermore, the skin pigmentation cells (chromatophores) used for camouflage and sending flashy displays might also work together with these photoreceptors to get a sense of the color around them. In chapter 6 Godfrey-Smith is finally ready to discuss what all this might mean for consciousness. He puts forward that human language and human consciousness is very auditory in nature. The ""inner voice"" (a.k.a. system 2, the logical reasoning part of consciousness) seems to work linearly in the way that a spoken language does. This would clearly have a large effect on the type of consciousness you have. What if, instead of vocal chords, the brain is wired directly to a video screen to transmit video images to others around you? This would surely make for a form of consciousness that might be entirely different from those of all vertebrates. He can't make any conclusions for sure of what the fundamental elements of that consciousness might be, but just the contemplation of it is interesting. Then comes a chapter on one tragic aspect of octopus existence: they live a very short life: 2 to 4 years. Many species have a single cycle of spawning. Then their bodies fall apart. We normally think of intelligence being a bigger benefit to animals that live longer because the high cost of learning can pay out benefit over a longer period. For such high intelligence, they have so little time to learn things. He closes the book with more stories of Octopolis and his concerns about how the changes in the world climate and CO2 levels pose threats to these ecosystems that support these delicate creatures. He is no flaming eco-warrior, however one who loves nature enough to dedicate years to the study of such an illusive animal can not help but be concerned about the obvious destruction that we see going on in the sea. Usually, the bigger, smarter animals at the top of the food chain are the most disrupted by ecosystem changes. The loss of these animals would be a great loss indeed.Overall, it was to me a new and interesting topic one, easy to read, and one that will probably inform many related thoughts in years to come. While the speculation on consciousness forms a central subject in this book, it does not dominate it. Most of the pleasure of reading this book just comes from discovering what different and unusual creatures these amazing animals are."
45,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44110461-esme,4,"I enjoyed myself quite a bit with this book, although I didn't buy into everything that was discussed. It went over the evolution of the Cephalopod branch and how they developed on a totally different time scale and path than did other 'intelligent' species on this planet. It was discovered only fairly recently that birds and dolphins and elephants have a sense of self. There have been many tests to discover just how 'intelligent' those species are, and the results have been remarkable. Dolphins have their own language, we sort of knew this already, but the extent of their language includes individual names. We are hoping that we'll ""crack the language"" using computers and other tech to help us along within the next couple decades. Wouldn't that be cool as shit, talk to the dolphins! Similarly, Elephants have shown to be much more vocal than we had thought previously, probably because half of their vocalizations occur on lower wavelengths we can't hear. Research has taken many steps in positive directions when it comes to animal welfare, rights, and treatment while they are being used for study and research. We now have protection for all animals with a backbone... but unfortunately this does not extend to invertebrates. Even that's beginning to change though and that's great because it's been shown that the Octopus and Cuttlefish are just as smart as Jays/Crows and probably on par with dogs. It's not okay to electroshock them, to cut off arms and see what happens, to drill into their brains with no anesthetic. Some countries have already taken steps to banning this sort of research, we're just waiting on the rest to catch up with the times. This guy is really more of a philosopher with science in his background, the book had a lot of speculation and anecdotal evidence which is fine and interesting - just be aware of it before you buy it. As stated before, I didn't totally buy everything since some of it was just speculation with no studies to back it up. However, most scientific research starts with speculation - look at this, isn't that neat? I wonder if it's because of XYZ? The philosophical aspects also allowed for more interesting range of topics with less rules and more rigid topic structure which you find with many non fiction science books. This guy has a passion for his topic of study, and that's what I enjoyed most. He really loves Octopi and is advocating for their treatment and welfare to be as humane as possible. We need more people like this speaking out for those that can't speak for themselves. Who would want to live their lives being poked, prodded, and cut apart with no medicine to dull the pain? "
46,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6638317-jill,3,"I have spent most of my day telling everyone within earshot all my new octofacts. I love them. I love octopuses. They are so smart and fascinating and bratty and symbolically excellent (they exemplify possibility and exploration, in physical and cognitive form!! COME ON), and also very cute. Just google ""baby octopus,"" like I spent the other part of my day doing. I will never eat octopus (or any other cephalopod) again :( So for octopus-love-creating I give this book 10 out of 5 stars, good job and well done and I would like three octopus tattoos thank you.However, for actual book merit: some issues. Pros: - massively engaging, particularly for a non-fiction book. Like, this may just have been my new obsession driving me forward, but I blew through it in less than a day. Super readable, and very interesting.- Godfrey-Smith makes some interesting hints at points about consciousness.Cons:- Godfrey-Smith doesn't really make any actual points about consciousness.- The book mostly hinges on Godfrey-Smith's individual encounters with particular species of octopus & cuttlefish. The conclusions he does draw rely heavily on his firsthand experiences with them, and while the anecdotes are interesting, like, they're just kinda tra-la-la anecdotes about his own deep-sea diving. Cool, but y'know.- It seemed short. I actually sad-gasped when I realized how close I was to finishing. I wanted so much more information about my new best ceph-riends, though maybe that information doesn't exist yet. Still, I feel that things were strangely organized, a lot of rambling with little nuggets of information, and the whole thing just felt incomplete at the end. This might have been ameliorated with a conclusion other than ""we keep developing neural networks across evolutionary experiments."" Okay, but that feels like the start of the book rather than the end.- Maybe I just want a sequel. But can that one be about octopuses too, please?In conclusion,  ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡"
47,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8618881-jamie-erin,3,"My inclination is to rate this book with 3 stars. I don't feel compelled to rate it more highly because for me, much of it (a full 50 percent) was a slog: I persevered through the drawn-out, somewhat sloppily organized philosophical delvings into the evolution of large nervous systems so that I could read another fascinating account of interactions with cephalopods. And Godfrey-Smith has some of the best anecdotes about cephalopod behavior that I've read. In addition, he has an endearing (and relatable) passion for and interest in these semi-alien animals. It was his excitement and first-hand experience with these creatures that drew me forward.I need to point out, however, that I didn't read the full description of the book before diving in. I saw that it was about cephalopods, which have piqued my interest with their evident curiosity and intelligence at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and I figured I'd enjoy learning more about their behaviors. As the description clearly says, however (and as I therefore should have known), this is a book that uses cephalopods to approach questions of sentience and evolutionary development in all creatures. I could find this interesting on a limited scale, but not to the depth and length given it by Other Minds. I also felt that the organization of all of the material (philosophical, scientific, and observational) could have been improved with some deep editing. I enjoy both philosophy and science, but more than once Godfrey-Smith seemed to be ""thinking out loud,"" and basically developing his theories over the course of the book. I felt like I was reading his personal diary in which he painstakingly worked out the questions and potential answers about the development of consciousness and the brain.Would I recommend this book to someone who, like me, wants to learn more about cephalopods? No, unless a reader is willing to skip around to get to the most interesting and revealing sections."
48,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49782194-conor-ahern,3,"This book has an interesting premise--octopi and their close relatives, unlike all other semi-intelligent beings (such as birds, whales, dolphins, pigs, and apes, etc.), diverged so early that their intelligence is less a variant on our own (like the aforementioned ape and pig intelligence) than a sui generis form of intelligence, the closest we might ever get to encountering alien sentience. Octopi show attitudes toward people and things, curiosity about objects, and base level comprehension of the dynamism of their surroundings, all in ways that Godfrey-Smith goes out of his way to explain cannot be explained, as in so many other animals, as mere functions of necessity or reactions. Octopi have some sort of comprehension of the world; they have a distinguishable stratum of activity and quirks that unquestionably elevates them above mere automata. And of course they're physically weird and distinct in all of the ways that the inhabitants of the briny deep tend to be.Although this book could tend toward tedium, left some big questions unanswered, and anthropomorphized a bit too liberally, it was really interesting and weird (in a good way!) overall!"
49,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48327873-markus,5,"OTHER MINDSThe Octopus and Evolution of Intelligent LifeBy Peter Godfrey-Smith (first published in 2017)When we imagine the lives and experiences of simpler animals, we often visualize some scaled down version of ourselves.Cephalopods bring us into contact with something very different.An octopus’s eye is similar to ours. It is formed like a camera, with an adjustable lens that focuses an image on a retina.The eyes are similar, but the brains behind them are different on almost every scale.If we want to understand other minds, the minds of cephalopods are the most other of all.To understand the evolution of human beings and the cephalopods we have to go back in time on the tree of evolution, about 600 million years.The last common ancestor of ourselves and the octopus, or of mammals and cephalopods,was likely a tiny creature, just millimetres long, like a small flattened worm, swimming about or crawling on the seafloor, or both? Maybe with simple eyes, with little else defining head and tails. With time passing for unknown reasons some of these worms developed differently and the tree of evolution started to make branches. One path from that underwater split leads to our branch of the tree, the vertebrates, etc. to mammals and eventually to humans.The other branch leads to the invertebrate species, like crabs, bees, worms, and also the molluscs, including clams, oysters, and snails.Most of the animals on this branch are relatively small, with exceptions. Some developed very complex social behaviours, but they all have small nervous systems.Except for the cephalopods. These are a subgroup within the molluscs, they are related to clams, and snails, but they have developed large nervous systems and an ability to behave in ways very different from other invertebrates.They did this in a very different evolutionary path from ours.Cephalopods are an island of mental complexity in the world of invertebrate animals.Cephalopods are an independent experiment of nature in the evolution of large brains and complex behaviour. On a different branch of the evolutionary tree, nature built minds twice over.Some of the cephalopods became smart.A common octopus has about 500 million neurons in its body. Roughly the same range as various smaller animals, close to the range of dogs, and cephalopods have a much larger nervous system than all other invertebrates.When vertebrate brains are compared to octopus brains, all bets are off. There is no part by part correspondence between our brains and theirs.Indeed, octopuses have not collected the majority of their neurons in their heads, most of their neurons are found in their arms.Half a billion neurons – why so many? What do they do for the animal? Nobody knows. We can make some guesses, that’s all.There is a mental surplus in the octopus.There are some similarities with the human being, as its eyes, but also some psychological Like learning, rewards, and punishment, long-term a short-term memory, they also seem to have something like sleep, possibly even something like dreams.Some features are a mixture of similarity and difference. We have hearts; the octopus has three hearts. Their heart pumps blood that is blue-green, using copper as the oxygen-carrying molecule instead of the iron which makes our blood red.There is the sizeable nervous system but built on a different design, with different relationships between the body and the brain.The octopus lives outside the usual body/brain divide, in a sense it is disembodied.Photoreceptors have been found to be active in the skin of a particular octopus. It appears that octopuses can see with their skin. More studies are needed for confirmation.Some cuttlefish and a few octopuses display a continual kaleidoscopic process of colour change that seems to be disconnected from anything going on outside them. They appear instead to be an inadvertent expression of the electrochemical tumult inside them.This is probably the closest we will come to meet an intelligent alien.The author of this study, Professor Peter Godfrey-Smith, is teaching philosophy and science at the University of New York and the University of Sidney.He is also a skilled scuba diver.In his many diving excursions mostly off the East coast of Australia, over several years, he made the most delightful and exciting encounters with octopuses and cuttlefish.""I have sometimes been able to recognize an individual over many days, occasionally over a week. It's not easy to re-identify animals which can change their entire colour and shape at will, but sometimes a distinctive scar makes it possible.Different animals respond differently to me. Some tend to come forward, in a resting pattern of colours and observe. The friendliest of them have reached an arm forward to touch me.Sometimes I reach an arm out close to his arms, but do not touch them. The cuttlefish reaches the tip of an arm out to touch mine. Then he shifts back to a few feet distance.""One possible interpretation of this action might be that the cuttlefish see if I might be good to eat.Another day, diving with my friend Matt in the Octopus site, we came across an octopus who seized Matt’s hand and led him over the seafloor, pulling him along behind. We have no Idea why he might have done this.The story tells us of many more exciting behaviours of these creatures, both in captivity in laboratories as well as in nature at the bottom of the ocean.The mind evolved in the sea. Water made it possible. All the early stages, the origin of life, the birth of animals, the evolution of nervous systems and the appearance of the complex bodies that make brains worth having.Professor Godfrey-Smith published this study in 2017, and it is likely a most up to date treaties on this subject.I read this book with enormous pleasure, as a precious follow up on my previous readings onDarwin, Pliny, Lamarck and Buffon, the History of Nature.I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this field of science."
50,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1492668-mark,3,"The author is a philosopher of Science. This is a discussion of the evolutionary origin of consciousness with much, albeit referenced, speculation, and centered largely on the seeming intelligence of Cephalopods (primarily the Octopus and Cuttlefish). The text is rambling and includes digressions on, for example, Baboon behavior and an excellent summary of the evolutionary theory of aging. Although it is not quite a fully organized classical essay, I enjoyed all of it, especially the information on the natural history of the Cephalopods. A few remarks, e.g. 'the esophagus of the Octopus passes through its brain', will probably lead me to more reading on the anatomy of these animals. Oh, and that may be it for me and Calamari."

This was a 'book challenge' book needed to check off a box. I mention that only because this is a book I would have never, ever picked up on my own. But I enjoyed this psychological approach to octopuses. The cephlopods mentioned were intriguing. I learned so many facts about them, and some of these facts were contrary to what I have always believed. I also rounded up because I loved the narrator's voice of the audio edition. This was nicely done."

Some parts describe evolutionary history and movement along the tree of life, some describe cephalopod biology and the author's experiences with cephalopods, and others apply evolutionary biology to explain -- or at least outline an explanation of -- consciousness. Powerful stuff by one possessed of a contageous curiosity."

58,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/992639-melanie,1,"I really, really, really wanted to like this book! I am a huge fan of cephalopods and have read many lay-science books about them. Aside from which I have a BS in biochemistry, which means I've taken a lot of biology courses. I'm putting that out there because it colors my critique of this book and I want to be honest about that.When I bought the book, I failed to notice that the author is a doctor of philosophy. Actual philosophy, not like a Ph.D. in some random, hopefully scientific field. The author is actually a philosopher. And he is approaching a scientific question with a philosophical approach. That might be okay in the question of how intelligent or how conscious or what drives cephalopod behavior, but the author dives well out of his area of informed discourse, arriving at some truly absurd speculations or even conclusions.For instance, how did multicellular life arise? Lacking any background information on this and possibly failing to understand whatever he read, he concluded that multiple single cell organisms joined forces to create a new multicellular entity. While it is true that most cells these days do contain organelles that are derived from what were once probably infectious or parasitic species, this is quite different from entirely different types of organisms simply sticking together. Such a scenario would mean that humans, among others, would be composed of two distinct cell lines in a single body. How this could work reproductively is a serious question.Another weird area of ignorance is his marvel that octopuses can navigate a complex environment and yet know exactly where they are and how to get back to it each night. This is not some marvel behaviour of octopuses, it is a common, almost universal, fact of life for motile species. Insects can do it. Fish can do it. Crabs can do it. Butterflies can travel half-way around the world. Dragonflies know where all of their feeding grounds are. While I admit that this is an impressive skill which I don't think is fully understood, the author presents it as a distinct issue related to octopuses.Also, his own anecdotal experiences do not count as a valid basis for scientific conjuncture. This is not the scientific method. Personal experiences are influenced by personal experiences. An example of this that many people may have experienced is that after buying a new car, you start seeing that type of car everywhere. Did people suddenly follow your inclination to buy that model of car? No, you became sensitized to their presence. This is why scientists do not rely on anecdotal evidence.In the question of consciousness, where the author has a legitimate claim to expertise, he is rambling and long-winded. Alas, I was unable to finish the book."
59,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38449140-alasdair-reads,3,"A fascinating topic area. There are two principle difficulties with the book. First, there is a lot of speculative, broad brush science here. The author, to his credit does a good job of alerting us and not making unsupported assertions this but it can be difficult to wade through, particularly in the rather dry area of evolutionary history that makes up the first part of the book. Second, the author never quite brings alive the story of the people and events involved in the same way as he does his love and the strangeness of these animals. It is the rare book that would work better as a documentary series."

The best parts of the book were its musings on what it means to be conscious. The second best parts were the facts about evolution's various branches. The part about the octopi were super interesting, but it didn't really fit in to either strand all that well. Or I suppose, it asked a lot of good questions without answering any of them. It was still a fascinating read and I would highly recommend it, but I feel like it could have used another few chapters to tie in the various themes. "

63,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24022721-christian-schwoerke,3,"This is a fascinating book, but its title is a bit misleading. The title is probably the publisher’s idea, as I found the book an erudite (and incredibly well footnoted and bibliographed) portmanteau of lots of things about octopuses (and cuttlefish), but only about half the book was about consciousness and other minds. While the discussion of evolution and the splitting off of ancestors at various stages is important to understand how at least two unique types of minds/consciousness arose, the discussions of longevity and colors only tangentially contribute to the theme of consciousness.Godfrey-Smith does a good job of elaborating how distinctive the octopus and cuttlefish (and squid) minds are, how they did not arise along the same lines as those of mammals, birds, reptiles, or fish. Uniquely, the octopus’ intelligence (its network of neurons) is spread throughout its body so that its arms—in some fashion as yet unknown—are capable of acting independently of, though still subordinate to, the central intelligence of its cephalic brain. Godfrey-Smith discusses some theories of consciousness related to morphology, how an entity’s intelligence/consciousness is in part determined by its physical contours as it interacts with the world. While I entirely buy into this concept and see how it would apply readily to octopuses, I wanted to read more about how this theory could define the particular attributes of human or say, turtle, intelligence.Equally fascinating were Godfrey-Smith’s discussions of longevity in a species, not as a function of deterioration, but as the result of a mutation in that species’ DNA that propagates and converges in that species to set parameters of senescence. I’m not certain I fully understood this discussion, since personal experience (I’m 65 years old) more readily aligns with the “breaking down/wearing out” theory. (However, too much of my sort of “common sense” thinking would have the majority of us observing that the sun revolves around a flat earth.)The discussion of communication between octopuses was limited but suggestive, especially the idea that their coloration might play a part in that communication, if not in a general and overt way displaying inner states of thought or affect (or perhaps some other organic process, such as digestion).Godfrey-Smith’s particular octopus haven in Australia is a cove where he and others often see as many as a dozen octopuses in a very loose community. This “octopolis” is unusual, and is only one of a handful discovered. The book’s celebration of the mysterious otherness of the octopus is dimmed by concerns for the welfare of the ocean. Godfrey-Smith makes clear the importance of the ocean for the initial and ongoing generation of life and notes just how much in the past three centuries humankind’s actions have begun to alter the ocean, to the detriment of its inhabitants and, by extension, the rest of the world."
64,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12162514-graeme-newell,4,"This book explores the concept that consciousness is not a lone human occurrence, but is an inevitable result of the evolutionary process. It provides strong evidence that mammals are not the only sentient beings in the world. Research suggests that cephalopods have remarkable intelligence and a well developed concept of “self.”It’s fascinating to learn about other brains. A big part of an octopus’s brain is located in its arms and is distributed throughout its entire body. This facilitates an incredibly decentralized responsiveness not possible in human brains.The author offers some fascinating evidence on how life evolved. I was particularly intrigued by the notion that different organisms came together and formed an organized “co-op” called a body. Our bodies are not an “I” they are a “we.”Cells that were good at making friends merged with other organisms and thus were the ones that survived. Current human bodies rely heavily on outside bacteria and countless other external organisms to facilitate digestion, disease control and countless other internal processes. It looks like this mixing and merging of these completely separate organisms is at the very core of the evolution of all life.Smith also provides a fascinating explanation of the science of lifespan. Why do mosquitos live for weeks, humans live for decades and trees live for hundreds of years? Turns out there’s hard science to explain which species win the lifespan lottery. Organisms with omnipresent predators tend to live fast and then die young, ending their lives with a go-for-broke burst of procreation. Creatures with long lives tend to have less pervasive predators, but this makes them more vulnerable to genetic mutations. Creatures that are eaten by predators never get a chance to die from cancer in old age. It’s important to remember that evolution does not just optimize for survival; it optimizes for procreation.I loved the first half of this book, but the last half tends to get a bit bogged down in theoretical discussions of consciousness. Smith also spends too much time describing his research processes and even indulges in a chapter devoted to admiration of cephalopods. This guy really loves octopuses and cuttlefish. Overall, this was a very interesting book. I learned a lot."
65,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24869130-david-tierney,5,"I didn't think a book about octopuses and the evolution of intelligence could make me laugh, but some of Godfrey-Smith's stories of the odd creatures were hilarious. Smith has been charged by angry cuttlefish, recounts a friend being pulled by an octopus to its den, and outlines an experiment where an octopus would squirt water at one particular experimenter they disliked and at an irritating light bulb. Beside the humour, this is a well-researched book, and Smith clearly has a deep understanding of his subject. Assertions are often backed up with scientific experiments and the resulting discourse is fascinating. However, it is also clear that some of Smith's conclusions are stretching the results and are influenced by his interest in octopuses; he sometimes seems to project emotions on the creatures, not to an irrational degree but to the point that there doesn't seem to be enough evidence to back him up. Nevertheless, this also reflects the strongest points of the book, his love of octopuses.Smith doesn't delve into any deep emotions he feels, even when it is obvious that he must be feeling them. Smith uses concise, simple, unemotional sentences, never sinking to hyperbole or flashy words. He simply describes what is happening and trusts the weight of his images to be important enough as they are. Smith has witnessed some horrific scenes, and describes one occasion where he tried to shield an octopus from an attacking leatherjacket fish before realising that he was causing the octopus more distress than the attack was, and instead left them to die.Originally, I was just going to give this book four stars, as there are some points at the midpoint where my concentration lapsed and the narrative felt as though it lacked direction, but after remembering chuckling in a cafe and nearly shedding a few tears into my pillow (I pretty much never cry at anything) I had to give it five. This is an accessible, enjoyable, and informative read."
66,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35364873-lisa-lynch,3,"The last time I read anything philosophical was probably in college when I decided to take a course on ancient philosophy. I ended up struggling with the class, mostly because the professor himself was quite ancient. I swear to god at least once per class he would forget what he was talking about mid-lecture and had to ask us all to remind him what section of the text we were on. I also remember a day when he had a coughing fit and left the classroom for a good 20 minutes, leaving us all to worry he was dead somewhere in the building. (He wasn't.)The only thing I learned from that class that I've retained over the years is that some dude named Descartes said ""I think; therefore I am,"" and also that I don't really care much about philosophy.But I care about octopuses. So I decided to read Peter Godfrey-Smith's Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness and, honestly, its a mixed bag.All of the science about octopuses here is really cool. Like, really cool. All of Godfrey-Smith's stories about his experiences studying octopuses and cuttlefish are also cool and interesting, albeit a bit too anecdotal at times, which I decided wasn't the worst thing in the world. And then there was all of this speculative discussion of human consciousness and its loose connection to the nervous systems of cephalopods and I just didn't enjoy it at all. To be fair, I'm not one who really enjoys deep ponderings, so I kind of set myself up to fail on this one.The idea that the intelligence of these creatures is so alien compared to anything else on earth is fascinating. But Godfrey-Smith makes some pretty big comparative evolutionary leaps between octopuses and humans that don't have enough facts or even logically detailed arguments for it to feel believable enough for me. Most of this book lacked explanations and seemed to expect the reader to accept things at face value, regardless.I mean, there is this statement early on that both humans and octopuses are made up, largely, of water and a careful balance of and salt and yeah, that is true. But I could also argue that pickles are made up of the same damn thing, so unless you can back it up with facts or even a logical explanation, I'm not willing to accept this as some defining revelation about the connection between the two. It was interesting to read the author's perspective, but it felt a bit incomplete. Or perhaps poorly edited? The structure of the book doesn't flow very well together at all.I think what I liked the most about this book is how it made me think. So I'm still going to give Peter Godfrey-Smith's Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness 3.5 out of 5 stars. I recommend this if you are interested in octopuses and consciousness, but be prepared for a whole lot of speculation and not much facts."

We often use humankind as the standard for questions like these but this book explores a distant branch of the tree of life for signs of intelligence; specifically the cephalopods, consisting of the squid, the cuttlefish, and above all the octopus. The author, Peter Godfrey-Smith, a distinguished philosopher of science and a skilled scuba diver, uses his encounters with these creatures as a jumping off point for exploring questions of evolution, consciousness, and intelligence among animals that are almost as alien as extra-terrestrial beings.The story begins and largely continues in the oceans from which all life originally came. The evolution of seaborne groups of cells is explored as they gradually became more complicated creatures that were capable of sensing, acting, and signalling, The author identifies gradual evolutionary developments that led to nervous systems in creatures like mollusks. Some of these mollusks abandoned their shells and rose from the ocean floor gradually developing the greater intelligence needed to search for prey and survive. This evolution continued for millennia just as our forebears and other mammals developed on land. The most fascinating aspect of this story is the search for and discovery of the nature of intelligence in cephalopods. Through observation the author identifies how the brain that is so compactly and centrally located in the human head appears to be spread out throughout the body of the octopus. “In an octopus, the nervous system as a whole is a more relevant object than the brain: it’s not clear where the brain itself begins and ends, and the nervous system runs all through the body. The octopus is suffused with nervousness; the body is not a separate thing that is controlled by the brain or nervous system.” (p 75) It seems that in an octopus the nervous system as a whole is equivalent to their brain. A relevant philosophical discussion about how to imagine this is conisidered in Thomas Nagel's famous essay, ""What is it Like to Be a Bat?"" (Philosophical Review, 1974). Most interesting for this reader was the way that the evolution of cephalopods has mirrored our own evolution in some ways even as the organisms have developed differently in response to their environments. The author's interaction with a nest of octopuses, in itself a discovery, provided information about the difference of these animals, yet also led to identification of a level of intelligence that was both beyond any previously assumed and far different that that typical for mammals and most other creatures. These discoveries, including tentacles that are so full of neurons that they appear to think for themselves, solved some of the mysteries of these creatures and provided encouragement that further answers will be found.

74,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,3,"As humanity finally learns (or is forced) to confront the reality and imminent dangers of climate change, we’re going to need every bit of mental flexibility and creativity we can muster. There has probably never been a moment in history when it was more critical for us to explore and appreciate types of intelligence different from our own. If for no other reason, this makes Peter Godfrey-Smith’s Other Minds a text worthy of attention. In this examination of the origins and character of cephalopod intelligence, Godfrey-Smith gives readers an opportunity not only to encounter a radically different kind of mind, but also to reflect on the intricacy and limitations of our own cognition. This is a great complement to one of my favorite books of 2016: Frans de Waal’s 
Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?
Although I enjoyed this book overall, I wish I had read Other Minds about a decade ago. Godfrey-Smith does a good job of providing the necessary context for discussions about the biological origins of life, intelligence and consciousness, and effectually brings his philosophical training to the table. But, unfortunately for me, I’ve studied these areas quite a lot already; too often I found my mind wandering due to over-familiarity with large chunks of the subject matter.Happily, I’m not at all educated about the delightful cephalopods with which Godfrey-Smith is so smitten. Reading about the lives of these sea-dwellers––squid, cuttlefish, octopus, nautilus––captivated my imagination and unlocked yet another vein of gratitude for Earth’s cornucopia of life.Godfrey-Smith frames humanity’s study of cephalopods as “probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien” (9). This is primarily because the last common ancestor shared by both humans and cephalopods is much, much further in the past than that of any other nonhuman animals we consider intelligent. Godfrey-Smith makes a strong case for the radical otherness of cephalopods, but also points out toward the end of the book that “it’s [the octopus] not really an alien; the Earth and its oceans made us both” (200). This tension between terrestrial familiarity and biological/behavioral alterity is what makes Other Minds an engaging read.Cephalopods––and octopuses primarily––possess some extremely unique characteristics, including almost limitless flexibility, distributed nervous systems, and skin that changes color with perplexing celerity and attitude. This “body of pure possibility,” as Godfrey-Smith puts it, “makes it clear the way they have become smart animals. They are smart in the sense of being curious and flexible; they are adventurous, opportunistic” (48, 64, emphasis his). Above all, I think it is this quality that makes the octopus a deserving recipient of our respect and affection.Although the chapter on cephalopod color-making is fascinating, the highlight for me is Godfrey-Smith’s descriptions of how their nervous systems are structured. Unlike humans, cephalopods do not have a single location we can point to and say, Ah, now here’s where the lion’s share of cognition and executive control are located. Instead,""A different body plan evolved, and a different kind of nervous system. These nervous systems are more distributed, less centralized, than ours. Invertebrates’ neurons are often collected into many ganglia, little knots that are spread through the body and connected to each other. The ganglia can be arranged in pairs, linked by connectors that run along the body and across it, like lines of latitude and longitude. This is sometimes called a 'ladder-like' nervous system, and it does look like a ladder embedded within the body. The ancestral cephalopods probably had nervous systems something like this, so when evolution multiplied their neurons, the multiplication took place on this design.In that expansion, some ganglia became large and complex, and new ones were added. Neurons concentrated at the front of the animal, forming something more and more like a definite brain. The old ladder-like designed was partly submerged, but only partly, and the underlying architecture of cephalopod nervous systems remain quite different from our own."" (66, emphasis his)Research indicates that cephalopod limbs have considerable autonomy compared to the limbs of mammals, although the degree to which this is true is imperfectly understood. Godfrey-Smith believes that a “mixture of localized and top-down control might be operating” (68). While this is also true of humans and other nonhuman animals to some degree, it seems a fair assumption that our cephalopod friends are far less cognitively “united” than we are. This makes it extremely difficult to imagine what an octopus’s experience might be like; we can’t even be sure if its experience is centralized enough to constitute a subjectivity that can “feel” anything at all. For a harrowing and brilliant fictionalized exploration of how distributed nervous systems might operate in highly intelligent yet non-conscious entities, I recommend Peter Watts’s 
Blindsight
.I think we can learn an important lesson from cephalopod anatomy. This lesson doesn’t pertain to us as discrete individuals, but rather to our collective endeavors. Time and again we find that organizations––businesses, governments, charities, churches, armies, etc.––suffer when they fail to achieve a balance between top-down and bottom-up pressures. Too much control concentrated at the top tends to alienate and disempower the majority of participants, whereas too little centralized organization tends to make organizations grossly inefficient. I think everyone would benefit from remembering the noble octopus when trying to analyze and overcome this persistent challenge.Though the book contains a lot of interesting information and insight, the final pages of Other Minds left me unsatisfied. This is no fault of Godfrey-Smith’s; the problem is intrinsic to inquiries that bring us to the very edge of human knowledge. Despite our best efforts to understand cephalopods, the only clear message I took away is that we know hardly anything about what’s really going on with these wacky critters––at least for now! And while I welcome an opportunity to acknowledge nature’s grand mysteries, I’d hoped for something more concrete than the measured speculations Godfrey-Smith was able to provide. This review was originally published on my blog, words&dirt."
75,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16803629-hank,2," It is funny how expectations color the book reading, or really any, experience. If I had thought this was less about octopuses and more about philosophy, I might have given it more stars but perhaps not. There is much about octopuses and cuttlefish that is interesting, listed in Other Minds, it just isn't very coherent or put together well. Plus at least two thirds of the book attempts to discuss the whole ""I think, therefore I am"" mantra and how it might relate to animals and not octopuses. Trying to analyze why exactly I didn't like this book, I think it comes down to the fact that Godfrey-Smith is trying to pass off this book as science and it doesn't make the cut. There is lots of science in the book, like how cuttlefish use and create colors, what the octopus high five means, etc but these are all science details that somebody else researched. Godfrey-Smith tries to tie it all up into something that proves octopuses and other animals are more sentient than we give them credit for but what he really was created was a bunch of nebulous discussion with listed facts only marginally supporting the premise and most of the time the facts were just listed, and not even tied to what he wanted to say. Disappointing as a story, didn't flow, no plan. Disappointing as a science book, nothing more than unprovable philosophy and disappointing as an octopus book."

No, really be an octopus?Godfrey-Smith is a philosopher of science and scuba diver who uses the strange intelligence of octopuses as an entry into evolution, consciousness, and the meeting of minds across a gulf of time and space. Octopuses are legendary in aquarium circles for being avid tricksters, squirting people with jets of water, and breaking out of their tanks to eat fish in the middle of the night before stopping home. Yet for all their intelligence, they are poorly understood animals. Why are they so intelligent, and how does their unusual neural architecture support consciousness.The last ancestor between all of chordates and mollusks was some kind of flatworm that lived over 600 millions years ago, with a few neurons and light sensitive patches. And while vertebrates evolved densely networked brains, octopuses and their relatives have a 'ladder' neural architecture, with each tentacle possessing nearly as many neurons as the central brain. Cuttlefish, those seemingly deep and serene minds, send images sparkling across their skin in ever changing patterns.In the end, we are left with more questions than answers. But it surely wonderous that we share our planet with such a strange aquatic intelligence."

Other Minds combines evolutionary history (tracing back to the point where the chordates split off from the invertebrates, some of whom have been conducting their own experiments with big brains), philosophy of consciousness (including a nifty section on how consciousness might have evolved), with some very good nature writing. I love Godfrey-Smith's description of being led by the hand by an octopus showing off its garden, and his anecdotes of octopuses expressing their annoyance to insensitive researchers. There's a definite ""science fiction"" feel to the journey, but it's all grounded in solid research. The writing's always clear, sometimes lyrical.

83,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7147893-tom,5,"I first learned about this wonderful book from Amia Srinivasan's excellent essay on it in the London Review of Books. After reading the essay I tracked down this book and purchased it and I have to say I found it fantastic. That said I must admit that this book may be specifically targeted at my interests. If you're not interested in questions of consciousness, animal intelligence, and marine cephalopods you might not find it as engrossing as I did.Octopuses (no, not octopi) are pretty amazing creatures. Their ability to change shape is legendary. Even large octopuses are able to squeeze through tiny holes. With no shell or internal skeleton of any kind, the sky is pretty much the limit when it comes to the body shapes they can adopt. Their eight legs are flexible and powerful tools. Octopuses have been known to be able to get jars open while trapped inside them. Their outer skins are basically living TV screens, able to adopt a fantastic variety of vivid colors and extremely accurate camouflage. Spend some time on YouTube looking at this stuff - seriously.But it turns out that, quite apart from all these marvels, the octopus is also a curious and clever creature. Virtually alone among sea creatures, octopuses in captivity know that they are in captivity and will do their utmost to escape. That includes attempting to leave their tanks when no one is looking and squirting jets of water to knock out lights. Attempts to study the octopus in the lab have proven difficult since the animals delight in screwing with their researchers. They appear, among other things, to recognize individual human faces.In short, the octopus is a highly intelligent animal, on the level of intelligent vertebrates like chimps and dolphins and parrots. But the octopus is much more alien to us than those creatures are. From an evolutionary perspective, our last common ancestor with the octopus swam the seas somewhere around 600 million years ago. Whatever that creature was had a simple nervous system and a bilateral body plan. Since then, humans and octopuses have developed completely independently and in very different ways. This means that octopus intelligence has pretty much nothing to do with the intelligence of humans or chimps or dolphins or parrots. It developed completely independently. The octopus, therefore, is perhaps our best earth-bound analog of what it might mean to encounter intelligent alien life. What is it like to be an octopus? What can we conclude about the intelligence of a creature that is so different from us? How did this single invertebrate, out of all the other invertebrate life on this planet, get so smart?These are the deeper philosophical questions that Peter Godfrey-Smith tackles in Other Minds. A professor of philosophy and an ardent SCUBA enthusiast, Godfrey-Smith has spent a lot of time observing the octopus in its natural habitat. Specifically, he's spent thousands of hours observing and filming a colony of octopuses at an Australian site known as Octopolis. Octopuses are ordinarily extremely solitary creatures, and Octopolis appears to be quite an unusual environment for them, with dozens of the animals living in close proximity. His observations of how these octopuses behave when thrust into an unusually social setting are fascinating all on their own. But they've also driven him to think deeply about what kind of intelligence a creature without a fixed body plan might develop, and how that could be different from our own.This book really breaks down into three separate topics: ruminations on the nature of consciousness; explorations of evolution; and the behaviors and biology of the octopus (and its close relatives). Somehow it never feels like Godfrey-Smith is forcing unrelated ideas into one book in an effort to write a ""Big Idea"" book. Instead it feels very natural and logical to explore these three topics together. All are fascinating and all relate to each other.You'll finish the book a little bit in love with the octopus, if you weren't already. The tragedy of the octopus's life, however, is that it is very short. Most octopuses have natural lifespans as short as two years. At that time they mate, the females lay their eggs, and then they begin to decay. Their color-changing hides give way to splotchy white, they become far less energetic, and bits of them start to fall off. But the fact that these remarkable, intelligent creatures have such short life spans in many ways makes them all the more amazing. If you haven't met the clever, weird, fantastic creature that is the octopus, this book is a terrific place to start."

All the early stages took place in water: the origin of life, the birth of animals, the evolution of nervous systems and brains, and the appearance of the complex bodies that make brains worth having.Consciousness surely did not, James said, suddenly irrupt into the universe fully formed. The history of life is a history of intermediates, shadings-off, and gray areas. One of my favorite recipes; philosophy and science, with some vivid imagery of being in the ocean while scuba diving; and based on the Octopolis, a possibly unique “town” of octopuses in Australia that seem to live communally and set this philosopher’s imagination alight with the idea of evolution of the mind. Perception, action, memory—all those things creep into existence from precursors and partial cases. Suppose someone asks: Do bacteria really perceive their environment? Do bees really remember what has happened? These are not questions that have good yes-or-no answers. There’s a smooth transition from minimal kinds of sensitivity to the world to more elaborate kinds, and no reason to think in terms of sharp divides.The story I am working toward is one of gradual change: as sensing, acting, and remembering became more elaborate, the feel of experience became more complex along the way. Our own case shows us that subjective experience is not an all-or-nothing matter. We know half-conscious states of various kinds, such as waking from sleep. Evolution includes an awakening on a different time scale.Cephalopods are an island of mental complexity in the sea of invertebrate animals. Because our most recent common ancestor was so simple and lies so far back, cephalopods are an independent experiment in the evolution of large brains andcomplex behavior. If we can make contact with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of a shared history, not because of kinship, but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.The chemistry of life is an aquatic chemistry. We can get by on land only by carrying a huge amount of salt water around with us.Subjective experience does not arise from the mere running of the system, but from the modulation of its state, from registering things that matter. These need not be external events; they might arise internally. But they are tracked because they matter and require a response. Sentience has some point to it. It’s not just a bathing in living activity.When animals did crawl onto dry land, they took the sea with them. All the basic activities of life occur in water-filled cells bounded by membranes, tiny containers whose insides are remnants of the sea.I said in chapter 1 that meeting an octopus is, in many ways, the closest we’re likely to get to meeting an intelligent alien. Yet it’s not really an alien; the Earth and its oceans made us both."

Its not just about octopuses (and yes, that's the correct plural form of octopus); its a philosopher's exploration of what it means to have a conscious mind, and how a creature so different from us in almost every way, also arrived at this elusive state.Cephalopods, a subclass of mollusks including octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish, are the only big-brained ""intelligent"" invertebrates (as far as we know). You have to go about 600 million years back to find our common ancestor, which was most likely a small worm-like creature, so its safe to say that a cephalopod's path to intelligence - and more specifically, the formation of their complex nervous system - evolved in a completely different way than that of a human's (or any vertebrate's for that matter). This means that natural selection created intelligence not once, as in us and other vertebrates, but twice! And maybe more than twice as the author delves into in later chapters...This quote really caught my attention:""If we can make contact with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of any shared history, not because of kinship, but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien."" I enjoyed the author's discussion of the evolutionary theory of aging in relation to an octopus's ""live fast, die young"" lifestyle. I actually discovered this book a couple years ago after reading this NY Times article:https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/op...I would recommend this book to everyone with the caveat that it is more philosophy than biology. Its an exploration of the evolution of the mind, with fascinating octopus antidotes sprinkled throughout. I think I have more questions than when I started this book but I'm okay with that. FYI there are extensive footnotes at the end of this book, which also supply a good reading list of other books and articles if you want to delve deeper into any of the multiple topics discussed. The book ends with a poignant chapter on how, inevitably, octopuses will take over the world. Just kidding - its about how we need to do more to save our oceans, because the ocean is where all intelligent life began, and we are slowly (actually not that slowly) destroying it. "

The author goes back in time in the tree of evolution to look for intelligence in other species, and finds it in the octopus, with whom our evolutionary trees diverged 100s of million years ago. The reason nervous system arose in the first place from an was to enable sensing and acting, which provided an evolutionary advantage, which the author also claims was a critical factor in enabling multi-cellular organisms (requiring the coordination of different parts of the organism). According to the author: ""Sensing and acting is characteristic of all known organisms"". The octopuses has a massive amount of neurons (500 million, still much less than our 100 billion), but the neurons are much more decentralized compared to us, where for example each arm is fairly autonomous. Several examples of human-like behaviors in octopuses are given, showing curiosity, experimentation, memory and even playfulness.The later part of the book examines how self-awareness and language could have evolved in humans. Communication evolved between organisms, and these tools for communication became tools to communicate within. When we hear internally how words hang together, we can learn something about how the corresponding ideas hang together. A long train of thoughts require language in the same way complex calculations require algebra. Our inner speech is what gives us executive control, providing ""system 2"" thinking.Although there are many interesting parts of this book, and I certainly recommend it, the essence of the book could have been compressed to maybe half the size without losing the most important concepts."

So there were definitely many concepts and notions that I had forgotten, as well as many that I never trully had contact with. So this book felt like a breath of fresh air in a way. I feel like many doors for further reading were opened here, some more alluring to me than others. I was particularly interested in the discussions on memory and the evolution of thinking and language. Biology and phylosophy came together here to try and make sense of the conscious self within us, and within other animals. Of course, when diving into such waters we can't expect to have clear answers yet, but I did appretiate immensely the questions Godfrey-Smith presented us. I find it very hard and not entirelly fair to review or judge this kind of book on it's scientific merits. I am not a biologist, so I don't have the tools necessary to trully analyse it. So I will conclude by saying that, as someone practically completely ignorant on the majority of the themes of Other Minds, I found the writing to be clear and concise, always with usefull examples and anecdotes that helped me grasp the essense of the ideas being discussed. I enjoyed learning about evolution, different kinds of thinking in the animal world. It was a pleasure to slowly make my way through it."

Nature gave two branches of consciousness, and this is the other.Communicating with the Octopus is the closest we can get to communicating with an alien species.Smith is a scientist first, and a writer second.

One thing we know for sure is that this is the closest example of an alien mind that we have encountered so far.What is more exciting is the fact that we (humans, apes, all mammals and birds, even fishes and insects) branched off on a different evolutionary branch from the cephalopods from a simple worm-like creature more than 500 million years ago. The only common thing between these two branches were the early signs of a nervous system. Even eyes were not there yet, but perhaps some light sensing cells on the body. Yet, these two branches independently produced large and complex brains, with many similarities (but also significant differences). That is a strong evidence that evolution of complex brains, and probably minds, is inevitable in multicellular creatures, because it happened at least twice on our planet, and therefore is likely to happen on other planets with multicellular organisms."
90,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2159256-andy-oram,4,"Godfrey-Smith has an extraordinary background to bring to his subject: a professor of philosophy, he has also spent years visiting octopuses and cuttlefish (distantly related cephalopod cousins) in the ocean. In contrast, Sy Montgomery, who wrote another interesting recent book called The Soul of An Octopus, got to know those creatures mostly in aquarium tanks. Anyone interested in the variety of life and the astonishing accomplishments of creatures on land or in the ocean will enjoy Godfrey-Smith's analysis of the behaviors he has observed, combined with fossil evidence and biological data.I recommend the book even though I don't believe the author has succeeded in his most ambitious goal: to find clues to the evolution of subjective experience and consciousness. Chapter 6 of this book meanders about various psychological theories in pursuit of that goal, but produces no intermediate states that I could see linking the brilliant intelligences shown by other animals to the self-reflective consciousness humans possess. As the book describes, scientists can demonstrate amazing abilities in birds, mammals, and cephalopods to draw connections and navigate complex social and physical environments. But that brings us no closer to knowing what they feel."

All the anecdotal descriptions of the cephalopod world, their sneaky behaviors, their watchful eyes, their forming of underwater society octopolis, and many more, were fascinating. The image of the lab-kept octopus with an attitude, who rejected its unsatisfactory meal by demonstratively dropping it into the tank's filter drain, while also making sure that the keeper watched, will definitely stick :)It's also interesting to learn about the octopus's distributed neural system, and their color-changing and color-sensing skin. Such a crime that most of these fascinating creatures only get to live 2-3 years.

An examination into the hypothetical reasoning behind the evolution of the octopus and other cephalopods, this books mixes philosophy, evolutionary biology and cephalopodiatry (and with that, I've levelled up my vocabulary as that's the first time I've used that word in my life -maybe I made it up?) Anyway, this book is a fascinating read.It's certainly a book of personal interest for the author, with a large chunk of writing devoted to his own theories (informed by current research). The analysis is at its best when talking about octopuses (and yes, that's the correct plural term -octopi is just bad Latin), as the author's own experience and access to research is strongest here. Often a chapter will begin with a general premise, some research and then application to cephalopods. The book concentrates mainly on the octopus but has a very nice chapter on the cuttlefish.The weakest chapter by far is when the author breaks the applied link to his subjects. Often the theories are very high level and benefit from examples and application to the animals. In Chapter 6 (actually titled 'Our Minds and Others') the theory of 'self thought' is heavily discussed but isn't really drawn directly to the octopus. I found that chapter more of a slog.The diagrams are few, but helpful. I particularly liked the photographs, and wish there were a few more (particularly of the giant cuttlefish -those guys are great).A special mention to the author's hypothesis on how the evolution of octopuses may continue over the next few thousand years (assuming we haven't killed them all in some human generated mass extinction event for the planet). I really liked the parallels of the unique behaviours seen at one research sight and extrapolating that to how things might evolve.Personally, I share the authors keen interest in octopuses and a bit of sadness that individually they don't live very long. So the book was a real treat.This was an easy read for me, but I'd suggest people read it only if they have an interest in octopuses and/or evolutionary biology (but haven't studied it themselves -the stuff talked about in the text would be easily covered in a proper study of the topic). 4 out of 5.Bonus: Read this book in less than a week! I should get some kind of award or certificate... maybe a balloon to celebrate."

Using octopuses and cuttlefish, Peter Godfrey-Smith shows with great enthusiasm how when you dive into the ocean you are diving into life itself. Looking at how brains develop and evolve over time, behaviours and consciousness and linking it to our own life. This is a very thought provoking book and having gone to Otago University, I was hooked as soon as he mentioned that. But with so many anecdotes and interesting points of conjecture, much like an octopus it is very easy to swim through this story and I enjoyed it on multiple levels. "
96,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14990510-mary,3,"The book started off feeling like an 8th grade text book. It was not quite condescending, but close. When the author told stories or gave ""real life"" examples, the book flowed well. The author also seemed eager to share all of his thoughts and information, and this seemed to cause the book to not flow easily and it seemed disjointed at times. Overall, though, an interesting, ""first hand"" look into the lives of a select few ocean creatures."

It's not unreasonable; that includes us and crows.But an entirely different branch of life on this planet also shows surprising intelligence--the cephalopods, including octopuses, cuttlefish, and squid. Their line and ours (that is, the vertebrates) separated hundreds of million years ago. Even our eyes and theirs evolved separately. Most of them live less than five years. They don't appear to be very social.Yet they have large and complex central nervous systems. Organized very differently from ours, but large and complex nevertheless. They show many signs of being intelligent, curious, and inventive. But why should an octopus that lives only two years, apparently isn't social beyond breeding once, and broods her eggs but dies when they hatch and certainly doesn't raise them, evolve such a complex nervous system and apparent intelligence? What are those expensive resources for?Godfrey-Smith gives us a really interesting exploration of this question, including tales of his own and others' direct experiences with cuttlefish and octopuses in their home environments, not just in labs. (Though they do some pretty darned interesting things in labs, too.) His own experiences with a cuttlefish, at the end of its breeding season and thus nearing the end of its life, are fascinating.There is also a lot of exploration here of what consciousness is, how it evolved, and what it really does--for us, and perhaps for cephalopods.All in all, an absorbing book, grounded in science, and exploring some fascinating territory and ideas.Recommended.I bought this audiobook."

I also found lots of information that I wasn't aware of as a beginner. Since I was drawn to the evolutionary split and cephlapods as a separate ingelligence, having a philosophical bent was not a deal breaker for me. However sometimes I did find myself wishing for a coauthor that was an expert on cephlapod physiology or social behavior as it often felt like the broader musings only began to connect with the specific. I wanted more elaborate speculation on how the octopus experiences not just if."

As the book makes clear, cephalopods have the most different brains to our own which shows us the potential of complex nervous systems.So much about this book blew me away. Like the fact that octopus arms act semi-independantly from the self. Or when Godfrey-Smith talks about the evolution of short/long lifespans or one's inner voice.Really the octopus is a tool used to talk about consciousness, but I still learnt so much about them.

116,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3145939-ellie,3,"Peter Godfrey-Smith is an Australian philosopher and diving enthusiast, with particular interest in cephalopods, which goes someway to explaining this book. I did find it quite hard to absorb and switched to an audiobook part way through. I possibly missed something important but it seemed to drift from topic to topic and not really explain how the octopus can show us how human intelligence evolved.You have to go a long way back the evolutionary tree to find a common ancestor between humans and octopus; our intelligence evolved in parallel. The book starts out explaining how single cell organised evolved into more complex creatures, how eyes might have coming into being and most importantly, the development of the nervous system. There was plenty of interesting bits but it was hard to just sit down and read it for long periods of time. It is a little dry in the delivery.Godfrey-Smith recounts some of his experiences diving with cephalopods, including quite a moving scene where he sees cuttlefish at the ends of their lives; slowing decaying into the water. These creatures only live a couple of years and he ponders why they are as intelligent as they are in such a short lifetime. I loved the fact that Octopolis exists, a community of, usually anti-social, octopus living together off the coast of Australia.Some of the experiments documented will be distressing to animal lovers, and octopus have only fairly recently been granted honorary invertebrate status to help protect them from cruelty.It's not all about cephlapods though. There is a chapter about inner voice, how it's an important part of our intelligence. However it's not something scientists think octopus have, so I can only guess it was put in to show how we evolved differently.If you are particularly interested in marine biology, I would say it's worth reading but it wasn't a very engaging ""popular science"" type book."
117,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3506568-julia,4,"3.5 stars. Some interesting information, but somehow less informative than I thought it would be. Also, now that I've read non-fiction with such a strong narrative voice that it actually enhanced the experience, when a book doesn't do that, it seems less interesting."
118,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84358220-sunrise-brit,2,"50% = 2 StarsFinally! A book on the Octopus and consciousness. I was very eager to read this one however I ended up a bit disappointed. A lot of time was spent on the evolution of the octopus, which is neat and all but not what I thought I'd be reading about. It's foot changes into a tentacle, it's shell changes into a bubble that holds air, I don't know, I guess I just wanted to read something more magnetic and in depth. Now, to be fair there is some very interesting information within regarding Octopus, some of which I've seen on nature shows and some not. When the book finally did reach the speculations on octopus consciousness, the question is asked, is language a prerequisite to complex thought? But then the book goes off to other things and I was left feeling very disappointed. The title of the book is so interesting! However the actual ideas within are pretty superficial, somewhat unrelated, and not compelling enough for my tastes unfortunately. Appreciate the author's effort."
119,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,3,"A subject that has not ceased to fascinate me is Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. I read the book less due to the octopus and more for the evolution of intelligent life. I found the first few pages of the book very encouraging. The author notes how the cephalopods (which include the octopus) were an independent experiment by nature in the evolution of large brains, nervous systems and complex behaviour, and thus it is possible that this is the closest we will come to meeting an alien. Also, as we move further in the study of the mind's evolution, it begins to touch upon philosophy, and I enjoy reading a ""science book"" which understands this mix.Later in the book, the discussion around subjective experience, sentience and consciousness was exactly this, and I relished the few pages that were devoted to this. In the book's second half, a section I enjoyed was around the entropy of living beings - a tree vs a cephalopod vs a human. How do they have fundamentally different lifespans? The explanation around mutations and how nature's machinations result in different ways of living, reproducing, and dying were excellent perspectives that aided my understanding of evolution.What didn't work for me though was (what I thought) a lack of coherent structure. That resulted in multiple detours from the subjects at hand, some of which, especially if you're not fascinated by octopus and cuttlefish, would make you wonder when we'd get back on track. "
120,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18185192-athan-tolis,4,"So this is a book about evolutionary biology written by a scuba-diving philosopher.It was fun to read. And if, like me, you have no clue about the topics addressed here, you will find it very informative.On the other hand, it does not really have a beginning, a middle or an end. It’s a survey. If you enjoyed watching The Big Lebowski, it’s kind of like that. Lots and lots of vignettes, not much of a plot.In between dives to meet his octopus and cuttlefish friends (decidedly NOT the highlights of this book, btw) the professor takes you through the history of how brains have developed on planet earth, juxtaposing ours (“us” being mammals, birds and most fish) with those of cephalopods, to illustrate some interesting points. In no particular order:We and our thinking mollusk friends share an ancestor from the Ediacaran period 600 million years ago. The period that came after that, the Cambrian period, brought an evolutionary explosion during which our ancestors and those of mollusks evolved entirely separately. So we and parrots, for example, share a common ancestor who is half as old as our common ancestor with Paul the Octopus. The octopus, therefore, is as good a guess as we can make on how an “other” mind from ours might work.Turns out they work rather differently! An octopus has about as many brain cells in its tentacles as it does in its brain, for example. Its legs enjoy a fair bit of autonomy. Each sucker has 10,000 neurons and a tentacle that has been surgically removed can still reach and grasp. (p. 67) Octopus arms are probably “like our blinking or breathing: we can assert control over them through attention.” (p. 103) Not only that, but an octopus has photoreceptors on its skin. It can see with its skin! (p. 121)The author goes on to say that our limbs probably also enjoy some leeway to do things on their own, it’s just that we don’t realize it: “Suppose you were reaching for an object with your hand. If the location or the size of the target you are reaching for suddenly changes, your reaching movement changes extremely quickly -in less than 1/10th of a second. This is so fast that it is unconscious.” (p. 104) This is a case of “actions produced ‘in silence’ as far as an organism’s experience is concerned, without giving rise to a subjective experience.” (p. 90) An explanation could be that our sensory organs and our brain are connected through two streams: realtime navigation and navigation through space perhaps goes through a “dorsal stream” in our brain, while categorization, recognition and description goes through a “ventral stream.” (p. 88)This all fits (kind of) within the theory (p.39) that nervous systems originated twice in evolution: once in order to control body rhythms and regulate hormones (for example as a reaction to light) and a second time to control movement (originally of the mouth and then of the rest of the body) and that subsequently the two nervous systems (call them “light” and “mouth”) moved closer to one another and were fused into one, but not fully and not the same in all animals.Three quarters through the book, the author finds out that his cephalopod friends, the animals on our planet with the biggest brain relative to the size of their body, only live to be two years old. When he’s over the shock, he dives into how this might be compatible with the theory of evolution. (I’m so funny)To get there, first he explains what the theory of evolution has to say about ageing. Bottom line is that ageing is, prima facie, a mystery: you can keep a fifty-year-old car going forever if you are happy to buy new parts for it, so an animal’s body, which makes new parts every day, should do even better than that. Evolution offers two explanations as to why we fail to renew ourselves:The basic insight here is that mutations happen all the time.Ageing explanation number one (due to Peter Medawar) is that if there’s a mutation that acts late in life to degrade our bodies, and assuming we can spawn throughout our lives at the same rate, “selection pressure against late-acting harmful mutations is very slight” (p. 165) with the result that “the gene pool will come to contain a lot of mutations that will have harmful effects on long-lived individuals.” Ageing explanation number two (due to George Williams) goes as follows: a lot of mutations have more than one effect. Mutations with good effects now and good effects later will obviously be favored by natural selection. Mutations with bad effects now and good effects later, as well as mutations with bad effects now and bad effects later will disappear quickly from the gene pool. Crucially, assuming an environment in which external effects will strongly check the size of a population, mutations with good effects now and bad effects later will be favored by natural selection.And that’s what the author believes happened to cephalopods. While some 500 million years ago the ancestors of cephalopods were protected by external armor, when that armor disappeared a situation arose whereby these now unprotected animals were better off giving all they’ve got to one big reproductive effort to produce as many eggs as possible.As an aside, their brainpower was also well-invested in camouflage. Hence the amazing ability of cuttlefish to project perfect copies of its background onto the natural video screen that is its skin.Speech and inner speech concern the author a fair bit:Baboons make very few noises, but they interpret other baboons’ “speech” in an extremely elaborate way. (p. 128) This is in sharp contrast with cuttlefish that can play a very elaborate movie on their skin but do not form anywhere nearly as elaborate communities as baboons do.Russian philosopher Kygotsky is quoted as having said that “inner speech is the tool that makes organized thought possible,” but the author believes that to be too extreme a position, given that chimps can plan and the cephalopods he has encountered in his swims react to him in an individual manner, leading him to the believe that “language is not THE medium of complex thought.” (p. 143)On the other hand, he believes inner speech to be the language of what Danny Kahneman called “System 2,” i.e. the more sober, analytical part of our brain. And not only inner speech: “Listening to your speech allows you to judge if it came out right.” Also “the sounds we cook up in our heads, including the sounds of words, we broadcast in our minds,” he opines and I, for one, agree that when I’m reading a book I’m probably broadcasting in my head. It all “goes into our working memory” (p. 148) And inner speech is probably the language of “higher order thought” such as “I hardly noticed that car” (p. 151)A parallel is drawn between the development of the nervous system some 600 million years ago and the development of speech much more recently:“Near the beginning of animal evolution, cells that had evolved means of sensing and signaling for the use of interaction with each other and with the rest of the environment gave these devices new roles: cell signaling was used to build multicellular organisms ad within some of them a new control device arose, the nervous system. (p. 152)The nervous systems arose through the internalization of sensing and signaling and the internalization of language as a tool for thinking was another.In both cases, a means of communication between organisms became a means of communication within them.Ultimately, it proves impossible to the author to connect all his ideas to cephalopods, so he just lays them out for the reader randomly about the book.Here’s an anthology:•	The chemistry of life is an aquatic chemistry. We can get by on land only by carrying a huge amount of salt water around with us (p. 19)•	Animals arose from cells whose daughters did not separate properly during cell division (p. 20)•	The intelligence toolkit is composed of: perception, memory, learning from experience, problem solving, planning (p. 30)•	An octopus has three hearts and blue-green blood (because it uses copper rather than iron to carry oxygen) (p. 74)•	When you take an action, you also send a copy of the command to yourself. That’s how you deal with changing perspective as you move (p. 83)•	In the animal kingdom there are cases where information gathered from one eye is not necessarily mixed with information gathered from the other eye. Even within the same eye connection of different parts of the eye may be poor. This may explain why hens move their head in a funny way: to allow both parts of their eye to catch a glimpse of whatever they’re looking at (p. 84)And then, as if this were some kind of BBC documentary, the last few pages of the book become a rallying cry to preserve the ocean.So this was a very weird book.But I enjoyed it!"

These are the things that bugged me. Still, if I see you this month, I'll probably have a lot to tell you about the evolution of animals with lots of neurons, the question of what your experience of sight would be if you had photoreceptors all over your body, and why we live to be 100 and octopuses live to be 2.

123,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,4,"Wonderful book. My confirmation bias might have something to do with my liking it so much, but I'll just have to live with that!I understand Godfrey-Smith to be a philosopher, which I don't hold against him...that breed can be rather full of themselves and tend to pepper simplicities with obscure jargon to hide the lack of substance...because he is generous with his restraint. Is this rigorous? Not at all and that is what makes this good for the common reader. Godfrey-Smith writes an eminently readable narrative of a decidedly odd consciousness whose evolution split from ours so very long ago. Details of what we know to date on the neurology and intelligence of the most fascinating branch of Cephalopods are woven around his personal experiences diving off of Australia. I was not expecting explanations (as there are few for this still misunderstood creature) but I also didn't mind the speculations that accompanied the facts (as we know them).An observation...the title really might have been singular as he focuses on octopuses. But then again, he might have been talking about all octopuses as ""other minds"", as opposed to other species. Regardless, there's a love affair here, and I'm right there with him."
124,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51791270-tomas-longo,5,"Fantastic work! The author does not simply present a list of facts about octopuses, but also transfer this facts into questions for different topics.The most striking transfer, IMO, is the discussion about selfwareness and how to distinguish changes in the environment caused by you vs the changes caused by outside events. A worm shacks up if you touch it, which makes it impossible to move forward. And yet, digging its way through the soil does not have the same effect on it (all the material is touching it as well). So the worm must be aware of its actions, and the impact those actions have on its environment as well as what those impacts mean for itself. (digging --> worm touches the soil --> the soil touches the worm --> no shack up).The author also completely changed my perception of octopuses. When I think about them now, I have this picture in mind, where an intelligent little thing floats in front of me, thinking about what this strange, big floating thing in front of it might be and if it could be eaten or, at least, if it could have some fun with it.Long story short: Must Read for everyone interested in evolution, biology and philosophy."

I bought this on a Saturday afternoon and finished it the next day, could barely put it down. Part biology, part philosophy, part theory of mind, this book brings together just TONS of information from all these different areas at the same time, like a, like an OCTOPUS. About every four or five pages you'll discover something cool about octopuses that will make you bother whoever is sitting nearby when you make sure that they now know, too. But there's a lot more than octopuses, there is the evolution of life from basically organic bathmats of bacteria laying around on the ocean floor to us humans and all the weird areas in between, how consciousness wasn't a light that just got turned on, but a long, slow process, how evolution doesn't have a goal or an end, not us or any other animal, how dying of old age is an evolved trait, etc., etc. For people who think a scientific outlook is somehow clinical and boring compared to creation myths, check this book out, real life is way more colorful and interesting than any myth I've ever heard."

Using the octopus as his starting point, he explores the history of evolution, the philosophical implications of conscious self-awareness, the questions of sensation and perception / how these are set up differently in nearly every animal, etc. It’s a fun book to knock out in a few hours if you’re looking to get a Planet Earth fix but there are no new episodes in sight. It’s not earthshattering or anything, but it’s a nice reminder how strange and beautiful it is to live in a world where bizarre creatures like octopi and human beings can coexist and yet perceive it so differently."

133,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16857218-christian-d-orr,5,"A most impressive study on some amazingly intelligent invertebrates This book was recommended by Goodreads as a nominee as one of the top science books of the year, and I can see why. I've had a fascination with cephalopods (octopus, squid, nautilus, and especiallycuttlefish) since I was a wee bitty lad, and reading ""Other Minds"" has rekindled that interest big-time. The author gives an in-depth study of the intelligence and capabilities of present-day cephalopods, but more than that, he delves into the history of the evolution of nervous systems and intelligence of not only cephalopods but animals in general.While the subtitle of the book specifically names the octopus, for me the most enjoyable portions of the book were the ones describing the author's personal encounters with the Giant Cuttlefish.Last but not least, this book has inspired me to start singing the Beatles' ""Octopus's Garden"" on karaoke again! ;-) And while I'll continue to enjoy eating ""tako"" (octopus) and ""ika"" (squid and cuttlefish) at the sushi bar, I'll feel a tad more guilty about it from here on out. Highly recommended! RANDOM STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS:--p. 4: ""What I found looked like an octopus attached to a turtle....about three feet long....a giant cuttlefish[!]."" Cool!--p. 5: ""the sense of mutual *engagement* that one can have with them."" [original emphasis] ""It's usually one touch, then no more [with giant cuttlefish]. Octopuses show a stronger tactile interest."" Maybe that's why Jacques Cousteau was more endeared to the former than the latter.--p. 7: ""One of the most important developments in animal psychology over the past few decades has been the realization of how smart crows and parrots are."" Wow, quite a contrast to the claims of the 1947 edition of the World Book Encyclopaedia's entry on animal intelligence (""their intelligence is far less than [mammals]"")!--p. 9: ""Cephalopods are an island of mental complexity in the sea of invertebrate animals.""--p. 24: ""always never,"" bit of an oxymoron there, isn't it? Wouldn't ""never, ever"" be more grammatically correct?--p. 25: Clever Paul Revere analogy.--p. 46: Nautiluses/nautili are ""now scavengers?"" I thought they captured live prey as well??--p. 50: ""The most startling finding in recent work on animal intelligence is how smart some birds are, especially parrots and crows."" Wow! Contrast this with a late 1940s World Book a Encyclopaedia entry which espoused the common scientific assumption back then that such birds were lacking in intelligence. (Of course, back then the scientific experts also insisted that dinosaurs were ""certainly stupid."")p. 64: ""They are smart in the sense of being curious and flexible; they are adventurous, opportunistic.""--p. 73: ""The most dramatic similarity is the eyes. Our common ancestor may have had a pair of eyespots, but it did not have eyes anything like ours. Vertebrates and cephalopods separately evolved 'camera' eyes, with a lens that focuses an image on a retina.""--p. 78: ""I wonder whether squid feel pain, and whether lobsters and bees do. I take this question to mean: Does damage feel like anything to a squid? Does it feel bad to them? This question would often now be expressed by asking whether squid are conscious. That always sounds misleading to me, as if it’s asking too much of the squid. To use an older term, if it feels like something to be a squid or octopus, then these are sentient beings. Sentience comes before consciousness. Where does sentience come from?"" A most fascinating and intriguing question.--p. 107: Oh, cool, back to the Giant Cuttlefish; ""A giant cuttlefish looks like an octopus attached to a hovercraft. It has a back shaped a bit like a turtle shell, a prominent head"" Ah so, that turtle comparison again!--p. 108: ""This animal is three feet long with a skin that can appear just about any color at all and can change in seconds, sometimes much faster than a second. Thin silver lines wander over its head, as if the animal is visibly electrified. The electric lines make the cuttlefish look like a hovering spacecraft. But the disruption to one’s impressions, to all attempts to make sense of the animal, is continual. As you watch, bright red trails lead from its eyes. A spaceship crying tears of blood?........The giant cuttlefish is also remarkable in another way: **how disarming it is to find friendliness in a large wild animal**. I do not mean a mere toleration of a human’s presence, but an active engagement, the animal’s making contact with a foreign being. This is not routine in giant cuttlefish, but not rare either. Quite often you encounter a friendly curiosity."" [emphasis added] Wow, reminds me why I had such a fascination with cuttlefish as a pre-adolescent kid."
134,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3," Other Minds is a philosophical and scientific examination of the evolutionary roots of our perceptions and consciousness … and octopuses by Peter Godfrey-Smith, a philosophy professor at the University of Sydney. Why octopuses? Well … octopuses and humans last had a common ancestor about 750 million years ago. Since our lineages split we’ve each gone on to independently evolve complex nervous systems resulting in high cognitive abilities (octopuses are far and away the most intelligent of the molluscs, while humans, with certain exceptions, are the most intelligent of the vertebrates). Being so very different from ourselves, octopuses are the closest thing we have to alien intelligent life. As such, we may be able to learn quite a bit about our own consciousness by studying these beautiful animals … or failing that, perhaps there’s a common reason we each enjoy eating crabs. Here are two octopus facts I learned from the book that I found interesting:1.	Octopuses have three layers of skin cells that that enable them to change color and texture in order to blend in with their environment and conceal themselves from predators. That’s impressive in itself, but they do this despite the fact that their eyes lack cones. If you recall from your middle school biology class … cones are the photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammals that allow them to perceive color. Because octopuses lack these cells it means they can only see in black and white. So how in the world are they able to change their skin color to match their environment? We don’t know … it’s a mystery. Some scientists think that octopuses may be able to take advantage of chromatic aberration (the fact that different wavelengths of light refract at slightly different angles) to perceive color by changing the focal position of their eyes to detect the different wavelengths. But, at present, this remains only a theory.2.	The majority of neurons in an octopus (about two thirds) are found in the arms, which can independently taste and touch and also control basic motions without input from the brain. The arms, literally, have a mind of their own, although the central brain can exert executive control when needed. It would be like having a disembodied hand that went around doing its own thing unless you focused on it to put it to work on a specific task. What about consciousness? This topic necessarily becomes more speculative because our understanding is still in its infancy. I think what can be said with some certainty is that consciousness is a byproduct of our complex nervous systems. Thus there is likely a range of consciousness throughout the animal kingdom dependent on the neural complexity of each animal. In fact, each human ‘awakes’ into consciousness as our brains become wired during the first few years of life (which is why no one has any memories of infancy). Other claims about consciousness need to be made more tentatively. For example, there are competing theories as to whether consciousness requires language, or whether language requires consciousness. Smith is solidly in the camp of those who believe the former, but the reality is that the scientific consensus is still out on this question. As to the book … it’s decent. The text is a mixture of Godfrey-Smith’s accounts of octopus observations during scuba expeditions, evolutionary theories of consciousness and octopus facts. The latter were of most interest to me. The writing is clear, if a bit dry and I appreciated the fact that Smith included pronunciations of several complicated terms (something few authors take the time to do). "
135,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18362346-valentina-salvatierra,3,"An insightful and reflective read written by a philosopher – not a biologist or a scientist of any sort. This is a philosopher with an interest in nature and respect for the scientific method, but do not expect to acquire deep knowledge about the biological underpinnings of a cephalopod’s near-alien mind. Rather, it provides some crucial information, a lot of which you have to take on faith – trusting that Godfrey-Smith’s interpretation of things like ‘DNA evidence’ (loc 374) is accurate, without asking too many questions about what exactly such evidence consists of or why it suggests certain things about the evolution of non-human intelligence. If you go along for this ride, you will get some fascinating anecdotes about human-octopus and human-cuttlefish interactions, results of empirical studies, and reflections about the philosophical implications of these. This is far more a personal account than a systematic treatment of any of the above. In terms of biological terminology, he uses terms like ‘mental surplus’ (898) which to me seem quite value-laden and unlikely to be used by evolutionary biologists proper. He also strikes me as lax in his use of some philosophical terms – first making a big point of distinguishing between ‘subjective experience’ and ‘consciousness’ (loc 965), but then goes on to discuss studies that considered consciousness in order to make his point that octopus likely have some sort of subjective experience, on a spectrum of ‘gradual’ change rather than sudden emergence of some qualitatively different mental state (loc 1081). To be fair, he does try to clarify later: ‘I treat subjective experience as a broad category and consciousness as a narrower category within it’ (1150) but I’m not sure he maintained that distinction throughout. In any case, his terminology seemed a bit sloppy and arbitrary at points. This was compounded by the occasional self-referential comments (“As I was writing this chapter, X happened”) which made the whole book seem sloppier and more anecdotal than it actually is. While the source material and the prose is great, some chapters I never got the point of and it seemed like with a bit more work the book could have congealed into something more structured, and therefore more powerful.I think a second potential risk of Godfrey-Smith’s style is the anthropomorphizing quality of his interpretations of animal behavior. At times even evolution sounds like a conscious, directed process and he often interprets the cephalopods behavior in intentional terms, e.g. as ‘the jaws of hell’ (1447). But then, I do think that is one of the best ways to make science compelling, rather than a dry descriptive text which I would not have enjoyed.Despite the weaknesses, Other Minds more than makes up for it in its strengths: the significant interweaving of anecdote and scientific knowledge, and the poetic slant of the way these same facts are presented that make them interesting to a lay-person and turn it into literature. The best theoretical discussions as well as biological arguments are definitely in chapter 7, “Experience Compressed” – the way he discusses the evolutionary justification for individual ageing and death, and how the octopus in particular might have developed his unusual combination of high intelligence and short life-span was particularly eye-opening, systematically worked out, and persuasive in its conclusion (2163)."
136,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586008-v-larkin-anderson,5,"This book turned me into an cephalopod nerd in the course of a single week. These creatures are so amazingly fascinating, and this book really does them justice. And, of course, as the title suggests, this book isn't just about cephalopods; it's about how they evolved, the intelligence that they've evolved, and how the differences between them and us can teach us about consciousness, both in ourselves, and in species very different from us. This is some deep, complicated stuff, and though this book challenged me in some of the more esoteric parts, I was engaged throughout, and learned a whole bunch, and had opinions on all of it by the end. Also there's a section about the evolutionary reason for why we age that was absolutely fascinating.I never thought that I would feel so emotionally connected to cephalopods, but here we are. They're smart, they can recognize individual human beings, and apparently have strong opinions on us; there have been octopuses that would shoot water at anyone new who visited their lab, and other octopuses that would shoot water only at one specific person that they'd developed a strong dislike for. What's worse, by the time I finished the book, I had come to the realization that they're truly tragic figures. They can change color on a whim, and often display complex patterns on their skin that seem to mirror what's going on in their head, but they are colorblind. They can express what's going on in their heads on their skin, but can't see all of their skin, so the pictures on their skin haven't become an inward loop in their head like our voices have become in ours. Worst of all, they're the smartest animal on their entire branch of evolution, but they only live for two years before they start to spontaneously fall apart. They have so much going on in their strange, alien, brains, but they only live to mate once, and then fade away. It's incredibly moving, and only makes me love their strangeness, intelligence, and independence even more.If you can't tell, I loved this book. I would definitely recommend it to anyone--unless, like one of my podcast co-hosts, octopuses freak you out. Then maybe skip this one? But I dare anyone to not be charmed by Charles, the octopus who absolutely refused to take part in a lever-pulling experiment, and instead broke the lever, pulled overhead lights down into his cage, and shot water at everyone.This review first appeared on my blog."
137,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7459837-ben-thurley,3,"An enjoyable, if occasionally distracted, excursion into the lives of octopuses and the evolution of consciousness.Godfrey-Smith tracks from the very deep past – the Ediacaran (Pre-Cambrian) period – when living organisms began to sense things and the feedback loop of nervous systems got started – to the oceans of today in which he swims with the cephalopods – octopus, squid, cuttlefish and nautilus. Through the work he explores and attempts to tease out the implications of consciousness evolving at least twice on Earth – once along the vertebrate line and once, independently, among the cephalopods. Godfrey-Smith regards octopuses as ""an island of mental complexity in the sea of invertebrate animals"", noting – though – that the layout and functioning of their brains are very different to ours. The clusters of neurons across their bodies makes it likely that each arm is able to 'think' and 'act' somewhat independently and Godfrey-Smith cites experimental evidence to indicate that this is the case.There were a few moments where the elements of the work didn't seem to quite hang together or felt a bit underdeveloped. The description of the wondrous Octopolis a secret, octopus' garden off the West Australian coastline, for example, is disappointingly brief and comes very late in the piece.Anecdotes and somewhat surprising facts about octopuses emerge at points throughout the work. Their propensity to express their dislike for particular individuals by spraying them with water. Why they live for such a short time – one or two years at most. Why they, along with squids and cuttlefish, are such masters of colour-shifting for camouflage and signalling when they are, quite likely, colour-blind. How consciousness, language and sociability relate.I enjoyed Godfrey-Smith's (well-informed but admittedly often speculative) musings on the shape and purpose of sentience consciousness. But I did find myself wanting to spend just a little bit more time with octopuses.Because, seriously, how can you not love the octopus? Godfrey-Smith quotes third century author Claudius Aelianus' take on the octopus: “Mischief and craft are plainly seen to be characteristics of this creature."" Mischief and craft. That's pretty much what I'd like my epitaph to be."
138,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37884382-corvus,4,"This was an excellent journey into the lives and abilities of cephalopods and other animals. Based on what I've read, it also brings a lot of new material and research to the table. I really appreciated the author's ability to look deeply into other animals' unique abilities and ""intelligences"" rather than only using humanity's cognition as a reference. Many other animals outclass us in so many ways. We really miss out on learning new things when we are egocentric in our observations. What human do you know that can hide food in hundreds of separate locations and not only remember all of them, but recall which food was hidden where- Without a smart phone? What humans do you know that use their entire nervous system to ""see"" their environment, rather than their eyes and brain alone?I docked a star because- while the author was initially critical or cruel and painful experimentation on the cephalopods, he later spent a good chunk of time highlighting and promoting pain research on animals in which humans- so anthropocentric they doubt other animals feel pain- deliberately and repeatedly cause pain in usually large quantities of animals. I understand that he made his book a mixture of philosophy and science- which I appreciate- but the field research they did could have shown similar results. Yes, observational research lacks what experiments can achieve, but if we throw all ethics out the window in search of discovery, what's the point? Also, when animal researchers discover pain and suffering in other animals, they don't suddenly quit their jobs with the realization that what they're doing is horrific. They just keep going- often upping the ante on the suffering. We have a long history of horrors against both humans and other animals that taught us plenty, but that doesn't make it excusable or right. Overall though, aside from that section, I felt the author did an excellent job seeking out and performing research to support his points. It was truly fascinating to learn to better understand and appreciate these creatures."
139,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2258444-valerie,4,"This is a fascinating book dealing with animal intelligence. The author is a professor of history and philosophy, as well as an accomplished scuba diver whose videos have been featured in ""National Geographic."" In this book, the author tells us his idea of how nature became aware of itself; starting, of course, in the oceans. He goes back to the Cambrian period, about 542 million years ago, and then tells the reader of a very important discovery made in 1946 made by an Australian geologist in the Ediacaran Hills in the South Outback area of Australia. Fossils he discovered (and being a geologist he did not know the importance of this finding) are actually evidence of life before the Cambrian period. This is the point where animals possibly, or probably, began to develop nervous systems. The author explains the possible reasons for this and really explains animal behavior well. The biggest attraction in this book, however, is the fact that only the cephalopods in the mollusk family, developed what can definitely be named intelligence, as anyone who has ever interacted with an octopus knows. The cephalopods include cuttlefish, squids, octopuses and the chambered nautilus. It is extremely fascinating to me that this particular part of the mollusk family developed intricate nervous systems, and obvious intelligence, whereas the other species such as abalones, clams, etc. did not. The tentacles which most cephalopods have are just packed full of neurons, so that each ""sucker"" on the tentacle is an individual sensory organ. I loved this book not just because of the ideas presented by the author, and the photos included, but for the possible questions we could be asking about animal development. Some of the ideas presented (at least in my mind) bordered on the spiritual, or metaphysical. This is a well written and thoughtful book about just how animal intelligence, up to and including human, probably developed."
140,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66040371-steve-majerus-collins,4,"When you think of especially clever animals, the octopus doesn't normally come to mind. Yet Peter Godfrey-Smith's Other Minds shows not only why we should, but why it matters. In a reasonable fast-paced and not-too-science-oriented volume, he tells the story of how intelligent life evolved on this planet (spoiler alert: he does consider humans intelligent). What makes the octopus and a few related creatures so special is that they branched off the evolutionary tree far more quickly than all of the other animals that seem reasonably bright -- mammals, birds, people and the like. They are in many ways quite alien from home sapiens. Though we share a common ancestor, some sort of squiggly cell, we diverged so long ago that the octopus really is different. Yet it also has curiosity, a sense of play and perhaps more that we don't quite get. It's a useful thing to consider as we mull what happens if someday we ever run across intelligent life that evolved somewhere distant in the universe, where what we have in common could be shockingly little. In any case, Godfrey-Smith manages to touch on many interesting philosophical and scientific points that I never thought much about, including an explanation of why living things die that is apparently well-grounded in biology but which was new to me (though I'll confess that Mrs. Seftas probably taught me in Bio 1 or Bio 2 years ago when I was clearly distracted with more important things like how to bring tadpoles in for extra credit). Anyway, this is not a long book. And it is an interesting one. My knowledge of our world expanded because I spent a few hours with Godfrey-Smith watching and thinking about some of our most distant kin."
141,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1972427-leanne,5,"Peter Godfrey-Smith, in his book Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness, points out just how far back in time human beings and octopuses diverged from each other on the evolutionary tree of life. As fellow primates, human beings shared a common ancestor with chimpanzees as recently as six million years ago. Chimpanzees are our living cousins. But compared to octopuses, so are cats. While not as close to us as our mammalian brethren, we know that parrots, magpies, and crows (also vertebrates) are highly intelligent. But to find our common ancestor with birds, you would have to go back more than fifty times further than to that of chimpanzees– all the way back to a lizard-like creature who lived around 320 million years ago.Guess how far back you have to go to find a common ancestor with an octopus?You have to go very far back indeed, to a worm-like creature that scuttled on the ocean’s floor around 600 million years ago. And to keep this in perspective, recall that dinosaurs only arrived on the scene around 230 million years ago. This is all to say that we are very distantly related to octopuses. And this fact alone could go far in explaining what we find so unsettling about the octopus gaze.Sy Montgomery, in her Soul of an Octopus: A Surprising Exploration Into the Wonder of Consciousness, says it like this about octopus intelligence:We split from our common ancestor with the octopus half a billion years ago. And yet, you can make friends with an octopus. More herehttps://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksd..."

I wanted to learn about octopuses (and cephalopods in general). I read a sci-fi with super smart octopuses and I was curious to learn about how their brain and cognition works. What I thought the book would be: talking about octopuses, how they behave, their biology, anecdotes about swimming with octopuses and what it’s like, studies about them and what we’ve learned. Some parts of the book were about this and those parts I liked a lot! So few ppl get to swim with octopuses and cuddle fish that I wish the author spent more time talking about his experience doing that! But instead the author spends a lot of time talking about much earlier distant evolution and researchers’ theories about thought processes in general. It felt more like a historiography of psychology. At these parts, as I listened to the audiobook, I found my attention straying. It also wasn’t helped by the fact that I recently read bill Bryson’s a short history of nearly everything and that book covered similar subject matter in a much more interesting way. All in all the book was ok, and did present some interesting and surprising information, both about cephalopods and just thought in general, but it wasn’t what I wanted. I gave it a 3 star bc I don’t want to give the book a lower rating bc it didn’t match my expectations, but my actually reading experience was more like 2.75 ish (or lower)"

Firstly, although the cover makes it look deceptively like a popular science book, it’s actually a philosophy book (I don’t think philosophy should disguise itself as anything else but I imagine science sells better). Secondly, it focuses specifically on octopuses. I LOVE octopuses.The central theme of the book is that octopuses (and related other cephalopods) are as evolutionarily distinct from humans as we can possibly get, so theorising about their brains, perception and intelligence is rather like learning about an alien life form. Godfrey-Smith not only has an intellectual interest in the minds of these magical creatures, but a personal interest, as he is an avid diver and has had many octopus encounters in the wild. Despite making me insanely jealous, it is the telling of these stories, interwoven with thought-provoking questions and neuroscientific findings, that really bring the concepts in Other Minds to life.One of my favourite books of 2018 was The Soul Of An Octopus. Like The Soul Of An Octopus, Other Minds deals with similar issues and illustrates them with vivid accounts of deep sea diving, but covers a wider breadth of ideas. Ultimately, although focusing on octopuses, it allows us to consider how self-awareness began millions of years ago in the ocean in the smallest of animals, and how that relates to our own human consciousness of today.I’d highly recommend this to anyone with questions about evolution, animals, human mental states or even an interest in good old scuba diving."
144,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32976590-adrian-curtin,4,"Many people know that octopuses have an uncanny intelligence amongst the animals that live in the oceans, but few people understand the significance of this prime example of invertebrate intelligence. I picked up this book looking for some insight into the cephalopod mind and Godfrey-Smith's work is just that. Other Mind's combines a philosophical discussion of the evolutionary development of the mollusk mind, philosopher's speculations on the meaning of self, experience, and sensation, scientific studies attempting to describe the intellectual capabilities and tales from his own observational research of the coast of Australia. Written by a philosopher, the book certainly attempts to grasp with many concepts of immeasurable scale, e.g. consciousness, aging, experience, and may fall short in it's organization and transition between these topics which have a tendency to get away from the main topic at hand. However, each discussion adds some interesting perspectives which intertwine with the deep sea experience of our maritime friends as well as reflect on our on position in life. Although the writing tends towards rambling and reiteration at times, there is something to be learned from every chapter. The book approaches a bit less the idea of consciousness and more strongly focuses on evolutionary origins, which makes the title a little misleading, but for lovers of science and philosophy, this book is worth a look."
145,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5106656-matthew-royal,3,"Good insights into what the definition of intelligence can be, and identifying our own chordate biases when approaching the development of artificial intelligence. At points, he waxes philosophical, but never very deeply. I'd be more interested in examining how our monolithic human brain biases us when we think about our thoughts, our bodies, or intelligence. Explore the idea that our integrated subjective experience called ""consciousness"" is largely independent of our body's mechanisms for deciding to lift our arms or move toward food, as measured by neuroscientists who (perhaps wrongly) interpret it as neurological proof of our lack of ""free will.""Even speculation into octopus qualia -- what does it feel like to be an octopus with semi-autonomous limbs -- or perhaps some thought experiments drawing analogies between human patients with inactivated brain regions vs an octopus with missing limbs.Interesting, if a bit unfocused. The news that cephalopods use extensive RNA editing to modify their brain structure came out about 4-5 months after this book was published, but I can't help but feeling that the author tilted more toward the side of diving into the water and playing with them to collect fun stories rather than toward the side of studying them in a lab and understanding the underlying physical mechanics. Even Disney in the movie ""Finding Dory"" spent considerable time writing software to simulate the physics and autonomy of Hank the octopus's limbs."
146,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1915261-scott-lupo,4,"Fascinating and thought provoking book delving into the subject of consciousness through the lives of octopus and cuttlefish. I think the main thrust of this book is that evolution developed intelligence more than once. We know mammals and birds have intelligence but rarely do we think of cephalopods. Godfrey-Smith starts at the beginning, over 600 million years ago, and traces the evolution of multi-cellular organisms and when nature might have begun to recognize itself and build a complex nervous system to give rise to consciousness. The author is a scuba diving aficionado and has a plethora of anecdotes and experiments on cuttlefish and octopus. Cephalopods are amazing creatures. Most of their ""brain"" is actually in their tentacles, they are amazing escape artists, can discern different people's faces, have eyes similar to humans (but only see in black and white), and have photoreceptors in their skin to give them the ability to create kaleidoscopes of colors to potential mates and enemies. And then the tragedy: they only live 2-3 years, most only one breeding cycle. Why would evolution create such a complicated life form that lasts so short? With a superb mix of science and philosophy, this book leads the reader into the complex and mysterious world of consciousness."
147,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47932244-chrissy,5,"This book is full of interesting facts and anecdotes about octopuses and other cephalopods. I went into it with almost no knowledge of these amazing creatures, and was fascinated throughout most of the chapters. The language is very easy to understand, which is also a huge plus - Godfrey-Smith explains the basics of neuroscience ideas when needed and gives plenty of helpful examples to illustrate a very colorful picture of the unfortunately brief life of octopuses.I'm not very interested in philosophy, and my intention was more to focus on the science than to provoke any deep thought on consciousness. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I still enjoyed the more philosophical parts, and each page is still filled with new knowledge and facts. I definitely did not agree with everything that was written, but I do appreciate that the author presents some perspectives that I've never considered before (please keep in mind I have never studied philosophy!). I also need to mention that I did not find anything in this book redundant, which I've struggled with in a few nonfiction books I've recently attempted to read. Godfrey-Smith presents his topic, elaborates and explains it fully, and then moves on without (I feel) filling pages with fluff to reach his quota.I very much enjoyed this book and would definitely read more of his work!"
148,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74350-k-wing,3,"Although this is a slim book, it’s dense in its questions and examinations. I especially enjoyed the anecdotal bits about cephalopods, as some of the concepts were admittedly a little beyond me. I was especially surprised to learn that most kinds of octopus live only a year or two. I wondered a bit though when the author said it “made sense” for these creatures to then focus so much of their efforts and biology on mating, and other things to proliferate the species. The phrase “makes sense” is what was curious to me. It makes sense to US, in that we can see the extent of their lifespans as observers, but I’m skeptical octopi reason this out. I have this same rub when it comes to nature documentaries. “This animal does this specific behavior for this specific reason” has always bristled me. Reason? This is something worked out by conscious minds. Self-aware minds and minds aware of their surroundings. (Is the octopi making a specific decision to spend it’s short life trying to offer its sperm to accepting female octopi in order to carry on the species?) What’s more, WE can see the animal doing a specific behavior for a certain reason, but that completely discounts that there may be other reasons not immediately observable that an animal engages in a certain behavior. All in all a very interesting book that I’ll be chewing on for a while. "
149,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22714918-ryan,3,"Engagement: (3/5) This book was beautifully written, but for whatever reason I found myself less than riveted while reading it. My mind often wandered during the long, albeit lovely, descriptions of the author’s encounters with cephalopods. Not sure whether that says more about my (lack of) interest in marine biology or the book itself.Intellectual rigor & honesty: (4/5) The book certainly seemed well researched. The author acknowledged when he was oversimplifying for the sake of explanation or was exploring speculative territory.Appropriate medium & duration: (1/5) I would prefer to have watched a multi-part documentary series based on this book. Much of the text, written with beautiful prose, would make for nice narration. So much of the imagery described by the author would be better presented on screen, even--and perhaps especially--the activity happening on the molecular level.New & useful information: (4/5) I did learn a lot from reading this book. It was fun to see where human traits and those of cephalopods overlap and where they diverge, knowing that most of our traits developed totally independently from one another (our most recent common ancestor was likely a worm 600 million years ago). This line from the book captures what ultimately made it so interesting: “If we can make contact with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of a shared history, not because of kinship, but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.” Comparison to similar books: (4/5) I’ve never read a book quite like this one, but among nonfiction popular science books, Other Minds turned out to be fairly accessible and interesting. The only downside is that maybe it shouldn't have been a book at all. I want a documentary series.3.2/5 overall"
150,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46327507-andix,4,"Few notes- 'This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien'- 8 legs, 3 hearts, blue green blood; 500m neurons (similar to a 3 year old) spread through the body; skin that 'sees'- their skin changes color to replicate the terrain or according to mood, it could be also a way of communication- can learn by watching each other behave, have short term memory (a few hours); can solve mazes and unscrew jars with food by using visual clues- they recognize individuals (humans and octopuses) and have preferences (squirting water at researchers they don't like)- live up to 2 years after which they start decaying (losing legs, skin); prolonged lifespan in cold waters- only one mating season in their lifetime: lady octopus lays eggs only once, tends them and shortly after the eggs have hatched she dies ('big bang' mating); the same for cuttlefish except for tending the eggs/babies- challenging question: does the intelligence reside in the brain or in the limb?- the author was part of the team that discovered Octopolis in Australia in 2009, a colony of octopuses continually inhabited since then- easy to read, lots of examples, the author is very empathetic with the octopuses"
151,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38538651-steven,3,"The thesis of this book is this: The octopus is very intelligent. However, the common ancestors between octopuses and humans were most likely very unintelligent worms that maybe had eyes and a few nerves. That means that octopuses and humans evolved intelligence through completely separate pathways. The octopusean mind is about as close to an alien intelligence as one can get. This book shines when describing just how weird octopuses can be and how differently their nervous systems work compared to mammals and birds. It really made me think twice about what I expect ""intelligent"" creatures would do or not do. I couldn't get enough of the stories and descriptions. But, beware! To get those stories, you have to wade through some pretty esoteric and rather vague philosophical musings.about consciousness, subjective experience, feelings. The sentences are pretty convoluted and non-sensical. Perhaps the editor was afraid to admit that he or she didn't understand what was going on. I'm not afraid to admit that. I totally missed the author's point in those sections.Another delightful tidbit I gained from the book. Apparently, it's ""octopuses"" not ""octopi."" And, ""octopusean"" is also a word."
152,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19487217-maija,4,"Spoilers ahead (?) Octopuses eat crabs, but in the lab they are often fed on thawed-out frozen shrimp or squid. It takes octopuses a while to get used to these second-rate foods, but eventually they do. One day Boal was walking down a row of tanks, feeding each octopus a piece of thawed squid as she passed. On reaching the end of the row, she walked back the way she'd come. The octopus in the first tank, though, seemed to be waiting for her. It had not eaten its squid, but instead was holding it conspicuously. As Boal stood there, the octopus made its way slowly across the tank toward the outflow pipe, watching her all the way. When it reached the outflow pipe, still watching her, it dumped the scrap of squid down the drain. After this passage, the author discusses the ability of octopuses to track when they are being watched before acting out their shenanigans. One might think that such an impressive passage should lead into a bit of a scientific discussion, e.g. whether this is evidence octopuses have theory of mind, but in this book it doesn't lead to that. This lack of discussion is my only quip with this book - at times it seems to be aimlessly descriptive. Despite this, it's not devoid of worthwhile ideas and it's still a great read."
153,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75931056-rob-caswell,4,"I really enjoy the content of this book, even if its organizations seemed a bit unfocused at times. The book seems to really focus on three areas: observed aspects of the cephalopod (primarily octopus and cuttlefish) mind, the general evolutionary development of the complex mind, and a collection of theories about the nature of consciousness and cognition. All three are of interest to me and in all three areas I felt my boundaries of knowledge were expanded. It’s great brainfood (no pun intended) for pondering both our planet’s natural world as well as for creative science fiction exercises in alien creation.It was a shorter read than I expected – mostly due to fiction being the bulk of my regular diet. As a scientific treatise the last 25% of the book is notes and references. But it’s not “light reading”. The ideas discussed – especially around consciousness and cognition – require more focus and thought, so the book feels like a longer read, IF you’re paying attention.The upshot of my read: cephalopods are stranger that I previously thought (and I already considered them pretty special) and I will no longer eat any octopus or cuttlefish, for the same reason I don’t wish to eat dolphin, orca, or whale. There’s a truly complex mind under that eight-legged alien form."
154,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9174992-dutchie,4,"An intriguing story of how forms of intelligence have evolved along separate evolutionary paths; philosophy meeting biology. I knew some facts about octopuses - that they are invertebrates (no bones) with three hearts and blue blood, and that they have a beak and squirt ""ink"". But I didn’t appreciate their complex nervous systems, nor their amazing abilities to modify their body shape and skin colours. Our last common ancestor, about 600 million years ago was probably a small flattened worm, measured in millimetres. From this split, the ""bilaterian"" body plan that we share with all other vertebrates, including fish, developed along one path, whilst the molluscs, including cephalopods evolved on another. Cephalopods really do seem alien: I've shown a dozen people the scene from Attenborough's Blue Planet 2, where a cuttlefish is hypnotising a crab. Fascinating. Thoroughly enjoyed this book: thought-provoking and profound. It made me think in different ways about all the curious forms of life on our planet, including our own, and how we communicate. On the downside, the overall narrative wasn't really coherent, and I would have liked to know what conclusions the author drew from the observations and anecdotes. The author is obviously smitten with his subject, and his enthusiasm is infectious. The kind of bloke I'd love to have a few pints with."
155,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63096839-wouter,2,"Peter Godfrey-Smith at some point writes about the nervous system of the octopus: “In the octopus, if the mixed-control interpretation is right, central guidance of the movements is never complete, and the peripheral system always has its say. To put it too anthropomorphically: you would send an arm out deliberately and hope the local-fine-tuning gets it right.”Unfortunately that is also how this book reads. The top-down idea, the premise, is great: cephalopods are the closest thing what we have to alien intelligent life. What can we learn about intelligence and consciousness by studying them? However, the intellectual tentacles that Godfrey-Smith puts out in the different chapters are a bit hit-and-miss and seem to live there own life, only loosely connected to the premise. There are vivid anecdotes from his own diving adventures, discussions about the evolutionary paths of intelligent beings, philosophical musings about consciousness and sentience, and interesting side-branches going to colour-shifting capabilities and cephalopod communication. For a book that is billed as a philosophical book, it’s a real shame that the philosophical parts seem to be least fleshed out and missing other interesting viewpoints that have been made on the topic. The book also sort of withers towards the end and instead of weaving the different parts of the book into one it leaves them dangling there like cuttlefish arms in a sea current. The book will make you love cephalopods and give you (even) more reasons why we should protect our oceans. An okay read, so two stars."

I took AP Psychology, and I will continue to insist that this makes me a psychology expert, at least by goodreads standards, so some of this wasn't very surprising. Also, I've reached the stage where I've been reading enough science non-fiction to know some of the 'basics' stuff covered here (at least in terms of evolution, thanks to The Evolution Underground: Burrows, Bunkers, and the Marvelous Subterranean World Beneath our Feet). So I was mostly into this for the Octopuses. And they didn't disappoint, they're marvellous creatures, and this made me think a bit more about the world around me and the creatures who live in it. Minds are marvellous, bizarre things, and I'm honoured to possess one. Godfrey-Smith dallies into other randomness quite a lot; this is not a focused book--but that's part of the charm, if you ask me. "

I preferred this one to soul of the octopus because it was a lot more sciencey vs memoiry. godfrey-smith goes to the cambrian era and talks about where lifeforms branch off and when consciousness might have arisen and what it entails and there's just a lot of very interesting information in there (like under a very particular circumstance of brain damage you can be blind, basically, as in you're not getting information in your visual field, yet still be able to put mail through a mail slot and navigate around obstacles because there's another flow of information that gets put across in a different way). and an interesting discussion of how aging comes about, evolutionarily, as part of the discussion of why octopuses only live a couple of years, with all their big smarts. definitely interesting. my dad would probably like it. a slower read than the soul of the octopus but more worthwhile, although the two together give you a good picture.

158,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87142-angela,3,"I was utterly captivated by his descriptions of octopus and cuttlefish, which are like giant sensory pillows with tentacle faces that mate by HUGGING and gently posting a sperm packet in a special slot. How amazing is that? They are literally like aliens amongst us, changing individual chromatophores into infinite patterns. Sadly, they live only 2-4 years in that magical hovering plasticine body. The part I didn't enjoy in this compact book were the philosophical jaunts into the meaning of mind and consciousness and what it means to have an individual subjective experience. I am not drawn in by these discussions, as they seem impossibly vague and unscientific and incredibly dull. Nor did I think the author really wrapped up his argument about the co-evolution of multiple sites of meaning/consciousness/brainpower. I was also appalled to see that current experiments on these highly intelligent creatures usually involve cutting them up to see how they react. WE ARE TERRIBLE."
159,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101504581-j-tc,3,"Peter Godfrey-Smith in ""Other Minds"" describes the behavior of cephalopods, intending to find in his description clues to a degree of intelligence we are not supposed to expect. The author also intends to relate these “intelligent behaviors” with his developed nervous system.However, the author always makes the description excessively adjectivizing the behaviour of these animals without a plan an idea, without a suitable method to validate a working hypothesis. He does not use a scientific method and bases its description on a constant “uau”.The author's approach to the Cephalopod Nervous System is still very superficial, in no way descriptive, and nowhere makes a comparative study with the central nervous system of other animals.Still, with what he described as anatomical in cephalopods, the author refers those as behaviours, but much of what is described is essentially based on the author's convictions.The behaviour describes the author's intentions and not a scientific approach (see how he describes the octopus taking the diver by the hand. A poetic but unscientific description).Despite this bias, the author was able to send us the idea that octopuses are animals with a level of curiosity usually only observed in mammals.The author gives a brief description of the evolution of species, and some of his statements are not well founded. In his analysis of the ""mind"" of these animals, the author addresses the theme of consciousness. However, his approach is always made in a very confusing and unenlightening way.Could the author have quoted Antonio Damásio who in his description of consciousness identifies three levels: Proto-self; Nuclear-self; Autobiographic-self. These three levels can be exemplified in the following scheme: When an organism is hungry, this is a basic form of manifestation of consciousness - Proto-self; but if an organism interacts with its environment in search of food, then this is a more elaborate form of consciousness and is called the nuclear self; but if I am not limited to searching and have a more elaborate behaviour such as “planting to prevent starvation” this is the highest form of consciousness and is called Autobiographic-self.Proto-self is manifested in the most basic forms of life, while a Nuclear-self is observed in most multi-nucleated organisms. The autobiographic self, what underlies culture and civilization, is what characterizes us as homo sapiens. Cephalopods have a nuclear self. Based on what the author describes, these animals have no social behaviour, nor care for their offspring, nor do they exhibit any behavioural traits that set them apart from many other animals.By this I do not mean that these animals are uninteresting ones.It is possible that if there is a ""reset"" on life on earth (as occurred in the previous five great extinctions), with the extinction of the current hierarchical top chain mammals, other animals may evolve to assume a dominating role. Octopuses might take on this way, but this is just speculation, even if I would like to be around just to see.The author also addresses the issue of aging, suggesting that cells are programmed to live without a limit, with cellular death arising from the accumulation of errors and mutations.In multicellular beings, cell death is programmed and is somehow controlled by the waste of telomeres (chromosome ends). In any case, death is not only an inevitability, but also an indispensable “a sine qua non” condition for evolution to occur and for a species not to dictate their extermination by an uncontrolled increase of population. Without aging and death species would not be sustainable and could not evolve because they could not have the necessary descendants.The author further suggests that a development of nervous system with at least 270 million years old reflects a use in past times. Usually anatomical features precede their expression and use, so the presence of a nervous system may reflect a possible way in which they can evolve if an opportunity is given.Finally, I congratulate the author on how the book ends by drawing attention to ocean problems such as pollution, acidification, warming, intensive fishing, loss of biodiversity, and the emergence of sterile areas by greatly reducing oxygen."

You can tell this is an author who found the academic tone and decided it was the only voice he needed forever. Also, the beginning covers a LOT of basic evolutionary biology, which is great, except I've already taken that course. And, uh, there's a LOT more philosophy than I wanted, mostly because the amount of philosophy content I tend to want is pretty close to zero.But! There were also octopus anecdotes, which is what I came for, and genuinely interesting cephalopod facts, which I hoped for, and enough speculation to fuel the development of several fictional alien species, which was a marvelous bonus. I came out of this with even more respect for cephalopods than I had going in. And I did enjoy this.(WOW it took a long time to read, though. Largely because sections of this are basically the reading equivalent of jelly -- hard to wade through, but it slides right off you, so if you want to remember any of it, you have to take several trips through the jelly pond.)"

I found it an interesting read, but my world view isn’t exactly changed. I’ve heard stories of people turning vegan because of this book and for me it wasn’t some kind of religious experience at all. That said, it is an interesting read and a lot of effort put into the research. The author is walking the difficult line of trying to be an academic book based on philosophy and evolution of the brain an trying to be an interesting, insightful read and not a text book. Generally speaking he is successful at it. I actually found many of the footnotes as entertaining and informative as the main text.I did learn from the book and the ability of cephalopods to change color and mimic their surroundings is something I’ve only recently become aware of. The book has a chapter that is very informative on how that is physically done (as best as anyone can tell) and also discusses what potential purposes, if any, the color displays could have.Worth reading."
162,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68529396-emily,3,"Some interesting insights into the lives of cephalopods! My favourite part was the account of how the octopus's chromatophore-based camouflage system works: a fascinating mechanism that I'd never given any thought to. On the whole, I enjoyed this book more for the information on zoology and animal behaviour than for the philosophy or psychology it seemed to promise — the relatively light touch on the latter topics does seem like a little bit of a missed opportunity for the author to bring his specialist perspective, given that he is a philosopher rather than a zoologist. This also meant that my general impression was of an interesting book that slightly lacked an overarching thesis or theme. However, it's entirely possible that this is less a legitimate critique of the book and more a reflection of the manner in which I read it: in very short snatches strung out over way too long a period of time (not because I wasn't enjoying the book — just busy)."

I had hoped that it would be more descriptive of human-octopus interactions—I could listen to those sorts of stories for hours—but it is mostly a textbook on evolutionary biology and the evolution of the nervous system. Something that the author skirted around and didn’t even try to propose a personal theory is the purpose of the highly complex visual skin displays that cephalopods are capable of. Why would an animal with a 2 year lifespan, who lives a mostly solitary life, need to have evolved such a complex biological feature? He mentions a study that was published a couple decades ago that mapped the visual displays as a structured language. This study was largely ignored because of the way it was written (conversational instead of cold science language) and so the author spent little time on it. But honestly, that’s what I wanted the entire book to be about. These creatures possess the physical ability to have a language that is more complex than humans’ and yet, as far as we understand, there is no biological necessity for it. That is just one of their many characteristics that throws evolutionary theory out the window, and yet the author spent the entire book justifying the few characteristics that are easily explained. Sigh. "

I’ve had a low-key obsession with cephalopods recently, which is what initially drew me in. I got about a quarter of the way through and decided to buy a copy for myself so I could continue to read it while I was on vacation in California. I can say without hesitation that this book increased my obsession with cephalopods 100%. My grandma and I went to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and I spent half the time in the cephalopod area. The knowledge I gained from the book enhanced my enjoyment in seeing the cephalopods. Understanding how and why they change colors and shape made watching them change colors and shape that much more fascinating. Another thing that caught my attention and got me to pick this up initially was the unusual combination of topics. Octopuses and philosophy. Not something I would’ve ever thought to combine. It ended up being really fascinating. I don’t really know what the point of the book was because Godfrey-Smith never seemed to come to any conclusion. I’m sure there are many books that go more in depth with consciousness or cephalopods but I still learned a lot from this book. The fact that there didn’t seem to be an overall point didn’t hinder my enjoyment or how much I learned. I do wish that the chapters were a little shorter. I felt like a lot of them went on forever. The book is really easy to comprehend and understand. I think it’s a great intro to philosophy and knowledge about cephalopods. There are so many great stories about octopuses that I absolutely loved. I’d definitely recommend this book to beginners in philosophy or anyone who likes cephalopods, especially octopuses. -----good book, good book, good book !!rtc within the next week or so"
165,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33334584-peter-pinkney,5,"This is an amazing book. I was going to give it four stars because the science in the book is a bit difficult, but the descriptions of these magnificent animals (octopuses, squid and the wonderful cuttlefish) made me round it up to five. Even though some of it is difficult, the section on what consciousness is, is fascinating. I am truly in awe of these animals, and I especially loved the fact that cuttlefish will often just totally ignore any humans present and with total indifference. A sort of animal 1000 yard stare.It’s such a shame that they only have very short lives. Although if they lived longer then they might well be ruling the world, and probably do a better job of it than we have done.As the author says, they are the closest we will probably get to meeting an alien although they are very much of this world."

The writer is a great story teller and outlining the topics based on cephalopods makes it so engaging! Who knew that cuttlefish were basically colorblind (based on our knowledge of color perception), yet they can produce such phenomenal color shows over their skin!? So cool. The book also gives you a lot to think about in regards to your own thoughts/ideas/perceptions, and the word around you. It goes hand in hand with all of the Buddhism readings I’ve been jazzed about. I love science reads and this was a great one! And the reader who did the audiobook was excellent! Not dull or monotonous like you might expect for a science book."

And lots of interesting facts about octopuses!The author's scholarly work is in the philosophy of science, especially in the evolution of self-awareness and the development of the brain across species. The scholarly parts were well argued and clear; I had no trouble following along. The octopus is quite interesting, in that it is clever, able to solve problems, etc., while having a nervous system and brain that is unlike those of vertebrates. It makes a fine example for the argument of intelligence evolving along several different paths, at different times in the past.The bonus for the reader are all the great photos of various octopuses and cuttlefish as well as the interesting stories of octopus' behavior.I doubt that I will buy this book for my reference shelf. However, I am glad that I read it."
168,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3215971-amy,4,"So many fascinating things I learned in this book. Some marine biology, some evolutionary biology, some philosophy, and I enjoyed them in that order. Did you know an octopus has 3 hearts and blue blood? The detail of how squid/ cuttlefish change color and how they “see” their surroundings to know how to camouflage is amazing. Some sections of the text are dry and very academic, and some of the theory I only partially understood. But definitely worth pushing through. A thought- provoking read for a science geek like me. Especially after just finishing Michael Pollan’s book “How to Change Your Mind,” which promotes the idea of alternative forms of consciousness. This book explores what it is to *be* a cephalopod. "

I never did find satisfactory ones of them displaying their tentacles in some of the more extreme arrangements Godfrey-Smith describes. I almost scored the book a star higher for being exceedingly clearly written. THANK YOU Godfrey-Smith for talking about where you'd be going reviewing along the way where you'd been, and summarizing at the end. So easy to follow, even in audiobook format.I liked his scope: evolutionary biology from hundreds of millions of years ago to the present. Along the way the listener learns about cephalopod behavior, pigmentation and neurology. The sections on perception, awareness and self-experience made me think about this topics in new ways."

It takes octopuses a while to get used to these second-rate foods, but eventually they do. One day Boal was walking down a row of tanks, feeding each octopus a piece of thawed squid as she passed. On reaching the end of the row, she walked back the way she'd come. The octopus in the first tank, though, seemed to be waiting for her. It had not eaten its squid, but instead was holding it conspicuously. As Boal stood there, the octopus made its way slowly across the tank toward the outflow pipe, watching her all the way. When it reached the outflow pipe, still watching her, it dumped the scrap of squid down the drain."""

The author spends considerable time on the color changes in squid and cuttlefish, wondering about the purpose of the changes, checking out possibilities, and hypothesizing the development and evolution of that behavior. He also is interested in the short life span of most cephalopods and compares life spans of other water and land animals. I listened to this book and found it difficult to stop listening. It is written for those of us who are not up-to-date on the subject matter. It does not include the in-depth results of his work, but summarizes, questions, and teaches. I will look for more of his work."

The author is not only a professor of history and philosophy of science - which creates a compelling narrative in and of itself - but also a scuba diving enthousiast. Easily digestible parts about the origin of life, the central nervous system and a deep look into the ancient seas are sprinkled with personal diving anecdotes. Let's protect our origin and stop polluting and acidifying the naturally alkaline oceans so we may keep peeking at our own history. "

Now, to be fair, I was listening to the audio book and not reading it and this could have made a huge difference to my feelings. I found the narrator's voice to be a bit monotonous and found it hard to keep concentrating on what he was saying. It was like being back at uni and drifting off in a lecture. I've listened to a lot of audio books now, mostly non-fiction, and I haven't had this problem before, so I'm going to to give the author the benefit of the doubt and blame it on the narration. My recommendation? Steer clear of the audio book. "
174,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7331806-rob-adey,3,"Since I heard about the weird brainy tentacles of octopuses I've been waiting for a book about them – ideally, something along the lines of the famous Thomas Nagel question about the inner life of bats. This book has a bit of that, but is really using octopuses to shed light on consciousness more generally and... it's readable enough, but I'm not sure it adds that much to the topic (it's not really a long enough book to do that), especially when Godfrey-Smith just argues a bunch of stuff by assertion. Still, good to read about the prehistoric cephalopod which was basically an 11-metre Cornetto."
175,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31037758-clementine,4,"I enjoyed this a lot. The bits on colour perception in octupuses and the big Why do we age question really resonated with me. However, this book was not as structured as it could have been. If in the beginning, it seemed clear the book would address conciousness, it lost its focus by Chapter 3. I didn't mind because it was still fascinating to me considering my background (neuro + psych + perception). However, I mush admit I'm a bit puzzled by its title considering the content. Overall, the book leans more on neuro and psych (with a touch of philo ramblings?!) than evolutive biology. Your enjoyment of the book may thus depend on what you are looking for and what your background is."

I have always been fascinated by cephalopods, so I was drawn to this book; however, if you are interested in philosophy, evolution, psychology or just the weird and wonderful mysterious of our planet I highly recommend Other Minds. I won't give any spoilers, but it really made me think about concepts of consciousness and sentience and what we take for granted from our perspective on land. For a very scientific book, Godfrey-Smith has made the discussion of evolutionary processes very accessible and almost romantic at times. It did take me awhile to read, but it was worth it and it was worth digesting every detail about our eight-legged friends and the great tree of life.

It also looks at communication, perception of colour and the meaning of signals in society comparing baboons with octopuses. I found this book absolutely fascinating! There is just so much interesting stuff to see by contrasting the separate evolutionary path of cephalopods and mammals. There were some stunning insights into what actually constitutes consciousness and what forces give rise to it at different levels in different types of creatures. The author obviously has an affection for the creatures he studies and a lot of his love of his subject comes over in his writing."
178,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1260126-tim,3,"A short book, and only about half of it is devoted to the fascinating subject the octopus and its alien mind. The rest of the book meanders over numerous ocean and cephalopodic related topics, from why the octopus has such a short lifespan (and why we die) to pollution and over-fishing our oceans. When it's on topic, the book is revelatory. Exploring the human mind in comparison to something as alien as the octopus is revealing and intriguing. The rest I didn't care much for. It feels like a subject that could have been written up in an article or two, but instead has been padded out to make a book."

There's bucketloads of #science in these pages, so readers would do well to brush up on their big-boy words before they pick this one up. It wasn't the easiest book to get through, but you'd really applaud the author's unique mix of biology, history, ecology and philosophy. If you're looking for a book with trippy illustrations and instant mind-blowing science facts to ponder whilst under the influence, this may not be it, so save your stash for after you've finished reading."
181,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58813607-adam-keller,3,"Like cephalopods themselves, this book spreads its brainpower over a lot of different areas: biology, evolutionary history, theory of mind, behavioral anecdotes. It’s accessible and full of interesting information. Godfrey-Smith views brains as complex computers that analyze inputs and stimulate behaviors. There is no cohesive “mind,” just the impression of one in some animals with a lot of interlocking systems in their neurons. That’s probably solid from a scientific/philosophical point of view, but it’s also boring. I pick this book up thinking, “Ooh, what’s it like to be an octopus?” and it’s like, “Well I can’t really answer that, and it might be the wrong question to ask.” Then why did you call it ‘Other Minds’ ???? God level troll tbh"

Some of the writing gets into fairly heavy philosophy, but it's grounded in recent science evidence and never strays too far from what someone who hasn't studied in the field can still understand. Plus, lots of fascinating details about octopuses and cuttlefish, among the most interesting animals in the world."
183,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/724958,5,"This is an important book and I am willing to forgive its fault of repetitiveness. I feel everyone interested in AI or machine learning really needs to read this. There is so little we know about intelligence, subjective experience, consciousness... we haven’t begun to really grasp how these things work or what they mean. Until we do, how can we boast of “artificial intelligence?” I have studied AI methods as a computer scientist for years, decades honestly, and this gave me so much to chew on. I see our pursuit in a very different light now. And even if this isn’t your deal, this short book is so thought-provoking. It’s more than worth picking up."
184,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12872086-sheeraz,3,"There was a mismatch between my expectations and what the book actually covers. I thought there will be enlightening arguments on the definition and characteristics of consciousness but the biggest chunks of the book are devoted to cephalopod behavior, only tangentially hinting at the big questions. There are some experimental references but the evidence of cephalopod intelligence presented is weak and often anecdotal. I gleaned a few things from the book like the evolutionary argument for aging, but in general it reads more like a tale of fascination than structured philosophical arguments or animal behavior research."

I went for a whole week going cuttlefish this and cuttlefish that. You want to talk about the weather? That’s great but let me just segue into cuttlefish, which I will now talk about for forty-five minutes straight. I had to read this quite slowly (my poor little brain didn’t cope so well with efference/afference/exafference/ reafference).

Going into this I expected more in depth study of the octopus, but all we got was bits and pieces of behaviors and studies. I did find the section on consciousness and the theories out there interesting, but they seemed to drag on without getting anywhere fast enough. Then they barely touched back on the octopus and what it all meant. I think the book struggles from trying to cram to many theories and ideas in to small of a book."

While the book certainly gives the reader an intriguing discussion, some of the authors attempts to blend philosophy and evolutionary biology fail.

Like an octopus, this book is always fascinating and never dry."

Some mad facts: octopuses have evolved 600m years separately to us but they are another evolutionary 'experiment' in big brains, like an 'intelligent alien'; octopuses have their oesophagus going through their brain (not great when something gets stuck); & colour on their skin is octopus' language, dreams & thought!"
193,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25248887-tom,5,"I read this to get some background on Children of Ruin, to find out how cephalopod intelligence really works. The author is a philosopher so the book is particularly interested in how a ‘mind’ evolves, and compares and contrasts the development of vertebrates and cephalopods to explore how intelligence evolved twice. I was expecting it to be a zoological text but actually found it far more interesting as a philosophical one than I’d expect. It’s charmingly written, there’s clearly a lot of passion involved and it ends up a very entertaining piece of non-fiction. "

A philosophical examination of sentience that only slightly bogs down. And an affecting look at the delicate balance of ecosystems and our responsibility to the planet and to ourselves. "

243,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44535036-john-aggrey-odera,4,"At the Kenyan coast, in Diani, where my father partly grew up, and where my family still spends some of our Christmas holidays, I have a fisherman friend, Issa, who supplies my family with fish, and who once told me a Swahili aphorism- a Methali - “Usijigeuze chachandu, kujipalilia makaa”. Among the local fishermen, Issa said, lore had it that the best way to cook an octopus was, while yet alive, to surround the captured animal with hot pieces of coal. The rest, the cooking itself, would be taken care of by the octopus, who’d first extend an arm and take a piece of hot coal, which it would proceed to place upon its head, burning itself. Then, agonizingly but decidedly, the octopus would pick the other pieces of coal and place them, one by one, upon each of its arms, until, finally, it died from burning itself. And was perfectly cooked. This activity was thought by the local fishermen to be an act of stupidity - hence the methali warned people against piling problems upon themselves, since in doing so, they would become their own executors. 	An uncomplicated reading of this behaviour would have us think that octopuses are dumb, for, in our minds, no intelliegent being would kill itself like that. Yet Peter Godfrey-Smith seeks to get us to view these animals not just as intelligent, but as exceedingly so. According to him, encountering an octopus is the closest experience we can have regarding what it would be like to encounter an intelligent alien. As such, and I’m conjecturing here, perhaps Smith would have us think of the Octopus’ behaviour as dscribed by Issa, if Issa’s account is to be believed at all, as deliberate suicide rather than self-immolation; as a conscious act of declaring self-ownership, even through the act of killing oneself, rather than as a meaningless act of self destruction.	First, however, we will have to agree on the octopus’ intelligence. Octopus brains (and bodies, duh!) are so different from ours’ that to simply apply our conceptions of intelligence to them would be misleading. Certainly, on a purely physicalist level, octopuses seem to be intelligent. They possess about 500 million neurons in their brains - roughly equal in number to what a medium sized dog possesses. But even more importantly, they possess a remarkable brain-to-body mass ratio - the number of neurons in the brain relative to the size of the animal. Furthermore, each of the eight arms of the octopus is a semi-autonomous unit, possessed of millions of neurons of its own. Godfrey-Smith uses the analogy of a Jazz band to describe the relationship these arms have to the central brain - that whereas the band might have a conductor, the players are often free to improvise, sometimes to even do things that the conductor does not approve of. Sometimes, for example, when an octopus arm has been chopped off, it will thrash about, crawl determinedly, change shape and colour; all in an attempt to act in a self-preserving (as independent from the whole) way.	But since octopuses' brains and physiologies are so different from ours, the more useful metric for intelligence is perhaps behaviour. It is here that Godfrey-Smith’s status, not just as a philosopher and a biologist, but most importantly, a diver, provides illumination - for accounts of the behaviour of octopuses in the wild differ in marked ways from accounts of their behaviour in lab settings, and as a diver, Godfrey-Smith is able to provide remarkable accounts of underwater interactions with and observations of octopuses. Still, even in captivity, octopuses display remarkable intelligence. When they try to escape from an aquarium in a lab, for example, they often wait for the time when no one is looking. They can display significant insolence, like dumping a type of food they hate down the drain of an aquarium, while contemptuously, one might say, if one could read their faces, staring straight into the eyes of the person who gave them the food. They are able to distinguish between different human beings, even when those humans are dressed in similar clothing, and they are able to show affection or disregard for specific humans - spraying those they don’t like with jets of water, and lovingly clinging to those they like.	The remarkable thing about octopus intelligence, though, is that octopuses, unlike other intelligent animals - most especially humans - do not seem to derive their intelligence from sociality. Octopuses, says Godfrey-Smith, are not inclined to monogamy; they have haphazard sex lives - with the male extending his second right arm, which contains a sperm capsule, to a female, who chooses whether to take it or not - and who even after taking it, waits a few days before deciding whether to inseminate herself with the sperm, or to discard it. Octopuses do not work in concert to secure food - they do in fact eat each other when they can, nor do they organize themselves to protect themselves against larger predators. Even when they exist in close proximity to one another - as in the case of Octopolis - the city of Octopuses near Sydney that Godfrey-Smith spends a lot of time exploring and talking about, they do not exist as a unit, but rather in as individuals attempting to self preserve, and ready to sabotage others when necessary.	Having established this intelligence then, the interesting question becomes that of consciousness - what it is like to be an octopus. Godfrey-Smith defines consciousness as “a mixed-up and overused but useful term for forms of subjective experience that are unified and coherent in various ways” - that is, an inner life; a subjective view of the self as distinct from whatever is not the self. Of the 36 recognized animal phyla, only 3 are comprised of beings that have “consciousness”, in the sense Geofrey-Smith understands it. The first are Chordates - comprised of animals that have a notochord; a flexible cartilaginous material running from the back of the head all the way to a post anal tailbone, and with bilateral symmetry; i.e. a bodily division composed of two opposite and roughly similar parts- left and right (as opposed to radial symmetry, which has only top and bottom, but not left and right). Vertebrates (Mammals, Reptiles, Amphibians, Birds and Fish) are chordates. The second phylum is composed of arthropods - animals with exoskeletons, paired jointed appendages, and segmented bodies- the most famous example of which are insects. The third phylum is composed of molluscs - animals with body parts known as radula, used for feeding, and mantles, used for breathing and excretion. Among the molluscs, only cephalopods, composed chiefly of squids, cuttlefish and octopuses, are significantly intelligent enough to have consciousness in this sense.	There are several heuristics for this kind of consciousness - this subjective identification. Take pain, for instance. Godfrey-Smith writes of animals going against their typical preferences, just to alleviate physical pain - say a chicken in pain is provided with two kinds of grains, one that it likes and the other that it usually doesn’t, but that is infused with painkillers. Smith tells us that often, the chicken will choose to eat the grain infused with painkillers. Or say a fish, also in pain, provided with two possible environments; one with its favourite food, and the other infused with painkillers. Again, most often the fish chooses the painkiller environment. Cephalopods- like Octopuses and Cuttlefish too, have similar experiences of pain, choosing to alleviate it whenever possible. Also, they tend to their wounds - a sure sign that they recognize them as debilitations, unlike say, an ant or a bee which, even though significantly physically injured, goes about its business as if nothing is amiss. And as lab experiences have shown, octopuses can experience profound distress, even anguish, and often times, when this happens, may try to end the situation one way or another, perhaps through attempting to escape - as is often the case, or perhaps, when all its attempts at escape have proven futile, through other means - thus my argument about Issa’s story, that the octopus pilling coal on itself was a case of suicide rather than stupidity, might be supported here.	Octopuses and cuttlefish have a remarkable ability, even more than that of chameleons, to change colour (they can glow in millions of various colour combinations) - and in the case of the octopus, shape - since it has not a single bone in its body, it can transform itself to look like anything - a rock, a bright piece of coral, a thin line several meters long; and though some octopuses might have arms a foot long, they can still pass through whatever little space, even the eye of a needle, so long as their beaks can fit. The colour transformations are both an adaptation towards camouflage - lending themselves towards preservation against predators, and perhaps even signalling, but, interestingly, they are not directed towards mating or attraction - for, amazingly, octopuses are colour blind.	Quite a significant part of Godfrey-Smith’s book is spent discussing the lifespans of octopuses, which are ridiculously short - about two years for most of them, though some large ones live up to four years, and, calculated from anecdotal accounts of observations of the gestation periods of some deep sea octopuses (most octopuses live in shallow waters), some deep sea octopuses may live up to sixteen years - though this is very much the exception rather than the rule. Especially for their brain power, it seems like such a remarkable waste that octopuses live such short lives, that they have such a fantastic brain that they never get to use. The explanation Godfrey-Smith provides here comes from Sir Peter Medawar, the Brazillian-British Nobel laureate famous both as the biologist who gave us tissue and organ transplant, as well as for being the best raconteur in the British isles during his time. Per Medawar’s theory of aging, when the octopus, during the Ediacaran period - bleeding into the early Cambrian period - gave up its hard shell for a life of physical unrestricted possibilities, it left itself open to mutations that significantly speeded up its ageing process - the result of of which was a fascinating life, but a short one. Octopuses are here for a good time, not a long time.	Upon finishing this book, I was convinced never to eat octopuses again - but that was easy for me, since I have been mostly vegetarian for the last four years anyway. I did, however, try to think of ways I could convince my friends (my family have assured me that, regardless of whatever argument I give them, they will never stop eating meat) to stop eating, if not all animals, then at least some of the more “conscious” ones.	The problem, as I see it, is that the intelligence of the animals we consume provides shaky grounds for arguing against animal cruelty - and that is made even worse by the fact that even for those of us who tout this metric, many of our consumption choices are not rational, and do not even take this metric into account in the first place. For example, although pigs are smarter than dogs - and it is very easy to learn this, most of us in the western world, who use intelligence as a metric for justifying our consumption choices, eat the former and not the latter. Thus, very presciently, Jeremy Bentham’s utilitarian argument against cruelty towards animals was one that tried to avoid the baggage that came with decrying cruelty simply on the basis of intelligence. Instead, Bentham invited us, in our decisions regarding whether to eat animals or not, to consider not whether they (animals) could think or speak, “but simply whether they could suffer”. This “suffering” is a conception of personhood, as preference utilitarians think of it, that leans very heavily on what Godfrey-Smith thinks of as “consciousness”: that to feel pain, and to feel it as something happening to oneself, is to suffer, and that we, who know better, should not subject a being with consciousness to such. It is plain, unjustifiable cruelty.Yet we’ve so far ignored even this suffering part, choosing to consume even those animals whose depictions of suffering are so much like ours - cows and pigs raised in slaughterhouses in most of the world; dogs sold for consumption in wet markets. The case for not eating octopuses (and yeah, that tasty calamari too) is perhaps even stronger - though, again, this shouldn’t matter, since no one, most especially in the western world, should be eating animals anyway. To use a bastardization of Bentham’s criterion: Octopuses don’t just suffer; they think too. Please don’t eat octopuses."

This book covers these age old questions by exploring the differences between us and the octopus, an animal so alien to us it's hard to believe we once shared an ancestor. The discussion on the evolution of the nervous system is fascinating. The cephalopods seem to have exploited the nervous system in a much more creative way than any other class.It's hard to imagine just what these creatures would feel, but the author makes a case that there is good reason to suspect they have a complex subjective experience. He distinguishes this from what we typically call consciousness, which may be unique to humans (at least on this planet). He speculates that because of our social nature (in contrast to octopuses who have little social interaction) we developed complex language which internalized to produce our inner monologue. Indeed, it's hard to imagine what consciousness could feel like without a language. Cephalopods, on the other hand, literally display their emotions on their skin. It is not clear what the evolutionary benefit, if any, of these strikingly beautiful collages possess.Overall an extremely wonderful book."

254,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6960931-andrew,4,"A welcome antidote to many of the lingering questions I found myself stuck with after reading Free Will a couple months ago. Free Will left me wondering whether subjective experience, consciousness, is really nothing more than an elaborate story that we overlay on top of our subconscious mental activity. Putting aside what that does to our perception of ourselves, the question I couldn’t shake was why evolve consciousness at all? If what Sam Harris says is true, what useful purpose does it serve? Happily, Other Minds delves directly into those very questions.Godfrey-Smith suggests that early nervous systems developed primarily as a way to organize the actions of newly evolved multi-cellular life. But consciousness is marked not so much by how much enters its sphere but by how much escapes it. Our conscious life does not involve the vast majority of the processes our nervous system regulates - growing our hair, beating our heart, etc.“Subjective experience does not arise from the mere running of the system, but from the modulation of its state, from registering things that matter. These need not be external events; they might arise internally. But they are tracked because they matter and require a response. Sentience has some point to it. It’s not just a bathing in living activity.”That gets us off on the right track - consciousness gives a mechanism for responding to unexpected stimuli. But there’s more to it than just that.“We can do a lot without consciousness, but some things we can’t do. We can’t unconsciously perform a task that is novel, rather than routine, an requires a series of acts, step-by-step. We can unconsciously learn associations between experiences-learn to expect A when you see B-but only if B and A come close together. Once there is a significant gap between them, we can learn the association only if we are aware of it.There’s a particular style of processing - one that we use to deal especially with time, sequences, and novelty - that brings with it conscious awareness, while a lot of other quite complex activities do not.”So it’s not just allowing for responses to novel stimuli, consciousness does in fact provide us with a unique kind of processing power. But how does it work, exactly? He suggests that it may be directly tied to how we process language:“The sounds we cook up in our heads, including the sounds of words, are broadcast in our minds in something like the way many ordinary perceptual experiences are broadcast. Once a sentence of inner speech is composed, it is exposed to the same sort processing that would apply to a sentence we hear.Inner speech does not live in a little box in your brain; inner speech is a way your brain creates a loop, intertwining the construction of thoughts and the reception of them. And when that's done, the format provided by language allows you bring ideas together in an organized structure.”Isn’t that fascinating? The idea that the inner monologues that are central to our conscious experience are actually a way for the brain to process ideas using the same mechanisms we would for understanding language - it quite literally is a way for us to talk to ourselves.Now the elephant Sam Harris still leaves in the room is whether the conscious decision I make as a result of that inner monologue is actually something “I” have any control over - or is it simply the result of my unique configuration of molecules. But the Buddhist in me finds that much less troubling, because I tend to see the idea of “I” as a mental construction in the first place - a byproduct of the inner monologue. But hearing how and why (to the best of our current understanding), conscious experience does in fact serve a valuable purpose, was an answer to a question I didn’t quite know how to ask. And to learn that it comes in multiple forms, and has evolved independently in different places (octopus, cuttlefish), is equal parts humbling and wonderful."

256,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2788942-turkeyphant,2,"Didn't get this book at all. Like others, I wanted to love it. But there's no structure whatsoever and no overarching thesis. It's just a collection of interesting but well-known anecdotes about octopus behaviour and no attempt to weave them together into coherent commentary about consciousness. And then it abruptly ends (with a thick unexpected wedge of uncited notes) not even without ends tied up and questions answered but before even posing the most pressing questions!The author claims to be a philosopher but doesn't engage in any way with contemporary theories of consciousness and common language. The study of consciousness is as deep as the ocean and we are making huge strides at the moment. However, sadly, this book doesn't even begin to plumb the shallowest discussions and, instead, paddles about aimlessly in rock pools.It's neither a good pop-science book nor an attempt to critically engage with the philosophical literature. It also offers nothing new to those peripherally familiar with octopus behaviour or biology. And the lack of references is just bemusing. It seems the author wants to talk more about a few fun dives he had in Australia rather that attempt to explain anything about cephalopod language or consciousness or any relationship between the two."

All in all a nice read, that taught me quite a bit and tickled my curiosity all the more.I do agree with some other reviewers that it loses structure a bit halfway through, but I enjoyed the various anecdotes enough to not really mind."

262,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10193872-larry-massaro,3,"Intermittently interesting, but ultimately disappointing, and not what I expected. This is primarily a kind of natural history of cephalopods, mostly the octopus and cuttlefish, and less about consciousness. The author doesn't succeed in integrating the two subjects very well. Godfrey-Smith is a philosopher of science and also a scuba diver, and he clearly knows a lot about marine biology. He starts by summarizing current research and speculation about the origins of nervous systems in the most primitive animals. He then goes on to describe cephalopods and their surprisingly big brains, the unique arrangements of their nervous systems, and their behavioral peculiarities. Cephalopods are apparently way more intelligent than other invertebrates, a point that, unfortunately, the author more asserts than demonstrates. I think we just have to take his word for it and satisfy ourselves with a few anecdotes of octopus cleverness. Octopuses and cuttlefish are not closely related to us on the evolutionary tree. Godfrey-Smith's main point in Other Minds is that, because the common ancestor of mammals and cephalopods was so distant and primitive, the evolution of intelligence must have happened at least twice on earth--separately, distinctly, independently--in very different environments. That's an interesting point, but the book doesn't satisfactorily address the big question that it begs: How then does intelligence evolve? Nor does it bridge the conceptual gap between intelligence and consciousness. Even if we accept the premise that the octopus is very intelligent for a non-mammal, that seems to say nothing about consciousness. Dogs and chimps and dolphins, for example, are demonstrably intelligent, but I don't believe that anyone has proven that they are conscious in the way that we are conscious. The 6th chapter in Other Minds seems to skim the surface of the research and philosophy of consciousness. And it's about human consciousness--of course--and highly abstract, and thus feels like a digression in this book, which is otherwise spent mostly underwater. Which is not to say that it isn't interesting in and of itself, with discussions of: - The role of language in our development--and especially the importance of ""inner speech,"" which is when we silently talk to ourselves, often in complete sentences;- Feedback loops and ""reafference,"" which is signaling to ourselves about our own activities; and - ""Higher-order thought"": ""This is thought about your own thoughts; it involves taking a step back from the current flow of your experience and formulating a thought about it: ' Why am I in such a bad mood?' or 'I hardly noticed that car.' Higher-order thought has long been seen as having a role to play in theories of subjectivity and consciousness, but it’s been unclear what that role is. Some people have argued that higher-order thought is necessary for any sort of subjective experience at all.""So it kind of deflates the whole goofy promise of this book when he follows with the point that ""most animals are very unlikely to have higher-order thought."" This is not a huge surprise, except that it IS a surprise given the book's title. With 2 more chapters to go, Godfrey-Smith slams the door shut at the end of this chapter: ""Cephalopod [color] displays have enormous expressive power, but as long as we’re looking at a single animal, rather than a pair or a group, these displays are not embedded in a lot of looping feedback, and perhaps could never be. The human case—an extreme case—suggests that the opportunities associated with reafference help to drive the evolution of a more complicated mind. Cephalopods are on a different road.""Bottom line: They're not much like us."

(they've got no skeleton, semi-independent limbs, and possibly see colour through their /skin/, just for starters.)-there's a lot of talk of Octopolis in this book -- a patch of australian seabed where about a dozen octopuses (rotating in and out as they leave or die) live in semi-harmony (attracting along their way schools of fishes, baby sharks, and manta rays). -I love every anecdote of octopuses bombing lab tests because they just don't get the point of them (see: the one octopus in this book who instead of pushing a lever to get some sardine went, Fuck This, This Food Sucks, and stole the lamp from above the lever to play with instead.) (which now that I think about it is pretty similar to a story in Ursula K. Le Guin's collection Buffalo Gals and Other Animal Presences. :V!)-this book explained parts of genetics and evolution (exactly how we're related to other animals and what it means for different species to have split off from common ancestors) in a way that cleared it up a lot for me!-I didn't know cuttlefish could get that big and the photos in this book left me shaken to my core."

I'm a vegetarian and have long held the belief that all sentient beings share this planet and humans need to respect other life forms. (I still swat flies and mosquitos, bugs etc.)  There were a few places in this small book I found a bit of a slog for me. In places he delves into evolutionary details and research he has done and studied which were more than I needed. I know he was building his case and explaining how he arrived at his conclusions but I found it rather dry. I did best when he was describing the habits and habitat of the critters. I was taken aback and it seems the author was as well, when he first learned that the octopuses and cuttlefish live very short lives, many just a season or two, and he states, ""The largest, the giant Pacific octopus can make it to about four years at the outside."" In some ways I found this book and another I read recently, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari|395812] complimented each other. Both authors ended with cautionary advise as to the effect humankind is having on other life forms on the planet. Peter Godfrey Smith sites the bee-colony collapse stating that the collapse was not a single pest or chemical or the decline of habitat but the accumulation of multiple stressors whose toll were being compensated for by bee colonies, until the combined weight came to bare resulting in bee colony collapse. The parallel is the sea, which we over fished and polluted and changed the ph from green house gases. He points to areas of dead zones in the oceans that already exist and sees them as serious warning signs. "

This was probably the longest it has ever taken me to read a book only 204 pages long (I skipped the notes). It was really only because I kept re-reading passages. This book is only marginally about octopuses and cuttlefish though. Informative and fascinating, but this is more a philosophy book that uses science as it's platform. I loved it, but it is more about how beings develop and the continued exploration of the mind and not about the octopus. I did learn many things, but probably (at least to me, and I am married to a doctor of maternal and fetal medicine), was learning how octopuses mate! I had no clue and to find out it is through the arms (the author does not use the word tentacles) gave me a head tilt and then an, ""ohhhhh, makes sense!"" "

I removed a star because I felt the author could have done much more to emphasize how horrifically cruel animal testing is when citing really terrible studies at length. While he struck a conservationist tone in the last chapter, relating what we learned in the book to the effects of climate change on the ocean, I was surprised that the book paid literally no attention to the abysmal and shameful ways we treat these magnificent and complex individual creatures. Raising awareness about that would have made a lot more sense for a concluding chapter. The book is mostly well-written and even poignant at parts. I appreciated the incorporation of diving observation anecdotes alongside scientific studies. I’m generally skeptical about the breadth of information lab studies on animals can reveal, and some are just ipse dixit from flawed and horrifically cruel studies, so it’s refreshing to see them supplemented. This also makes the book more readable because the complex ideas and explanations about different cephalopod behavior and physiology becomes more tangible. I appreciated that the author seemed to make an effort to be less anthropocentric and to appreciate different capacities without the firm reference point always being an inevitably biased conception of human intelligence (however defined). In addition, the author’s care to distinguish subjective experience from self awareness was appreciated (a lack of self awareness does NOT mean that an animal can’t experience the world or feel pain). I recommend this book to anyone interested in sea life or the evolution of consciousness and the brain."

274,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7610691-maryjo,4,"I was expecting a book about octopuses, but Peter Godfrey-Smith is a philosopher by training and the book is more about how we understand consciousness, and how the questions change if we look outside a human frame. Cephalopods are particularly interesting because they represent a different evolutionary path, and their various embodiments are quite different from those of humans, primates and other mammals. Exploring evidence about how living organisms respond to their environment, and examining words like ""feeling"" and ""awareness"" Godfrey-Smith chooses the word sentience to frame his discussions of evolution consciousness over time and across species. Godfrey-Smith is himself a diver, and he has a great appreciation for the sea and sea creatures. The book is written in first person, full of his own observations of particular cephalopods. This is very engaging; at the same time the book is a serious engagement with provocative questions and scientific evidence. It may be more successful in raising questions rather than answering them, but as a non-biologist, I enjoyed following his thoughts. And there were many factual tidbits about cuttlefish and other marine creatures that were new to me. I listened to this as an audio book, but it might have been better to read it. "

The most impressive thing about this deeply impressive book is the way in which Godfrey-Smith is able to use reflections on the mind of the octopus as a spur towards a metacognitive study of the very nature of human thought and ideation itself. While the philosophical and biological concepts are frequently (pardon the pun) heady, the material in Other Minds is always presented in clear, accessible prose that allows even a layperson to comprehend both the meaning and the nature of the text. There's a scene that recurs in this book in which an octopus in an Australian ""Octopolis"" observed over a period of time by marine biologists leads a naturalist by the hand to its den in a gesture that transcends in some unknowable way the preconceived laws of connection between minds and species. In learning about the octopus in these pages, those who take the tentacle in their hands learn important things about what it means to be human. This book was a mind-blowing stunner of a read."
276,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59682834-jerry-pogan,3,"A very interesting read but I finished feeling like I need more information. Much of the book talked about the authors observations of the behavior of Octopus and the closely related Cuttlefish. This was interesting but most of his conclusions seemed to be more guesses as to why certain behaviors were observed as opposed to a more scientifically determined study. One of the more interesting discussions was about the intelligence of the Octopus and how far back in evolution they branch off from all other intelligent animals. They basically evolved almost completely separately and are probably the closest thing we will ever observe to an intelligent alien. Their brain is not necessarily centered in their head but also in their arms which makes the arms almost independent entities. Another interesting fact is their skin and ability to change color and the fact that they have light sensitive cells in the skin that may allow them to have a primitive form of seeing through their skin. They also have eyes similar to mammals which evolved separately. The book also touched on consciousness but I felt this was very inconclusive. All in all interesting but it makes me really want to read more about the Octopus, they are certainly fascinating animals."
277,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4583352-britta,3,"Choosing a rating for this book was really hard because the subject matter is so enthralling to me, but the writing was NOT. It read like an elevated attempt at a school paper by someone who did not get good marks in English composition class (any time an author uses ""next I will discuss"", I cringe. You don't need to say that if you write a proper transition! Alas, I'm a snob).That being said, the author isn't a scientist but a philosopher, so the approach of the book is a more detailed dive into the inner workings of ""self"" and consciousness, which is COOL. His candid accounts of interactions with cephalopods were my favorite parts because his excitement for the subject really comes through his writing. ...Sooo I'll forgive him for his crap writing skills because I still learned a ton from the book, like that Octopuses give each other high-fives to identify each other and cuttlefish have what appears to be REM sleep (mind blown).Obviously I'm biased because cephalopods are by far one of my favorite types of critter, but this book was really fun to read (bonus points for the pictures!). For all my whining about his writing, it was still a worthwhile read in my opinion. "

I knew next to nothing about cuttlefish, for instance, and Other Minds has made me curious for more. Ditto for octopus ""cities"" (of which there seem to be at least two that scientists routinely observe - Octopolis and Octlantis). The philosophical interludes, on the other hand, lost me completely. I'd give the book 3* rather than 4* if the rest of it wasn't so brilliant, but I can appreciate that, in the end, it all does come together - albeit painfully - to paint a picture that makes sense."
279,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48319145-clive-f,4,"Octupuses have eight legs, we all know that. How many hearts do they have? Turns out they have three. Now, how many brains? Well, it turns out the answer to that is complicated... very complicated. And that has huge implications for how smart we think octopuses might be, along with a few of their close relations like some squids, together known as cephalopods. It also starts to nudge into an even more interesting space: that of whether octopuses are conscious or not. Because if they are, the implications are huge, and that's what this book mainly sets out to explore:""Cephalopods are an island of mental complexity in the sea of invertebrate animals. Because our most recent common ancestor was so simple and lies so far back, cephalopods are an independent experiment in the evolution of large brains and complex behavior. If we can make contact with cephalopods as sentient beings, it is not because of a shared history, not because of kinship, but because evolution built minds twice over. This is probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.""It's a truly fascinating space to think about, and this book did a good job of introducing me to various aspects of it. The early chapters take you through the ancient evolutionary history that lead to both humans and the octopus. We go all the way back to the Ediacaran, from about 635 to about 542 million years ago. Life seems to have been very peaceful then, with creatures grazing on mats of vegetation in the early oceans. All sorts of weird things were out there:""body forms that have since been entirely abandoned by evolution – three-sided and four-sided designs, some with quilted arrangements of plant-like fronds.""Then some animal worked out that eating other animals gave you a lot more nutritional value than grazing, and we were in a whole new game. This is the Cambrian era of prehistory:""During the Cambrian the relations between one animal and another became a more important factor in the lives of each. Behavior became directed on other animals – watching, seizing, and evading. From early in the Cambrian we see fossils that display the machinery of these interactions: eyes, claws, antennae. These animals also have obvious marks of mobility: legs and fins. Legs and fins don’t necessarily show that one animal was interacting with others. Claws, in contrast, have little ambiguity.""One way to deal with this was to grow a hard shell, and hide within it, or to grow hard body parts and use them to leverage muscles. This was the path our ancestors chose. The other was that of the octopus:""An octopus has almost no hard parts at all – its eyes and beak are the largest – and as a result it can squeeze through a hole about the size of its eyeball and transform its body shape almost indefinitely. The evolution of cephalopods yielded, in the octopus, a body of pure possibility.""To use that possibility, the octopus has many more neurons than comparable creatures - about 500 million, close to the range of dogs, and very much larger than all other invertebrates. But these neurons aren't largely collected in one place, as with vertebrates:""When vertebrate brains are compared to octopus brains, all bets – or rather, all mappings – are off. There is no part-by-part correspondence between the parts of their brains and ours. Indeed, octopuses have not even collected the majority of their neurons inside their brains; most of the neurons are found in their arms.""This is where it starts to get weird. The arms have nearly twice as many neurons as the central brain. ""Each individual sucker on an octopus's arms may have 10,000 neurons to handle taste and touch. Even an arm that has been surgically removed can perform various basic motions, like reaching and grasping."" And still they are very smart - ""smart in the sense of being curious and flexible; they are adventurous, opportunistic"". Examples abound:""When vertebrate brains are compared to octopus brains, all bets – or rather, all mappings – are off. There is no part-by-part correspondence between the parts of their brains and ours. Indeed, octopuses have not even collected the majority of their neurons inside their brains; most of the neurons are found in their arms.""So how does this all work? The octopus, we discover, is ""suffused with nervousness; the body is not a separate thing that is controlled by the brain"" - the brain is the body, or perhaps better even to say the body is the brain. If it has a language, it seems to be a language of colour and patterns, for octopuses can also produce a remarkable range of colours and patterns on their body, changing these in a second or less if needed. They do this not only for camouflage, but also, so far as we can tell, to communicate with other octopuses. Our exploration of this has barely begun, as we gather data from octopuses in the wild, but it's certainly used for mating, and quite likely used for dominance displays. Finally, we touch on the question of why an octopus might need intelligence like this? Neurons are very expensive things to run, from an energy point of view. Many octopuses only live for two years. Why would such a creature need such a sophisticated capability? We do not yet know.This is a tantalizing book. The author, based on many hundreds of hours of personal observation in the ocean, and building on decades of work from others, makes a very strong case for octopuses as intelligent creatures, even as conscious creatures - as conscious as your family pet, perhaps. But different, too, with a distributed intelligence of a completely different kind than cats, dogs, and humans. There is much more we can learn about intelligence, about consciousness, about what it is to be human rather than a crab or a cat or a cephalopod, from these eight legged, three hearted, creatures with their distributed intelligence and language of colour.

Look no further.I was amazed by how far from my original expectations this book was. I thought I'd have on my hands a book about octopuses, but it is really about the ""deep origins of consciousness"" part much more so. Although it does also explains and refers consistently octopuses and other cephalopods, this is a good and easy reading of how consciousness may have evolved, how life may have evolved, how the brain have evolved and so on.The notes section alone will power further readings for years to come: the author provides detailed information of the bibliography used, from articles to books, with exerts from the book itself and clarifications of where it was based on.

There is a great description of how their nervous system differ from ours, but it lacks more discussion and what does that mean. In particular, I think a good deal of chapter 4 and all chapter 6 are just philosophical ramblings without much relation with the rest of the book. Something that also bothered me was that a good part of the evidence shown by the author consisted in anecdotes that he experienced. I think it is fine to use those to motivate and exemplify, but at some point you can't keep your thesis using only that. Finally, the book ends abruptly with a final lesson that we should conserve our oceans (which is fine), but without some summary or conclusion on the book content (which is bad). I think the idea of this book is really good, but the execution was done poorly."

284,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1390208-brent-ecenbarger,5,"Octopuses have an ability to adapt to the special circumstances of captivity and their interaction with human keepers...In New Zealand, an octopus took a dislike to one member of the lab staff, for no obvious reason, and whenever that person passed by on the walkway behind the tank she received a jet of half a gallon of water in the back of her neck. Shelly Adamo, of Dalhousie University, had one cuttlefish who reliably squirted streams of water at all new visitors to the lab, and not at people who were often around. In 2010, an experiment confirmed that giant Pacific octopuses can indeed recognize individual humans, and can do this even when the humans are wearing identical uniforms.If you're like me, that previous paragraph is enough to dig in to read a whole book about the amazing creature that is the octopus. I love the idea of an intelligent creature living on our planet that most people know nothing about, and Peter Godfrey-Smith has written a very well researched book about cephalopods, primarily the octopus but also squids and cuttlefish. Although large portions of the book don't deal with octopuses, Godfrey-Smith manages to explain why it is important to look at these organisms to learn not only about what they are capable of, but also what we can learn about the evolution of life on Earth and what intelligence and consciousness mean. Why octopuses though? The primary reason is that scientists believe that we can trace all life on Earth to early organisms hundreds of millions of years ago that branched off into numerous different paths that led to things like plants, animals, bacteria, etc. Of all the living organisms on Earth, advanced nervous systems can be found in three subsets, the first being animals, the second being arthropods, and the third being cephalopods. The cephalopods come from an entire different branch on that evolutionary tree, and are unique in their development of a nervous system on that branch. Considering that, the octopus could be compared to an alien life form, as we can look at an animal whose brain has evolved under an entirely different set of circumstances than the rest of the planet.I learned a lot about philosophy and evolution while reading this book, and I think most readers would gain similar new knowledge. For instance, all I knew about Pre-Cambrian history prior to reading this was that supposedly the Graboids from Tremors were around then. However, Godfrey-Smith explained that situation that the life forms in this era (the Ediacara) floated around in a pre-predator environment. Quite simply, early life forms were not hunting each other but instead scavenged (Godfrey-Smith refers to this as ""the Garden of Ediacara""). The result was an environment allowed mutations to thrive and a giant boom in variation of life forms to follow in the Cambrian era.In addition to reviewing studies on octopuses and preexisting literature, Godfrey-Smith frequently visits a location called Octopolis, one of the only confirmed habitats for multiple octopuses over several years. Throughout the book, I got a ton of great anecdotes about these amazing creatures both from the author's personal experience and scientific studies. Some of the interesting stuff I learned included that octopuses have distinct personalities that come out both in the wild and in lab settings. Also, the nervous system of the octopus is spread throughout the both the brain and the arms, meaning that even if you cut an arm off it can continue to function on its own afterward for a lengthy period of time. Godfrey-Smith describes this relationship as the brain being a musical conductor, but the arms are all jazz musicians; the brain sends a command, but the arms have great leeway and creative ability to make decisions and react accordingly. The color changing aspect of octopuses is discussed extensively. If you haven't watched video of their camouflage in effect underwater, stop reading this and hop on Youtube because they are natures greatest color changers. Scientists disagree as to if this is used at all for communication between animals; I came away with the impression that at a minimum they are used in expressing dominance or submission to other octopuses. What is amazing though is that octopuses are themselves colorblind, even though their eyes are very similar to human eyes in how they function. Much of the difficulty in knowing more about octopuses, or limiting how much one can learn, is the short lifespan of the animal. For the most part, they all live for about two years or less, an extremely short time for such an intelligent animal. There are a few exceptions, such as the nautilus (which can live ten times as long but is nowhere near as smart) and the deep sea Octopus which not only lives longer but can spend over four years just nurturing its eggs! This was the longest egg brooding period ever observed for a creature on Earth. As people become more aware of the intelligence of these creatures, additional studies are being performed. In 2011, it was learned that octopuses can recognize other individual octopuses. Another study seemed to indicate that octopuses can learn by watching others do something and not by doing it once themselves. Humans are able to have episodic memories of a particular event instead of how to do something. Studies show octopuses also have this high functioning capability. There are some great photos in this book as well (both color and black and white) and some helpful diagrams related to a variety of subjects. When the book gets into more philosophical issues, or discussions about biological evolution, it can get a bit text booky at times, but never for more than about 10 or 15 pages. Godfrey-Smith wisely centers all of his big ideas and conclusions on the octopus. Highly recommended."
285,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73548608-helio,4,"Appropiately enough this book has eight chapters. They are not always about octupi (the corrert term is octupuses). Some are about branches of life or development of different nervous systems or comparisons to baboons or historical accounts of octupi research. The mostly anecdotal information is interesting. For instance the author recounts three types of encounters: friendly-exploratory, aggresive-hostile and indifference. It was the last that bothered the author most - being ignored like some inanimate object. There was no attempt to explain the different interactions. Similarly with experiments some octupi learned to turn levers to gain food while others spit water at researchers. There was no delineating age, temprement nor gender to attribute the different behaviours. It might be a matter of some octugirls just wanted to have fun."

It discusses a wide variety of subjects concerning biology and philosophy, including the evolution of consciousness, the uniqueness of intelligence in octopuses and other cephalopods, and what it means to have a subjective experience as a living creature. I appreciated the author’s efforts to respect the animals he observed and their habitats, using minimally invasive methods to study the octopuses and cuttlefish. The photographs and personal anecdotes included made for a great balance with the scientific research and explanations."

There was just too much ""what does it feel like to be a..."" Many of the studies referenced were 50 or more years old and I guess I'm a sensitive, touchy-feely person but many of those studies were pain studies and I was turned off by the electric shock and arm crushing (but the author notes not too crushed !? WTH? Octopus have no bones but anyone reading this review has a soft appendage that would hurt even if only somewhat crushed) "

But the author sort of misses his focus - he sort of drifts into anecdotes instead of answering the questions about different types of minds that I was hoping he would set out to do in the book. So, after having finished, I sort of feel like this: 1) Yes, an octopus is an amazing creature. 2) I'm still not sure what is really different between a human mind and an octopus mind, except that humans have much more brain capacity. I wanted to know more of the actual build of the brain - for example, what would an octopus with similar brain capacity to ours look like? Do all clever minds think alike, or can there be great differences as to how intelligence functions?"

This book refutes at least the final sentence. Truly fascinating on multiple subjects, the book approaches big questions from a novel angle. The writing on general evolution, cephalopods, and consciousness is exemplary, explaining difficult subjects clearly without dumbing down concepts or getting tied up in arcane jargon. Well paced and with quite the twist towards the end (terms you usually here for novels) could not recommended strongly enough for anyone interested in intelligence, evolution, the mind, and the wonders of our fragile planet."

Smart, imaginative, witty, poetic, not condescending, and with a genuine love for the book's main subject: cephalopodes. It is impossible to read this book without developping a deep love for octopuses and cuttlefish.The way the author attempts to struggle with some of the biggest problems in the contemporary philosophy of mind is remarkable, even more so because the book is easily understandable by a moderately informed audience."

You can't so much with the Octopus. It represents a different evolution to the problem of constructing a big nervious system. This makes it ""the closest we're likely to get to meeting an intelligent alien"". The book is a mix of philioshopy, cognitive science, biology, and ethology. I'd say it is popular science, but you will get caught up in qualia and subjective experience and the like for brief periods. You'll learn a lot of octopus life, behaviour, and death.I loved it."
292,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4995129-richard,4,"Those looking for a solution to the philosophers' ""Hard Problem of Consciousness"" won't find it here. Godfrey-Smith's task is only to insist - through the medium of a lot of cool stories - that that we don't have a hope of understanding the (human) brain and mind until we have faced the fact that there are other kinds of minds. The same point has been made through the example of the corvids, but the octopus and its close relatives have both a higher level of mentality - including acute recognition of individuals and circumstances, the ability to take sides and deceive, and astonishing ingenuity - and a genuinely alien mentality. A swift read and lots of fun."

He doesn’t skip over steps, but describes the best theories of how consciousness has developed starting with the simplest of life forms, and he’s also able to engage with the philosophical questions that consciousness raises. He doesn’t have simple answers, but his stated intent is to help move the conversation forward onto new ground, and he does that very successfully.Full review: https://hannahgivens.wordpress.com/20..."
294,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally,5,"When I saw it was written by a philosophy professor, I almost got cold feet, fearing something abstract or reader unfrieldly. Not so! The author bases his remarks on his first hand experience with cephalopods in the wild as well as scholarship, and his writing on the evolution of consciousness and its relation to sentience and intelligence is a pleasure to read. He has great respect for the minds he is exploring and an expansive, open perspective while at the same time being analytical and precise. Recommended."
295,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88029385-naomi-russell-baugh,4,"This book is and isn’t about the octopus. This book is much more about consciousness and the evolutions of it’s mind in relations to our own and to others. Realistically I wanted more natural history and biology, and instead got a hell of a lot of anecdotes, tangents and philosophy. Which I really should have seen coming considering it sits within the philosophy section of my store. But still, I did enjoy the majority of this book. And I would recommend it to others. I personally just became horribly uninterested by the end. Naomi. "
296,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749243-wdmoor,5,"This is a book that will stick with you for a long time. It's not a feelgood aren't-octopuses-smart book, but serious look at the origins of consciousness.I must've reread each chapter two or three times, returned it to the library, then ordered my own copy from Amazon. Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness is a perfect winter read...highly recommended "
297,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31252158-dayton,4,"Cephalopods are fascinating, and there are some excellent octopus (and cuttlefish) anecdotes in here. There are also some very interesting ideas on consciousness, subjective experience, nervous systems, senses and evolution. I wish the result cohered better--many of the author's specific arguments were speculative and didn't feel terribly convincing, and it wasn't always clear what his point was--but definitely a lot to chew on."
298,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38396339-bastard-travel,4,"Octopuses are crazy smart, and they have an unsettlingly well-developed nervous system. Nobody knows why. Most intelligent animals are highly social, and the prevailing hypothesis is higher intelligence develops as a side effect of having to navigate increasingly convoluted social mores. Octopuses are territorial and cannibalistic, but smart enough to screw with us when we try to test their intelligence -- exactly like Hannibal Lecter. "
299,0374227764,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22082636-brian-beatty,5,"Wow!I'm an evolutionary biologist that primarily studies vertebrates, and very often use histology in my research. But the views on behavior of single cell organisms and the role of nervous systems in the metazoa just blew my mind. As a starting point to coming around to conceiving of how cephalopods could be fundamentally different, it just makes sense to explain this. Overall this has changed my outlook, and I'm very glad that I read it."
