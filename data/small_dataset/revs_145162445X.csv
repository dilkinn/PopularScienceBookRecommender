0,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Krauss has managed to draw an almost perfect normal curve (Bell Curve) with this book as far as engagement and content is concerned. The Start of the CurveIt starts slow by promising us a full whirlwind historic tour from Galileo to CMBR and beyond and takes its own sweet time getting to even Einstein and then dwells on the most known aspects of modern science as if no one has heard of all that before. The RiseThen as I was contemplating postponing the book for some future date, Krauss suddenly draws himself up to his full commanding ivory tower height and things suddenly get hard to comprehend. Now I was perked, this was what I was there with him for, after all.The Peak of the CurveMaybe it is because that was the only part of the book which I knew not enough about. I had read about the fact that the only way to explain the universe is to postulate an inflationary scenario for the early universe but Krauss puts it in terms which no other author which I have read has done. He makes it beautiful, breath-taking and completely believable that in a few micro seconds the universe expanded by an order of magnitude of 24 and attained the final shape that we see now! And he systematically charts out how this theory was derived based on observed size and density of universe, based on postulated energy of empty space, based on curvature of the universe and on the nature of acceleration of distant 'standard candles'. During this part of the book as well as the part in which he lists out the reasons for why the universe we live in is flat and accelerating and dominated by energy (as against mass, ie, by repulsive force of acceleration than by attractive force of gravity) and then slam-dunks it in by explaining how all this can only be explained by an inflationary early universe.The DipJust as I was bristling with all the new knowledge and information and thinking of the rave review this book is gonna get and about how knowledgeable I was going to be as I finish it, Krauss grinds the journey to a screeching halt as far as science is concerned. He takes a major left turn and plunges into an entire chapter on speculating if scientists wo trillion years into the future can ever find out the true nature of the universe. The anser is no. All evidence of the origins of universe would be lost or obscured by then and Kraus concludes that it is possible that even with the best scientific method, minds and far advanced technology, it is posible to reach the wrong conclusions. In face no matter how advanced that civilization is they will never know of a world beyond their own meta-galaxy! This is a wonderful thought an Richard Dawkins comments extensively on it in the afterword but surely it didn't warrant so many pages in al already small book? But in spite of the boring nature of the chapter, it is sill a very profound one - All our attempts to understand anything is limited by the presence of physical evidence, so we must also think about what might already have been obscured from us in the 13.odd billion years of the universe and this is especially true if the inflationary hypothesis is correct because an inflation like that would be like a flood over a crime scene. So the chapter is about humility even though Krauss tried to make it into an argument about why we live in a very special time, the only time we can wonder why it is special. This is again a clear opening to fit a god-of-the-gaps into. I am amazed at how many new avenues Krauss has opened up in this book. Is he secretly against Dawkins and Hitchens?The Lower EndAnd then he shifts into trying to explain the universe in terms of the Anthropic Principle which I have a tough time accepting even though I agree with the sturdy logic of it. I just feel it is Wrong, that is all, to explain things by saying that we wouldn't be here to talk about it if it were not so and that is the answer.The interest is still held fo a while as he does a critical analysis of string theory and concludes that it is a wonderful mathematical and theoretical edifice but it has proven/predicted not one single observation in 25 years or so and hence is more or less a dead-end. He plainly asks the common reader to get over the string theory hype and stop talking about String Theory to show how knowledgeable you are. If anyone talks of string theory and TOE to you, count on the fact that he heard about some stuff during the Great Hype and never bothered enough to understand or keep up-to-date.The Long Tail of the CurveAnd then comes the low point of the book, which Krauss probably put in only to gain traction with Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. The long rant about religious claims and about their argument about ""How can something come out of nothing"" - the only answer is that it does, it still is happening and something can also go back into nothing in the future. So what does that prove? Not much I think except to accept that the universe is right strange, brotha. Then comes the epilogue about how science has to be respected and all that Carl Sagan stuff as science as a candle in the dark, the normal curve tending towards zero on the tail now, reader barely awake.The AnomalyAnd finally, the book winds down with a poetic afterword by Dawkins registering a major upturn anomaly in the normal curve towards the very end. (any good normal distribution will have the outliers after all).TakeawaysThe reader can come way from the book with a feeling that he now knows some 'deep' quantum kick-ass fundamentals without having been stretched as much as, say, a Brian Greene would do to you in The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory. This must be the reason for the sudden popularity of the book and comparisons with 'The Origin of Species' and with A Brief History of Time as the next great opening of windows by science and as the final nail in the coffin that Darwin built for religion. Richard Dawkins sure sounds very pep in his afterword, as if, now that this book is out, no more argument is possible.I am not to sure about that of course. Ultimately the book is making the claim that everything we can measure and see and know anything at all about, ever, is just 1% of the universe. That is to say that physics can never know anything about 99% of what exist in the universe. Now, that is dangerous territory and can play right into the hands of religious aficionados. I wonder why Dawkins was elated by the book and not feverishly going back to the drawing board to counter all the hundreds of nonsensical faith-based claims that can crop up from this information.Final WordIn the end, I liked the book. It was worth the read for that amazing middle portion and for the analysis on string theory. but to compare it with The Origin of Species as a landmark work or to talk as if it is the definitive word in the argument strikes me as hyperbole. It is a well-written work accessible to the lay-reader that tries to explain how much modern science does not know. If that fills you with a sense of wonder, this is the book for you.Post ScriptPS. I really don't get why Ian McEwan turned up to comment on the cover. Some mix up? Hmm..."
1,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"Point/CounterpointA Nice Brief Account Of The Inflation/Î©/Dark Energy ThreadKrauss, who was personally involved in some of the work and knows all the key actors, does a fine job of summarising progress in cosmology over the last fifteen years. The most significant development, needless to say, has been the discovery of Dark Energy. Krauss presents the background and shows why it wasn't quite as unexpected as has often been made out; he was one of the few people to have predicted it, though it sounds like he could hardly believe his own prediction. He is also good on showing you how solid the evidence is. To people outside the field, it isn't at all obvious that the case is a strong one, since it depends on ultra-precise measurements of the distances to the most remote galaxies, something that is anything but trivial to do. Krauss straightforwardly says that he had doubts at first and urged his colleagues not to jump on the bandwagon; but, after a while, so much material had accumulated that it was almost impossible to explain the facts in any other way.Holy Fucking Shit, This Book Just Blows My MindOh My God, I was going to say, but Krauss, in this stunning book, gives you solid evidence that God doesn't exist. The latest advances in astronomy have uncovered a bunch of amazing new facts. Believe it or not, we now know the age of the universe to four significant figures!! Yes, the universe is 13.72 billion years old - not 13.71 billion or 13.73 billion!!!But that's just the starting point in Professor Krauss's whirlwind tour of all human knowledge. He tells you how 99% of the universe is invisible dark matter and dark energy. Incredibly, there's exactly enough invisible stuff to make space perfectly flat. And that means... wait for it... that the universe could only have started from nothing! Yes, you heard me. If things started with nothing and got blown up by inflation (don't worry, he tells you what it is), then you'd have exactly what we see today!So who needs God? Not Richard Dawkins, who wrote the cool afterword!"
2,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,5,"I guess everyone could have predicted that I would give this book 5 stars, if not at least agree with it's theories. Being a forthright atheist and scientist I was bound to love this book right? Well that argument could be made, but I refer you to my ratings for other atheist works such as ""The God Delusion"", which I must admit deserves a reread and possibly an updated higher score in retrospect, and Hitchens' ""God is Not Great"" which I thought was relatively poorly argued due to being essentially ""look at all these bad things that religion makes people do"", which anyone with any education will conclude with ""no shit Hitch, but what about whether God could and may exist?"".But this book isn't really an atheist agenda, as it only answers the question of how a universe could come into existence from nothing, no energy, no trigger, no cause. This is a question I ask as a scientist an non-believer, but it also gives an answer that happens to contradict most theological thought. Coincidence? Well I guess most theories based upon the observed data over the last few centuries have done this and in effect God has been pushed further and further away until has has been left with the role of the spark. Now Lawrence is taking away that role and it pisses people off.I guess that even though 95% of this book is purely cosmological with the only agenda is to illuminate, it is hard to not go into a science vs theology argument here as the reviews for this book, and I would surmise ""The God Delusion"" follow a similar pattern. Poor reviews for this book tend to fit into the categories:* I did not get it (it was written with too much jargon and with a steep learning curve)* People who are offended that he had a go at philosophers.* Religious people who tend to say ""While the cosmology was interesting his conclusions were ill-found and the afterword by Richard Dawkins was just offensive.""I guess you could also argue that good reviews tend to be from scientists and atheists.So despite being one of the best atheist arguments I have read in print, it is not going to achieve any change at all in the religious 'head-in-the-sand' type. If you are religious, don't read this book. Don't try and argue against it as you will look the fool. If you are an athiest or a scientist give it a go. It is a hard slog in sections, but it is rewarding.I adored this book as it educated, enlightened and reconfirmed the power of science and reason. "
3,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,4,"One thing is certain, however. The metaphysical 'rule', which is held as an ironclad conviction by those whom I have debated the issue of creation, namely that ""out of nothing nothing comes,"" has no foundation in science. Arguing that it is self-evident, unwavering, and unassailable is like arguing, as Darwin falsely did, when he made the suggestion that the origin of life was beyond the domain of science by building an analogy with the incorrect claim that matter cannot be created or destroyed. All it represents is an unwillingness to recognize the simple fact that nature may be cleverer than philosophers or theologians.I'm not going to even attempt to figure out if what Lawrence Krauss is saying is scientifically correct. I have no way of knowing, even though his is a pop-science book, many of the arguments went flying over my head like some high velocity particle being expelled from a black hole (with apparently no need for high energy because of some properties of black holes, gravity, quantum stuff, particles and other things that I can just nod along with). I could whine that the lack of footnotes, or citations to where I could read the articles dealing with this stuff is missing, but I have a feeling that a) it's easy enough to do a bit of library research to uncover any of the articles but b) if I tried to read any of them my brain might collapse into itself like some unstable quantum universe under the pressure of my own ignorance. One reviewer I noticed was turned off by the constant return to 'bashing' big G and his believers around. This reviewer believes that Krauss should have laid off a little and just let the science speak for itself. Fuck them, I say. Bash away. Yeah, the believers might not be the ones who will ever read this book, but throw rocks at their flimsy and childish beliefs. Why? Because we (I mean I) live in a country where more people believe in angels than believe in evolution and I work in a bookstore where more people will probably buy the book that has the prayer for ridding your life of satanic demon birds in it than will buy this book. Any chance you get throw intellectual rocks at the fuckers, because guess what? They are throwing rocks all the time, and they are name-calling and attempting to push their medieval bullshit fear mongering on everyone. That said, it's not like there is name calling going on in this book, it's just the author is pointing out that there is no reason to revert to creation myths to explain things, science is doing a fairly good job at chiseling away at a fairly comprehensive picture of the universe without the words, let there be light being said and logos permeating the cosmos. All this aside though, the book is really interesting. I would do an awful job at even trying to paraphrase the arguments and discoveries that points to everything in the universe was created out of quantum fluctuations in 'nothingness', or in the empty space where until fairly recently everyone thought was just empty space, but now scientists are realizing is filled with 'stuff' that is a whirlpool of strange goings ons and contains more dark energy than all of the observable energy in the whole big, gigantic, universe. Want some of the details on how this is so? Read the book (I sound like the old commercial from the 1980's for that Scientology tract). It's a fascinating idea, and sucks even a little more 'meaning' out of our existence, what if we really are only here because of some particles popping into existence at the mind boggling strange quantum level and because they went through an inflationary period in the mind boggling tiny amount of time before they would normally pop back out of existence (apparently at this level things do pop in and out of existence fairly often, how exactly scientists know this I can't say, but it sounded convincing to me) and because of that everything we can possibly see and tons of stuff that is so far away from us that we will never be able to see even using the most powerful technologies we have was formed. Fucking incredible, right? Maybe not the most comforting, it's not going to reassure you that you really are important and that something bigger than yourself loves you, but really more beautiful and amazing than the idea that some jealous being floating around the ether decided on a whim to create the world and then lingered around for billions of years before throwing some gigantic temper tantrums on the equivalent of a few grains of sand on the gigantic beach that would be 'his' creation. The ideas in this book are 'dangerous', if I was feeling sleazy and wanted to dupe some stupid motherfuckers, I would set out to take the basic premises of this book and concoct some New Age book using a few scientific facts and make a Secret-esque book about the power to create something from nothing. I'll leave that to people with less morals and more ambition than me though. There is a lot of ground in this book to misunderstand and trample around on to make all kinds of nonsensical 'metaphysical' extrapolations from.And speaking of metaphysics, without the quotes and not in the way that most people use the word (when people generally ask for the metaphysics books they aren't looking for philosophy they are looking for New Age), the ideas in this book are like a giant wedge to shove into classic philosophical arguments. If the idea of nothing can come from nothing is overthrown by science what does that do to whole lines of philosophical reasoning? This is one of the basic tenets of Western Philosophy, it's what you learn in Philosophy School, it's how you help shape logical arguments about the Big Questions. All the way back to Aristotle (and beyond, but I'm going to stop there, it gets different when you step back to Plato, and the Pre-Socratics, well just forget it), it's this basic idea that works to create his own speculation about creation (he sidestepped the question in a way by saying the universe must be eternal since there could be no prime-mover), and following his logic it's one of those tools that most philosophy people carry around in their mental toolbox to help them call bullshit on arguments with weak premises. Krauss likes to take pot-shots at philosophers, too. And this is probably not a bad thing. I can imagine a Zizek getting a hold of a few of the ideas in this book and running rampant through Lacan and Hitchcock with them to make up some unsettling and absurd claims, but lets consider him and his ilk theorists, and not philosophers for the sake of this review, but it would be fascinating (and unrealizable, because of the whole space time continuum and all) to have honest to goodness heavy-weight philosophers take this kind of knowledge and re-work it into their own views of the universe. What would an Aristotle or a Spinoza be able to do with their own philosophies with the added benefit of years and years of scientific discovery at their disposal? I'm not saying they would advance our knowledge necessarily beyond what we have now, but what avenues of thought would they go down by knowing more about the physical world then the time they lived in? Or, more realistically, would these great philosophers not hang their head in shame if they saw that their works were still being read and certain arguments of theirs still being wielded even in the face of scientific discoveries that led them to be obsolete, did any of these philosophers ever want to be just accepted as blind dogma? I'm losing a bit of control on this review. So I'll sum up, the world is strange and beautiful and we are more likely than not just an insignificant part of it, but we are observers of it and we should be open to understanding it as it is, even if it's not the most comforting version of the world that we might want, just because it Is and there is nothing else.

4,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"There is a deep sense of curiosity in most of us on how the universe came to be. If we manage to determine that, it would be the pinnacle of human intellect & achievement, I think. Lawrence argues in the book how science has progressed enough to explain how the universe grew from âNothingâ. A note of warning though â this âNothingâ assumes the existence of space and the laws of physics already being in place. This (as the author notes as well), is not the âNothingâ many of us will assume this to be. The absolute âNothingâ which some or many of us understand differently also finds some limited discussion towards the end of the book.The book traces the progress we have made in uncovering the mysteries of the universe â and with each new discovery, the role of God diminishes. Through the book, Lawrence expectedly takes several digs at theology. He states that scientific facts should not be ignored, and a âGod of the gapsâ (attributing what science is yet to explain to God) is a poor concept as it in any case diminishes the role of God as understood by religion. I agree and think most people do accept this, but still find meaning in religion for personal growth and treat (or should as Joseph Campbell advises) a lot of what is stated in religious texts metaphorically (also Advaita Vedanta treats the concept of God very differently). Scientific evidence is very strong (such as with the cosmic microwave background radiation) that there was a big bang, the universe went through a period of rapid expansion, and matter was created leading to what we see today.I found the concepts of the flat, closed and open universe to be fascinating. The discussion around this and the implications for the future of the universe makes for very engrossing reading. We are most likely in a flat universe (though this is not conclusive) â light does not curve and the universe may not roll back onto itself. The author mentions that we are at the best possible time to determine the secrets of the universe, since as we go on â the expansion would tear apart galaxies and greatly diminish the remnants of the big bang. This is interesting â indicating we should be investing more in cosmology now.As one would expect, it is not that the book has all the answers â after all science itself does not yet. The creation of the universe from nothing or the possibility of a multiverse finds some discussion towards the end of the book. There is some barely disguised disdain for string theory â which I share as well since it comes as force fitted, excessively complex and detached from reality to me. I found parts of the book to be a bit dense / less readable, nor did I find much of the humor the synopsis of the book mentions. The book is intellectually stimulating and does well to bring advances in cosmology together in a crisp narrative."
5,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a short, entertaining and informative book, written by a leading cosmologist. Lawrence Krauss describes, step by step, the observational evidence for the expansion of the universe, the existence of dark matter, and dark energy. He clearly describes the differences between a closed, open, and a flat universe, and shows the the reasons why we probably live in a flat universe. I had never understood before reading his explanation, how the spatial scales of variability of the cosmic microwave background radiation proves that our universe is flat. In a flat universe, space is in Euclidean geometry, and light rays travel in straight lines. The universe will not implode upon itself in the distant future. He shows the evidence for the big bang theory--quite a lot of evidence is behind the theory--I had no idea. Scientists claim that the universe has expanded for 13.72 billion years since the big bang: How do they figure it so precisely, to four significant figures? Krauss explains this very nicely.Krauss shows a way out of the anthropic principle, that is, that the universe's characteristics were chosen to be ""just right"" for the production of galaxies, stars, earth, and life. He shows that the idea of multiple universes is not so far-fetched, if one defines the universe as that region of space that is causally connected.Krauss adds a subtle, dry humor to his text. For example, the title of the sixth chapter is The Free Lunch at the End of the Universe, a bow to the title of the book The Restaurant at the End of the Universe by Douglas Adams. So what is the free lunch? As the universe is expanding, the density of energy remains constant. That is because for any galaxy in a flat universe, its positive energy of motion is exactly balanced by its negative energy of gravitational attraction. Truly ""empty"" space is unstable--small quantum fluctuations give rise to the creation of matter, and at the same time conserve energy. Krauss quotes Yogi Berra, ""The future ain't what it used to be."""
6,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19470614-lilo,4,"As a layperson, I donât feel qualified to review a scientific book written by a renowned professor of theoretical physics. But here are a few thoughts I had during and after reading this book:Upfront I must confess that I did not fully understand the contents. What, for instance, is a âflat universeâ? O.k., you can blow up a balloon, and the more you blow it up, the less curvature its surface will have. Fine! But will it ever get totally flat? Just try it. Iâll bet you anything that it will burst before it gets anywhere near to be flat. So why is Professor Krauss talking about a flat universe? We canât be there yet. And what would happen if we ever got near there? Would our universe bust, or would it ignore all predictions? Taking from my meager recollections of what I ever learned in math, the curvature would get infinitely close to flat but would never reach it. Correct me if I am wrong. So whatâs all this talk about a flat universe? I donât get it.There is also a lot of talk about what Nothing really means. The experts of different fields of science, philosophy, and theology donât seem to be able to agree on how Nothing needs to be defined. Well, I canât help them there. Theyâll have to figure it out between themselves. Is Nothing still Nothing when it has the potential to create Something? Maybe this Nothing contains Something after all. And is Nothing equivalent to empty space, or is it something different? Somewhere in this book it says that empty space pops up from Nothing. Now, this had me really confused. If Nothing and empty space are the same, then Nothing must pop up from Nothing. Well, this is beyond me. Trying to comprehend this, my brain feels like empty space or rather like a black hole.Talking about black holes: I had always been under the impression that whatever matter gets too close to a black hole will be sucked into it, and not even the smartest theoretical physicist knows what awaits it there. No scientist claims to know whatâs on the other side of a black hole. (Thatâs, at least, last I heard.) And now Professor Krauss tells me that there is a virtual particle escaping when a pair of positive and negative particles reaches the event horizon of a black hole. And whatâs worse, the particle that flies off to infinity takes away its twinâs energy. This messes up the law of conservation of energy and, over time, results in the black hole being deprived of more and more energy until it finally disappears out of existence. Well, maybe I got this all wrong. I wouldnât notice anyway if a black hole were missing on the starry sky.Btw, it was new to me that our universe only came to be because of a one-in-a-billion impurity of equal matches of matter and antimatter during the Big Bang. Without this impurity, matter and antimatter would have equaled each other out in a matter of split seconds or minutes or hours or a few thousand hundred of years. (I donât quite remember, but what does this matter when we are talking about the immense age of our universe, which, I learned, is exactly 23,73 billions of years old.) In other words: Not only we but everything in our whole universe is a product of some pollution. This was quite a shock to me. Yet I was somewhat comforted by the fact, which Professor Krauss has pointed out, that however our universe came to be, we are all made of stardust.You see, that even though this book is a bit over my head, I certainly learned Something.I must say, however, that I have a beef with this book. Yet let me start from the beginning. No, not from the Big Bangâonly from the beginning of my writing here. I should have told you upfront that Professor Krauss is trying hard to convince you, the reader, that our universe did NOT NEED a creator (or more likely even, did NOT HAVE a creator). And Richard Dawkins, who wrote the epilogue, is literally preaching that there is no God behind the Big Bang. I, on the other hand, assume that there IS, even though I do not believe in a personalized God, as He is portrayed in the bible and in all religions (maybe with the exception of Buddhism, which is actually less a religion and more a philosophy.) What I assume is a force behind the Big Bang, which is a Something and Not a Nothing.Well, who am I to argue with renowned scientists, such as Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins? Compared to their high-caliber cannon of a brain, my brain is only a BB gun. Yet let me point out that how ever much Professor Krauss and Professor Dawkins know, there is still more that they donât know. So for instance, they (as well as other theoretical physicists) havenât got the slightest clue what the so-called dark energy of empty space is (which makes up for about 70% of all the energy in the universe). Neither do they know too much about parallel universes they claim exist. (Well, Iâll forgive them this because I know even less about parallel universes.) So for all they donât know, they are IMHO a bit too sure that our universe (as well as an infinite number of parallel universes) came from Nothing and not from Something.Now with all due respect to Professors Krauss and Dawkins, I would like you, the reader, to consider that my little BB gun of a brain might be right on target, while Professor Kraussâs and Professor Dawkinâs high-caliber cannons of brains might be shooting in the wrong direction.For a scientific review of this book, please read Ramaâs review athttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."

8,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,3,"Description: A wildly popular lecture now on YouTube has attracted almost a million viewers. One question in particular has been at the center of religious and philosophical debates about the existence of God, and it's the supposed counterargument to anyone who questions the need for God. As Krauss argues, scientists have, however, historically focused on other, more pressing issues such as figuring out how the universe actually functions, which can ultimately help us to improve the quality of our lives. In a cosmological story that rivets as it enlightens, pioneering theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss explains the groundbreaking new scientific advances that turn the most basic philosophical questions on their heads. One of the few prominent scientists today to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss reveals that modern science is addressing the question of why there is something rather than nothing, with surprising and fascinating results. The staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories are all described accessibly in A Universe from Nothing, and they suggest that not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing. That grrramazon description rather defeats the need for the book - watch out! Bezos and his lucre hunting cronies will be after you...Yep - I've dumped the audio book and opted for the youtube lecture instead.Had great fun with this: recommended."
9,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,3,"2.5 StarsThe idea of a an Unmoved Mover or better still a First Cause is fascinating. Just to think that everything has a cause(s) which itself has a cause(s) takes one to a journey backward which we may well be ill equipped to take. This book didn't do much in that domain however, but it rather explained our recent understanding of the cosmos and how from ""nothingness"" (though with quantum fluctuation which makes the whole idea of Krauss' ""nothingness"" problematic) a whole universe can come into existence. Frankly, I couldn't help finding the title inappropriate . However, it helped to clear some misunderstandings that I had about the multiverse and the inflation, though the examples he used were not-so-brilliant. But, I was disappointed with the book because it made serious attacks against philosophy which in my view were unfounded or at best irrelevant especially that he mentions in this very book how Einstein (apparently one of his heroes) was influenced by Spinoza. Sean Carroll beautifully put it while commenting on Krauss' attacks on philosophy:""The point of philosophy is not to be âusefulâ to science, any more than the point of mycology is to be âusefulâ to fungi""."
10,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4595550-simcha-york,3,"Lawrence Krauss's A Universe from Nothing appears to have been done a serious disservice by the author, the editor, or both in that what would otherwise be a decent enough (though not particularly groundbreaking) work of popular science has been press-ganged into the tired ranks of writings on the God Wars. While I haven't yet read a book from either side of this debate that adds anything really worthwhile to a discussion which is largely sophmoric and whose actors seem to spend most of their time stumbling over one anothers' metaphors, this book is particularly disappointing in that it is built around the kernel of a much more promising work that really shouldn't have deigned to stoop to the silliness exhibited by both the New Athiests and their detractors.Krauss, like all good writers of popular science, has an infectuous enthusiasm for his field of knowledge. He also has a fairly good eye for compelling detail and an ability to take very complex concepts and present them in a manner that is lucid and accessible to those of us without advanced degrees in physics. That said, there is nothing in this book that will be particularly new to the avid reader of popular science. Even the title theme (a universe rising up from ""nothing"") was covered, though in somewhat less interesting detail, in Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow's The Grand Design. And like that work, this present book suffers from the author's attempts to wade into the waters of philosophy and metaphysics, in which he quickly finds himself out of his depths.The book's subtitle (Why There is Something Rather than Nothing) is a bit misleading, in that this question is not actually addressed by the book. Or, it is addressed, but only through a bit of semantic sleight-of-hand, by which Krauss sets his own terms for what he means when he uses the word ""nothingness"" and then goes on to explain not only how something can come from ""nothing"" but how it could well be that something must come from ""nothing."" All of which is quite interesting in its own right. Unfortunately, Krauss tries to pass this off as equivalent to the metaphysical question as to why their is something rather than nothing (to be honest, it is difficult to tell if Krauss is being disengenuous here or simply sloppy in his thinking). With regard to Krauss's concepts of ""nothingness,"" one can't help but recall one of the best-known lines from The Princess Bride: ""You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.""In short, A Universe from Nothing would likely have been a better, more focused book had it contented itself with being a work of popular science exploring some of the more fascinating things that physicists are discovering about the emergence and ultimate fate of our universe. That it attempts to also situate itself in the growing canon of popular books on atheism feels like a tacked-on marketing ploy. And such a ploy is the only thing that can explain the unfortunate inclusion of the Afterword by Richard Dawkins, which is so obsequious and hyperbolic in its barely-pubescent fanboy glee that I am not sure who should be more embarrassed - Dawkins for having written it, or Krauss for making himself look like a self-congratulatory schmuck by allowing it to appear in his book."
11,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,2,"This book failed short of my expectations. The subject was interesting but its exposition lacked clarity due to inconsistencies of all kinds. Regarding the semantic ones, allow me to paraphrase the author: There is no such thing as 'nothing' because 'nothing' is 'something', namely 'nothing' is 'empty space' that is not really empty but 'a boling brew of virtual particles that we cannot see directly'. And, though nothing can travel faster than c, about 70% of that seemingly empty space, termed as 'dark energy', carries the visible galaxies apart from each other at superluminal speed. As for other inconsistencies and flaws, let me name just a few:The references to equations with no equations were of no help for better comprehension.Though it was clear to me that the author was trying to explain the contradictory estimates of the geometry of the observable universe by measuring its curvature directly versus assessment of its mass density, the presentation and the pertinent illustrations for the closed, open and the so-called 'flat' universe left me baffled and made me re-read the relevant explanation in The Perception of Space... and its Measurement. I felt forced to google for somewhat clearer explanation of the mystery of 'dark matter' versus 'dark energy'.The intriguing hypothesis that the Big Bang resulted from a quantum fluctuation left me craving for a better exposition, too.On the plus side, bearing in mind that I haven't read many books on cosmology, I found the book informative. I learned about some engrossing facts, including the pioneering work of the American astronomer Vera Rubin and her colleagues in the early 1970s, the BOOMERANG experiment in 1997 and the WMAP experiment in 1997, and a few more.As for the parts against the existence of God, if I were a theist I would find the author's arguments unconvincing."
12,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"I found Kraussâs book totally engaging. His style is challenging but not overwhelming. His arguments for how the universe was created from ânothingâ were convincing. The critical term is ânothingâ. What nothing is may seem obvious, but Krauss shows us why it isnât. He takes us back to the very beginning, the Big Bang. How did it start: Quantum fluctuations, false vacuum or just a potentiality? So something if no more than physical rules for the event to originate seem to have existed. Although Krauss suggests that these rules or potentialities could also have spontaneously arisen. But there is no reason to believe that such spontaneous eruptions are a onetime event. This brings us to the multiverse spawned from continually bubbling inflation or existing in other dimensions such as those described by string theory. Another answer is God. Like Krauss I am not a fan of what he calls âGod of the gapsâ, the insertion of God to explain things we donât understand in the physical world. Any explanation would have to invoke the eternal to avoid the question of First Cause. The author brought up Aristotleâs idea that God is eternal pure thought who did not create the world and does not intervene. Of course, Aristotleâs idea would not be compatible with todayâs major religions. Krauss discusses many other issues. He offers a detailed explanation of why our universe is flat and why that is important to us. He digs into what are perhaps the two biggest mysteries - dark matter and dark energy. We donât know what they are. If particles responsible for dark matter could be discovered, the Big Bang and the universeâs future might be clarified. Dark energy provides another take on nothingness, in this case empty space. Quantum mechanics dictates that there is no such thing. It is filled with virtual particles that come and go too quickly to track but impart energy to space. This dark energy maintains the energy density of space as it expands while the density of ordinary matter diminishes overwhelming gravity. Thus over trillions of years the universe will dissipate into an amorphous sea of particles, a fate that clearly disturbs the author. Perhaps a better understanding of dark energy would lead to a different outlook. Krauss painstakingly makes the case for his beliefs. I found myself going back and reading many sections again to get to the bottom of his arguments. The depth of this book made it an enjoyable process. Even though I have read about these topics before, Kraussâs explanations were enlightening. A casual reader could benefit picking up the gist of Kraussâs views, but I think this book will be appreciated the most by the reader with a deep interest in the subject. So for me a clear five stars."
13,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book surprised me with its readability. I didn't feel like I was an average 5th grader taking a university course in physics ALL the time, although I do admit that somethings were above my head. If I ever want to learn anything outside of my current capability, obviously it's not going to come easy. This was very accessible though.""Quantum fluctuations, which otherwise would have been completely invisible, get frozen by inflation and emergy afterward as density fluctuations that produce everything we can see! If we are all stardust, it is also true, if inflation happened, that we all, literally, emerged from quantum nothingness"". (p.98)The other startling conclusion is that we live in a day and age where it is still possible to measure evidence of the Big Bang and light can still travel from galaxy to galaxy. A few trillion years down the line, this will not be possible. It will only be possible to know about the mega-galaxy that the cluster the Milky Way belongs to will have merged with. The other galaxies and stars will have sped away from us, beyond an observable distance. Well, I never thought of that before!I am quite bothered by light pollution, but not enough to regularly travel into the wilderness and look at the stars. I should take the time. Ponder the fact that we live in a special time, when the mysteries of the universe can still be considered, theorized about and proven by observation. I haven't seen the Milky Way since I was 10 years old, much less any smudge of a galaxy which isn't the one I live in. My knowledge of the sky is limited to the ability of telling stars from planets, but that doesn't deter me from enjoying it."
14,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63873525-alex-j-o-connor,0,"A great book outlining the history of cosmology. I found it got a little hard to follow near the end, but cleared up for a satisfying conclusion. It regularly hints at Krauss' atheism, which although is perfectly justified I feel may alienate agnostic or theistic readers. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody who has no interest in physics whatsoever, as you'll be introduced to new concepts that require a bit of thinking. If, however, you are a science enthusiast of any kind, this book is a must have."
15,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"My understanding of this book perfectly traced the arc of the Big Bang and expanding universe. An initial burst of inspiration followed by a rapid expansion of ideas about quarks, quantum mechanics, general relativity, dark matter and dark energy, and then a sudden reversal and contraction as the book strays from the fascinating early ideas and collapses in a chaotic discussion of how science and reason are not compatible with religious beliefs (anyone who is reading this book is probably already in that camp), and how the various schools of thought among cosmologists are constantly shifting as more experiments, data, and theories are digested and debated. In particular, the discussion of string theory was too precursory given the complexity of that admittedly difficult and abstract line of thought. In the end, I was left with a sense that the true origins of the universe remain a mystery, particularly the question of whether quantum fluctuations in a vacuum really could trigger a Big Bang and our current universe (or multiverses if you prefer that theory), along with the related question of whether the current laws of physics have always been a constant or whether they could have developed differently in other universes, what were the initial conditions that existed before the singularity occurred (of course there was likely ânothingâ since at that point there was supposedly no time or space), and finally the idea that our knowledge of the universe will actually fade in the future as the universe expands to the point where all galaxies will become too distant from each other even for light to reach each other, and may eventually collapse back into themselves. And all along I just though it was âturtles all the way downâ.In the early and middle part of the book, which I liked best, Lawrence Krauss describes the Big Bang, namely the singularity in which quantum fluctuations in a vacuum before space and time existed led to a sudden and exponential expansion in the universe, in which a slight imbalance between matter and antimatter allowed for the eventual formation all the matter and galaxies, stars and planets that we can now observe in the visible universe. And by studying the redshift of distant galaxies, we can also measure their distances and test various theories about whether the universe is open (forever expanding), flat (perfectly balanced in its present state), or closed (will eventually stop expanding, reverse course, and contract back into a singularity). Krauss also discusses CMBR (cosmic microwave background radiation) and how it reveals the initial conditions of the early universe. This is by far the most interesting and accessible part of the book.To sum up, although the book is promoted as an accessible book discussing the origins of the universe from nothing, I would say it was only partly successful, and mostly in the early going. I also read Stephen Hawkingâs A Briefer History of Time and The Grand Design (both written âwithâ Leonard Mlodinow) earlier and found the former to be a more understandable beginners approach, but the latter to be so watered down for the average Joe interested in quantum theory (wonder how many of them are out there) as to be somewhat insulting. I still have on the TBR shelf Brian Greenâs The Elegant Universe and Lee Smolinâs The Trouble with Physics, with the former being a major proponent of string theory and the latter being a debunking of that whole school of thought, but I wonder if that will just confuse me further.Iâm still looking for the right balance of clarity, accessibility, and readability to improve my understanding of concepts that boggle even the most brilliant scientific minds out there, but am starting to think that this is really asking way too much of any one book. If anyone has any suggestions, especially Manny or Brendon, Iâm receptive."
16,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5420722-derek,2,"I found this book very frustrating. In the first place, Krauss spends far too much time God-bashing, instead of just sticking to the science. Fine, he doesn't believe that God created the universe, but there's absolutely no good reason to even bring it into a discussion of how our universe has been created from nothing.In any case, ultimately, his arguments seem no better than a belief in a supreme being as creator. Krauss waves his hands and tells us that most of the universe consists of ""Dark Matter"" (fairly easy to believe, as it is simply matter that we can't detect with current instruments), and ""Dark Energy"" (a seriously kludgy substance that exists purely to make physical theory match observed reality, via the ""Cosmological Constant""). How is it that if we believe in God, we're credulous cretins, but if we believe in Dark Energy we're ""scientists""?He even had the nerve to introduce Occam's Razor. If we are to use the Razor, perhaps we shouldn't jump so blindly on the Cosmological Constant bandwagon â a part of Einstein's General Relativity that he seriously regretted, and considered an error.Now, my knowledge and understanding of physics is probably about as good as it gets for someone without a degree in physics, and I didn't have too much trouble following the science in the book â but it was hard enough that it can hardly be considered as being a book for the layman (that is, the science is far harder than A Brief History of Time). Perhaps he could have provided arguments that would convince me, but if so, the book contains too little physics to convince anyone of his case, and too much for most readers to follow."
17,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"3.5 Stars: Yeah. So. I read this. Or, rather, I listened to it. Which, in hindsight, may not have been the best choice. *insert forced/awkward laugh here* You see, this is not what I expected at all. Well, I take that back. This was what I expected, but the ratios were quite a lot different than I expected. (You know, that whole 'reading summaries' thing I don't do? Probably would have helped there.) My point is that, had I done some research and maybe found out what this book actually was going to be, I'd have read a copy of it instead of listening to the audio, and probably got a lot more out of it. But, I totally blame myself for this, because this 'not reading summaries/reviews' thing is a habit I've gotten into in order to come to every book with an open mind, which sometimes backfires on me. So anyway. I listened to this, and I say that it probably wasn't the best way to experience this book because I'm not an auditory learner, and there was a TON of information in this book that I just could not follow in this format. I fully admit that while I found the information in this book to be extremely interesting, most of the explanatory technical stuff went WHOOSH! right over my head. I do much better when I can see and peruse and absorb data visually than when hearing it, especially for technical or complex information and ideas, of which there was a lot in this book. A LOT. (Even better is if there are pictures of said complex info. Colorful ones. With descriptions and arrows and thingies.)This book explains how something can come from nothing. (Or rather ""Nothing"", a distinction that I'm still unclear about. I don't feel THAT bad about this ignorance disclosure, though, because it seems that ""Nothing"" is a constantly evolving concept.) This concept, something from nothing, is very intriguing to me because I am curious to know how things form and start their paths to nowness. I also like to know how things end, though not quite as much, because that starts me thinking about how I'LL end - not nearly as fun a concept. This little passing interest of mine isn't like a fixation or anything - but if I find something interesting, I usually want to start at the beginning, or at least find out what the beginning was to give the history context. So, in that way, this book was very interesting. It was cool to learn more about the make-up of the universe, and the possibilities of the multi-verse, and the projected future-history of the universe, which is bleak and kinda depressing, but still fascinating, if just for the fact that it's changed my perspective on the future. I mean, I'd always imagined that science will continue to evolve and that we'll make more and more discoveries of the universe, but our window of observation is finite - after a couple trillion years, that literally won't be possible because the expansion of the universe will cause the observable light we can see today to shift so far on the light spectrum as to become invisible. (Or aliens will eat it, or something. I might need to re-read that bit. Gosh, this book was so technical!) And then the universe, like everything, will eventually end. I also enjoyed the overviews of how great scientific minds have formulated theories or made discoveries that have changed the course of science. I liked that there was a wide range of theories and aspects of science discussed in this book, and I won't even pretend to pretend that I understood it all, but it's intrigued me to want to read more... though hopefully more accessible for the non-cosmologists/physicists/scientists/PhD'd among us (that's me, FYI). Preferably with pictures. We'll start here: ...and build from there. :D"
18,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14294522-diana,5,"I really enjoyed this book for a couple of reasons: 1) Krauss is one of those rare personalities that excel both in science (his successes are well documented) and teaching and by teaching I mean in a seductive (a word Krauss has used and you'll see how his language in the book can be seductive and almost flirty at times), entertaining way. This is something the world desperately needs as we seem to have slipped back as a society (even in places once much more rational like the United States) that believes the strangest non substantiated things. Our society really needs better fundamental science education. As I've heard Krauss say, a couple hundred years ago, you'd be considered illiterate if you did not know something about natural philosophy....how illiterate many are not knowing about fundamental science and by extension mechanisms of critical thinking and the scientific method.2) The content, with a little work, can be easily grasped. Since it is devoid of math (because the math to describe the concepts in this book and the math that proves and makes predictable the content in this book requires a lot of training) it is accessible, especially if you are the sort of person that can grasp somewhat abstract concepts.If you want to become more literate regarding how the universe began, how it will end and what is cutting edge in physics today, I highly recommend this book. If you are intellectually lazy - go ahead and read it anyway - you shouldn't be intellectually lazy. I'm saying this to shame you because we don't have time for lazy brains anymore.I find it odd that people have criticized this book because it is anti religion. I was waiting for malicious statements and found none. Krauss simply presents what evidence has shown us: that it is less probable that a god is responsible for such things given that it is at least plausible that a universe can come from nothing albeit sometimes he makes a little joke at the expense of those who make ignorant statements. Maybe I'm just more tolerant and also enjoy the witty jokes.Perhaps I am also in the minority for not seeing the cold death of the universe as terrible (though in the 90s when scientists were measuring the universe directly I did morbidly root for a big crunch)....I think this is perhaps because a lifetime of existential angst over my own mortality has hardened me to the mortality of the earth, solar system and by extension galaxies & universe I live in. Krauss titles this chapter ""Our Miserable Future"" because almost worse than our universe's cold death as space/time expands & galaxy clusters move away, intelligent beings will be less able to know the universe's true nature. More specifically, in the far future, physicists on other worlds (should they exist), will make inaccurate conclusions about the universe (as accurate as human conclusions 100 years ago). No more microwave background radiation to measure, no more evidence of the big bang. Oh well, too bad suckers! :) We're lucky to live when we live but maybe if we were smarter a bit earlier we would have been lucky then too.Go ahead, treat your brain to this book - nothing is unstable :)"
19,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,4,"I actually listened to the audio version of this book, narrated by Krauss. I'd be less than honest if I didn't admit that some of this went over my head, but then again, I haven't devoted my life to the study of physics and the cosmos. That said, I think I can appreciate the basic points being made.Krauss not only presents a sound and compelling case for the Big Bang Theory, but he also explains how something really can come from nothing (which is really something, btw), a concept that makes my head hurt...but in a good way.Throughout the explanation lies an undercurrent of anti-theism/deism as Krauss addresses (though not always directly) how and why many traditional religions are not only incompatible with science but also in direct opposition to it.I happen to share many of Krauss' views on religion, and as such realize that this might not be a book for those persons of faith who aren't prepared to have their beliefs challenged and minimized. On the other hand, if you're open and secure in what you believe, don't mind a healthy dose of mind bending ideas, and are interested in learning more about the freaking awesomeness of the universe, then this somewhat simplified introduction is probably worth your time.I'll add that Krauss produced this book after a video of one of his lectures went viral. He felt that he needed to build upon the ideas offered in the lecture and set the record straight for those on both sides of the ""God"" debate who seemed to find justification in his ideas. So, if you're not sure about the book, or want to sample a truncated version, that might be a place to start."
20,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"If youâre looking for free lunch, think big. The universe itself may be the ultimate free lunch. From a scientific point of view, this book is along the same lines as The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking. To summarize the book in two sentences: âIn quantum gravity, universes can, and indeed always will, spontaneously appear from nothing. Such universes need not be empty, but can have matter and radiation in them, as long as the total energy, including the negative energy associated with gravity, is zero.â Nothing here is not just empty space; itâs the absence of space itself. One very important thing that Hawking avoided in his book, but Krauss struggles to address in this book, is that even if a universe can appear out of nothing, it does so according to the laws of quantum gravity. So itâs not nothing in its true sense, if you want to be finicky. We still need the laws that allow for the appearance of a universe out of nothing. (Donât ask me what it means when space-time doesnât exist but there are still laws that govern the nothingness.) He admits that this is still not easy to explain. Regardless, the book is a good survey of the latest in cosmology. I didnât like his frequent snide remarks at theologians. Thatâs uncalled-for in a science book. "
21,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4542177-duff,4,"As a non-scientist, I found many moments of ""oh, that is what I didn't quite understand"" from previous reading in physics and cosmology. That said, there were also times when I simply did not quite understand the complexities that Krauss was explicating. It was a book that I was sad to finish...really liked it. He takes us on a clear, guided journey around the issues of ""nothing""...that which we cannot see in the universe, but through the laws of physics and math is actually measurable, in a theoretical sense. Other reviewers have noted how many times he ""refutes"" God, mostly through examples of his own debates with deists. A little trying, but easily passed by for the incredible material he presents."
22,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"This book pauses with sufficient frequency during its romp through science from particle physics to astrophysics to take pokes at theistic religion to make it clear that the author's intention is to cast a shot across the bow of ""God of the gaps"" thinking which seeks refuge in the question, ""Why there is something rather than nothing."" The author explains that phenomenal progress has been made in the past century that has brought us to the cusp of operationally addressing questions regarding origin, current condition and ultimate fate of our cosmos.The book describes how in the process of pursuing these questions the very meaning of these questions has evolved along with our understanding of the universe. The recent findings that the dominate part (99%) of the universe is made up of material we can't see (i.e. dark energy and dark matter) has changed our distinction between something and nothing. After sighting examples from quantum physics and astrophysics that show; (1) particles appearing from nothing, and that (2) empty space is not ""nothing"" (it's a quantum field), the author proceeds to show that ""nothing"" is an unstable condition thus ""something"" was inevitable. As with most recent physics, these explanations are not all that easy to comprehend, and beyond my ability to accurately summarize in a book review such as this. If you're interested to pursuing this subject further I recommend this

 that provides a 50 minute lecture by the author that generally covers the first ten chapters of this book. The final four chapters explores a variety of possible concepts of the universe and/or multiverses.I was fascinated to learn how controversial and uncertain the definition of ""nothing"" was. For scientists empty space--what formerly could have passed for nothing--now has a new dynamic that dominates the current evolution of the cosmos. Some contentious theologians on the other hand have insisted that their concept of ""nothing"" is more profound than anything that a scientist might understand to be ""nothing."" They insist that a ""nothing"" that contains the potential for ""something"" can't be truly ""nothing."" The author counters that a ""nothing"" which contains the potential of creation is no less worthy than the theist's God who has the potential to create. My own observation is that a ""nothing"" with no God exudes nothingness more completely than a ""nothing"" than includes the existence of God. ""We have discovered that all signs suggest a universe that could and plausibly did arise from a deeper nothing--involving that absence of space itself--and which may one day return to nothing via processes that may not only be comprehensible but also processes that do not require any external control or direction. In this sense, science...does not make it impossible to believe in God, but rather makes it possible to not believe in God. Without science, everything is a miracle. With science, there remains the possibility that nothing is. Religious belief in this case becomes less and less necessary, and also less and less relevant. ... I believe that if we are to be intellectually honest, we must make an informed choice, informed by fact, not by revelation.""The following are my own musings, not necessarily from the book:I think the author is needlessly critical of supersymmetric string theory. He admits that it is a mathematical model that rationalizes the relationships between subatomic particles using 10 dimensions, but he says it has never explained or predicted anything in particle physics. Well, maybe so, but I foresee a possibility that a version of string theory may end up providing the best possible model for dark energy and dark matter. Dark energy is apparently everywhere in our universe including under our noses. Since we can't see it I propose that it may have something to do with those seven unseen dimensions. And perhaps the dark matter may consist of strings with no vibration. (I suspect some readers will laugh at my thoughts. I don't care. Thinking up crazy ideas is fun.)The following are two concepts that were new to me and that I learned from this book:1. Faster than the speed of light? If space expands at an ever increasing rate, it is possible for objects to move away from each other faster than the speed of light without violation of the theory of relativity. This is because the speed of light applies to speed through space, not space itself which has no limit on how fast it can expand. (i.e. Space does not obey the law of space-time.) If space itself expands at an increasing rate, eventually the expansion will exceed the speed of light and consequently light from the most distance stars will not be visible. This will lead to a condition in two trillion years when all stars that are not included within our local super cluster of constellations will not be visible to earth-like observers in our constellation. (It won't be earthlings doing the observing because our sun will burn out long before then.) This condition will erase all observable evidence of the big bang.2. Changing ratio of dark energy to dark matter The ratio of dark energy to dark matter has been changing as the universe expands. Early in the history of the universe the constant quantity of dark matter was more concentrated within the smaller universe and thus it was the dominate constituent. Dark energy is different in that it remains at the same concentration throughout the expanding universe and thus in the distant future will be the dominate constituent as dark matter becomes diluted by the expanded size of the universe. We currently live at a unique time in the history of the universe when both dark energy and dark matter are measurable. The author described this as a special time in history because it is the only time when we would be able to tell how special it is.Wikipedia.com has articles on dark energy and dark matter for those interested in reading more."

24,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"This book is amazing. I listened to it as an audiobook that was read by the author himself. It is about 5 hours and 30 minutes in length.A Universe From Nothing was written by Krauss to expand on a talk he gave in a lecture in 2009 under the same title (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Imvl...). The lecture is about one hour long is absolutely worth watching (I watched it after finishing the book, but I think it would be better to watch it before). The title is of course shocking, how the hell can a whole universe come from nothing? Surely you're joking mr Krauss! (or was it Feynman :p) You're just an atheist trying to do away with God to justify your atheism! Let's hold that judgment for the end and read the book with as little preconceptions as possible.The forward was supposed to be written by Christopher Hitchens, but unfortunately he was very ill (metastasised oesophageal cancer) and couldn't write it, and in fact died few months before the publication of the book. Krauss begins the book by asking us a question, what is nothing? Would we define it as empty space with no particles (the so-called quantum vacuum)? or as the absence of even space and time? or as the absence of all of that and the laws of nature as well?This must have been added at a later time to the book, because it feels like a reply to critics who accused Krauss of dishonesty by using the term ""nothing"" to refer to what is actually a quantum vacuum (a something). Krauss confessed that in the subtitle of the book ""Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing"", he didn't really mean what modern-day philosophers and theologians would understand by the term ""nothing"", because our knowledge and understanding of the universe and of nothing is advancing and what was considered nothing by previous philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas is not seen so by today's standards. He further adds that his purpose from writing the book is to share the marvellous advancements in science made recently and to spark debate about their philosophical and existential consequences (which he certainly did - and I recommend reading them after the book).Krauss then takes us through a wonderful and awe-inspiring summary of advancements in physics made in the 20th century. Here were are told about the palpitations that Einstein had after his equation yielded results exactly matching the observed strange orbit of Mercury, and how Hubble proved that other galaxies exist and that the universe is expanding, which changed the-then scientific view that our galaxy was all that existed and that the universe was static. We are told about gravitational lensing and how Einstein thought it was not worth publishing about, yet helped us weight the galaxies very far away from us (isn't that just wonderful!). This allowed us to understand that the vast majority of the weight in the universe comes not from the matter we know, but from another type of matter that is mostly scattered between galaxies which cannot be seen and which we know nothing about its nature. It was therefore named Dark Matter. He also talks about the Big Bang and inflation and displays the evidence in a convincing and beautiful way.He tells us briefly about quantum physics and the efforts of scientists such as Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger, Werner Heisenberg, Paul Dirac and Richard Feynman that led to our current understanding of this rather counterintuitive nature of reality. The author then talks about the story of the Cosmological constant from its conception by Einstein to its resurrection in the end of last century as well as its yet unresolved problem which he calls one of the most important ones in physics nowadays. He also talks about anti-matter and how it was first found.Then he moves to the curvature of the universe and shows that there are three options for it; open, flat and closed. The evidence at first from weighting the universe suggested it was open (the weight was only 30% of what it should be for a flat universe, which is the most elegant mathematically and has a sum of zero energy), but direct measurement of that showed it was actually flat. So where is the remaining 70% of the universe? That's what we call Dark Energy or the energy of empty space.So what are the consequences of knowing the our universe is a flat one? Krauss tells us this means that it could have begun from nothing, because empty space (which he refers to as nothing) is not stable! Well how so? Krauss talks about what is known as Virtual Particles that pop into existence and out of it all the time. Sounds crazy right? Well, it was measured indirectly to an accuracy of 1 in 10 billion (1 in 10,000,000,000)! You might ask, doesn't this violate the law of conservation of energy? The answer is no, because gravity acts as a negative force, so the net energy is still zero. It's just like adding one to minus one, you end up with zero and therefore energy is conserved. He also talks about blackholes and Hawking radiation, which predicts that blackholes produce particles at the event horizon on the the quantum scale.Since our universe is made of mostly matter, rather than anti-matter, Krauss suggests that in the early universe there must have been some quantum effects that lead to matter being more than anti-matter, and that this can be as small as 1 in a billion and be enough to explain all the matter we see in the universe. He repeats here that the answer to the question why is there something rather than nothing is: because nothing is unstable and is required to become something. This nothing he talks about is as explained above is also known as a quantum vacuum, but what about the nothing of no space and no time?Here Krauss invokes Feynman's ""sum over all histories"" theory, which according to the author does not prohibit that small compact spaces (virtual universes) can pop in and out of existence just like virtual particles. He adds that a future Quantum Gravity theory might better inform us about this possibility. So what is the good of these virtual universes if they just pop back into non-existence? Krauss got that covered. He tells us that a compact universe with zero total energy can quantum mechanically pop into existence ""with impunity"" according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the law of conservation of energy. These universes are closed and only last for microscopic time (it is in the plank scale - very small), nevertheless if before collapsing, the ""configuration of the fields within it"" produce an inflation, then this universe can expand exponentially, until after 100 or so inflations it becomes flat and therefore very similar to ours. That's how a universe just like ours can come from nothing (no space and no time). Krauss is keen to add that this doesn't mean that our universe came from nothing, but that this is a big step toward making this a plausible scenario.On the last type of nothing, the absence of even the laws of nature, Krauss says that while science doesn't have an answer to this currently, it might (or might not) have one in the future; A Theory of Everything. He is critical of String Theory, calling a theory of anything rather than of everything. Krauss dislikes the anthropic principle that is often invoked by many atheists; he says it's slippery and makes no predictions, especially since we don't know the probabilities associated with it. Nevertheless he says that it could after-all be the case. He then goes into a philosophical reflection on what this means on the question of God's existence which he adds we are much informed on today than previous thinkers, because we know much more now about the nature of the universe (or multiverse) we live in than they did. He concludes that God is not necessary or at best redundant. He share's Steven Weinberg's view that ""Science doesn't make it impossible to believe in God, it just makes it possible not to believe in God"".The afterward is written by no one other than Richard Dawkins, the author of the famous (or infamous depending on your views) book The God Delusion. Dawkins starts poetically and summarises the important points of the book. He then just moves into showing that religion and God are wrong. At the end, he make a big exaggeration by comparing this book to The Origin of Species, which even Krauss called ""pretentious"". I was left with the feeling that Dawkins was more interested in showing God is not real than in seeking an alternative answer for the deep question of the book.Overall the book was easy to understand (and has jokes scattered in it!), with the exception of the third quarter in which the author actually explains how something can come out of nothing. It is interesting that the points made here are very similar to those made in The Grand Design to reach almost the same conclusions. Here's a quote from that book: Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going. In this book however, Krauss elaborates much more on the issue as summarised above.The repeated use of quantum physics which I understand only little about to answer this deep question might seem suspicious, especially in light of the many misleading uses by charlatans such as Deepak Chopra. However, what's reassuring is that Krauss is a leading physicist and that the same argument was used by other scientists such as Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow.The book with its intended forward by Hitchens, afterward by Dawkins and conclusion that allows for non-belief in God is clearly intended to be Krauss's debut into the New Atheism movement.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Big Questions."
25,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5500087-shaun,5,"""Universe From Nothing"" is a thought-provoking book, detailing how science has went about discovering the origins of the universe. Krauss' subject matter is derived from the observable experiments and Data supporting the theory that the universe was created due to the big bang, which itself arose out of a state of rapid quantum fluctuations - from nothing.  Along with educating the reader on how the rigorous testing of evidence supports the theory that the universe sprang from nothing, Krauss finds it of equal importance to educate the reader by clarifying what ""nothing"" really is and how the scientific understanding or usage of the term ""nothing"" is more informative than the Philosophers or Theologians semantic, hopelessly abstract and non applicable definition.  Since the theologian contributes nothing more than mere backpedaling the definition into obscurity, Krauss argues that the scientific understanding of nothingness indeed replaces the relevatory or imaginative proclamations with more useful operational efforts to describe ""nothingness"". Early on, Krauss sets the tone for the reader to explore implications by scientific discoveries by providing the scientific ethos for furthering our understanding of nature;1) Follow evidence wherever it leads, even if the conclusions are startling or unexpected 2) If one has a theory, one needs to be willing to try to prove it wrong as much as one tries to prove it right3) The ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment.  Throughout the chapters the reader is taken through the steps of the last 100 years in how the ideas of size and shape of our Universe has drastically changed through a push and pull of theoretical science either being confirmed or denied by the advancement of scientific observation and testing. This fascinating tale evokes many of the centuries observational discoveries in Physics and cosmology such as Edward Hubble, who confirmed that the expansion of the universe wasn't only happening but in fact accelerating, disproving Einsteins formulation of a ""static universe"" -Other profound discoveries are thrown into consideration such as the ""CMBR"" ( Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation ) which supported the theory of the ""big bang"", or of the methods of how Krauss and others took in calculating the shape of the universe - leading to other profound discoveries such as the concept of ""dark matter"" ( or dark energy"" ).These discoveries in turn lead to other startling discoveries of our universe. . .which leads the path to the the thesis of the book. I found the this section always engaging with Krauss always employs different methods, facetious analogies or graphs in helping the layman understand how the other scientists came to their conclusions, always underlining his useful premise;""The Universe is the way it is whether we like it or not"".  The integrity of Krauss work is further demonstrated with Krauss mentioning how he was cautious with the first data that comes in, might not be representative of all the data, systematic errors that could affect the data. ""Speculations are fine, especially if it promotes new avenues for experiment. Krauss further calls for composure and being conservative as possible when examining real data.In the last chapters the reader finds a wonderful description of processes of how a universe could come from nothing.  Some of the conditions that conspired to produce the shape of the universe that it is today such as the process of Inflation, whereby the energy of empty space/nothing gets converted into the energy of something - Empty space, endowed with enough stored energy which dominates the expansion of the universe, effectively creating everything we see.It was mind-bending to discover that what we know or perceive as ""empty space"", is an unstable boiling brew of virtual particles that ""pop"" in and out of existence. This fluctuation of energy happens so quickly that only the indirect effects of virtual particles can be measured before a positron meets the first electron, coincidentally annihilating each other and thereby returning back into empty space. Krauss details more on the scientific method by citing the ""paragon of good science"" as when scientists use models that can be tested and falsified. Instead of working with questions of ""why"" something works, the work and inquiry of the scientist is to frame these into ""how"" questions, which allows the production of new knowledge and understanding of the phenomena. ""How"" questions are thus differentiated from purely theological questions, which presume the answers up front. Richard Dawkins is also featured in the afterward, contributing a shorthanded yet chatty recap, successfully solidifying concepts that perhaps the reader was only beginning to correctly conceptualize together with underlining the significance of Krauss' work in the face of Philosophica and/or Theologian myopia . . .In all, I thoroughly enjoyed Krauss' narrative and his facetious nature in trying to relate this profound and convincing discussion to the reader interested in Science, or those who follow the developments and discoveries more closely.

26,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian,4,"the baked-in problem is that this explanation of how 'something' can emerge from 'nothing' must accept that 'nothing' operates by laws of quantum gravity. is this truly 'nothing'? shit, i dunno. krauss touches on this as admirably as possible. but i guess i should also throw quotations around 'possible', eh? and there's the problem. "
27,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1374596-blarg,0,"This book was unexpectedly disappointing. As a non-scientist who reads extensively about cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, I wasnât surprised that the author spent the first 142 pages of his book rehashing what we know so far about the formation and evolution of our universe and its component structures. Some of the information is quite recent, and I expected the foundational knowledge to be important to understanding the argument and evidence that would presumably follow.Unfortunately, I was fairly well stunned (and disappointed) that he then blithely extrapolated one known phenomenon into a wildly different context with barely an acknowledgement of how different it is, and then declared victory in a ridiculous and unnecessary argument with theists.It is true that we know from recent experiments that what we long thought of as âempty spaceâ beyond the edges of our solar system is not ânothing.â Even places in deep outer space that are truly empty of any dust or molecules are still physical structures that are capable of holding matter â similar to how an empty shoe box is still a physical box.We all know that shoe boxes are made from cardboard, and we now know that space itself is made of a seething sub-microscopic âquantum foamâ that contains vast amounts of energy and strangeness. (See http://www.scaleofuniverse.com/)Quantum mechanics also tells us that inside this quantum foam, at the tiniest microscopic level, all sorts of particles and anti-particles are constantly winking into and out of existence. The author describes on page 154 that under the right circumstances, two charged plates can be brought close enough together such that a âreal particle-antiparticle pair can âpopâ out of the vacuum, with the negative charge heading toward the positive plate and the positive charge toward the negative one.âAs crazy as this sounds, we know from Einsteinâs famous equation that energy and mass are essentially interchangeable. They are different manifestations of the same thing, and under the right circumstances (such as nuclear fusion), we can convert matter into huge amounts of pure energy such as nuclear weapons.These same principles suggest it is entirely reasonable for energy to turn into particles (mass), and the author presents a compelling case of how the math works out fine when an equal balance of particles and antiparticles pop into existence, because they represent zero net energy. (Imagine having two bank accounts with zero balances and then electronically transferring one dollar from one account to the other. Suddenly one account has one dollar and the other account has a negative balance of one dollar.)Unfortunately, this is where the author makes a leap of faith that I simply canât follow. He concludes that because it is probable (or even certain) that miniscule quantum particles and antiparticles pop in and out of existence inside our spacetime, it must follow that it is possible or probable that the same thing happens outside of spacetime â in a manner that allows for the creation of a quantity of spacetime that is so huge as to be literally mind-boggling.(Our Milky Way galaxy contains approximately 300 billion stars, and is so vast that it would take a rocket ship (traveling 500 miles per hour) more than 147 billion years just to cross the Milky Way. And our galaxy is one of more than one hundred billion galaxies in the universe.)After making the case that it is possible for universes to pop into existence so long as they have zero total energy, the author completely fails to explain why our universe seems to have far more matter than antimatter. I was expecting him to say there must be vast amounts of antimatter beyond our view , but he instead provided a head-scratching explanation of how the imbalance could have come to be â without addressing the fact that such an imbalance flies in the face of everything he postulated about the primacy of zero energy systems.Near the end of the book the author unintentionally shows how weak his arguments are when he comes right out and claims that it is a âfactâ that âin quantum gravity, universes can and indeed always will spontaneously appear from nothing.â It may be true that this is so in some version of the speculative (and unquestionably incomplete) theory of quantum gravity. But it certainly is not a fact and the authorâs presentation of it as one is emblematic of the sloppy reasoning found throughout his book.Finally, a grudging word about the bookâs discussion of religion. I am embarrassed for everyone that a book dedicated to exploring cosmology and scientific principles spends so much time pointing out how the overwhelming huge mountain of scientific facts (based on easily repeatable experiments) conflicts with the mix of inconsistent ancient myths that comprise monotheistic religions.From my perspective, ""religion versus science"" isn't a conversation worth having because religion brings nothing testable to the table. Religion isn't even the equivalent of a spoon at a knife fight. (It's more like claiming a cupcake is a great life preserver while living in the desert, far from water.)I would have greatly preferred that the author split this book into three books. One being his robust and excellent discussion of modern cosmology, the second being a more logical explanation of his theory of nothingness, and the third being a scientific evisceration of the myths of theistic religions. Having read the book the author wrote, however, it is clear to me now that he (and/or his publishing company) intended to pick a fight with religion in order to generate buzz, controversy, and sell more books.He should have spent more time explaining and defending his central theory, and laying out the case for the next generation of scientific experiments that we should perform in order to prove or disprove his theory."
28,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Is it true that the laws of physics allow creating something out of an empty space?This is one of the best books I have read in recent years that summarizes the laws of physics and the origin of the universe in a splendid manner. The author describes as how our universe was created out of nothing; just an empty space with virtual particles using quantum physics and relativity without invoking string or brane theories.Moments after the big bang, a slight asymmetry in the distributions of matter and antimatter resulted in our universe. This asymmetry was extremely minute, one part in a billion, which means that there were approximately one billion photons for every proton (matter) in the universe, which is still found in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), remnants of the glow of early universe; the moment after matter-antimatter annihilation occurred. The essence of the book is that the application of the laws of quantum physics and relativity to physical reality produces facts that stun common sense. The reader begins to appreciate the author's argument and the physical laws that support it. The author also has a humorous look at the nature of things while discussing strangeness of quantum physics. At several instances he jabs at politicians, leaders of corporations, and men who profess to preach God, with hard facts of physics.A summary of the book is as follows: When a balloon gets blown up larger and larger at a fast pace, the curvature at its surface gets smaller and smaller, closer to being flat. A similar mechanism called inflation lead the early universe into a long lived universe removing all its curvature. The cosmic inflation is a period rapid of exponential expansion of our universe, moments after its birth. As the energy of empty space is converted into the energy of something, the universe was driven closer and closer to being essentially flat on all observable scales. Secondly, the laws of quantum physics imply on very small scales for very short times, empty space is a boiling bubbling brew of virtual particles with wildly fluctuating fields. These quantum fluctuations ended the period of exponential expansion during inflation. That is, different regions of the early universe stopped inflating at slightly different times and the density of matter and radiation were slightly different. These small fluctuations in the density of matter resulted in gravitational collapse to form galaxies, and later stars. It is the quantum fluctuations of empty space, the quantum nothingness that evolved into cosmos. If a closed universe had been created (with curvature); it would have collapsed on its own gravity, leaving nothing. A flat universe mediated by inflationary expansion led to a long lived universe.Virtual universes that pop in and out of existence, within a very short time, are interesting theoretical constructs. The virtual photons carry zero energy, and they do not violate energy conservation or Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Hence the formation of virtual particles from empty space is in accordance with laws of physics. The dynamics and the nature of things are not as simple as they appear from Newtonian laws of physics. For example, when an object is moving through space, the space itself evolves with time and the terms of present and future becomes relative and not absolute, according to relativistic physics, and the laws of quantum physics applies not only to physical properties of objects but space itself.The phenomenon of Hawking-radiation applies quantum physics to a classical entity such as black hole and this study reveals that a black hole can radiate virtual particles. Due to quantum fluctuation in its vicinity, just outside the event horizon, one of the partner particle falls inside the event horizon and loose its gravitational energy; the other partner particle will fly off to infinity clearly visible in the universe without violating in the laws of the energy conservation. The total positive energy of this particle is compensated by its twin particle's lost energy. Thus the black hole is able to radiate particles. The net effect of a particle falling inside the black hole results in its lowering of energy than before. This process progressively results in a black hole less and less energy and finally the black holes disappear out of existence. Thus the reality of something coming out of nothing during the beginning of the universe or something going out of existence from something is real.For every effect there is a cause, but what was there before the first cause? Vedanta philosophy reasoned from this conundrum that the universe and God must be eternal. There is no first cause, in fact causes go backwards and forwards in all directions. There is no beginning and no end. Physics offers a more convincing argument for the concept of God in the idea of multiverse. According to this, our universe is one of the several billions of universes, each with its own set of physical laws and physical reality. The fundamental forces and universal constants are not unique in multiverse physics and anthropic principle is unnecessary. Only the inhabitants of a universe can see and experience their universe, but God as an entity can see and experience all the universes"
29,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635936-jeremy,5,"lawrence krauss' new book, a universe from nothing: why there is something rather than nothing, summarizes the continuing developments in the field of cosmology. in addition to championing these new insights in the study of modern physics, krauss also frames these advances in the appropriate context of their resulting implications for theologians and deists. adapted from a lecture he delivered at the 2009 atheist alliance international annual convention (and made popular on youtube), a universe from nothing explores the history of the universe from the big bang through inflation to its theoretical endpoint using the most current (and widely accepted) science.krauss is marvelously adept at conveying his broad scientific knowledge in as succinct and lucid a manner as is perhaps possible, making it relatively easy for a non-theoretical physicist to grasp the concepts he is attempting to illustrate. among the more notable and recent advancements that krauss examines in the book are the discoveries that the universe is now accelerating following the so-called ""cosmic jerk"" that took place some five billion years ago (see also 2011 nobel prize in physics), the abundance of dark energy that appears to account for nearly three-quarters of the universe's total mass (that resides mostly in ""empty space""), and the uniform flatness that characterizes our universe. the majority of the book is spent assembling and explaining the related pieces that together form a picture of the universe which, according to the latest scientific data, seems to have evolved from nothing- in fact, may have only been able to evolve precisely because there was nothing.
the ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, not the comfort one derives from one's a priori beliefs, not the beauty and elegance one ascribes to one's theoretical models. the results of experiments that i will describe here are not only timely, they are also unexpected. the tapestry that science weaves in describing the evolution of our universe is far richer and far more fascinating than any revelatory images or imaginative stories that humans have concocted.
as our understanding of the nearly 14 billion-year-old universe is constantly evolving, there is clearly much to be learned about cosmology. krauss is enthusiastic in his dissemination of the accumulated knowledge, and seems eager to welcome whatever conceptual refinements future advancements will inevitably bring. a universe from nothing is not simply a scientific treatise however, as krauss considers the ramifications these new insights have on age-old theological arguments.
for more than two thousand years, the question, ""why is there something rather than nothing?"" has been presented as a challenge to the proposition that our universe- which contains the vast complex of stars, galaxies, humans, and who knows what else- might have arise without design, intent, or purpose. while this is usually framed as a philosophical or religious question, it is first and foremost a question about the natural world, and so the appropriate place to try and resolve it, first and foremost, is with science.
richard dawkins, in the book's afterword, characterizes krauss' book as ""the knockout blow"" to the theologian's remaining arguments in favor of a creator. with a few hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe and a modern physics that seems to indicate that our universe could have only arose from nothing, krauss' assertion that god is ""unnecessary- or at best redundant"" is as compelling as the science he uses to arrive at said claim. a universe from nothing, like most books of reason and evidence, will do little to dissuade those whom ardently profess their belief in a deity, but as cosmology clarifies our place in the universe with greater precision, the arguments in favor of a creator seem ever less defensible. krauss, in this eminently readable (and often funny!) book, has ventured further down the road of rationality and empiricism, allowing us a guided tour on the never-ending quest to truly understand the nature of life in this brilliant universe we call home.
if we wish to draw philosophical conclusions about our own existence, our significance, and the significance of the universe itself, our conclusions should be based on empirical knowledge. a truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implications.

30,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6376052-lois-keller,3,"I would like to first that Lawrence Krauss is a very intelligent man and that I have a lot of respect for him as an author, scientist, and intellectual.  Secondly, this book was somewhat an enigma to me (bear with me for a few before marking me as a English major with little science background). I went into reading this book with my own well formed bias and skepticism towards the subject matter - can something can from nothing? Why this book is an enigma is that Krauss wants to support his arguments as backed by well reasoned, scientifically sound arguments, but he often contradicts himself and oversimplifies the material in order to do so to appeal to a larger audience. The contradictions are subtle, for instance, he goes into great detail early on in the book about how usually the scientific community is highly skeptic and harsh towards new science and should be, but then he bases a good portion of his argument on Stephen Hawking's postulates on how something can come from nothing. Now as a scientist, I want experimental verification for these theories before I fully accept them and the theories that branch from the original. Krauss would probably love to go into detail and full mathematical explanations in his book, but he doesn't, and by generalizing his subject matter, he loses some of his validity (in my mind). Am I convinced that something can come from nothing and we no longer need the existence of a good to support the creation of the universe? Not in the slightest; however, Krauss did make me think about this topic and question my own personal beliefs and rationalizations.  What I really took from this book and grew from was Einstein's opinion on the origins of the universe about half way through the book - ""For Einstein, the existence of order in the universe provided a sense of such profound wonder that he felt a spiritual attachment to it, which he labeled with the moniker ""God"""" This struck me as such a beautiful concept and phrased in a way that I had been previously unable to do so - God is a representation of the structure of our universe. There is nothing to suggest that God is an active presence in our daily lives; yet, there may be something to that God is a term used to describe the ultimate simplicity and relational concepts that define physics - God is what makes things work, what connects aspects of our lives to the reality we perceive. I guess God could be the Grand Unified Theorem (I'm sure that would be a well received publication title...).  Overall, I enjoyed this book. Krauss keeps it relatively focused, and even if you hate thinking philosophically about the origins of the universe or about the science behind it, I believe you could still find enjoyment in A Universe from Nothing. I would really recommend this to anyone - it's a solid 3.5 stars and is definitely an intellectual and thought provoking read with a lot of excellent science nuggets of gold in it. As a physicist, I craved more mathematical reasoning and maybe even a few paper citations, but as a member of a general public, I appreciate Krauss's ability to explain things without losing his audience. "
31,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5838986-amy,1,"This book was half academic circle jerking and half wannabe Dawkins posturing. 1. I was too dumb to understand the majority of the nitty gritty science. You can tell me that the universe is flat based on geometry and I'll believe you; you're just wasting my time if you try to impress me with equations. 2. Knowing that I'm too dumb for this book made me wonder who he was writing it for. I'm not unintelligent, even if my background is in English and not in physics. There's just enough raw science in here that I'd think a layman would be confused and just enough simplistic analogies that say he's writing for the layman, after all. 3. Half of the time is spent nodding at his colleagues' work, his own work, and the ""silly"" work of others in misguided fields. There's a long sojourn where he talks smack on string theory. It's some of the most condescending writing I've seen. He tries to say he still respects them, but for every ""String theorists are intelligent men and women"" concession, he'll follow it up with a ""So just let them have their little vain moment in the sun"" comment. I'm not interested. 4. Can't stress enough how much of this book is just ""I know that important guy"" and ""I was the one who organized the conference where that dude spoke"" and ""My work on ____."" Is this a book for the masses or an excuse for you to flout your CV, Krauss? 5. I am not one to feel offended when someone tries to prove there isn't a god. I'm the person who goes out and buys Dawkins so I can better argue against churchgoers. But I did not pick up this book for a philosophical debate about the existence of God. It's not what I wanted. Say your piece, Krauss, and if you want to go full Hitchens and outline why God doesn't exist, then write a different book. His arguments felt completely out of place. 6. Let me summarize: The universe is still expanding. In a trillion years, anyone's who's alive in the universe will not be able to see beyond their own galaxy. They'll think they're alone and anyone who suspects otherwise will not be able to prove it. We live in a special time, a small (relatively speaking) window of roughly a billion years where we can trace the origin of the Big Bang, know that we are one of many billion galaxies, and are able to study starstuff that will eventually cease to exist. It is postulated that the universe will end as it began: by one day jumping from one state to another. One day, it will cease to exist. There is something now. There will be nothing later. But, because it's been proven (or the possibility is so dramatically high that it's practically proven) that you can create something from nothing, who's to say another Big Bang won't happen when our universe dies? It could. It might not. It probably will. The cycle would begin anew. However it all ends, it will be mathematically beautiful. That's it. That's all you need to know. Thank me for saving you hours of your life."
32,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13369978-jana-light,2,"This is a difficult book to review. On one hand, Krauss is an enthralling and clear science writer. He gives great descriptions of how the universe works, about conditions in the early moments in the universe that led to what we see today, and (my favorite, because it was new to me!) what the very old universe will look like and how it will be in a state that will make any observers assume the universe is the way humans actually thought it was back in the 1800s. (!!) This was all interesting, fun, wild stuff. On the other hand... wow. Simply put, Krauss frames his entire book as doing something he does not, and in fact cannot, do. His entire premise is that he is showing how the universe came into existence from Nothing, but unfortunately this is a question outside the realm of science. It is philosophy, and in most ways it is pure speculation. Everything Krauss claims to be ""nothing"" -- ""empty"" space, the bits right before the Big Bang instantiated space itself, etc. -- are nowhere near the definition of ""Nothing"" that is at the heart of the question he claims to tackle and claims to answer. Certainly, not the Nothing that philosophy starts with (philosophers are much more careful and precise about their terms). Krauss redefines the concept to fit what he wants it to be and what will help him ""prove"" his argument, rather than honestly confronting the real question. It was very disappointing.Now, if Krauss had set out to demonstrate that the universe can operate, from its initial starting ""stuff,"" without the intervention of a supernatural Being, then Krauss did so. Excellently and fascinatingly. But instead, since he set out to answer a question science is not equipped to answer, I cannot give the book the stars this truly excellent science writing deserves. Another huge problem for me: throughout, Krauss dismissed and almost mocked philosophy, undermining its legitimacy as a form of inquiry. Despite that, he insisted on engaging (poorly) in philosophy through at least half of the book. You cannot dismiss a tool of inquiry and then use it -- poorly, without understanding how to use it properly -- to make your point. I kept thinking things like ""stay your lane,"" ""respect the fields you don't know,"" and ""by the way, it's cheating to move the goalposts.""As a book on science, this was quite good. I learned a lot, reinforced or recalled other things I had learned from other laymen physics books, and found many new questions to ask my physicist husband. As a book purportedly answering -- answering!! -- the question of ""Why is there something rather than Nothing?"", it is almost offensively and laughably bad. "
33,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,4,"Lawrence Krauss catches us all up on the latest in cosmology with his rare combination of professional expertise, ability to explain difficult concepts, and sense of humor. The first portion of the book follows the history of astronomy and cosmology to present, showcasing the bold ideas, both successful and failed, that have brought us to our current understanding of the universe we live in. These concepts are explained very well, and his account filled many gaps in my understanding. I'm extremely happy I finished this book prior to watching the film Particle Fever, about the building of the Large Hadron Collider and the search for the Higgs Boson, as it gave me better footing upon which to appreciate that story.As Krauss begins to drive home his thesis and discuss current insights into the energy contained within empty space, he brings in pieces of information that he has personally had a hand in elucidating. He does a great job of separating what we know for sure from what might be the case, and then explores the implications of each. All of this is set against the classic question that book-ends all of existence: ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" Citing science's penchant for answering ""how"" questions far more effectively, Krauss examines the alternate questions that could make sense to even answer, and compares those questions with the far less satisfying speculations theology has provided.As the book wanders into complicated discussion of time-traveling electrons that shoot back into the present with self-annihilating antimatter in tow, or the implications of a closed or open or flat universe that might spring into existence for varying levels of time, I'll admit he goes well over my head. I found myself re-reading a number of pages to grasp the concepts, and sometimes just had to kind of nod and move along. I won't fault Krauss's explanatory powers, as he explains other concepts so well - I'll fault my own lack of experience with quantum physics and relativity, and the inherent complexity of those topics.Highly recommended for those wanting a fuller picture of particle physics and cosmology, or who wish to have conversations that involve such things."
34,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Krauss comes out swinging, calling theism morally bankrupt, and poo-pooing ""first cause"" as a cop out.The first half of the book is a very good explanations for lay or studied person.Later on, though, the author beats his thesis like a dead horse with a floppy philosophy stick.I got really tired of hearing the phrase ""something from nothing"".I was curious why he insists space is precisely flat.Experiments like BOOMERanG show it is very nearly flat.But then again, the gravitational constant is very nearly zero compared to the other forces.Nearly zero can only be called zero when zero is otherwise an important prediction, like the rest mass of a photon.While it's a safe guess that our limit for the curvature will continue to approach zero, it is by no means a certainty!Krauss seems to imply otherwise, an in my opinion, mistakenly so.In the end of the book, he gives a shockingly poor answer to Einstein's question:Did got have a choice in creating the universe?He responds with a sort of anthropic argument, that if the universe were much different, there would be nobody around to ask the question.This is clearly not true for computer scientists, who, if they're like me, create toy universes all the time.Their made-up laws of nature may be simple, and the results may be trifling compared to, and by definition are lesser than, our universe.But they are universes, just the same.Chess, Conway's game of life, Richard Dawkin's Biomorphs, any Minecraft map, and the World of Warcraft are all universes, with their own laws.None of them incorporate quantum mechanics, or have an Einstein in them, however.Idea: Build Einstein in Mincraft!My favorite part of the book was the terrifying story of the impoverished physicists living 2 trillion years from now.They will have no traces of dark energy, or the big bang, because the CMBR will have red-shifted out of view.Poor guys."
35,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3465909-ronald,3,"Like poetry, an abstruse scientific work need not be fully comprehended to enjoy it. This somewhat arcane audio book, well read by its author, theoretical physicist & cosmologist Larry Krauss, sheds just enough familiar photons to guide the layman through the maze of dark matter, quantum fluctuation, event horizons, and The Singularity. I was especially keen on Dr. Krauss's discussion of the philosophical implications of evidenced-based findings about the expanding universe... no gods required or allowed.In recent years, many scientists have challenged the ""non-overlapping magisteria"" (NOMA), proffered by Stephen Jay Gould, noted paleontologist and evolutionary biologist. Science no longer cedes the forum to the unsubstantiated assertions of religion about life and the cosmos. Thus is upended the unfalsifiable claim that religion ""knows"" the world in ways different from science, but equally valid.The Afterword by evolutionary biologist and ethologist Richard Dawkins is powerful corroboration of this important work from an evolutionary biologist's perspective. I found the book worthwhile; and given enough space-time, if I read a lot more of this stuff, my understanding will surely expand along with the universe."
36,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7308179-jerry,2,"I found this book rather disappointing. It does shed some light on the promised question of why the universe exists, but very little. I found his writing not nearly as good as that of Brian Greene. Krauss seems to have an inflated ego that intrudes into the narrative all too often.One of the things I found most annoying is that he repeatedly and foolishly wandered off his scientific discourse into a discussion on theology where he attempts to show that there is no room for God in creation. I found this quote revealing: ""All it represents is an unwillingness to recognize the simple fact that nature may be cleverer than philosophers or theologians."" He forgot to include that scientists may not be as clever as they think. He fails to recognize that he is really taking on faith that four significant digits of accuracy. The scientific theory only lasts as long as the next contradictory experimental result. After all, even the great Einstein himself was wrong about his cosmological constant. "

38,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9924189-james-kane,2,"Originally published just under a year ago, Lawrence Krauss' A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather than Nothing (2012) grapples with one of the oldest and most complex questions confronting scientists, philosophers and theologians everywhere: is it possible for something to come from nothing? Drawing on key developments in modern physics, several of which are indebted to his own research and published scholarship, Krauss argues and demonstrates that, contrary to common belief, our universe can have emerged literally from nothing 13.72 billion years ago without violating any time-honoured notions of what is logical or physically possible. Although this argument fascinates and offers an important corrective to one of the longest-standing tenets of human intellectual history (i.e. that nothing can come from nothing, so to speak), the book for the most part constitutes a rehash of a scientific adventure story that has been covered numerous times in works by various other science writers. To be fair to Krauss, the retelling of this narrative is virtually inevitable, since explaining and promoting radical new ideas in this field requires a summary of the most important research that has gone before. While authors like Brian Greene and Stephen Hawking manage to structure ""the story so far"" effectively and recount its key developments in an engaging way, Krauss often lacks clarity in his writing, failing at times to explain certain crucial concepts or to show non-specialist readers exactly how one discovery led to another. The main point of the book is a significant, even revolutionary one. (Though I should point out here that Krauss is by no means the first scientist to mention the idea in a work aimed at a wider audience, even if he may be the first to make it the focus of a whole book.) Cosmologists still have a huge amount of work to do in order to clarify exactly how the universe began, but for the first time in human history we have reached a point where it is not only plausible but legitimate to envisage an origin scenario where matter came into existence out of the unstable, unpredictable quantum energy of empty space. In stressing this point, A Universe from Nothing has the potential to make a real and (crucially) accessible contribution to general understanding of the enormous, truly ancient world we live in. This is exactly what a ""popular science"" book should do. Unfortunately, in addition to championing an intriguing recent theory about the origins of existence, Krauss explicitly adopts a stance throughout which reduces the purpose of the book to something more akin to that of an anti-religious polemic.Now, just like Krauss, I'm also happy to admit ""in the interests of full disclosure ... that I am not sympathetic to the conviction that creation requires a creator, which is at the basis of all the world's religions"" (p. xi). I'm also happy to admit that I was brought up Catholic and went to church until well into my early teens, and that I had stopped believing in ""God"", as such, by the time I left school, though I can't claim to be able to single out any particular point where I self-consciously renounced my faith. Despite that, however, studying the history of a whole range of different people whose entire socio-cultural and even political framework was (and in some cases still is) inextricably bound up with their religious beliefs has made me intensely wary of the whole ""science v. religion"" debate simply because the latter has played such a fundamental role in both the collective and individual human experience. While science may be defined as truth obtained through reason and religion as truth received through revelation, the fact remains that both of them, essentially, are based on ideas - and there can be no going forward unless people in opposing camps are willing to give each other's ideas genuine consideration. In The Coming of the Third Reich (2005), the brilliant first volume of his three-part study of the rise and fall of the Nazi Party, English historian Richard Evans argues that the only way to understand how Hitler's party could have gained control of Germany and wreaked havoc on Europe is to take Nazi ideas seriously, no matter how distasteful that may be. Theologians and scientists, I would argue (probably from a very biased perspective, but that can't be helped), could follow the historian's advice here and adopt the same approach. The exchange and serious discussion of ideas is one of the most profitable and most enjoyable things about being human, especially in an age where we know so much more about the world than we have ever known before. Krauss outlines some truly amazing and oddly beautiful ideas in this book. It is sad, then, that he detracts from the lustre of the ideas themselves by making frequent and thinly veiled denigrating remarks about religious conceptions of the origins of the universe. The content of A Universe from Nothing is endlessly intriguing, but the way in which Krauss forces it into the sardonic straitjacket of his anti-religious message mars the book even more than its other defects. A typically smug and caustic afterword by Richard Dawkins only makes things worse. Dawkins calls this book ""the knockout blow"" against religious ideas about the beginning, finishing the work begun by Darwin's roundhouse kick to ""supernaturalism"" on behalf of biology and the flurry of strikes landed by numerous scientists in between. Although Krauss has proved that it is no longer necessary to explain the universe through the agency of a creator, he does note, at least, that there is still much that we don't know, and perhaps won't ever know, about how everything came into existence all those billions of years ago. Dawkins' crowing pugilistic imagery on the other hand suggests that he himself has not read the book all that closely after all, or indeed grasped one of the most important lacunae in the ongoing debate between scientists and theologians. Dawkins can claim all he likes that theology lies bruised and bleeding on the floor while science pumps its fists in the air and basks in the adulation of a cheering crowd of onlookers, but the only certain truth right now is that the fight has only just begun.(Note: Being a grumpy, old-fashioned devotee of physical books, I didn't actually read the ebook - this edition was the only one I could find that has the same cover as my paperback.)"
39,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5576926-david,4,"Krauss's big idea in ""A Universe from Nothing"" is that starting with only space-time and all the laws of physics (e.g. quantum mechanics and general relativity), our universe can be accounted for. He refers to such a starting point as ""nothing"" (a nothing that I believe to be far removed from non-existence). This book is his attempt to neuter ""ex nihilo nihil fit"" as an argument for theism. As a Christian, I'm unsympathetic to Krauss's clear anti-theistic agenda and the biases that come along with it -- nevertheless, I couldn't help but enjoy this book. If anything, it's a clearly written and infotaining current snapshot of the best atheistic thinking on such issues.While Krauss gives a good review of the road by which we've reached our current cosmological understandings, he frequently smacks on the religious for describing the universe as they want it to be (as opposed to how it really is). However, he does a fair share of this himself in the second half of the book. Most of this comes from his dedication to the ""Copernican principle"", which has come to be more generally understood to mean that there is nothing very unusual about our time and place in the universe, or really anything in existence. Defending the Copernican principle leads him to spend lots of time speculating on various ""anthropic principle"" enabling theories. It's the old idea that the only universes in which minds could question their existence are those same universes that just happen to support conscious existence. The goal of the argument is to therefore assert that we're not unlikely at all, since a myriad of other universes must exist in which no one was around to ask the question. Under this principle, unlikeliness is not allowed, and many (usually untestable) assumptions will be made to prevent it.It's like when Stephen Hawking in his ""A Brief History of Time"" insisted that an infinite big bang / big crunch cycle would, throughout infinity, assume every possible outcome, thus explaining away the apparent unlikeness of our existence at this moment (however, Krauss and others demonstrated that there is no big crunch, so at least Hawking's ideas were falsifiable). These theories are asserted to be true, not because the science demands it, but because of the philosophical commitment for us and our environment to not be unlikely, because unlikely things (in the absence of a myriad of alternatives) naturally bring the supernatural into the discussion.He brings up some current unknowns, such as ""Why are there three generations of elementary particlesâ the electron, and its heavier cousins the muon and tauon, for example, or the three different sets of quarks, of which the lowest energy set makes up the bulk of matter we find on Earth? Why is gravity so much weaker than the other forces in nature, such as electromagnetism? Why is the proton 2,000 times heavier than the electron?"". So far so good, as these are precisely the kind of things science seeks to explain. But then he goes all anthropic-principle again, and suggests that the answers to these might be that all permutations exist, and that we're just in the universe with those particular constant values. That is every bit as bad as the ""just so"" religious arguments he criticizes. Krauss hypocritically does what he attacks the religious for doing, when he says ""the ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, not the comfort one derives from oneâs a priori beliefs, nor the beauty or elegance one ascribes to oneâs theoretical models"", and by quoting Sagan's âExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidenceâ.He smacks on string theory, which I'm happy to see: ""perhaps no theoretical picture has ever so successfully permeated the consciousness of the physics community without having yet demonstrated its ability to successfully resolve a single experimental mystery about nature"". He further explains that over the last 25 years of string theory, ""A 'Theory of Everything' had suddenly become a 'Theory of Anything'!"". But again, he does precisely this with his anthropic arguments based in his speculative (i.e. no stated approach for either predictions or falsification) multiverse assertions.At a few points in the book, Krauss bemoans the fact that in the distant future, due to the expansion of space, evidence for the big bang will not be observable. ""We live at a very special time . . . the only time when we can observationally verify that we live at a very special time!"" He admits that at such a future time, science would ""come up with a completely false picture of the large-scale universe"", but that this false explanation would be better than what religion would give you, of course.All popular atheist books throw a bone to the readers who still demand some semblance of meaning in their lives, and this one is no exception: ""A universe without purpose or guidance may seem, for some, to make life itself meaningless. For others, including me, such a universe is invigorating. It makes the fact of our existence even more amazing, and it motivates us to draw meaning from our own actions and to make the most of our brief existence in the sun, simply because we are here, blessed with consciousness and with the opportunity to do so.""Renowned atheist Richard Dawkins wrote the Afterword section, wanting to make sure the attack on faith was received loud and clear. Dawkins assumes a victory far beyond the reach of Krauss's arguments, summarizing with ""Even the last remaining trump card of the theologian, 'Why is there something rather than nothing?' shrivels up before your eyes as you read these pages"". Krauss had wanted Christopher Hitchens to write the forward, but his cancer had progressed too far by that point. Hitchens was no scientist, but then again, the point was to join the attack on theism, something that Hitchens did very well, and with undeniable style. (Everyone left a debate loving Hitchens. Dawkins could have learned a thing or two from him.)I realize this review sounds negative, but I'm giving this book a solid thumbs up."

I would need to read more about the subject to really grasp the understanding how a universe (and multiverse) can came through quantum fluctuations. The prerequisites to creating a universe is 1. space (or a empty ""vessel"" that can hold charge) 2. the law of physics. Once you have that, quantum fluctuations happen because ""nothing is unstable"" and in this unsuitability particles that interact create energy without violating the conservation of energy principle. I can somewhat get that, but I didn't really understand how you can get these particles into a infinitesimal spot that contains all our matter and energy in the universe to create the big bang. Good read for those trying to understand the modern scientific explanation of how the universe came to be. "

So if you feel like a starter to cosmology... thats the book!"
43,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,3,"Scientifically, this is a fascinating book. Philosophically, it is a train wreck.I read a small amount of cosmology and quantum mechanics. Not enough to be anything remotely like an expert, but enough to enjoy the genre with books like, for example, Spooky Action at a Distance, which is a fascinating glimpse into all the various kinds of non-locality. (By the way: the Goodreads insert book/author function is broken for me, or else I'd link to the books I'm mentioning.) Sometimes these books also veer into philosophy. A great example would be The Island of Knowledge, another book by a cosmologist that covers some very similar material to Krauss's book (e.g. the multiverse) and does so with a compellingly sophisticated review of the relevant history and philosophy.But whenever you get a scientist veering outside of their discipline, thing can go pear-shaped quickly and dramatically. This happens even with some writers that I generally agree with quite a lot. For every Frans de Waal competently linking in Freud you also get a Stephen Pinker who--as great as he does in his area of expertise--starts inducing forehead-slapping moments when he wanders into political science and philosophy.But I've never read anybody so catastrophically dense and self-assured as Krauss. (Although, in fairness, that's probably only because I can't stand Dawkins' smug self-satisfied smarm enough to finish a chapter. His afterword in this book is probably the longest single piece of his writing I've read.)Let me give you some very specific examples of what I mean. There are two premises to Krauss's book. One is a scientific premise: it explains how we could potentially get the entire universe via a Big Bang out of a quantuum vacuum. This book is excellent. Another premise is philosophical: it purports to answer the ""ancient question 'why is there something rather than nothing?'"". It does so by (1) redefining ""nothing"" to actually mean something else and (2) redefining ""why"" to actually mean something else. Krauss is very defensive about his sleight of hand. You can always tell his argument is getting thin when the spurious insults and glib put-downs start getting thick. He is especially harsh towards philosophers and theologians (which, bizarrely, he seems to view as basically the same discipline) and especially when they are most right and he is most wrong. His book is not actually about something emerging from nothing. It is about something emerging from the quantum vacuum, which he describves as ""a boiling brew of virtual particles that pop in and out of existence"". Let me ask you, do the phrases ""something from nothing"" and ""something from a boiling brew"" sound identical? No, they do not. Hence, the philosophers are right, Krauss is wrong, and so he isn't even addressing (let alone answering) the question he has posed for himself. He does the same thing, later on, with the word ""why"": ""[I]n science we have to be particularly cautious about ""why"" questions. When we ask, ""Why?"" we usually mean ""How?"" If we can answer the latter, that generally suffices for our purposes."" In other words, not only is he not going to tell you why something comes from nothing, but he's also not going to even try to address the ""why"" question, and instead will answer the ""how"" question and pretend that's just as good.And look, scientifically, it is. If he had just stuck to the science, I'd have enjoyed the book. But instead he spends an awful lot of time axe-grinding with irrelevant insults that make no sense. I get that he likes to argue with teenage Young Earth Creationists or whatever--and hey, everyone needs a hobby--but sprinkling your popular science books with adolescent put-downs just makes you look like a tool. Especially because the target of his ire--a demographic known for the being poor and uneducated--is a textbook example of punching down.In the end, this book is marred by the petulant whining of a spoiled genius who is frustrated of the fact he cannot admit: that his of expertise is not the only one of interest and significance. He can't answer the ""ancient question"" and some people actually are curious about it, and that's just how the cookie crumbles sometimes. He's got a hammer, and his biggest fault with religion really seems to be that it's not a nail.Of course, all of this pales in comparison to Dawkins' eye-roll inducing, over-the-top, ego-stroking afterword. Dawkins in all seriousness praises this book as being on the level of Darwin's ""Origin of Species.""If, on the origin of species was biology's deadliest blow to supernaturalism, we may come to see A Universe from Nothing as the equivalent from cosmology. The title means exactly what it says, and what it says is devastating.Take a breath, there, Dr. Dawkins. You're starting to hyperventilate. What's more embarassing (although this is plenty embarrassing already) is that Dawkins steps face-first into a pretty obvious philosophical conundrum that at least Krauss has the acumen to spot. The problem is this: based on the cosmology in the book, far-future cosmologists using the data available to them would draw the wrong conclusions about the nature of the universe relative to what our cosmologists think today. From Krauss:How do we know the universe is expanding? We measure the recession velocity of distance objects as a function of their distance. However, once all visible objects outside of our local cluster in which we are gravitationally bound, have disappeared from our horizon there will be no longer be any tracers of the expansion: no stars, galaxies, quasars, or even large gas clouds that observers could track. The expansion will be so efficient that it will have removed all objects from our sight that are actually receding from us. Moreover, on a time scale of less than a trillion years or so, all the galaxies in our local group will have coalesced into some large metagalaxy. Observers in the far future will see more or less precisely what observers in 1915 thought they saw: a single galaxy housing their star and their planet surrounded by an otherwise vast, empty, static space. This is a philosophical problem for folks like Krauss because if the validity of science rests on its ability to discern truth and if science predicts that future scientists will be unable to come to the truth by relying on science, then you've got a crisis. Krauss isn't blind to this, and so he make an argument about how science is superior even when it gets the answer wrong because at least it's a rational process. This is all reasonable, and I don't have a problem with Krauss's response. The problem is that Dakwins isn't as bright as Krauss. He notes the exact same problem of the (hypothetical) far-future cosmologist, also seems to recognize that this creates a problem for the authority of science, but then he doubles down and says that science is still superior to religion because it gets the right answers:Theologians may speculate about angels on pinheads or whatever is the current equivalent. Physicists might seem to have their own angels and their own pinheads, quanta and quarks, charm, strangeness, and spin, but physicists can count their angels and can get it right to the nearest angel in a total of ten billion. Not an angel more, not an angel less. Science may be weird and incomprehensible--more weird and less comprehensible than any theology--but science works. It gets results. It can fly you to Saturn, sling-shotting you around Venus and Jupiter along the way. We may not understand quantum theory--heaven knows I don't--but a theory that predicts to 10 decimal places cannot in any straightforward sense be wrong. Theology not only lacks decimal places, it lacks even the smallest hint of a connection with the real world. This is a monumentally stupid argument to make. In defense of the realization that science will get you the wrong answers sometimes, you defend it by saying that it gets you the right answers? Seriously? That's your move? Krauss and Dawkins must be good buddies, because there's no other reason to leave such an embarrassing specimen of poor logic in your book.So here's how things stand: I'd love to have just talked about the science of the book. That stuff was all very interesting and very cool. I gave the book three stars because of it.But the reality is that all of this nonsensical axe-grinding was really, really annoying. And, more than that, it was really, really poorly done. Krauss's main philosophical points were unambiguously and totally wrong. If the quantum vacuum is a seething, bubbling mass of particles than it's not nothing. That's not some bizarre, unfair, goal-post-moving ploy by spineless philosophers and theologians. That's just common sense. Ugh. There's more, but I think I've covered enough bases. Remind me to avoid anything by the New Atheists from here on out. These guys and the Young Earth Creationists and religious fundamentalists were clearly made for each other. "

âThe universe is far stranger and far richerâmore wondrously strangeâthan our meager human imaginations can anticipateâ¦Until we open our eyes and let nature call the shots, we are bound to wallow in myopia.â
 This book was quite short, but it was packed full of fascinating information. Kraussâs writing is clear and concise, intelligent and yet still very accessible. I also appreciated his sense of humor. I have encountered some of this information before, but a fair amount of it was new to me. While I canât claim to fully understand everything he discussed, for the most part I believe that after reading this book, I do have a firmer grasp on much of it. Iâll summarize the main points of interest below, so I suppose a spoiler warning is in order. Consider yourself warned.The book began with Krauss briefly describing major relevant historical discoveries in the fields of astronomy and physics. He then went on to discuss the geometry of our universe (is the net curvature open, closed, or flat?). He explained that by analyzing the cosmic microwave background radiation, or CMBR, scientists found that a flat universe makes the most sense. He discussed how, in order to account for the amount of âstuffâ needed to make a flat geometry feasible, we must have dark matter and, what I found even more interesting, dark energy. Our flat universe (the expansion of which is actually accelerating due to the amount of dark energy present) has roughly 30% of its energy in matter, and an astonishing 70% of its energy in âemptyâ space! During this discussion, he also touched on virtual particles (ââ¦that electron-positron pairs can spontaneously appear from nothing for a bit before annihilating each other again...â), and how these virtual particles are actually âresponsible for most of your mass, and that of everything that is visible in the universe.â (Side note: hooray for Feynman!) Krauss also pointed out that in our flat universe, the positive energy of motion (dark energy) is exactly cancelled out by the negative energy of gravitational attraction, and so the total average energy tends to zero.Krauss then posited that an inflationary period may explain the homogeneity and flatness of the universe, and may also have frozen otherwise invisible quantum fluctuations so that they then emerged after the inflationary period as the density fluctuations that produced the visible universe. If this is the case, we all would have emerged from what is essentially quantum nothingness. Then there was a chapter which speculated on the âmost plausibleâ future of our universe, which I thought could have been omitted. He also touched lightly on the idea of a multiverse, and the shortcomings of string theory. He finished up with a discussion of 3 different types of ""nothing"" (the laws of physics plus empty space, the laws of physics without any space, and neither the laws of physics nor any space), and attempted to describe ways in which science could explain how âsomethingâ could arise from each form of nothingness without having to rely on divine intervention. While I thought he did a decent job probing into the nature of nothingness and what exactly that could mean from a scientific standpoint, this portion of the book was a bit too conjectural to really grab me.Okay, I realize I may have gone a tad bit overboard in summarizing this thing! However, that is because so much of the material was really fun to think about, and hence fun to share here. Bottom line: the book was a fascinating read, but it tended to get too speculative toward the end. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who would like a concise, accessible introduction to cosmology."

The degree to which our best science here has advanced in the recent past is reflected by the understanding of the universe that we had just a century ago. At that time, it was thought that the universe was static and consisted of just one galaxy: our own. In the past 100 years, though, Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized how we understand space and time and the physical processes operating at the very largest of scales, while quantum mechanics has revolutionized how we understand these processes at the very smallest of scales. It is the development of these theories in particular that has provided us with our current understanding of the universe.However, the picture of the universe that these theories have furnished us with still leaves us with an apparent problem: What existed before the big bang? Surely something must have existed beforehand, for if nothing existed then something (indeed everything!) came from nothing, which seems absurd. Indeed there are few things more intuitively implausible than that something can come from nothing. In the philosophical community ex nihilo, nihilo fit (from nothing, nothing comes) is appreciated to be a self evident premise, and one of only a handful of postulates that are completely indisputable.The apparent contradiction between the universe beginning at a finite time, and the premise that something cannot come from nothing, has often been used as an argument for the existence of an uncaused cause, or creator (most often understood as God). However, in his new book `A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather than Nothing' renowned physicist and cosmologist Lawrence Krauss argues that a full understanding of the science that has yielded our current picture of the universe also allows us to see that something can indeed come from nothing. Thus, for Krauss, science can in fact do the work that it is often thought only God could manage. As Krauss puts it (borrowing a line from the physicist Steven Weinberg), science does not make it impossible to believe in God, but it does make it possible to not believe in God (p. 183). In introducing us to the science that allows for the possibility of something coming from nothing, Krauss takes us through the history and evolution of physics and cosmology over the past century, beginning with Albert Einstein's theory of relativity in 1916. In the course of this journey we learn about what our best science says about the basic make-up of the universe (including the existence of dark matter and dark energy), as well as what our best science tells us about how the universe (likely) began and where it is (likely) heading in the future.

46,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4796031-armin-books,4,"As I have finished reading the book on Monday, I have to say it was not as bad as what David Alberts had characterised it on New York Times as âPale, small, silly, and nerdyâ. Similarly, it was not as good and ground-breaking as what Richard Dawkins purported it to be the âOrigin of Species of physicsâ. I would evaluate the importance and relevance of this book somewhere in between these two extremes. The book starts with some background on the history of physics and cosmology in the first three chapters. I particularly liked the part explaining the works of Edwin Hubble and how he came to the conclusion that the universe is not static but expanding. The discussion on the premise of the book âA Universe from nothingâ starts on chapter 4, âMuch Ado about Nothingâ. In this chapter he talks about particles and antiparticles and how particles can appear spontaneously out of nothing as long as they disappear in ever-shorter times. Chapter 5 is dedicated to spelling out the energy of empty space or as it is more commonly known the Dark energy. In chapter 6, he returns to the subject of nothingness. Given the fact that our universe is a âFlat universeâ, he asserts that in such a universe gravity can and will start out with an empty universe- and end up with a filled one. Apparently, the flatness of our universe is the key to the hypothesis that our universe could have sprung out of nothingness. A flat universe is very special indeed, as its total gravitational energy is Zero (Negative gravitational energy cancels out positive energy of matter exactly). Chapter 7, âOur miserable Futureâ talks about the future of our universe. Based on all the current evidence on the rate of inflation, the future that awaits us is dark and cold as we march toward eternal nothingness. But maybe, as my friend Michael Lopresto explained to me yesterday, this future is not dark and gloomy after all, if only we change our mindset about the whole eternal existence being any superior to non-existence. I am not sure.In chapter 9, he returns to his favourite subject, the question of whether there was a creator. According to him, it is not just that a creator is impossible to exist; it is more the case that modern physics renders him/her unnecessary. He also warns us about the danger of asking all too many âwhyâ questions. He views âwhy questionsâ quite pointless as they presuppose some kind of purpose or intentionality. A much more worthwhile attitude he believes is asking the âHow questionsâ instead. And so he rephrases the title of the book: âHow there is something rather than nothingâ. Finally, on chapter 10 he posits, âNothing is unstable.â He also mentions the presence of some parallels between the topic of the book and the nature of life in the universe and its origin. He continues to the next chapter with an analogy to moral philosophy which I found illuminating. To conclude, read it for yourself but don't trust all the fantastical reviews, but make up your own mind. It is a fast read and is thought provoking."
47,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,0,"I already know that there is no god. Further, that it's a waste of energy to think about the existence of one. Discussing religion is akin to feeding the trolls - just stop.I wanted to read this book to learn more about modern physics/ cosmology. But I didn't want to just get the general ideas and impressions of what I was reading about; I wanted to actually *understand* it. And I couldn't. About 1/3 thru I skipped to the epilogue and afterward, which were fine, but, again, irrelevant. Maybe I need to read an actual textbook that takes a reader step-by-step. I know I'm theoretcially smart enough to understand this stuff, but since I haven't studied physics since the '80s I just don't have the background, nor do I have the agility to dive into a book like this without it. I'll seriously consider watching the video that inspired the book, though.Oh, and I do appreciate the diagrams that actually show why the universe is expanding in all directions away from us, *as if* we're at the center."
48,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71115989-liliana,2,"As most reviewers have pointed out, this book came to be after the enormous success that a lecture by Krauss had on Youtube on the same subject. I haven't seen it personally, but I must admit that I am inclined to recommend you to see it instead of reading this book. Or listening to it, which is what I did.Now, don't get me wrong, I found the topic very fascinating and, while I think it could've used a better audiobook narrator (it is Krauss in my version), Krauss' writing was quite engaging and accessible. However, the book didn't need to be as long as it was, and I got the gist of it pretty quickly. Especially because in Krauss' exploration of the topic, he decided to go beyond physics to more philosophical meanderings, but his superficial approach of these didn't add much to the argument. In fact, I feel like it might have detracted from its objectiveness. Some of his key concepts, e.g. nothingness and flat universe, I think could've used more explanation. I also don't think he actually answered the main question of ""why"" something emerges from 'nothingness'. I might have missed something, but I'm pretty sure he just said ""because it can"".Besides that, I found some of his remarks... slightly unnerving, let's say. Most likely something very entwined in my personal experience, but for example when he talked about how coincidental acts that are interpreted by some people as having meaning, really don't have any. Namely, someone dreaming of something and that exact thing happens the day after. Paraphrasing here: ""oh, in such an immense span of space and time, anything can happen, so don't take that as some sort of sign"". Hmm, ok? I don't even think that has anything to do with his argument, so that seems kind of a jerk move to me.There are really interesting points of discussion presented in this book, nonetheless, and in its majority I found it enjoyable. Namely, I liked the discussion on dark energy, dark matter and general relativity. But I probably should've just watched the lecture."
49,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20388505-muhamed,3,"Krauss gives a summary of the scientific discoveries of the past century to arrive at the conclusion that something can come out of nothing even though at the end he answers the question 'why is there something rather than nothing' by ""well there won't be for long"". While, I very much enjoyed Krauss's writing and ideas, I think the last chapters weren't convincing enough. For example, what he learnt from his friend Steven Pinker regarding a morality without God, is very debatable. He claims theologians (and philosophers) do not contribute at all to the society yet he takes his notion of morality, ironically, from his philosopher friend. Is that how insignificant discussions of morality to Professor Krauss, that discussing them is a waste of time and as long as a friend assures us about them we can go about our lives discovering new scientific theories? He quotes his hero Feynmann, that the motivation behind his scientific work was to merely ""find out"" about the universe. I remember now how disappointed I felt when I read Feynmann's biography to find out his derive to find out more meant that he would contribute to technologies so harmful to mankind without ever asking if what he is doing is right. While, I have so much respect for the personal and professional character of Professor Krauss, I don't think this book manages to deliver what it promised to do. What it does however, is to give a lot of clarity to the question."

A lot of times I understood what he was saying but not really how he came to that conclusion. There were things that I understood and found interesting and other things I didn't understand and would like to read more about on my own. The afterword by Richard Dawkins did help a good deal, as I think Mr. Krauss, while undeniably intelligent, wasn't always able to explain things to the uneducated person(namely me). The Big Bang Theory was something we went over quick, fast, and in a hurry in my Bible Belt Public School, so the parts about that were particularly interesting for me.It was when we got into Dark Energy and how the universe is inherently flat but not flat in the sense I want to think of that I began to feel this book didn't explain it well enough for me to understand. It's still an interesting read, and I'm glad I read it! I don't really get the whole ""This is Bible Bashing"" complaint I see in a lot of reviews. He lets the science argue for itself, and if you felt personally attacked reading this book, chances are you are more than a bit self conscious about your own beliefs to start with."

52,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62086210-sabbir-saadat,4,Lawrence Krauss is clearly one of the illustrious communicator of science of this time. This is hard science from him- do pick it up only if you have a solid background in theoretical physics. 
53,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12872086-sheeraz,5,"Great read that made me reevaluate my agnostic perspective. One of the easiest argument for divine creation is the existence of anything as opposed to nothing, and the author tackles it from two directions - 1) Using the anthropic principle: something exists because is it didn't, we wouldn't be around to make that observation, and 2) Citing results from research in physics about how it is indeed possible for something (matter-antimatter pairs) to emerge from nothing, and how even space itself can spontaneously inflate. The book was riveting and one of the very few where I want to go back and read it again so I can better contextualize all the studies and arguments the author has put together. Recommended for anyone who has pondered these difficult questions and wants good intellectual stimulation while getting educated."

55,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4031665-fungus-gnat,3,"Krauss gives a more-or-less historical tour through the last hundred years of cosmology, from the single-galaxy universe and the steady-state theory through the implications of general relativity, the triumph of the big bang theory, the expanding (and then possibly contracting) universe, through dark matter and ultimately to the wierdnesses of dark energy, the expansion of space itself, the multiverse, and the creation of something out of unstable nothing. To someone like myself whoâs only read bits and pieces on cosmology for the past couple decades, this book is a revelationânot least because itâs actually understandable through most of the story. Given the abstruseness of the concepts as delivered as simply as I suppose Krauss can for my benefit, I have to think that the abstraction of this material from the actual science, which must be expressed in indecipherable mathematics, must have been just a mite difficult.Nonetheless, this is challenging stuff. Krauss has the fortunate habit of repeating what heâs said, often more than once, which is necessary given the mind- and brain-bending phenomena he discusses. Nonetheless, I bet he would be disappointed to know that, despite his best efforts, his careful walks down logic trails and his quirky little diagrams, some of this material is just not comprehensible to me. It left me feeling at times that maybe if I tried poking around in my Scientific American archive, I might find some helpful supplemental narrativeâan odd reaction to a book-length synthesis. Krauss seems to be eminently fair to scientists who have turned out wrong, and to those who now disagree with him. His treatment of string theory, of which he is not fond, is a good example. He does not, however, always acknowledge skeptics. For instance, he devotes quite a bit of space to the multiverse concept, without much of a second thought, but a doubting article in, well, Scientific American about six months ago suggests there is another side to this narrative.Cavils aside, I would consider A Universe from Nothing as an impressive achievement in science popularization (and, thankfully, a concise one, at 60K words). Krauss, though, has another agenda, which he does not execute as well. He continually erects religious and philosophical bogys whom he then easily knocks down. Like Jesus clearing the money-changers from the temple, Krauss clears the mystics from the house of science, which to Krauss is the entire universe. Now, there may indeed be some benefit in laying out the evidence for a materialistic view of the universe when religious shamans maintain that only the existence of God could explain this or that natural phenomenon. But if reasoning to God from the natural world is a fantasy easily punctured, Kraussâs attempt to reason from the natural world to the nonexistence of God is scarcely more credible. Krauss does not explicitly make an argument for atheism, but it is clear when he says that God is not needed to explain X that he has little or no appreciation for a God who permits what is to be. Saying that science can demonstrate why something comes from nothing takes nothing away from that possibility. Krauss would be better off sticking to science; once he gets beyond it, he no longer enlightens.  "
56,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46791595-travis-swart,1,"I read A Universe From Nothing not long after it came out. At the time, I was exploring both sides of the argument for the cause of our universe. It is one physicistâs attempt to explain how the universe could have come into being without a divine creator (e.g. from natural causes). Itâs a prime example of how desperate atheist scientists are to find a natural explanation for the existence of our universe. In this case, heâs literally grasping at strawsâstraw man that is. Kraussâ ultimate point is to show that on the quantum level, matter can pop out of ânothing.â Therefore it might be possible for these fluctuations to have generated the Big Bangâânothing is unstableâ he asserts. In order to demonstrate this, he builds what Iâm calling a reverse strawman argument. First he builds the strawman by redefining what ânothingâ is in order to fit the definition to his own devices. Then he props his theory up with misleading evidence. At several points in the book, he gives examples of particles popping in and out of ânothing.â It is immediately apparent to anyone who paid attention in high school physics and chemistry classes what this ânothingâ really is out of which these particles pop. They are in fact converting back and forth between a state of matter and energy in an electric field! This is the case in each of his examples. Einstein stated this relationship rather simply in his famous equation E=mC2. We know that matter and energy can change forms in different circumstances. So this is nothing more than a sleight of hand game preying on the scientifically ignorantâfor whom he does do a good job of writing the book in laymanâs terms.By the end of the book, his argument relies on two faulty premises in order for this process to have caused the universe. 1) It requires that some kind of electro-magnetic field has to have been in existence from all eternity for these particles to convert from energy to matter. However, we know through Einsteinâs General Relativity that all matter and energy, space and time came into existence at the Big Bangânone of it is eternal. The Second Law of Thermodynamics reinforces this about our universe. If there was no eternal energy field, then the laws of physics which allow for this process to occur couldn't have even functioned. 2)All laws of physics rely on the existence of timeâno time, no natural laws of physics to cause any of this to happen in the first placeâagain, Einstein established this a long time ago. Since time came into existence at the Big Bang, there was no time before it to enable any laws of physics. Physicists such as Steven Hawking have tried to work around this problem with inventive theories involving things like âimaginary time,â but of course, such theories fail in the real world. Other theories have come out since, but ultimately must succumb to this truth.No time = no energy = no functioning laws of physics to bring about what Krauss is describing in this book. The straw man quickly falls apart once the faulty supports are removed. In the end, he only establishes that there is a need for something to be eternal in order for our universe to have an ultimate cause. And we know that nothing in this material universe is eternalâeven electric fields. What options do we have left once we rule out the laws of physics as being the cause for the Big Bang? "
57,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7564683-rene,3,"I am not a scientist by a long shot, but I have long been interested in astrophysics and cosmology. Those scientists who are truly enthusiastic about what they are discovering are infectious, and those that are not only enthusiastic but capable and patient teachers spread the excitement of science far and wide beyond the walls of the NAS.There aren't a lot who are both, and I have always appreciated those busy with complex research who are so excited by what they're doing that they are willing to stop and try to explain it ""to the masses"". I have seen blurbs and excerpts of Dr. Krauss' work before so I bought this book fully expecting to like it.When Dr. Krauss takes the time to explain the processes behind current and past cosmological discoveries, this book is endlessly fascinating and thought provoking, and it leaves you wishing he would have explained more. In a way, it raised more questions than it answered, which is exactly what introductory learning is supposed to do.  Unfortunately, you have to constantly deal with the distraction of his constant pot-shots at theology and a whole side-plot about whether or not this can prove the ability of the Universe to exist without the need for a ""Creator"" that is constantly derailing the main narrative. It is frustrating, unnecessary, often pointless, and distracting. Several times he makes the point that science isn't theology and theology isn't science. He acknowledges that proving or disproving the existence of God isn't a scientific question. Therefore, I wish he would have listened to himself and resisted the temptation to add his own theological musings. I found myself impatiently skimming over these parts, trying to find my way back to scientific narrative he had suddenly dropped to indulge in these thoughts. Perhaps that is the real point of the book, but that was not the reason I wanted to read it.Astrophysicist Dr. Alex Filippenko, while he has not written an equivalent general publication book, is equivalently knowledgeable, an excellent teacher, and willing to leave theology out of his lectures, and I'd find some of his work if you're interested in general cosmology and astrophysics without the side of religious politics. There are definitely gems of knowledge and discovery in this book and Dr. Krauss' wry sense of irony and humor is infectious, therefore I'd still say it is worth a read so long as you can either sweep aside the annoyance of having to skip through all the pointless theology deductions and/or desire to read those in addition to the science of ""something from nothing"""
58,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,3,"This is a difficult book. Krauss starts with a description of the universe as we now understand it. Describing the history of cosmology in the few pages he has available is an ambitious task. There are many difficult and non-intuitive concepts involved, and while recent reading enabled me to feel familiar with some of these, I was left short on a few areas (e.g inflation, string theory and flat universes). Since this book is written as an argument for a certain viewpoint, the need to take certain 'facts' on face value felt unsatisfying. The ironically unique, or special, place in space and time we humans have to observe all this is well illustrated. Regardless of ones view on other conclusions he makes, I suspect most would agree that our special place is fairly awe-inspiring.The second half then elaborates on the possibility that the Big Bang event could feasibly have had its origin in nothing. At this point, many of the points become more philosophical, since we don't have physical evidence for what did happen, unlike many of the points made in the first half. There are two main lines of argument here, the first being that what we do know suggests nothing may have the potential, or reality the capability, for something to come of it, whilst the second line tends to be that physically based arguments, even if unprovable, are better than theological ones (since they don't assume 'something' to begin with). Whereas the first half required some background reading to understand the concepts, the second requires a leap of faith (or for some a leap off one onto another perhaps). While non-theists would no doubt accept the arguments easily enough, and theists, like me, find them uncomfortable, the existence of anything if nothing was the starting point must be a difficult jump for anyone.The conclusion, regarding the theological discussion, is that of 'soft' atheism: science does not make belief in God impossible, but it does make disbelief possible; without science everything is miracle, with science perhaps nothing is. Unfortunately, by the time I got to the end the scientific content had become mixed with the philosophical, and it was hard for me to untangle these details. Others may have more luck than I did, but I'm not sure this one has nailed its goal."
59,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,4,"""A Universe From Nothing, Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing"" is the first book I read by Lawrence Krauss. It dares to explain big question which only theologians and philosopher tentatively had [sort of] answers. It starts with particles soup in the Big Bang to the first star and other modern cosmological aspects.I admit this book is a bit beyond my comprehensible knowledge of cosmology, but I didn't read it with nothing to remember. I could push through to know a bit of history of modern since after Copernicus and what was behind Einstein's general theory of relativity. The book also indicates that we humans, especially astronomers, are living in a very special time right now since the traces of magnificently cosmological events such as the Big Bang, the picture of the infant Universe etc., haven't been erased yet; beings in the next billions or trillions years won't be as lucky as we.Moreover, some questions which are considered to be the intersection of science and religion are also answered. As the book puts it, sometimes, people point out that science just another kind of faith, but it is not. Scientists change their minds, admit they are wrong, and are happy and eager to throw out ideas that turn out not to work. They donât presume to know for certain the answers to questions before they ask them. So yes, they have faith that the universe is comprehensible, but the greatest thing about science is that their faith is shakable. At any moment they can give up believing in anything they once believed in, if nature suggests otherwise.Science, as physicist Steven Weinberg has emphasized, does not make it impossible to believe in God, but rather makes it possible to not believe in God. Without science, everything is a miracle. With science, there remains the possibility that nothing is. Religious belief in this case becomes less and less necessary, and also less and less relevant.I may return to this book once I'm more knowledgeable at cosmology so that everything in this book would be more comprehensible for me."

PD. I am agnostic and dont believe in inteligent design by no means"
61,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3215206-oscar,4,"Great book. A concise overview of the progress made in the past century, from Hubble and Lemaitre, passing through Einstein and concluding with modern cosmology. All the way from the belief that the Milky Way was all there was in a static Universe, to the expanding Universe we now know we are living in, to talk of the multiverse. All leading into the overwhelming and awe-inspiring conclusion that all of this knowledge - in combination with the best of our knowledge from quantum physics - consistently points towards our Universe very plausibly popping into existence out of nothing - sans deities. Some of the physics might take some patient reading to grasp, but the overall point - we know enough to dispense with the necessity of a supernatural god to create the Universe, the laws of physics are sufficient, is very clearly and elegantly presented.Curiously, Krauss has publicly stated to not have much love for philosophy, and it is precisely the parts where he combines scientific facts with philosophical reflection that shine the most."
62,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,4,"This is a very well crafted overview of current developments in cosmology. Among the topics covered are the theoretical background and empirical evidence for the big bang (e.g., the cosmic microwave background radiation and the relative abundances of the light isotopes), the discovery of the accelerating universe, and, with some emphasis, the empirically confirmed prediction that the universe is ""flat"", which implies that it is a ""free lunch"", in the sense that the positive energy measured from the presence of matter is roughly balanced by the negative potential energy. Krauss then notes how the measured vacuum energy potential of the universe differs from predictions of theory by 120 orders of magnitude -- the cosmological constant paradox.The only aspect of the book that was a bit tiresome is the author's frequent assertions that belief in God is nixed by these findings. Even persons who are not particularly religious will recognize that the author is off on a tangent here every bit as pedantic as that taken by some religious fundamentalists. "
63,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3600868-vincent-russo,4,"One of the constant counters I receive from debates between myself and the faithful when discussing religion is their propensity to think that something arising out of nothing is absurd without the intervention of a creator. This spontaneous and perhaps counter intuitive notion when posed to a species that evolved to gauge the speed of an approaching predator is of course seemingly absurd on the surface. As it happens of course, there are scientifically verifiable and plausible causes for the spontaneous creation of something from nothing devoid of a divine entity. I would like to recommend this to people who impose a divine creator, however from the two known articulately barbed authors (Krauss and Dawkins), the outright degradation of religion in the beginning and throughout the book (which I loved) may rub some the wrong way. Even so, if you are on the correct side of the religion fence, this book may serve as anti-bullshit cannon fodder for those who attempt to justify their arguments with divine fairy tales. "

But the book does not work! There is a problem when theologians corner scientists and tell them that they are wrong (about the existence of God, the creation of the universe, etc,); there is also a problem when scientists attack theologians and tell them they are wrong/foolish/misguided/superstitious/stupid! These camps speak different languages and have completely different requirements for proof. What a cocky, presumptuous book. I gave it two stars only because I learned enough to make it a worthwhile read."

As I have started reading the book I am almost got glued to it, as it gradually picked up and took off very fast in later stages. Each phase, it left with an awe about our universe we live in, narrating how it might have originated and how it would end also( with bit scariness). Things such CMB experiments and the conclusion that let to make the shape of universe are exiting. But the very subject of bring 'something from nothing' as Krauss attempted to do so was not very convincing to me, nevertheless it is seems a possibility that cannot be neglected. Additionally it has encouraged me into learn more physics, which is something resembles like universe itself. The more you learn, things you dont know expands further and recedes fast out of horizon.

I don't want to spoil it, but it involves the negative energy of empty space, quantum fluctuations and an inflationary early universe. Of course, we don't really know what happened, and perhaps we never will. Our best evidence at this point only hints of a possible origin, and the whole thing is difficult to grasp. On a daily basis, even small objects don't just appear out of nowhere ... let alone enough matter to form hundreds of billions of galaxies. Yet that's what quantum theory predicts.

When I understood that it was first a youtube talk, I watched that which was much easier to understand.Dr. Krauss takes great care to explain the range of cosmological discoveries in the effort to prove that a universe made from nothing does not require a deity. Unfortunately, I didn't get it and listening and reading all of his cheap pokes and jokes made me more hostel and resistant to his theories. He should take his own advice that proving or disproving the existence of God isn't a scientific question and stick to the science that he knows so well. "

He's capable of doing ground-breaking research and then he can turn around and tell me about it with style, clarity, and charm--without making me painfully aware of how little I really know about modern-day physics. There are some pretty tangled sentences in this book, but Krauss' enthusiasm renders them sort of endearing. It's as if he didn't write this book so much as spill it out verbally in a long burst of excitement and inspiration. You can just see him grinning behind some of these pages, saying to you eagerly, ""Isn't that just so cool?"" It is. "

The reason Iâm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is the following: if the book is written for lay-people (non-physicists), itâs mighty hard for us to understand in places. The author is often able to break down the concepts and translate the beautiful science into something the rest of us can understand and when he does, itâs brilliant. That being said, this isnât a book for scientists and there are parts where this reader, at least, would have appreciated a bit more explanation. Iâd read it again and again though!"

It is an awfully slim volume for the subject matter it claims to discuss, and I soon found the reason why. Rather than being a book on popular science, as it is marketed, the book is really a thinly disguised attack on religion. If you want to learn something about science, skip this book.

80,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8582121-xiaomaea,5,"As this is a rather weighty book, bear with me in a longer review, if you're interested.Is this book worth your time? And there will be a significant amount of time invested in it, because this isn't light reading.The short answer is that I gave this book five stars because I thoroughly enjoyed it; it made me think, and opened up avenues of thinking - which is what I want from any good book, fiction or nonfiction. Is it well-told? That's what I look for. This book is very difficult to understand; there is no way around that. The concepts discussed are those of astrophysics and cosmology, and if you're daunted by particle physics, quantum theory or general relativity, this book is not for you. About four-fifths of the book is dedicated to explanations leading to and the ultimate answer to the title of the book: why is there something rather than nothing? Laurence Krauss takes the reader step-by-step, chapter by chapter to and through the concept of our universe being a flat universe; he explains how this sort of universe requires a certain set of things to occur or to already have occurred. He explains how a period of rapid inflation and a big bang are consistent with what we now know about and observe in our universe. He explains how fluctuations in either empty space or no space at all could bring about the myriad galaxies and billions of stars we can observe - and that if human beings live long enough, we eventually will not be able to see any longer. Whatever characteristics the universe - or a multiverse - has, following the evidence is exciting and fascinating: and we live in one of the (on a cosmic scale) brief times in history when this evidence can still be observed.These concepts aren't easy to discuss or to understand, much less to explain. I admire Mr. Krauss' ability to deliver most of the explanation to a layperson such as myself so that I can honestly say that I understood about 80% of the content; I'm not sure I can explain it as well as I'd like, which probably means I'd need to re-read certain portions again - if you can't explain it, you might not understand it, as the maxim goes.The last fifth of the book - mostly concentrated in the chapters at the end but also interspersed throughout with connected commentary - is dedicated to the idea that a Creator or a Being outside of time, essentially God, is not necessary. Mr. Krauss is up front about his views in his introduction, and for the most part, he is able to present his views without rancor. There are several occasions, however, where he uses wording that indicates obvious disdain for theological concepts or those who argue for them, on a logical basis. For the reader who identifies with those beliefs and wants to be well-informed scientifically, or who is looking to see where they disagree, this can be off-putting. Final conclusions: this is a fascinating topic - and the book is well-written, for the most part even for those who aren't experts. If you're a person of faith, I recommend struggling and wrestling with this topic the way that Jacob wrestled with the ""angel"" at Bethel. It's worth your time."
81,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5986736-ashwini-nocaste,5,"http://thalukinglass.blogspot.in/2014...I like to imagine all of existence as a fully blown balloon twisted in the middle with the opposing ends twisted in directions opposite to each other, so that it looks like a 3D symbol of infinity. One of the ends of that balloon is, of course, our observable universe. I also like to imagine and try to apply characteristics of things observed around in our world to the dynamics of how things play out in the universe. It is something like drawing an analogy between, letâs say gravitational forces of heavenly bodies and attraction between two human beings. I know it will seem absolutely preposterous to draw such an analogy but the reason why I believe so lies in the idea that all that there is, is just one energy, but manifesting itself differently, both characteristically and behaviorally, at different scales and levels. The same energy at heavenly scales becomes the attractive force of gravitation and the same energy at quantum levels becomes the energy of dancing uncertainty. And since energy exists in one end of the balloon (which is observable space), an equal amount of non-energy should also exist on the other end of the balloon so as to balance the ebullience of the energy in the other end. There is something on one side, and there is non-something on the other side and together therefore they make Nothing, but together they are also Everything that there is. Hence, Nothing is Everything, or Everything is Nothing â an upanishadic quote that became the root from which my current imagination of our existence sprouted.But the existence and sustenance of this energy requires a first cause or a creator of this energy or a prime mover of this force which compels this energy to move through shapes, vaccums, objects and creatures. Prevalence of observable and consistent laws acting throughout the universe reveals a picture of a well structured evolution of our universe and therefore does away with the need of the âFirst Causeâ requirement, because if it did exist, then there is absolutely no telling as to when the First Cause could become an intervening cause. This problem is resolved by Deistic arguments that postulate a First Cause that had a role to play only in the beginning and thereafter the universe was left on its own to evolve as it deemed fit on the basis of the laws initially made. But none of that explains where this energy or the âFirst Causeâ really came from? Now let me take you back to my balloon version of existence. We see one side of the balloon twisted in the middle through which energy courses through myriad forms, and therefore we see that there indeed exists something. However for something to exist, there has to be some principle or law, if not purpose or meaning, on which that something comes into existence. Though at this juncture, I was greatly inclined to conclude a first cause principle, Krauss beautifully shows how ânothingnessâ as opposed to âsomethingnessâ that we see is essentially unstable and a boiling brew from which quantum fluctuations cause virtual particles to pop in and out of existence in such short periods of time that they essentially do not exist. However such virtual particles do exist, according to Krauss. These virtual particles that âliveâ (speaking simplistically) only for very short durations carry the potential to affect other particles, however microscopically small. What causes these quantum particles to pop in and out of existence? We may not know why they do so or who makes them do so, but they really do so and that fact was figured as a possible reason for the big bang explosion that expanded our universe in every possible direction. This now makes me imagine of universe in another way. It can be like a kettle of boiling water, with the universes in it akin to bubbles that pop in and out existence (albeit over gargantuan periods of time) due to being affected by the way particles in a quantum fire below it interact with it, for however brief periods of time. Call it an inconsistent picture, if you will, because quantum fluctuations occur within the universe (in this case, inside the kettle), than below it, and moreover it again requires a cause, otherwise who would have lit the fire? Regardless of the inconsistencies in the way I paint my universes in the colours of my imagination, I derive utmost pleasure in forming different mental portraits as it makes me really wonder about the fascinating ways in which energy transforms through and takes different shapes. Scientific adventures into metaphysical curiosities are fraught with theoretical incompleteness, but nonetheless have a remarkable potential to boggle a person and cause a mini big bang in his neural activity. I knew my time was well spent in reading Lawrence M. Krauss after I came across this sentence in his book, âA Universe from Nothing: Why there is Somethin grather than Nothing.ââHowever, a negative charge moving backward in time is mathematically equivalent to a positive charge moving forward in time.âThat added force to the way I imagine existence to be, (existence includes the universe and much more apart from it), so that what ever we see or observe, has a direct parallel in another dimension, which we perceive to be opposite to ours, though which ought not to be opposite in its own right. But who am I to clarify any of it further, when even Krauss admitted that Universe behaves very strangely. Despite all of its rationality, logic, and scientifically proved equations, observations and experiments, I believe Krauss avoided dismantling the entire scientific muscle in this arena after calling our times as very propitious for knowing the true nature of our universe. He remarked that scientists in another system trillion years ahead in time will live in a universe that will have inflated so much that their galaxy would be the only one observable to them and all that would be observable apart from that will be empty dark space, thus potentially occluding any evidence of the big bang. I honestly think that the same could be applied to us in much the same vein, that what we are observing about the universe might be completely different from how it must have been 13.72 billions years ago (our estimate of the universeâs age) and all preceding contrary evidence must have gotten occluded? Krauss could have added something to counter this potential line of thinking or if he had put it unconnectedly in some page previously, I failed in figuring so.I like these kind of books chiefly because they help me expand my mind and learn of newer ways of thinking and looking at the world and our universe. This happened after my mind did odd-degrees of somersaults back and forth after reading Hawking's BriefHistory of Time and Sagan's Dragons of Eden. Those two books did not make me a scientist overnight bubbling with a quantum enthusiasm of scientific curiosity, but what they did indeed was to add new dimensions to my creative imagination and this is what I expected out of this book too and was thoroughly not disappointed. I will not end up remembering the scientific logic in the book, but I will be really thankful to the book for adding another image of the universe in my mind (remember the kettle earlier?).Finally, the idea of a universe coming from nothing and going to nothing is an idea that I deeply espouse because that idea provides a sense of closure to me and to know that science is also deeply rooted into unearthing answers to that hypothesis is a very comforting piece of news."
82,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1866292-g-branden,3,"I liked it, but not as much as I wanted to.I'll begin with my gripes and then pivot to what I liked.1) No end notes, no suggestions for further reading, and no bibliographical references of any sort. Personally, I only let Asimov get away with this, and him only barely. Besides, he is dead and cannot hear my complaints.2) No math. This will surely be a plus for many people. Not for me. If you're going to use advanced physics to take a stab at answering an age-old philosophical question, and try to talk people out of their belief in God to boot, doing so by only implicitly relying upon the mathematical models that are so convincing to the author asks, if you will, too much of a leap of faith from the reader. Granted, not everyone wants to learn enough physics to follow modern cosmology (I certainly may not end up with that much background myself). But the social contract of science is ""show, don't (just) tell"". The advantage over religious truth is that a lay person can take the math to a knowledgeable expert and seek independent verification.Drawback #1 combined with drawback #2 almost knocked this down to 2 stars for me. These are anti-synergetic flaws.3) Richard Dawkins, a man whom I otherwise respect (I've read several of his books, starting with 
The Selfish Gene
 almost 20 years ago), far oversold the virtues of Krauss's book in his afterword. I do not think there is any way this book will end up being regarded as on par with Darwin's 
On the Origin of Species
. See drawback #2. Darwin's work was epochal because he spelled everything out in an empirical avalanche and analytical tour de force. (Caveat: I've only read excerpts of Origin myself.)4) A Universe from Nothing suffers from a semantic problem thrust upon it by the forces it seeks to battle. In Victor Stenger's 
God: The Failed Hypothesis
, the author's case against God depends (as he frankly acknowledges) heavily on how one defines ""God"". Some people, including friends of mine who identify as Christian, do not consider themselves supernatural theists. Stenger's critique thus fails to resonate with them. Krauss's book has a similar problem in that a great deal depends on what one means, precisely, by ""nothing"", and in that this concept turns out to be a tricky one when you get quantitative and precise about it. Krauss, too, acknowledges this difficulty. But it is another case where a bit of fundamental philosophical groundwork should have been laid. Platonic ""realists"", or people who resemble them even unconsciously, likely are not going to be convinced by Krauss's discussion of virtual particle pair-formation, even though this idea is now something like a century old and has a lot of empirical support.However, if drawback #4 was my only gripe with the book I'd have loved it. Krauss, like Stenger, is on a scientific, not a philosophical mission. (In fact, Krauss denigrates philosophers at almost every opportunity, an attitude that would be unfair were it not for the efforts of Jacques Derrida alone, to say nothing of his disciples.) But again, if one wants to confine one's mission, so much more desirable is a footnote or endnote directing the reader to a philosophical exploration of ""nothing""--so drawback #1 strikes yet again.Back on the gripping hand, we've all had experience with people who will equivocate until their dying breath. They also seem to be the sorts of people who write reviews of books they haven't read. It's easy to understand why Krauss doesn't want to take the first step towards people who have sworn before the altar of God never to meet him halfway.5) Flipping to the authorial photograph on the jacket, I find myself wondering how I can trust a physicist who looks uncannily like Stephen Merchant.(Okay, I'm kidding with that last one. But it *is* spooky...)The things I liked about this title are more straightforwardly enumerated. Except I already enumerated, so I'll, er, alliterate:A) The subject is inescapably interesting, at least to me. Cosmology--the study of the origin and possible fate of the universe is a literally a wonderful subject--full of wonder. Krauss's enthusiasm for his subject shines through, and he is, shall we say, philosophical about some of the stranger and lonelier potential fates (such as what Wikipedia calls ""The Big Rip"", though Krauss doesn't use that term).B) Krauss provides capsule introductions to many physicists of whom you may not have heard, such as Vera Rubin. I never mind a reminder that science progresses through the efforts of actual human beings, and it's nice to know a little about them. Giving just enough biographical information to identify what made a person noteworthy, and what was personally interesting about them (for instance, the lengths to which Rubin had to go to get her Ph.D. in astronomy) without digressing too far from the conceptual matters at hand is a real skill, and one Krauss practices masterfully.C) Krauss is unapologetic about his atheism and at the same time offhand about it. This is, in my view, exactly the right approach. The world doesn't need your story about how you were de-converted, or never religious in the first place. Atheism should be a consequence of the workings of your mental apparatus, not a first principle. Multiple public opinion polls in the United States have shown that atheists are America's ""most distrusted minority""--more so even than gays and Muslims, against whom discrimination is at least regarded as somewhat controversial, or as requiring restraint under some circumstances. I infer that there are a substantial number of evangelical Christians who would rather fly on a commercial passenger liner flown by Mohammed Atta (were he still alive) than by an atheist. (Fortunately, they are ignorant of the religious attitudes of the pilots I know, as they are of so much else.) The problem is obvious to me--plenty of Christians know atheists, but don't *know* that they know atheists. Krauss sets a good example. For a book that supposedly bolsters atheism, Krauss has surprisingly little to say about it. He lays out the cosmological physics (albeit without math, sigh) and lets the reader wield Occam's Razor for him- or herself.D) In spite of his dearth of references, I did infer from Krauss that Alan Guth's famous 
The Inflationary Universe
 is worth my consideration. I will certainly be looking into that to see if it can fill in the many gaps that this title left for me.Bottom line: this might be a good introduction to modern cosmology and a few wacky quantum-mechanical concepts for lay people who are a bit more lay than I am, but it's certainly no Origin of Species."
83,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20246339-peter-a-van-tilburg,5,"Krauss makes clear without mathematical elaboration that the universe is rapidly expanding and that this expansion can be understood by the mass particles which we cannot observe directly. This mass is needed because the mass of the visible matter would be attrackted among themselves which would imply an implosion of the universe. Virtual particles pop up and disappear again in very short time moments. This is âfrom nothingâ. These particles explain the mass we are missing. The expansion of the universe will ultimately imply that we cannot see it anymore as the mass ourside our cluster cannot be observed anymore. The fact that we are able to see it is therefore special. According to Wijnberg this can be explained by antropic selection implying that there are many universes so that inevitabile in one of them (ours) the conditions optimal are. Because we see that there is matter there should be an imbalance between matter and anti-matter in some time amd instant. The empty space apparantly is instabile then. In the small asymmetry the creation takes place. Krauss states that attributing the first movememt to God a complexity that adds an element which in itself has to be explained. This seems not logical. In his opinion the mulitversum assumption as basis for our universe makes more sense. I am impressed by the knowledge which has been build up by a great deal of people on our universe. Does this influence the way I see God? Apparantly the laws of nature can explain much more then I assumed. It is plausible that the big bang occurred and the virtual particles and empty space also seems plausible. I think the multiversum assumption is far fetched, letâs say a leap of faith. Just like in biology the large number of occurrences is used as argument to explain our existence. I find it hard to understand the first causes and am inclined to give God a role here. Further one can experience Him in your personal life and hear about Him from old (biblical) and new (testimonial) stories."
84,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12339709-felix,4,"This book is an eye opener! I learned so much, about the cosmos, the history of the universe and more.I'll start with the bad - the book is hard to read as it is filled with deep explanations in the field of quantum physics and other research and without basic understanding of the topic I think people will get lost. Also, the writer uses half smart half funny philosophical debates about physics which sometimes are annoying. Too much use of the word 'nothing' although it is necessary for the idea. The good: Since I'm Jewish but I don't ""like"" religion of any kind it is hard for me to get into any serious debate with religious people as I had no real data to present them and they twist it against me.Now, not only my beliefs (not that the universe needs my faith in it) got stronger they also got facts.Here is some of the notions I took from the book and the reading that came after it: - Evolution is not a theory - its a fact, even the weird parts of it has explanation. And I wasn't a fan of evolution by the way. - The Big bang has been proven scientifically and even the age of the universe is determined. No maybe, no opinion, no theory - it is proven! The data is there- The universe is not empty and most of all does not need high power to exist.- Matter and space can come out of nothing - This is something that religious people often say ""how something so vast and infinite could come out of nothing"". Usually their answer is that some invisible being (that came out of nothing by himself) HAD to create it.. So no, IT doesn't. Matter and space can exist from nothing. In conclusion: People who hold strong religious beliefs will discard this book even before starting it. And most of people on earth doesn't even know that some of the biggest questions in the world has already been answered. I think that the scientific society should get involved with education more instead of just saying - they are stupid let them be. "
85,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce,4,"Lawrence Krauss' book is a fun summary of the evolution of cosmological thinking from Galileo to today. It's humorous and highly readable, although I confess the author still lost me at parts. Armchair theologians and deists beware: Krauss is not a believer in the supernatural, and despite best attempts (for him) still comes across as a bit contentious/contemptuous of the idea of God. Why bother? Krauss' whole thesis rests on an evidence-based portrayal of the natural world. If he's right, persuasion is irrelevant; we all ultimately experience the same natural consequences. At p. 146, he says flat out, ""Occam's razor suggests that, if some event is physically plausible, we don't need recourse to more extraordinary claims for its being."" Yet having strung together an elegant (and still emerging) picture of physical laws and their function as an engine of cosmological history, he proceeds to make a wholly unnecessary non sequitur argument, writing:Consider an electron-positron pair that spontaneously pops out of empty space near the nucleus of an atom and affects the property of that atom for the short time the pair exists. In what sense did the electron or positron exist before? â¦There was potential for their existence, certainly, but that doesn't define being any more than a potential human being exists because I carry sperm in my testicles near a woman who is ovulatingâ¦. In any case, if potential to exist were the same as existence, then I am certain that by now masturbation would be as hot button a legal issue as abortion now is.Still, while quotable, this example of fallacious reasoning is an anomaly in the work as a whole. If Krauss at times unnecessarily hostile to supernatural explanations for naturally-explainable phenomena, the basis for his impatience is exceedingly clear.It's been over a month now since I read this, so let me do what I can to briefly summarize Krauss' thesis from memory and a few select notes (yes, I took notes), with sincere apologies to the author and other physicists for totally bollixing it up. Let's start with the premise of science itself. Krauss' scientific philosophy ties the level of confidence in our worldly knowledge to what we repeatably and repeatedly observe. As for extrapolations from these observations, he is with Karl Popper in requiring scientific theories to make falsifiable statements to be taken seriously or considered interesting.In human terms, the universe is so incredibly large and longstanding that it is difficult for the mind to grasp, and yet consistent, continuing, and independent observations of multiple, correlating phenomena establish a sturdy conceptual framework from which we can further build. Thus Krauss takes us from discovery to discovery, locking in the existence of quantum particle fluctuation with not a little help from the Swiss, and triangulating the Big Bang from a host of unrelated data that requires only a bit of diligent staring to cobble together. As he puts it at p. 20, ""Nowadays, one way to see a supernova is simply to assign a different graduate student to each galaxy in the sky. After all, one hundred years is not too different, in a cosmic sense at least, from the average time to do a PhD, and graduate students are cheap and abundant. Happily, however, â¦ since supernovae explode once per hundred years per galaxy, with 100,000 galaxies in view, you should expect to see, on average, about three stars explode on a given night.""We are surely privileged to be living at a time when it is possible to use tools to gain primary evidence of things ranging from infinitely vast to infinitesimally small, from age-old to near instantaneous. What to make of the strangeness of miniscule antiparticles, which are hard to see, short-lived, and exceedingly rare? Should we view them as Krauss suggests at p. 62 ""in the sense that Belgians are strange? They are not really strange; it is just that one rarely meets them."" Could there be a divine plan in all this? For the author (p. 6), if ""metaphysical speculation is independent of the physical validity"" of the cosmos, it ""is irrelevant to our understanding of it."" Yet without metaphysical explanations, how do we explain the ultimate origins of existence? After all, we are hardwired to seek causality. Logic itself is built on the premise that everything comes from an arbitrary somewhere. First positions are always fiat.That's nothing. And what Krauss ultimately teaches is that nothing is unstable. Of course, ""true nothingness"" turns out to be nontrivial to define. Is it absence of matter? Of energy? Of the potential for either? Is it nonexistence or pre-existence? Philosophically and logically, where nothing is defined as an absolute negation â ""not X,"" where 'x' is anything you care to name â the very idea is undefinable. Whatever results, some new absence emerges by inserting another ""not,"" leading to the knotty paradox of seemingly infinite regression.So empty spacetime is not truly ""nothing"" inasmuch as it now appears to be filled with dark (really, ""non-radiant"") matter and energy. Nor can the space within atoms be said to be empty; we can now predictably find particles and antiparticles popping out of the void and annihilating one another like so many kamikaze soap bubbles. We've learned that the universe is expanding; but we're discovering that this applies not only to the fabric of spacetime (which is directly observable, whatever it may be), but also (and this is extrapolable) the space between spacetime. These ever-expanding gaps make possible whole new universes. Moreover, each of these newly-erupting universes operates or much more likely, dissolves, collapses, or implodes under their own respective sets of unique, self-consistent physical laws. Thus does nonbeing give rise to being, as something is always coming from nothing. It's the norm, just the way the cosmos is wound.And so Krauss proceeds to write God out of the equation. Either God exists wholly apart from an infinitude of possibilities, in which case, God is irrelevant. Otherwise, and with extrapolable evidence for a frothy nothingness that continuously foments newly observable matter and energy, ""the requirement of an all-powerful deity who somehow exists outside of our universe, or multiverse, while at the same time governing what goes on inside it"" ceases to be plausible. ""It should thus be a claim of last, rather than first, resort."" (p. 146 again) All in all, it's an amazing overview. I can't say I fully understand the cosmology he describes here or its full implications, but it's oddly comforting to learn that I don't need to take any of it on faith."

If you have a general understanding of physics and quantum mechanics it will be a fun read but if you havenât refreshed or learned about the fundamentals of these subjects it might be a bit confusing at times. For instance, when Krauss discusses the origin and ultimate end of the universe he assumes that the reader has an a priori understanding of the four forces and how they function. Furthermore he assumes his reader is not only educated in these fields but also accepts empirical evidence provided by science over religious dogma. With that being said, it seems a bit futile to even dispute the âGod of the Gapsâ argument or any theological ideologies throughout the book because his assumed reader wouldnât be in that demographic. In the instance that his reader was a religious person who denied empirical evidence, his arguments wouldnât be substantial enough to sway their opinion in a different direction. Therefore the argument against God or theological ideologies would best be saved for another book.*im not sure how to do a second review after my second read so Iâll just add it to this one! This is definitely a book that should be studied more than just read and I will probably read through it a third time before the year is over. I generally donât reread books back to back like this but this book was a special case. There was so much information on physics, quantum mechanics and string theory that it would be challenging to retain all of the information with one single read unless you were already a particle physicist or something of the sort. I really love this book and think there is much to learn from this more than what most general science books will teach you. With that being said, I still stand with my original view that it might be a little challenging to grasp all of these concepts without a prior understanding of physics and quantum mechanics. If youâre looking to get a general understanding before reading this book Iâd look to A Brief History of Time and Astrophysics for People in a Hurry or Crash Course on YouTube also has a lot of information on these topics. Iâll end this review with a couple of quotes I really enjoyed!âThe best answer I have ever heard to the question of what it would be like to be dead is to imagine how it felt to be before you were conceived. In any case, if potential to exist were the same as existence, then I am certain that by now masturbation would be as hot button a legal issue as abortion now isâ âScientific ethos is based on three key principles: 1) follow the evidence wherever it leads2)if one has a theory, one needs to be willing to try to prove it wrong as much as one tries to prove it right 3)the ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment, not the comfort one derives from ones a priori beliefs.â âA truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implicationsâ âReality doesnât owe us comfortâ"
87,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/523305-prooost-davis,5,"""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" is a question atheists are often asked by believers. My own simple answer before I read A Universe From Nothing (or before I heard hints from other publications on this subject) was ""Why does that question necessarily imply a God? Why not other explanations?""Lawrence M. Krauss, a particle physicist turned cosmologist, gives us science's latest ideas on how something might come from nothing, and in fact may have been inevitable. And how, given further eons, the something we know may just well become nothing again.We happen to live in a place and time where we can look out and see the light from billions of galaxies, and can see that they are accelerating away from us. Should there be any observers anywhere in the universe, say, a trillion years from now (they won't be earthlings, since our sun will have long since burned out), galaxies outside their own gravitational cluster will have receded to the point where their light can no longer be seen. Those observers will not be able to figure out that they inhabit an expanding universe. Something I never would have thought about.Quantum physics and cosmology are not easy subjects to get one's head around. I certainly don't understand them very well, but this little book is compelling for the curious."
88,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92765494-robin,2,"Lawrence presupposes that metaphysical materialism is true (Read Bernardo Kastrups latest work for very solid arguments that it is not) and tries to paint a picture with the much limited knowledge of our current physics, and some quantum physics. He readily ignores experiments in quantum physics that point in different direction, like those where the primacy of the observer (consciousness) prove to be of major importance. Check out physicist Thomas Campbell who write about these instead and you'll find someone who isn't bound by dogma.The myth of creation he paints is the same old, coming from current paradigm of materialistic ontology. Everything is accidental, without any meaning. When anything close to religion is mentioned he promptly ridicule it. I'm not religious in the ordinary sense myself, but I fully understand its legitimacy and viewpoint - which is a philosophical one, outside of science.Lawrence say that people confuse the questions ""Why"" and ""How"" only so that he can try and paint up a how and tell us this is the same as why. This kind of reasoning is so naive or deliberately misleading that I'm not going to comment on it any further than that.If you want to understand contemporary materialist, go for it.On a quest to understand the existence we're in? This won't help you.Try going back to the old esoteric texts of Hermes and start from there instead."

Are we basically just made up of a set of particle/anti-particle quantum fluctuations that arise from basically nothing?This book discusses these questions and gives some background to how we arrived at other scientific insights. He gets very technical in the last 1/3 of the book so if that isn't for you just skip those parts. Some of the concepts he discusses are so mind-bendingly insane it almost seems like he is discussing the supernatural instead of the natural (i.e. virtual particles).He covers a lot of ground and I think makes great arguments for how we know what we know when it comes to physics and cosmology, while taking as many shots at the super-conservative view of God and religion as he can. He does as good a job as any to explain virtual particles, better than Feynman in my opinion. I also think he does a better job of condensing the research on the flat universe compared to Brian Greene's book, as well."

Such discoveries are truly eye-opening and reveal, on a quantum level, the bizarre nature of empty space, i.e. ""nothing"".Krauss explores ideas of General Relativity and Quantum Physics. Amongst other things, he writes about the implications of different geometries of the Universe, the evidence for the Big Bang, dark energy, inflation and the implications of quantum gravity.Ultimately, the book undermines the credibility of Theologians and Philosophers in the pursuit of truth about our reality.This is a 5 star read for anyone interested in Science, Philosophy and Theology.The chapters are nice and short, however at times difficult to read for those not already pre-exposed to ideas of cosmology. I wish I could rate this 4.5 stars."

As such each chapter ends with a âcliffhangerâ, because almost each next chapter reveals new insights which changes what was understood in the previous one. That made for an intriguing read! But also it is confusing. Just as one thinks this is it; some new development is described. A new development that sometimes goes back in time. Fascinating to read how from seemingly âemptyâ space our whole universe evolves, including us humans. => So that means for me that space is not really empty. It does contains something after all!Or as Krauss puts it: âHidden in what seems like empty space - indeed, like nothing - appear to be the very elements that allow for our existenceâ.The book describes how the Big Bang theory became a fact, based upon empirical data.It explains why the universe we live in is flat.Matter created via quantum fluctuations out of seemingly nothing.That is the stuff that is explained here.Fascinating as said.After chapter 6 it becomes more and more theorizing. Now I really got to understand what physical theorist are doing!Much of these later chapters is still theory. Not yet verified by empirical data (like String Theory or the multi-verse). But still very plausible. And that is enough for Krauss.He emphasises that thru science alone we can understand our surroundings: ââScience provides a possible road map for the creation of space (and time) itself - and perhaps also an understanding of how the laws of physics that govern the dynamics of space and time can arise haphazardlyâ.Because as he states it: ârelying on invisible miracles is the stuff of religion, not scienceâ.Is there a First Cause? We donât know and Krauss dismisses this question. He focusses solely How there is something from nothing. He stresses could have. We may never have enough empirical info. But it is plausible and that is significant for Krauss."
92,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41396647-peter-corrigan,4,"A fairly 'quick' read on one of the most abstruse concept possible, the origins of the universe. Krauss does a good job summing up the development of the physics over time and their incredible implications. I was somewhat pleased to read his somewhat perplexed reaction (compared to my utter confusion) to string theory having recently finished Brian Greene's earlier effort (The Elegant Universe). I was less pleased with his recurring need to joust with the 'creationists' and theists. There is little common ground to even debate on in my mind, the two 'camps' are literally a universe apart and the twain shall never meet it seems. Science for all its power and beauty can never really answer the 'why' although Krauss gives it a heroic effort. Still, there is so much in this thin volume that I need to revisit already, the importance of the Cosmic Background Radiation and the Cosmological Constant, the criticality of a 'flat' universe, dark matter, dark energy, etc. I really wish he had provided a list of suggested further reading or any kind of reference section. It is a serious debit in an otherwise fascinating little book on a BIG subject."
93,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4394019-robin,4,"Krauss is clearly brilliant, and knows lots of interesting things, but that only occasionally comes through here. There are stunning, universe-redefining revelations, but theyâre often presented in a scattershot, unstructured way. Having an editor to trim the already slim volume would help, as well as keeping Kraussâs typically absent academic mind on one topic for long enough to explain it properly before moving on to the next shiny theory. Also, thereâs ill-advised patter about philosophy and theology to no apparent end besides getting on the New Atheist gravy train, and Krauss gets way too hung up on the anthropic problem (without even defining it!) for his own good. Still - worth the read to know why weâre all here, just be prepared to fight for the knowledge. Like being a passenger in a Ferrari driven by someone with a twitchy foot, itâs a jerky ride, but when it goes, it really goes. "
94,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55180466-akhil-munjal,5,"One of the finest pieces of cosmological literature that I am so glad I chanced upon. I listened to the audiobook which was beautifully narrated by the author himself. Even though I thought I knew alot about the latest and greatest in humankind's understanding of the universe, this book managed to teach me so much more and in fact left me with a very different worldview then what I had before reading it. For example I was surprised to learn that most of our universe is actually dark energy and this fact snowballs into a expanding universe which will leave humans of future with nothing to see in the night sky. However bleak as it may seem, the fact that random particles are able to come in to existence in our universe from absolutely nothing, gives me hope that we are generally moving in the right direction and as a reader I must always remember to accept the universe rather than try to listen to theologians make random justifications. Epilogue by Richard Dawkins was the cherry on the top and I have to recommend this book to any one curious about our universe."
95,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1915261-scott-lupo,4,"Author Lawrence M. Krauss attempts to answer the age old question of how the universe started without getting caught in the endless regression of ""first cause"" or having to settle for some supranatural phenomenon or being. The first thing he defines is the word nothing. Nothing in the fabric of space and time is actually something. He goes on to describe how virtual particles pop in and out of existence and the expanding universe. There's a lot in this book to digest and it's all very fascinating. The crux of the book is that nothing is actually unstable and the universe was created a certain way because it had to, although he leaves the door open for other universes (multiverse) to have the possibility of other characteristics unknown to us. In the end, something will always arrive out of nothing. Mind bending! "

In any case, even in a universe with no miracles, when you are faced with a profoundly simple underlying order, you can draw two different conclusions. One, drawn by Newton himself, and earlier espoused by Galileo and a host of other scientists over the years, was that such order was created by a divine intelligence responsible not only for the universe, but also for our own existence, and that we human beings were created in her image (and apparently other complex and beautiful beings were not!). The other conclusion is that the laws themselves are all that exist. These laws themselves require our universe to come into existence, to develop and evolve, and we are irrevocable by-product of these laws. The laws may be eternal, or they too may have come into existence, again by some yet unknown but possibly purely physical process."

98,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75978047-francis-bezooyen,4,"This is the second of Krauss's books that I've read. It confirms my experience with the first one - I find him harder to follow than other's who write similar material. There were definitely some sections that I just didn't understand. I would like to re-read it sometime in the hope of improving that situation. That said - the parts I did understand were very interesting and illuminating and compel me to come to Krauss's defense against those detractors who accuse him of misrepresenting the kind of ""nothing"" that is being referred to in the question ""why is there something rather than nothing?"". Typically, these critics focus on the part of the book where he treats empty space as ""nothing"" and point out that this empty space is not truly empty due to the virtual particles etc to be found there and fail to acknowledge that Krauss himself concedes in the book that this is a valid criticism and that he then goes on to explain how it has been shown that space itself can emerge from a state much more profoundly like the kind of nothing they have in mind and that this kind of nothingness is fundamentally unstable.Personally, I think that last point is critically important and a conclusion that one can arrive at through a philosophical mode of analysis as a necessary empirical fact without understanding the how of it. The simple of it is that the kind of ""nothing"" that so stumps us is one in which this nothingness is the only state that exists in any sense and is unalterably stable. So defined, this is a state that is logically restricted from ever giving rise to or even co-existing with anything at all. And yet, we do exist. The conclusion that this latter fact should make glaringly apparent to us then is that the pristine, idealized, nothingness that we imagine when we ask why there is something rather than nothing _cannot_ exist. That this is so remains mysterious to me and yet it seems to be an unavoidable conclusion as is the conclusion that the closest thing to a state of nothingness that can exist must be fundamentally unstable, else, again - neither we, nor any God, or any form of anything, could exist in any way."

Additionally, since most of my listening time is spent in transit, I can easily get distracted if the material requires a good deal of concentration. ""A Universe from Nothing"" requires the reader's full attention - at least, any reader who comes in without some basic knowledge of cosmology (i.e. me). Eventually I gave in and got the e-book version of this as well so that I could read and listen at the same time, and this dramatically improved my understanding of the material.""A Universe from Nothing"" is an expansion of a YouTube talk that Lawrence Krauss gave for the Richard Dawkins Foundation that ended up going viral. Whereas that talk lasted for about an hour in length, the audio of ""A Universe from Nothing"" lasts five and a half hours. As a result, I would encourage the layman (again, that'd be me) to start out with the YouTube lecture as it succinctly sums up the argument Krauss makes here (and has visual cues to boot!) ""A Universe from Nothing"" is best grasped by those who have some understanding of cosmology and want to delve deeper into the topic. The topic, while hard to grasp, is nevertheless a fascinating one. I won't attempt to summarize the book's contents here because I would prove woefully inadequate at doing so. Needless to say, Krauss answers that question often posed by theists to atheists, ""why is there something rather than nothing?"" In short, because there has to be. The state of nothingness is so unstable as to basically make ""somethingness"" a foregone conclusion. Now imagine that concept explained in detail over 200 pages.Krauss is such a brainiac and so passionate about his subject that he has the tendency to sometimes forget that his readership just isn't as smart as he is. As as result, he'll start talking about things like String Theory, Dark Matter, and God Particles, while providing little to no initial explanation of what those things are - assuming that his readers already have some basic understanding of these concepts. Sadly, I did not, and Google proved a very useful - and necessary - companion piece for Krauss's book. Krauss does wax poetic and beautifully about certain concepts, like the knowledge that all human beings are the result of atoms that were cast out by exploding stars, or supernovas. So it is, he says, that the atoms that make up your right hand are very likely to have been from a different star than those making up your left. ""We are all stardust,"" he writes, later adding that we ought to ""forget Jesus"" as it was the ""stars that died for us"". Here we come to a common criticism of Krauss that is the same we find in other scientific works or works about biology that come from atheists like Richard Dawkins. That is the belief, firmly held to by theists, that science and religion aren't incompatible. Indeed, many of the negative reviews of this book are from religious readers upset that Krauss throws the occasional jibe at religion. To which I say, OF COURSE science and religion are incompatible! How is a person supposed to believe both in the Big Bang and Natural Selection and that Jesus had to come to earth to die for our sins? The very idea is laughable. The idea of some kind of eternal state - either Heaven or Hell - where human beings go after they die? Clearly contradictory to everything we know about the universe and that Krauss writes about here. It is always necessary to refute this kind of religious nonsense because in addition to being simply wrong, it's dangerous. It's dangerous in a world where funding for scientific and medical research (e.g. Stem Cell research) is denied because those with the power to grant this funding are themselves brainwashed by religious dogma. If for no other reason, ""A Universe from Nothing"" is essential reading for its ability to further expose the nonsense that is religious belief and shine a light on the wonder that is the universe."
108,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,3,"This entertaining little book was planned to be flanked by two bulwarks of atheism: Richard Dawkins, who provides the glorious afterword, and Christopher Hitchens, who was supposed to write the introduction to the book.This planned structure says something of the motivations of the book: part scientific, part anti-religious.The scientific parts works well, as far as I can comprehend them (though admittedly it's not easy for a non-specialist to comment on the validity of particular theories in theoretical physics!).The problem lies with the anti-religious, anti-theological, anti-philosophical works. They are crude and unconvincing. They might be true, but that is beside the point.For a writer who claims to want to one-up God's account in Genesis, one should be willing to put yourself to the task with some humility.The core argument is that one doesn't need a ""prime mover"" or a ""creator"" to get the whole universe rolling. I feel that Krauss manages to titillate some nerves and ruffle some feathers - but a decisive blow against the theology of creation and the philosophy of nothingness this is not. (One can always say in return: ""alright, but WHO made the universe so that something can arise without an antecedent cause?"") Science may throw up any number of facts, but without the logical subtlety of Thomas Aquinas and the power of persuasion of Jean-Paul Sartre, it cannot win hearts and minds. I am one of those people who doesn't need further convincing of the awesome explanatory power and beautiful poetry of science, so maybe I am not the target audience... but I find it an implausible assertion that a non-believer would repent and amend his superstitious ways from reading this book. That said, I really, really, do hope so!Frankly it is a shame that the question of theology is so prominently displayed here, since it only clogs up an otherwise interesting cosmological tale of the origins of the universe. 2/3 of the book are straightforward theoretical physics, and those are the good bits. For a lay reader they provide a fantastical tale that sounds too weird to be true, but that apparently resonates with the scientific consensus consisting of the very best minds of our times. The world really is completely amazing!Whether quantum fluctuations can give birth to ""something out of nothing"" - even entire universe - is a fascinating proposal, and the basic tenet of the book, that ""Nothingness is unstable,"" lends itself to impressive and dizzying mind tricks. The book is nutritious food for thought even for philosophers and theologians, even if the author doesn't make the most of the evidence that he so dutifully presents.The story consists of black holes, multiverses, a short history of competing scientific hypotheses, space exploration, anecdotes about Richard Feynman, impenetrable mathematics, and even more juicy anecdotes about Richard Feynman...Unfortunately all this good stuff is marred by amateurish anti-theology. The book would be better without it. If something good needs to be said about the atheistic pseudo-philosophy, at least we can take solace in the fact that another gallant (if feeble) sword is directed at the Beast of Religious Belief. Religion, after all, is responsible for uncountable tyranny, stupidity and bloodshed. I applaud the spirit of the book, even while deploring the execution. PS. You may have noticed that I have said little about the science of the book. That is because it's just too difficult. I mean WTF, you can't expect a social science major to comment on black holes!Sometimes the wisest thing is to shut up in the presence of a mystery."
109,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1478144-john,3,"I finished this book very much in two minds about it. So far as the content itself was concerned, I had no quibbles: this gave me precisely the explanation of something-from-nothing that I wanted while at the same time offering me a good (and in my instance timely) update on the state of modern cosmology.I also liked very much the fact that the book isn't burdened by apparatus: it eschews the standard dozens of closely packed pages at the back of references to papers I'll never read. I get fed up of this unnecessary crap at the back of supposedly popular science books: it's not as if the author is planning to lie to me. (Besides, as has been amply demonstrated, dishonest authors can use the apparatus to aid their deception.) (I get doubly fed up when, as has happened, my publishers force me to burden a book of my own in this way!) (The worst of all is when the end notes mix these useless references with informative additional stuff that should have gone into footnotes, so that you keep having to scrabble to the back only to find, most of the time, that you've come on a wild-goose chase.) It was a pleasure to read a popular science book without this constant distraction.Rant over.And I liked Krauss's attitude toward string theory. It's plain that he himself doesn't hold much hope for it, but instead of simply dissing it or ignoring it he gave it fair air time while explaining his reservations. His approach left me with a welcome thirst to find out a bit more about string theory, of which I know abysmally little.So far so good.What really irked me about the book was how goddam sloppy it was! Clearly the people at Free Press hadn't thought it was worth doing a final proofread, because there were countless literals; most commonly, these consisted of what seemed to be copyediting changes where the original version had accidentally been left in the text alongside the substituted one (so that, as it might be, altering ""What really irked me about the book"" to ""What really pissed me off about the book"" resulted in ""What really irked me pissed me off about the book""). On two or three occasions I found myself flogging my brains to understand something only to realize that the obstacle to my comprehension wasn't (just) my habitual stupidity but the fact that there was one of these maddening copyediting hiccups. There was the introduction of the Horizon Problem, only for us never to be told what the Horizon Problem actually is. There was the diagram described on page 18 with a merry ""I . . . reproduce it for you later in the book""; in fact, it's on page 112, as some previous reader of my library's copy had thoughtfully noted in the margin so that others didn't have to go searching for the blasted thing. There were sentences that rambled on forever to no good purpose. (I have nothing against long sentences in principle. I object to the ones that are in effect several shorter sentences joined up repeatedly with ""and"".) There's the use of the term ""meta-galaxy"" to discuss the result when, in the far future, our local cluster coalesces; after checking the dictionary, I still don't know what Krauss thinks the prefix ""meta"" means. I assume he was aiming for ""mega-galaxy"" but got distracted along the way.Overall, then, a mixed bag. However, if you want an answer to the perennial creationist objection that ""you can't get anything from nothing"", this is the place to look; the book's much recommended on that basis."

The conclusion is the latest installment in the progression of cosmic nihilism that started with Copernicus in dethroning the centralism of humans in the universe: Earth is not the center of the solar system, the solar system is not the center of the universe, the laws of heavens are the same as those on Earth, homo sapiens is very much old, the universe does not need a creator and finally it is one of uncountably many (maybe).This books is somehow similar to Hawking's ""The grand design"", as the conclusion is the same and the general attitude of disdain for religion and theology is as apparent. The present book focuses much more on the fundamental role played by the energy of empty space in driving our current understanding of the laws of physics and the cosmological state of things; it also presents less history of science and at the same time more philosophical reflections by the author (plus a short crystalline postface by Dawkins to nail the coffin of the theology of the gaps - although Dawkins' comparison of the present book with Darwins' Origin of species is an exageration of sorts, if only because here Krauss is proposing no new theory but only popularising current scientific knowledge). So there is ample overlap yet also specific material that can be found in both books. Between the two, I tend to prefer this one, as it exudes less scientism (of which Hawking is a grand if myopic proponent) while leaving place for awe and reflection. Particularly, in unraveling what the energy of the vacuum implies (flat universe, eternal inflation and emergence of universes from nothing as allowed by the Uncertainty principle in quantum gravity, the current ideal window of time to confirm experimentally the expansion of the universe and the Big bang, the emergence of space itself and of matter from space by fluctuation of the nothing, the problem of the 120 orders of magnitude of error in calculating the energy of vaccum itself), Krauss goes much further than Hawking's latest vulgata - somehow, Krauss prolongs the causal sequence in the progress of theories from Maxwell onwards that in Hawking's book is so well sketched (the additional nodes are Dirac's first combination of quantum theory with relativity which predicted, to his initial despair, antimatter, and then Feynman's intuitive explanation of antimatter through his graphs, arising the concept of continuous production of particle-antiparticle pairs prescribed (since not prohibited) by physics below the Planck time and length). In both books, Feynman plays the role of the prescient hero.Ultimately, as Steven Weinberg witted, science makes possible not to believe in god, and here we have further evidence. Krauss however refrains from concluding that all knowledge will ultimately come from science, because it is not a given that a ultimate theory exists, and if it exists that we get to know it, and even then this will only set the rules of the game, which we still need to play ourselves, if only philosophizing about it."
111,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1410379-armand,5,"here is my best take on ""A Universe From Nothing"" of which I understood some, but not all- There exists some kind of primary space, which is not the ""outer space"" that we think of when we think of ""space"". This primary space has qualities that we don't understand and it either A) infinitely big and expanding at crazy speeds or B) Science doesn't have tools to measure or understand it. (We theorize it exists because evidence of the emergence of our Universe strongly supports the existence of this primary space.) Within this primary type of space, our kind of ""empty space"" can emerge. This is the kind of empty outer space that we picture when we think of Star Trek, black stuff filled with little more than star dust and maybe passing light. This space, while empty of matter and what we consider ""normal energy"", still carries a certain energy which scientists call dark energy or ""the cosmological constant"" which pushes space apart. In fact, if this dark energy/ cosmo. constant did not exist, then all the galaxies would start to crash together due to gravity. Instead, the galaxies are rushing away from each other at ever faster speeds.When this empty space emerges, either it or the dark energy (I got confused reading this part) can spontaneously create matter and antimatter pairs. These are tiny particles and their negative counterparts. These tiny matter and antimatter particles usually smash into each other and annihilate each other, leaving a balance of zero energy. This apparently happens ALL THE TIME as a very small scale.However, sometimes this ratio can change and you can have more matter or antimatter. As in the case of our ""big bang"", the ratio of matter to antimatter began to favor matter. When this happens, it can reach a sort of boiling point which is called ""inflation"". During inflation, empty space can start to expand at a crazy rate. One thing that I learned from ""A Universe from Nothing"" is that while nothing can move faster than light through space, space itself can expand at a rate far, far faster than the speed of light and that has been happening in our Universe for a long, long time, so that even though light is shooting out towards the limits of empty space (the empty space is which is expanding into the primary space that we don't really understand), light cannot ever reach the ""end of space"" because space itself is getting bigger at a much faster rate.So this is how a universe can be spawned. According to modern theory, universes may be spawning all the time, all within the prime space that I mentioned above. By definition, most of these universes will be empty universes or maybe just beds of radiation. Only by chance will some universes reach the right level of matter vs. antimatter, the correct level of gravity vs. cosmological constant that will produce galaxies and other organized structures.Hence, the main idea of the book is that, by observing the underlying structures of our universe and the big bang that created it, we can see that ""empty space"" can spontaneously generate matter and energy. If this happens enough times and in enough places, then you can have an infinite numbers of universes. Some of these universes are bound to organize matter into galaxies. And, finally, that there is a lot of evidence to suggest that this is true."

I confess that I can feel his pain. I have always found the standard model of reality propounded by quantum mechanicians, with plethora of particles, real and virtual, to be a rickety construction held together with string and super glue. The fact that this model has provided the most accurate predictions of experimental outcomes in the history of science, winning by four or more orders of magnitude over its nearest competitors in physics and the other sciences, does not dissuade me from my belief that it is an ad hoc construction which will eventually yield to a simpler, more elegant, theory once the resolution of our scientific instruments improves. Ptolemaic theory, with its epicycles, managed to explain astronomical observations and retain the earth at the center of the universe very nicely until the telescope and improved devices for measuring arcs came along. I must also confess that I am very wary of popular science books. I have resolved that I will never read any book that purports to be the Tao of anything. Now that I have confessed to two prejudices that should have prevented me from even cracking this book open in the first place, I must say that, having done so, I found it to be an exceptionally readable and cogent explanation of current speculation regarding the origin and ultimate fate of our universe. The title is serious: quantum cosmologists, using the predictive power of quantum mechanics, now assert that our entire universe arose from a pair of virtual particles which, being the negations of each other, cost zero energy. I have pondered this hypothesis, which has the further ramification that these events are occuring all the time, spawning an uncountable number of universes which are forever unreachable from our own, and I simply do not believe it. I am an apostate from the church of the dice-throwing God. There, I said it. This book is an excellent popularization of a topic which, with the recent discovery of the Higgs boson, has attracted interest of the educated reading public. Oddly, the Higgs boson is not mentioned once in these pages, which disappointed me somewhat. My only other criticism is that the author is a card-carrying member of the Dawkins atheistic science club and debating society. At times, Krauss deviates from the task at hand to attempt to explain the existence of moral imperatives in a godless universe, a challenge which has defeated a great many philosophers, most notably Immanuel Kant. Lawrence Krauss is, by all accounts, a respected and excellent theoretical physicist, but he is no Immanuel Kant. If you are at all interested in finding out about the multiverse, quantum entanglement, spawning universes like foam bubbles on top of a pint of Guiness out of the quantum vacuum of space, you will enjoy this book. If you find it convincing, you should try the Book of Genesis next. The account you will find there requires less suspension of disbelief."

It's rather interesting that both the author and I sort of came to the same conclusion, that we are merely trying to figure out how and why the world is as it is, and that there is something rather than nothing because we wouldn't be existing to think about nothing if there was nothing.The thought that nothing is unstable, nothingness has energy, and the methodology the author steps us through to get us through was very new and entertaining. I was fascinated by the idea that being in existence meant that one was made up of energy, though it is probably common knowledge in the theoretical physics world. I guess it is definitely worthwhile to step out of one's comfort zone in thought processes once in a while.Admittedly, though the author does do an excellent job ""dumbing down"" some of the concepts he was going through, most of the material does require a lot of hardcore mathematical thought, especially if you have not been trained in quantum physics or chemistry. I was straining to recall all my physical chemistry and quantum mechanics from my college years to get a grasp of the concepts the author was trying to portray. Honestly, I am unsure whether a reader with absolutely no exposure to these concepts would follow through half the material in this book. Granted, I probably only got a minute fraction of the theory he was trying to explain through myself, but at least previous exposure helped me persevere through the math without freaking out and shutting the book half way.I am nevertheless bemused on why the author is so negative towards the concept of a Christian God as the creator of the universe. He slams a lot of the Bible Belt educators trying to add Intelligent Design and/or Biblical creation in part of science curriculums, which even as a devout Christian myself, I agree that all that is utter nonsense. Yet personally, I experience absolutely no conflict with the proof and acceptance of the Big Bang Theory or the theory of evolution with my Christian religious beliefs. In fact, I have a hard time understanding why people have to think it is one way or another. Perhaps I am one of those naive, hardheaded uneducated individuals trying to find meaning in coincidence that the author is trying to enlighten. But in essence, there is really no use in fighting over things that are not logical. The author's universe is undiscovered and full of surprises, and so is the God in which I put my faith. There is no way to know whether either of us found the true law that governs the entire scope of being or whether we found rules and laws that explain the environment and current existence surrounding us. So why fight about it, and just get along? Isn't the correspondence of ideas fun and time consuming enough anyways?"
115,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1659159-edward,4,"I find cosmological speculation to be mind-boggling but the word research may be more appropriate than speculation in this work by a theoretical physicist. I admit that I couldnât follow most of the mathematically-based arguments that Krauss employs in this book, but I think I understood the essential gist of what he was saying â that the concept of ânothingâ that most of us have in our heads is completely inadequate.  âNothingâ is actually made up of âsomethingâ which has to do with dark energy dark matter, (the stuff of black holes, string theory, faster than light concepts) most of which is unknown, if not unknowable (if weâre lucky we understand perhaps one per cent of how our infinitely mysterious universe actually functions). If I followed Krauss correctly, in the subatomic physics world of protons and neutrons, âsomething: does appear from ânothingâ and is apt to disappear just as well.  The implications of this are profound and makes idle and meaningless, talk about a âGodâ who has created the universe. The traditional notion of a âGodâ is redundant, and besides, even if accepted, begs the question of the Creatorâs origin. Why does God exist? The universe is capable of creating itself and there is no need of postulating a cause behind the âBig Bangâ theory which Krauss accepts. The Big Bang came out of ânothing,â and was followed by an incredibly swift inflationary period when everything took a fraction of a second to grow through 28 orders of magnitude. It is billions of years old and may well vanish again into ânothingâ. But to repeat, ânothingâ is not what our conceptually-limited minds make it out to be. Itâs impenetrably obscure to us - we see or comprehend virtually nothing of what is there. One of the most interesting aspects of how science approaches this subject is Kraussâ contention that âwe live at a very special time. . . the only time when we observationally verify that we live at a very special time.â That means that that if we were existing in the distant future , the universe will have expanded so far that all galaxies except our own will have receded forever so there is no trace of their existence. Today we can still see their traces, even if billions of light years old. If true, all that one can say is that weâre extremely lucky .  Reading this book has reinforced for me the idea that the traditional notion of God is meaningless. âGodâ has always seemed to be to full of anthropomorphic wish-fulfillment fantasies. But what is revealed in this book makes one even more humble in the face of awe-inspiring mysteries that dwarf the traditional idea of âGod.â To continue to exist, God has to be redefined. Maybe the ending of the Book of Job has the last word after all â human concerns and problems are simply dismissed in the unknowable dimensions of nature, or in our age, the universe. "
116,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27238491-james,1,"The arguments in this book show a striking resemblance to the ""inflationary model"" of multiverses that is described within by Krauss. Just like an inflationary bubble of space quickly arises out of quantum fluctuations and, driven by ""dark energy"", rapidly expands to approximate a flat, and thus stable universe, Krauss' claims expand rapidly via dark conjecture and uncertainty, and only due to the distance one quickly reaches from the initial premises does the conclusion he makes appear to be stable or plausible at all.It would be amusing to count all the ""if""s, ""could""s, ""might""s, ""possible""s, and such that underpin the arguments of this book, but I'm not sure I'm motivated to try. Especially in the latter half, where Krauss should presumably be tying everything together into a tight conclusion, instead he presents a series of loosely connected conjectures that are riddled with disclaimers about how the science involved isn't well-understood yet.For example, Krauss brings in Feynman quantum sums around p. 162, and in the process of describing their contribution to something arising from nothing says, ""[T]here is no completely unambiguous method to define Feynman's sum-over-paths technique in general relativity. So we have to make some guesses in advance based on plausibility and check to see if the results make sense."" Later on he says about some of the implications, ""These are open questions. However, unless one can come up with a good reason for excluding such configurations...it seems most reasonable to consider these possibilities.""Near the end of the same chapter (p. 170), he states, ""The lesson is clear: quantum gravity not only appears to allow universes to be created from nothing...it may require them."" (Emphasis added).To paraphrase Krauss: ""It's really clear that something may be the case if a bunch of stuff that we don't really know for certain might also be true. And if that stuff is true, and if some mathematics that still haven't been reconciled can be assumed to sort of work together, then it's possible that the universe could have arisen from nothing. Isn't that amazing?""I'll give Krauss credit for being honest about the tenuous nature of his conclusions, but the problem is that the book is put forth as attempt to answer a very serious question, when in reality it is completely inadequate to that purpose. And this is not to mention the serious philosophic flaws in Krauss' reasoning, considerations of which he contemptuously flicks away in a manner that demonstrates he doesn't really understand them.If this book had merely been published as a brief summary of current cosmological thinking, along with a projection of some tantalizing possibilities in the directions cosmology may go in the near future, then it would be a decent book. But as a book that claims to explain how something arose from nothing, it is a terrible failure. Hence 1 star."
117,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"The gist of Krauss's argument is that, as opposed to a closed universe (collapsing on itself) or an open universe (infinitely expanding), the universe is flat. By ""flat"" Krauss either refers to the boundary between a closed and open universe where there is a balance between gravitational attraction and a repulsive force that counters gravitational attraction, or a universe that is so expansive that there's no curvature. He also defines flatness as the universe ""slowing down, but never quite stopping."" I believe that Krauss's argument boils down to what creates this repulsive force that counters gravitational attraction. By his calculations, only 1% of the universe is the matter that consists of galaxies, stars, the earth and us. Thirty percent consists of dark matter and seventy percent comes from dark energy. Dark energy, which I think is Krausss's repulsive force, consists of virtual particles that pop in and out of existence and have zero energy, yet do all the work to counter gravitational attraction. The discussion of virtual particles seems to form the core of his argument that something comes out of nothing. Whether any or all of this is accurate is for the physicists to decide. From the non-expert reader's perspective, Krauss is a challenge. The repeated references to ""a universe from nothing"" come across as a mantra as he continues to move ahead with his sweep of cosmic history, in a brief book, from the big bang and its inflationary period to a distant future where all disappears into nothingness, while making a few critical comments on creationists and string theorists along the way. He crams in too much. Something needs to give. For starters, a slower, deliberate and elementary description of what's involved with virtual particles and how such counter gravitational attraction (and how that is negative gravitational pressure) would have helped explain how he gets to his central point of ""exactly"" zero gravitational energy that results in a flat universe. The reader understands how plus 1 and minus 1 is exactly zero but that summary leaves out a lot of information that Krauss blows through. Despite these shortcomings, this book is provoking in the best sense of the word. Krauss fills in the always mysterious ""empty space"" with stuff that in his argument is the engine of the cosmos itself. But still I wonder. Krauss states that Andromeda is one of 100 billion galaxies are ""in our observable universe"" (p. 8) and then he says that ""400 billion galaxies currently"" inhabit ""our visible universe"" (p. 107; also p. 123) and then qualifies that by saying that our galaxy is ""merely one of perhaps 400 billion galaxies in the observable universe"" (p. 3.) Then, in the Afterword, Dawkins says that there's 100 billion galaxies (p. 188). The discrepancy doesn't inspire confidence. "

And, the atoms in your left hand probably came from different star than your right hand. â¦â¦. It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics: you are the stardust.â- Lawrence M Krauss The book âUniverse from Nothingâ happeningly explains about how universe is formed from nothing. It is very interesting to know that how things start to form its path from nothing. The origin of universe as known is the formation from Big bang Theory â¦.. but when this book came in hand I was pulled towards its fascinating title ""Universe From Nothing"" and so the reading started. It is understood in the book that no matter universe is formed from nothing but still it does so according to the laws of quantum gravity. So how something can be created from nothing can be explored while going through and slowly involving self within the pages of the book. Reading extensively about cosmology, particle physics, multiverses and quantum mechanics might be uninteresting, difficult, confusing and at times boring for the non-scientific reader but the black holes, dark matter and dark energy may keep it interestingly hooked. There are lot many things in the book which are hard to absorb by a non-fiction reader and hence it may require lots of patience to get involved into it, but the way the author has put it up keeps it easier for all readers to get involved and keep a person hooked passively to know more about the universe and the book interestingly. The writer explains the differences between a closed, open, and a flat universe, and puts up the reasons why we probably live in a flat universe. He also explains about how the scientists claim so precisely the four figures as âuniverse has expanded for 13.72 billion years since the big bang theoryâ. But at times to understand the context clearly and get to the bottom of the arguments, the pages have to be turned back again and again. At times there is a conflict of mind while reading to understand âwhat we knowâ from âwhat we donât knowâ. Also the lesser known facts and scientists explained adds to the knowledge and understanding of the reader to full convincing. Science will continue to evolve â¦. But how we look at it and how much we come to know is a very wide thing as the observable light we can see today may shift so far on the light spectrum that it may become invisible â¦â¦. And eventually everything will come to an end. ""Quantum fluctuations, which otherwise would have been completely invisible, get frozen by inflation and emerge afterward as density fluctuations that produce everything we can see! If we are all stardust, it is also true, if inflation happened, that we all, literally, emerged from quantum nothingness"" â¦.. very interesting :) "
119,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"A most interesting book with flawsKrauss is a brilliant guy with a lively style but this book, despite offering the general reader some real insight into contemporary cosmology, and some rye jokes, was a bit of a disappointment to me. The main problem I think is that Krauss doesnât come to grips with the implied question in the subtitle, âWhy is there something rather than nothing?âFirst he wants us to know that âwhyâ questions are really not science, theyâre philosophy. The question our esteemed author insists on is âHOW is there something rather than nothing?â But this is not the same question.Next there is the sleight of hand with the notion of ânothing.â Putting aside word play such as the ambiguity in, say, ânothing matters,â it is not correct to say that the universe came from nothing because it came from the expansion of space. Space is not nothing, as Krauss admits on page 152. The question then would be why does all this space exist? The answer, it came from inflation. But inflation required energy and that also is not nothing.So all of Kraussâs talk (from the also brilliant Alan Guth, by the way) about the universe being the ultimate free lunch is just that, talk. The plain truth of the matter is that, yes, the question âWhy is there something rather than nothing?â is a philosophic question and not the sort of question that physics can answer. However it is not a subterfuge for slipping God into any equation (as Krauss implies), although I suppose some people do that. It is instead a profound question that has been asked, as Krauss points out, since antiquity with still no answer in sight. If we could get an answer as Hawking said, we would know the mind of God.Krauss gives physicist Frank Wilczekâs answer which is that ânothing is unstable.â Somehow I didnât get the proof for that except to understand that virtual particles go in and out of existence in âemptyâ space according to quantum mechanics, which I donât doubt. However again it is the case that that empty space is just not empty so there was never any instability between nothing and something because there never was any nothing. The problem as I see it is the limits of our science. There is something about space that we just donât understand. We know from Heisenbergâs uncertainty principle that space cannot be empty, but we donât know whyâor, as Krauss would have it, we donât know how space could be empty.I could give you the answer, ânothing is impossible,â which after reading this book, seems more and more likely, yet there is no way I or anyone else can or has demonstrated that nothing is an impossible state of the universe. Yet it could be true.It is rather annoying (I imagine that Einstein, James Clerk Maxwell, Niels Bohr, et al. are twirling in their graves) to see physicists today doing either math or philosophy and imagining that they are doing physics. I will give Krauss credit though. He gently makes it clear that string theory, for example, is not science. (See pages 130-134)As far as the cosmology and physics in the book go, I think Krauss makes some things that were previously opaque somewhat clear. Take for example why inflation occurred. It seems (as Guth realized) that âas the universe cooled, it underwent some kind of phase transitionâas occurs, for example when water freezes to ice...â (p. 96) This led to the release of energy as âlatent heatâ leading to the incredible inflation that expanded the universe by a factor of more than ten to the twenty-eighth. Now THAT is an expansion.I also liked the suggestion that the Big Bang may have spawned multiple universes. However those other universes apparently are not in any practical sense part of our universe because inflation pushed them so fast and furiously away from us that their light will never reach us. These I believe are different than those that some physicists believe came into existence outside the Big Bang. (pp. 128-129)One thing I didnât understand is this: Krauss says that the universe is currently flat; however in the future it will be open, so ultimately the universe is NOT flat. Have I got that right?Another thing I didnât get is this: Krauss tells us that during some time in the past before the dark energy of space exceeded the gravitational pull of matter and radiation that the expansion of the universe was slowing down. Does he mean that space was contracting or just the matter and radiation? If space itself was contracting then we have a mindâs eye picture of a shrinking ball of space with matter and radiation within getting closer together. If only matter and radiation were contracting while presumably space was expanding or staying the same, we have a picture of the bubble of the universe with lots of space along its boundaries (if we can speak of boundaries of space) while nearer the center are matter and radiation. Which is it? I donât know.Puzzling was Kraussâs insistence that we live in a âspecialâ time because the contractive pull of matter and radiation exactly matches the expansionary force of dark energy. (pp. 122-123) I think it is only special to us (or actually only to cosmologists) and moreover this special time probably spans millions of years.Okay, now for some Kraussian jokes.First a string theory joke. He writes, â...the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Frank Wilczek has suggested that string theorists have invented a new way of doing physics, reminiscent of a novel way of playing darts. First, one throws the dart against a blank wall, and then one goes to the wall and draws a bullâs-eye around where the dart landed.â (p. 134)Hereâs a bit about particle physicists and the anthropic principle (sort of): âCosmology has produced one totally mysterious quantity: the energy of empty space, about which we understand virtually nothing. However, particle physics has not understood many more quantities for far longer!â He adds further down the page, âMaybe all of the mysteries of particle theory can be solved by invoking the same mantra: if the universe were any other way, we could not live in it.â (p. 136)On the last jocular point I would say, maybe not us but some other creatures, and they would be invoking the same anthropomorphic principle and calling it by another name.Krauss remarks that âone way to see a supernova is simply to assign a different graduate student to each galaxy in the sky. After all, one hundred years is not too different, in a cosmic sense at least, from the average time to do a PhD, and graduate students are cheap and abundant.â (p. 20)Actually the best joke in the book is also a double pun on the phrase âuniversally attractiveâ: âAny high school student will happily tell you that gravity sucksâthat is, it is universally attractive.â (p. 77) (No, I will not explain this.)Another question about the nature of the state of nothing is, could there be nothing but the laws of nature existing in truly empty space and time? Or put another way (and I wonder if this is ~ Kraussâs position) there is something rather than nothing because the laws of nature will always be there whether there is space and matter or not.Near the end of the book Krauss does explicitly address the essentially philosophic nature of the question at hand. Brushing aside the need for a First Cause, he writes: â...empty space or the more fundamental nothingness from which empty space may have arisen, preexisted, and is eternal.â (p.174)Best and easiest answer I think.âDennis Littrell, author of âThe World Is Not as We Think It Isâ"

Various sections are well written but could have been far more effective if the author had added alternate descriptions for emphasis and summaries/repetitions to bring the point home.A rationalist's causal tale of creation has the same issue as the creationists' turtle-on-the-back-of-another varieties: one falls prey to an infinite regress until one reaches a point whether one leaves the rest to a God or what the author presents here: the emergence of something out of nothing. The author has brilliant rationalist descriptions on such a creation but with two issues.One, the author's story is based on the premise that ""nothing is unstable"". However, his nothing is not a true nothing.: it is a state without matter but with all the quantum physics laws that we have valid in this universe pre-existing. From such a nothing, it is conceivable to create a universe but the question has been pushed back only marginally from Big Bang as the starting point to a state of no matter but all existent science law as the starting point. While the author touches upon this flaw towards the end, he does not realise that compared to the evolution description from Big Bang to now, the step from nothingness to Big Bang is not only tiny and highly speculative but also without much utility at scientific or philosophical levels.Two, the author does not sufficiently explain the creation of excess matter or photons from nothingness and inflation despite many hints. A nothingness can spontaneously and briefly give rise a pair of particles (like matter anti-matter). There is a small chance that one such pair fails to annihilate as is its want in a fraction of time, because before it does inflation within one of the constituents lead to a massive creation of excess material. While it is possible to see such a material creation when pairs are created at the boundary of a blackhole for example, there is not sufficient description on how this could be the case during the inflationary phase in our universe.All in all, what is attempted is bold. The writing style is quite lucid despite the complexity. The book could not have provided answers that don't exist. With more descriptions, a lot more could have been addressed."
121,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1937339-s-p,3,"This is Lawerence Krauss's attempt at denying the existence of a deity through explaining the current state of physics and cosmology. It follows (with much more detail) his RDF foundation lecture which was up until recently on YouTube (and which I enjoyed immensely).The current state of physics parts of the book are quite informative and bring thing almost up to date - I can't pretend I understand all of it (to paraphrase Richard Feynman ""If you think you understand it, then you don't understand it"") however it has cleared up a few questions that I was only vaguely aware had been resolved -such as 'does our universe have an open, closed, or flat topology' and 'Why does the cosmic microwave background radiation appear lumpy' - both of which are answered here (and in this spoiler (view spoiler)[ a) it is flat, b) because nothing travels faster than light and local variations in the plasma of the big bang would not have time to 'equalize' as per expected theories since the expansion of the plasma was at or close to the speed of light  (hide spoiler)]).Of course it is very difficult to explain very bizarre ideas, such as those that arise from modern physics and cosmology to dim witted person-sized earth-dweller such as myself - and especially to do this without any mathematics and I credit Krauss for this and for the fact that I did actually increase my knowledge of the universe through reading it. The difficulty is the constant references to the G-Word, which are completely unnecessary in my view. Anyone reading this book is unlikely to need to be convinced of the existence or otherwise of a first cause, and frankly the sheer beauty of the ideas, if understood, is highly unlikely persuade you either way - after all the 'first cause' in the case of the universe is still unknown, and will probably never be entirely provable anyway.The idea of 'something from nothing' is also fascinating and is an interesting idea. Suffice to say, if the theorists are right here (and they think they are!) then it is possible that the universe just popped into existence of it's own accord. And I guess if it happened once...One annoying thing however is that, in my copy least, the figures used to illuminate the text seemed to be sequenced badly and lacked captions. This made it difficult to identify which figures related to which chunks of text! "
122,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91529867-matthew-gagnon,3,"I was turned on to this book when watching an interview with Christopher Hitchens, prior to his passing, where he referenced it. In short, he said that it was a fascinating book which made a compelling case for why (and how) the universe could, indeed, have been created from ""nothing,"" rather than by a ""first cause"" set in motion by a creator.I find the idea provocative, because it has been something philosophers, theologians, and people of all kinds have struggled with forever. Atheists have always struggled to answer the basic question: ""if there is no creator, than what created creation?"" Certainly, a scientist believes in the big bang as the ultimate creation of the universe, but what created the singularity that exploded in that moment? Maybe it wasn't the Judeo-Christian God, but surely it could not have simply appeared spontaneously out of the nothingness.Similarly, the religious among us have also struggled with the concept of God himself. If God created the universe, than what created God? Typically we get answers to this question that are, to be kind, cop outs. ""He is beyond time"" or ""he has always existed and will always exist"" or ""he is beyond understanding."" These answers have never been particularly satisfying to me. After all, if you believe that about God, you can just as easily believe that the universe itself is eternal, and has always existed, and did not have an ultimate ""beginning"" to it. Indeed, many theoretical physicists have argued over the years that the universe as we know it began with the big bang, that it will re-contract in on itself in a big crunch, and explode again in another big bang, in an eternal cycle.Regardless, being fascinated by both the philosophical and scientific aspects of the questions of existence, and the nature of creation, I thought the book sounded fascinating.And to be sure, it was very interesting. Krauss is one of the lesser known but still prominent purveyors of ""popular science"" -- scientists that are quasi-celebrities as they try to make science have mass appeal -- but he is still a brilliant cosmologist, and you can hear his mind at work in the book. And the book was definitely interesting and worth my reading it, for sure.My relative disappointment in the book, though, came from a couple places.First, it seemed to me like the provocative thesis and title of the book was a bit of a cover for him to talk about general cosmology, and in a way that, at least to me, sounded like he was attempting to lord his knowledge of the subject over the reader.There is no question that you have to do a fair amount of scientific explanation to set the table for why and how the universe may have emerged from nothing, but the number of topics he covers in cosmology, particle physics, quantum mechanics, relativistic physics, electromagnetism, and so many other areas, left me with the impression that he was attempting to show off in the hopes that he was writing a new version of A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking. Much of it was not essential to the ultimate argument he was making. To me, a lot of the book was superfluous, if admittedly interesting.I was also left with a bad taste in my mouth by Krauss' attitude, throughout the book. I understand he is decidedly an atheist and is not fond of those who have faith, but in my opinion he had a sneering, elitist, arrogant attitude about those who do. Yes, I understand he has had to debate some young Earth creationists over the years and those conversations have left him frustrated in his perception of those folks. But the concept of existence and where it came from is something that he himself acknowledges has been philosophized about for thousands of years. So having a holier than thou attitude about others considering the question of existence just seems misplaced to me, no matter how wrong he may think they are.I'd have much preferred if he reflected some understanding of why people look for answers they can understand, and simply stuck to explaining why he thinks there is a new way of thinking about it that might give us greater understanding. Instead, I got a bunch of snide remarks that expressed his contempt like, ""everyone, except [fill in a group he considers irritating] agrees with me."" Unnecessary, and petty if you ask me.My second, and arguably more important criticism of the book, is that he never really pays off the premise of the book.Like a person who spends ten minutes setting up a joke with a lame punchline, Krauss spends most of his book bringing us to a point where we are ready to hear his ultimate point, and then spends about half a chapter on it, and doesn't really pay it off.I thought a lot of the journey along the way was quite interesting, and set the table nicely. He explained, for instance, why and how quantum particles can, in fact, materialize out of nothing, and then disappear into nothingness. This got me really interested, but was still ultimately unsatisfying, because as Krauss himself point out, that observation still requires some kind of existence, and some kind of instigating event for that materialization out of nothing to occur.Great, because he moved on and acknowledged that limitation, and then brought us more information, at one point showing that in a multiverse, a universe with our specific design is the only type of universe to be created that could in fact survive long enough to not blink out of existence quickly, and thus give rise to life that can even ask the question of where it came from.Also interesting. Also provocative. But that is more or less where he stops. He concludes with some thoughts that basically boil down to ""our universe exists the way it does and was created from nothing because in the multiverse this is the only place it could've happened."" It was circular logic that didn't ultimately satisfy the paradox in most of our heads: why is there something? From where did it originate? If from a God, what created God and what was there before? If from another dimension, what created that dimension? If some kind of complex multiverse, from where did it originate? Basically, how did existence become existence? It is a logic puzzle that we have never satisfactorily answered -- and may never satisfactorily answer -- but yearn to search for.Unfortunately, as much as I did enjoy the book and found it interesting, I don't think it paid off the claim made on its cover. Certainly not ""enough"" that it would cause me, an enthusiastic consumer of science material who knew much of what he described in the book already, to give it my highest recommendation."
123,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2409682-oscar,4,"In his book, Lawrence M. Krauss asks the question of why there is something instead of nothing, that is, why does the universe exists instead of not existing. Why are we here, doing what we do, instead of not being here. While this opens up inevitable questions regarding the meaning of life, the universe, and questions regarding a possible creator, Krauss is more focused on looking at how physics explains the existence of the universe. He looks at scientific discoveries that have shaped and pushed forth the idea of the big bang theory and how this relates to the universe being here and how it might all end one day.I enjoyed reading this book largely as a result that even though it begins with a philosophical approach, it really builds its argument largely with a close summary and analysis of the basic tenements shaping the big bang theory and its implications. As someone who isnât a physicist, but fascinated by the subject matter, I found the book to be written in a straight forward style that invites the reader to gain a fundamental understanding of how science explains the universe, its properties, and what we can still learn and predict. Thereâs a good amount of philosophy integrated in the book, but in my opinion, I would have liked more of it. However, Krauss, ultimately, brings everything together with the notion that the fact that there is something from nothing, despite it being able to be explained through direct and calculated science, results in something magical that can be appreciated despite the fact that we may never discover what it all means. "
124,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215097-john,4,"Iâve been a fan of Lawrence Krauss for several years. Heâs a dynamic, entertaining science communicator and a very bright guy. As I write this, his You Tube video on the subject of this book (A Universe from Nothing) has 1.5 million hits. Thatâs not as many hits of course as stupid cat videos, but I find it encouraging. I saw Lawrence at The Amazing Meeting a couple of weeks ago in Los Vegas and he gave a great talk. His writing is accessible to non-technical people and since I always enjoy essays on science history I thoroughly enjoyed is summary of cosmology in history. Iâm not sure Krauss mentioned it, but the science of cosmology has probably increased its knowledge by two or three orders of magnitude in the past 20 years (about the time Carl Sagan died). Modern physics is amazingly complicated but Krauss makes much of it understandable on some level â I particularly enjoy his explanation of âinflationâ which finally made sense. Of course if we accept some or any of the premises of modern cosmology we do so on the basis of authority, but itâs an authority acceptable to me because scientifically authoritarian communicators have been vetted by the scientific method. This book is interesting and provocative and I certainly recommend it. If you donât want to invest the money or time for the book (its actually a fairly quick read), then at least invest an hour in the You Tube video. "

Carl Sagan would have liked this book, ditto Richard Feynman, who, along with Charles Darwin, are science heroes of mine. Poetic and poignant as well, for example:""The amazing thing is that every atom in your body came from a star that exploded. And, the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than your right hand. It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics: You are all stardust. You couldnât be here if stars hadnât exploded, because the elements - the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, all the things that matter for evolution - werenât created at the beginning of time. They were created in the nuclear furnaces of stars, and the only way they could get into your body is if those stars were kind enough to explode.""From the emergence of the universe, from nothing, 13.72 billion years ago, to its likely future, this book is an excellent overview of current thinking, from long and intense observation, of quantum physics and cosmology."
126,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8263284-glenn-crouch,3,"The Author has succeeded in producing a relatively (no pun intended) easy to read book on some quite complex concepts in Physics - in particular the areas of Quantum Mechanics and Cosmology. I enjoyed that he included quite a bit of the History of the fields involved - and probably would've appreciated a bit more - as I do think he could've better explained the history of the conflict between Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.Like most books covering topics on ""breaking edge"" Science, the Author will probably need to do an update. Assuming of course recent Science Alert type posts regarding Dark Energy et al are reliable.However, I do disagree with the Philosophical conclusions that the Author makes - which should be expected. Though I have post-grad qualifications in Science (Mathematics), I am a Lutheran Pastor - so it shouldn't come as a big surprise that whilst I enjoy and appreciate the Author's Physics, I would not so much enjoy his evangelistic drive for Atheism. I would be tempted to suggest that the Author talks more about God than any other Physics books I've read - including those written by devout Christians.So if you would like a good read into modern Physics research this is a good choice, though I would caution you in regards to the ""New Atheism"" interjections throughout."
127,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8153785-tyler-guillen,5,"I get the impression that this book is taken as yet another book whose intent is to announce the death of any realistic need for religion (following Harris, Dennett, Dawkins, Hitchens, etc.), and rightfully so. It more or less completes the puzzle, bringing in a cosmological perspective of what amounts to a naturalist view of reality. By the end we are left with a wonderful account of why science and reason trumps theology in the pursuit of truth.Given the distinct possibility that most of the people who will pick up this book are already convinced of that notion, the book nonetheless has great value. It provides a wonderful survey of the bleeding edge of physics, and is worth reading if you're interested in getting a good perspective on a very abstract science. He simplifies the concepts (omitting very little of the original theories, I might add) in a way few are able to. I definitely prefer his explanations to Brian Greene's (not to undermine Greene's efforts one bit).Prof. Krauss is definitely a better public speaker than he is a writer, and his humor comes out better in person than it does on the page. Regardless, we still get plenty of his charm and authority in the text, and it is a pleasure to read. Quick, too; I read it in a day."
128,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3646808-james,5,"There is something fascinating and wonderful about a book like this, even though the science is WELL beyond my comprehension, there is a comfort that comes from the logic, the questions, the admitted problems and unknowns, the theories and current research.... In some regards, reading this book is much like reading scripture. In both there is much I don't understand or comprehend, and in both there can be found comfort and satisfaction. However, in scripture the comfort is superficial and often has a half-life that leaves me realizing the comfort is illogical, even immoral, and thus it is an unstable and unsatisfying comfort. In a book like this from Dr. Krauss, however, the answers don't need to be fixed, the science can be outside of my mental capacity to understand but I can have more ""faith"" in what I don't understand because the science is continually looking to disprove and better understand. Scripture demands my faith in absolute believe without doubt and science rewards my doubt and welcomes my questions, never with the hubris of a preacher but only the inquisitiveness of very smart people looking for real answers.And to hear someone like Dr. Krauss talk at this level is truly inspiring.

129,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,4,"Summary""A Universe From Nothing"" argues that modern physics is starting to shed light on questions as foundational as ""why is there something rather than nothing?"" Kraus doesn't purport to provide an ultimate ""answer"" to the riddle existence: he simply points out that science is making progress. The very fact that this question is suitable for empirical inquiry is pretty remarkable, and Krauss's presentation of what we've learned so far is fascinating.While this isn't the best book to dive deep into the physics itself (Kraus's treatment is a bit unfocused and cursory), ""A Universe From Nothing"" is notable for changing the way you think about the ""big questions."" I left with a better appreciation for how ill-suited our intuitions are when it comes to understanding the nature of reality, and sense of amazement that, if we take the laws of physics as a given, they might actually predict a ""universe from nothing.""A decent tour of modern cosmologyMuch of the book consists of a tour of modern cosmology: the big bang, inflation, the fact that the universe is expanding, the shocking discovery that this expansion is accelerating, and the implied existence of dark energy. Props to Krauss for taking the time to explain how scientists were led to these (often unexpected) conclusions, but otherwise its pretty standard pop-intro-to-cosmology stuff. My main complaint is that it's not always clear how these discoveries relate to the question at hand: namely, why is there something rather than nothing?Quantum physics casts doubt on our intuitionsBefore we can take a stab at answering said question, we'll need to challenge some seemingly reasonable assumptions, such as the idea that you can't get ""something"" out of ""nothing."" Virtual particles serve as a poignant counter-example. In short, quantum physics predicts there are particles and anti-particles constantly popping up ""out of nothing"" and subsequently annihilating themselves. They're called ""virtual"" particles because this happens so quickly that we cannot, due to the uncertainty principle, observe it directly.Still, virtual particles have a measurable effect on their surroundings, and you need to take them into account when calculating things like the energy spectrum of hydrogen (""the best, most accurate prediction in all of science""(68)). The point is, virtual particles don't care that they violate your intuition. A hundred years ago someone might have argued, on philosophical grounds, that ""something"" can't come from ""nothing."" Today we no longer have to philosophize. We know, on empirical grounds, that it does.Quantum gravity (might) predict a universe from nothingOur intuitions rewired thus, Kraus points out that once you have a quantum theory of gravity, quantum behavior applies to the fabric space itself. In fact that, just like quantum mechanics predict particles appearing out of nothing, quantum gravity predicts space itself appearing out of nothing. This gives us ""one way of thinking about the answer to the question of why there is something rather than nothing: nothing is unstable."" (159)Now, we should be a bit wary here. We don't yet have a mathematically consistent theory of quantum gravity. We use ""approximate"" theories, and thus the resulting predications need to be taken with a grain of salt. Even so, it's delightful to think about the implications of such a (prospective) finding. We'd effectively be in a situation where the laws of physics actually predict that a universe like ours will have ""popped up out of nothing."" And while we'll still need to account for the laws themselves, it's pretty amazing how much we'll have removed from the philosopher's and theologian's domains.Can we explain the laws of physics themselves?Kraus briefly talks about how a multiverse might help explain the laws of physics themselves, but at this point we're on purely speculative ground. And that's OK. The point isn't that science has all the answers. It's that it might. Or rather, that it has more answers than we previously thought, and that when faced with ""the big questions,"" we should hesitate before declaring them outside the realm of empirical inquiry.Conclusion""A Universe From Nothing"" is by no means perfect. Its exposition of cosmology is too superficial if you already know a thing or two, and not high-level enough if you don't. It's a book that should have either been much shorter or much longer. The good stuff, though, is great. At its best, it's a meditation on the relationship between science and philosophy, and an ode to following the evidence, wherever it may lead. If you consider yourself a bit of a science-and-philosophy nerd, it's worth checking it out. A lot of smart people have spent their lives speculating about the mystery of ""existence."" In ""A Universe From Nothing,"" you'll finally get to hear what nature has to say. Notable Quotes""'Why is there something rather than nothing'... is first and foremost a question about the natural world, and so the appropriate place to try and resolve it, first and foremost, is with science."" (xiii)""Lack of comfort means we are on the threshold of new insights."" (xv)""The job of physics is not to invent things we cannot see to explain things we can see, but to figure out how to see what we cannot see."" (26)""A truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform with the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implications."" (139)""[As to why there is something rather than nothing]"": I am going to assume what this question really means to ask is, 'How is there something rather than nothing?'

130,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3735884-stephen-cranney,2,"This book was quite a let down. I'll have to admit that the title was quite the hook for me, implying that it would show how physics solves the philosophical question of existence, but a more accurate description would have been: how matter is created out of pre-existing empty space that is embedded with energy and shaped by pre-existing cosmological constants, which doesn't have quite the same ring to it, but that's really what he's talking about here. He seemed to have a God fetish, and he occasionally made mean-spirited side comments about Americans that had nothing to do with the subject at hand; I wasn't sure if they were supposed to be jokes or whether he just had to get his European superiority complex off his chest (not that Krauss is European himself). The material in the first half of the book is old news to anybody who even casually follows science, and I don't think that he did a good job describing the more abstruse material in layman's terms (not that this is an easy endeavor, it's just that he didn't pull it off--Dawkins' afterward seemed to indicate that I wasn't the only one that wasn't quite sure if they understood Krauss right).

This one is great. In attempting to answer the question of why or universe looks, acts, and occasionally smells the way it does, the reader is given a tour through physics, quantum mechanics, relativity theory, string theory, and many more gobs of awesome science stuff. This is the kind of book I would love to see take hold in public schools in the states. It seems we as a country are turning away from science and become more subjectivity in our thinking. I remember teaching in Santa Fe years ago (so old, oh god!) and having parents tell me that we should be teaching creationism in schools. Or at least not be teaching that ""other theory"" in the interest of respect and fairness. Books like this, if read by the general populace, would make us a better society, because it puts the kibosh on all of that. Well written and can be understood by laymen like me (although certain parts I had to read through a few times to really get the concept). Where did we come from? What does nothingness even mean?

However, towards the end it changed into rather a polemic against philosophy and theology. Now, I am sympathetic towards what one might refer to as a ""rationalist"" approach to the discussion of whether there is a supreme being/force/whatever. But I didn't think that that part added much to this book. I would have preferred the author to confine himself to a logical presentation, without involving criticisms of philosophers and theologians, regardless of how deserving they might be of those criticisms. For that reason, I gave the book only 3 stars instead of 4.The author has a pleasant writing style, and conveys his explanations of physics theory and observations well, with some good analogies."

While the book itself was short, I often found myself perplexed, particularly towards the end, at the sophomoric philosophical practices illustrated in this book by an overly confident Lawrence Krauss. Krauss finds the biggest strength in his book by showing off his knowledge of theoretical physics. The biggest weakness, his overwhelming failure to philosophically interpret any scientific information, which essentially overrides the strength he does have. Along with his philosophical 'dumpster-fire' analysis, he makes a hearty attempt at convincing the ill-informed that 'nothing' is 'something'. Krauss, being a huge advocate for scientism, makes a sincere effort to reconcile his faith in atheism by casually proclaiming that a natural process created something from nothing. Lastly, Krauss, while good in his field, is a horrible philosophic mind and shouldn't consider making an attempt to answer philosophic questions like, 'why is there something rather than nothing?', particularly if he despises philosophy."

I find myself to be a fairly intelligent person, but this was way above my reading level. I would read a paragraph and then hope the next paragraph would explain the last! Granted, I took physics for architects, so my background is sketchy, but still for a book for laypersons it was extremely difficult to read.2. I get it that the author is an atheist. I get it that he doesn't want 'believers' using his theories to promote their ideas. But I don't get why he insists on belittling persons of faith. Repeatedly. As a believer in a one true God, I think that what I could understand of his book only reinforces what I believe. We can't see 90% of the universe? Huh, I wonder what sort of forces are dwelling in the unknown? He calls it dark energy. Fine. I would rather be 'dark energy' than obliterated into nothing when I pass on from this life. 3.

A particular virtue of this book is that it does not talk down to the reader, as many do, although I would have appreciated some mathematics which is a much more concise way of conveying the ideas.Richard Dawkins provides an afterward in which he concludes ""If the On the Origin of Species was biology's deadliest blow to supernaturalism, we may come to see a Universe from Nothing as the equivalent from cosmology."" Well...that is quite a recommendation. Although I don't think it rises to such prominence, I would offer this book to anyone who wants to brush up on the latest picture of reality.While it seems unlikey that anyone whose processes of independent thought have been paralyzed by the toxin of religion would ever pick up this book to read, Kraus has done an admirable job in portraying a real universe full of wonder without the need to invoke the supernatural."

A science writer needs to apply a magnet to these facts so that they become an explanatory story. This is just a list of stuff he knows. The Dawkins afterword is unbelievable in its gush. Suggesting that this book might come to be seen as being as important as the origin of species is just ridiculous. There is nothing new in this book and its contents are not in any way orchestrated.The description of how we come to know what we do about the universe is fascinating but incomplete. This book needed to be 700 pages long, but that would have meant he'd have to actually explain things to us non-physicists fully and after reading this, I just don't think he is capable of that.Finally, I know he won't like this comment, but no matter how stylishly he dismisses people who say he doesn't address ""nothing"" sufficiently, he really doesn't address ""nothing"" sufficiently."

It makes me really sad that we live in a world where scientists have to waste their energy fighting myths and proving science right and myths wrong. Science works, as Richard Dawkins nicely puts it in the epilogue, it yields results. I am looking forward to the day when Krauss and others will write books such as this without having to discuss why physics is more plausible than theology, and why no God is necessary. But then again, if that was obvious to everyone, maybe this book would be unnecessary. And that's why I give this book five stars. Amazing work."

It is intentionally deceptive and only ceases to prevaricate in the last few chapters. When you finally get there, you will have laboriously read through a jumble of unstructured fluff that his editor certainly did not read. The content is far and few between and uselessly applied to anyone genuinely interested in any topic it presents. He intentionally sweeps over statements that demand more clarification, and never fails to use ad hominem whenever he meets an objection.If you are a theist who is interested in the arguments of atheists, do not read this book: it has nothing for you.

It isn't an easy read for someone with no firm background in physics, and it helped me to have some of the background in order to understand this book better. I had to go back a few times and re-read certain passages because I just couldn't wrap my insignificant little brain around it. That's the beauty of this work. Prof. Krauss' ability to explain something so convoluted to the reads is astonishing. And, while the faith of our universe may be bleak, our universe is so invigorating and provocative. Thankfully, we have people such as Prof. Krauss to study it and unravel some of the mysteries.Amazing read. I'd give it ten stars."

In the last 20%, the author explains a physical phenomenon that is so fast and microscopic, that it appears to be 'nothing.'Then the author conveniently uses the word 'nothing' again and again, and explains how the big bang happened because of 'nothing.' Then, with a masterstroke of deception, the author wraps up the book by implying that the universe came about from nothing, in a literal sense.This is flawed logic. Something being 'seemingly nothing', and 'nothing' are universes apart. Also, to write a book titled 'A universe from nothing,' where you supply the definition of 'nothing' makes no sense. Nothing means nothing. It doesn't mean a certain tiny level of matter and anti matter oscillating very fast. That would still be something.The title must be 'A universe from something so small, that it looks like nothing'."

The overview of science is a summary rather than an introduction except on some topics where the author seems to inconsistently go into depth. The difference between BOOMERANG and WMAP are neat but not necessary and seem to be largely filler in this otherwise thin book. The author talks about ""symmetries"" but doesn't really describe the much more in-depth types of symmetry that science provides vs. say left-right (bilateral) symmetry. There was little discussion on why some things are conserved and others are not and this is both handy in explaining a lot of things and quite beautiful.This is short for one of my reviews as this book is like most of Krauss's, very meh. Watch the YouTube video of his presentation on the universe from nothing if it saves you the cost of this book."

Krauss accuses his critics of changing the meaning of the word ""nothing,"" but it just doesn't seem fair to call empty space ""nothing,"" as Krauss does. Empty space has properties, and nonexistence is not among those properties. Empty space has height and depth and length and volume. Why is there empty space instead of nothing? At best Krauss shows only that a universe from nothing is plausible, and four-fifths of the way through the book, Krauss, himself, changes the meaning of his terms, deciding that the real question is to ask ""How"" is there something instead of nothing, not ""why."" But the real question, properly understood is this: Why is there something instead of nothing--wouldn't it be easier for there just to be nothing?"

The fact that it has taken only a few thousand years to learn so much about a universe that is billions of years old, with huge leaps being made over just the past century or so, is mind-boggling. Some reviewers have complained that the author bats down theology and creationism in this book, but when you have science being pushed out of classrooms in favor of non-scientific, religion-based concepts of existence, I think it's a perfectly valid topic to include in a book about the universe.

He's already updated this book once (Higgs boson discovery at the LHC), and modern physics is exploding with both new discovery and new questions, so I wonder if current models and theories will change radically in the next few decades.I read this book piecemeal over quite a long time due to workload and several other books and projects that intervened, so I'm hesitant to try and put together a genuinely coherent review. However, I can say that whether you like Krauss or not, you have to admit he's always interesting, and he's very proficient at breaking down complex concepts into understandable chunks.I happen to enjoy both science and a bit of irreverence. I'd like to reread this book when I have more time to focus on it."
145,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9329180-rick,2,"Krauss gives an interesting summary of recent cosmological research. But his philosophical maunderings are unconvincing. Also, he makes an interesting linguistic blunder in my view. He does not define ""Nothing"", and even seems unaware that this word has different meanings in different contexts. Thus ""I did nothing all day"", or ""there's nothing in this jar"", or the like do not mean ""no thing"". Similarly, it turns out that empty space can give birth to ""something"". But saying that something came from nothing is rather vacuous (pun intended). He would have been better off if he had used another word, like ""space"" instead of ""nothing"". As I ""read"" the book on audio CD, it would have been a lot more easy to follow too, as I could not tell when he meant ""nothing"" and when he meant ""Nothing""."

I wasn't sophisticated enough to understand what I realized now: god destroyed the Babylonians for the sin of being capable. Science is the modern ziggurat, an edifice hundreds of years in the making that can see back in time 13.72 billion years and predict into the future trillions more. If they were capable, we are more so. I'd like to say I understand all the details and implications of Krauss's writing, but I can't. I got the broad strokes, and that's enough. The idea that the universe has net-zero energy makes so much sense. Now that the idea is in my head, I can only say, ""Of course. How could it be otherwise."""

And some day way in the future, we'll poof back into nothing. Unless, we destroy the planet first, but that's a whole 'nother can of worms.It was interesting.

He has no discipline, can't stick to one thought at a time, and often casually inserts personal stuff into the scientific narrative. Second, his arguments are a pastiche, not tightly woven, borrowing from here and there, losing the reader. Third, his central point, that something can come from nothing, slips into the book for about 2 pages, unexplained and undefended, and then he briskly moves on as if it was established. As the NYT Book Reviewer said in his final note, this book is just dumb. There may be much more to the science he attempts to describe, but this is a disservice to the discipline."

But he does make a damn compelling case that such a thing might not be very far outside the realm of possibility; in fact, it may turn out to be an inevitability based upon the problem of Nothing. Nothing, a word which in everyday parlance has a specific meaning, turns out to defy our intuitions at the quantum level. This shouldn't be too surprising. The history of science (including and especially physics) is the history of the universe kicking our 'common sense' in the nuts over and over . . . and over. "

I agree that it is lazy to fill unanswered gaps with God but I cannot release the idea that there is something out there. He/She/It may not have created the universe but my wishful thinking wants to believe there is something greater than us. Regardless of our beginning, I agree with Knauss' approach of scientific proofs rather than Creationist's ""because the Bible says so"" approach.Ultimately, I liked best the quote from Richard Feynman that Dr. Knauss referenced, ""I don't mind not knowing. It doesn't scare me."""

Dr. Krauss is quick to reveal places where it might be tempting to draw certain conclusions but backs away from them for reasons he reveals. I found this candid honesty made the book more enjoyable. Two additional notes, I would argue the universe (potential multiverses)Krauss describes is not incompatible with Zen Buddhism in its simplest form. Further, I found the hubris of Dawkins' epilogue nauseating. There is no God and Dawkins is his prophet. "

The jokes are the same but the delivery in prose suffers compared to the video. So, you should watch the video, and then maybe come back to this afterward. With that said, there's a wealth of fascinating material in here, and it is quite engrossing in its own right; it's just by contrast that it suffers."

Krauss's words are poetic as well as understandable to even those who don't know an ounce of physics or cosmology. Even the afterward by Richard Dawkins is insightful and witty.

His exploration of string theory was less so, but that wasn't the focus anyway. I enjoy ontology and science, but I think biological sciences are more my speed generally. Chemistry is hella-cool, but I usually think of it in terms of metaphor. Hence my majors in English and psychology and not anything useful :-)"

This book covers both a ""primer"" on astrophysics and a debate on how our scientific view of the universe compares with what has traditionally been the domain of theologians and philosophers. The main claim is that the universe arose from nothing, that it will likely revert to nothing and that we are in existence at a fortunate time when we can actually see these changes taking place around us - in the distant future, all traces of the Big Bang will have disappeared due to the expansion of space.

209,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5880260-jimm-wetherbee,3,"Lawrence Krauss has put together a fine introduction to the current state cosmology that is marred only by a provocatively metaphysical title to which exposition attempts to hew. Authors often lose control of their titles, and Krauss may have argued that subtitle should have read âHow there is something rather than nothing,â or even better âHow there is something in addition to nothing,â (which would surely be more consistent), but, really it is the metaphysics of ânothingâ in the title that make it less than it could have been. But I get ahead of myself.Krauss appears to have two main aims in A Universe From Nothing. One would to make modern cosmology interesting and accessible to those, such as myself, who frankly don't have the background to understand cosmology at its deepest level. Here Krauss is brilliant and elegant. Keeping analogies and diagramsâwhich tend to mislead more than they enlightenâto an absolute minimum Krauss moves from the relatively straight-forward (why it is that it appears all galaxies are moving away from when the Milky Wayâor any other galaxy for that matterâis not the center of the universe) to the more obscure but profound, (just what is this thing called inflation that comesâin cosmic termsâhard on the heels of the big-bang, what is it suppose to explain, and why it is an integral part of cosmology rather than an ad hoc support). He even makes a forayâalbeit somewhat non-committalâinto string theory. Those who want to know about dark matter, dark energy, negative energy,1 virtual particles, or quantum fluctuations, could do much worse.There is also much that is truly thought provoking on an existential level. For instance, Krauss clearly argues that given the state of our current knowledge, future advanced civilizations on worlds yet unborn would have far fewer clues than do we about the origin of the universe. The background radiation, that cold echo of the big-bang, will be too faint to detect. Galaxies will be so far apart that they will not be visible one from another. At such a time, the only reasonable conclusion one could reach would be that the universe is much smaller and never had a beginning. One cannot help but wonder, what is it that we have missedâcould not help but miss because we have come upon the scene when we didâthat would change our body of knowledge. On the other hand one might ponder, what phenomena might arise some billions of years from now that on a cosmic scale is simply hidden from our current view. Such a provisional view is quite humbling. On the other hand, minds such as Krauss, may delve in new directions and make these constraints moot. We just don't know all that we can't know.Now for Krauss' second aimâan aim which almost certainly is the reason for some of the effusive praise found on the dust-jacketâthat cosmology shows that creatio ex nihilo is no big deal, that it happens all the time, and so that God either doesn't exist or is not necessary (which really amounts to the same thing). Here Krauss engages the reader on a philosophical levelâa discipline Krauss elsewhere has demonstrated little patience. However, the nice thing about philosophy is that just about anyone can participate. If one is willing to ignore a few gratuitous swipes,2 the philosophy is quite approachable. Moreover, while most of us cannot engage deeply enough to critique the physics in A Universe From Nothing, almost anyone can evaluate a philosophical argument delivered on the popular level.Krauss deploys two basic arguments. The first runs something like this: The argument that philosophers and theologians3 offer for the existence of God is everything must arrive from something (ex nihlio nili fit4) but that the chain of one thing arising from another cannot be infinite. So, the chain must end with God. But, every instance of nothing that philosophers and theologians offer is either too vague to be evaluated by scientific means or is such that science has shown that something can arise from it. Moreover, philosophers and theologians fall back to ever more abstract and absurd notions of what nothing is whenever science is able to show that something comes from nothing, but this line of reasoning cannot go on forever either. God is not necessary for the creation of the universe.Although the form of the cosmological argument that Krauss seems to be critiquing starts with something along the lines that everything that began to exist was caused by something else, rather than that from nothing, nothing comes, it is a safe assumption that Krauss would consider nothing that âsomething else,â so we can simply proceed to the second premise. For the first charge, Krauss maintains that the typical characterization used by philosophers and theologians of nothing as the negation of being is vague and untestable and so cannot be demonstrated as true.Much of the rest of the A Universe From Nothing, can be seen as directly or indirectly supporting the position that any sensible idea nothing is enough for something to arise. Whether one is talking about virtual particles springing from empty space, the net energy in the universe being zero, or the false vacuum that propelled inflation in the early universe, Krauss would maintain that a physicist can come up with a more common notion of nothing than a philosopher. In fact, the progression of the book is such that we are led to ever rarefied versions of nothingness. One can picture Krauss prodding his implicated interlocutors, as if saying âIs this nothing enough? No? How about this?â Indeed, Krauss accuses philosophers and theologians of changing what they mean by nothing in the face of science showing that something can come from nothing.In reply, one could reply that while ânegation of beingâ might sound a bit esoteric and obfuscating (the notion of being is not easily approached), one could suggest that if something exists, then it isn't nothing. Now, the idea of existence may be just as vexing as being, but philosophers would agree that if something exists it has being and both philosophers and physicist would agree that if such things as quantum fluctuations and such are real, then they exist. If existence as such isn't the sort of thing physic can evaluate, then it says more about the limits of physics than it does the nature of existence. Unless Krauss would want to argue that things that exist arise from things that don't, it would seem that adage âex nihlio nili fit,â still applies.Krauss' further gambit that philosophers progressively move away from more common sense ideas of nothingness to more obscure ones as physics discover something arising out of nothing does not gibe with the history of philosophy. Krauss quips that he imagines that Aristotle and Aquinas thought of nothing as empty space. On what this imagination is based is hard to say. Aristotle argued against the existence of the void. The choices before us would seem that he either held empty space to be something or (and this seems more likely) impossible. One could also point to more modern reflections in the correspondence between Clarke and Leibniz. Clarke held (with Newton) that space was absolute, but would have hardly thought of it as nothing. Leibniz, idealist that he was, held to a relative view of space such that if there were no objects, there would be no space, empty or otherwise. One might further argue that Kant's famous antinomies of time and space loose their force unless space is considered to be something.The problem we have here is that while we might be able to conceive of nothingness, we can hardly be said to be able to imagine it. When trying to imagineâor if you will, pictureânothingness we can only go upon ever more rarefied things that are next to nothing. This is a problem of which Krauss should be very familiar. Human beings do not live at the scale of either the quantum world or the cosmic. We really cannot imagine things at those scales and explaining them by what we commonly experience is fraught with limitations. Common sense ideas tend to break down at the extremes. It seems shortsighted to reserve this judgment for science while denying it to philosophy, and it would seem that philosophers have held a very radical view of nothingness for millennia.It may well be on account of this radical nature of nothingness that philosophers such as Aquinas never used ex nihlio nihil fit5 as a premise but only as a supporting argument.6 The shame is that the only conclusion on can draw from ex nihilo nihil fit is that existence as such is necessary, not that a necessary being exists. Perhaps The Necessary Universe: How There is Always Something When There's Nothing There, just didn't make for as good a title.Although initially directed at the so-called fine-turing argument, one almost guesses that Krauss senses that nothingness is not the issue, because toward the end he pivoted to a different line of argumentation. The most promising explanation for the origin of the universe predicts the existence of multiple universes. Multiple universes dispense with the need for a creator of the universe in the same way that natural selection does. Even if one could argue that God is somehow behind the existence of these multiple universes, their very necessity renders God redundant and by Ockham's Razor nonexistent.One does not have to be a physicist to find multiple universes (along with string and brane theory) appealing and intriguing. While a thing's being appealing (as Krauss frequently notes) doesn't make it so, those of us who are not cosmologists should best allow those are to play out the promise of multiple universes. For now, let us who are not in a position to pass judgment accept that this is just one of an unimaginable number of universes.The second line of the argument simply goes after the fine tuning argument. The fine tuning argument is merely Paley's teleological argument on a much larger canvass, and so any successful critique of fine tuning only goes to show that a good analogy doesn't prove anything.Of these, it is the third that may be the most interesting because buried there is the idea that the cosmos is necessary insofar as all possibilities (and so all potential) are realized. Multiple universes hold out the promise that the cosmos is fully actual and so, in a way, a necessary being.There are, however, some prima facia objections that A Universe From Nothing doesn't address. Assume for the moment that there are multiple universes and that there always7 have been. Each universe is in a system of multiple universes that can be seen either as distinct state of affairs, or possible worlds8 (because they are mutually inaccessible, following David Lewis), or as a single state of affairs or possible world (because only as a whole would they constitute a maximal state of affairs, following Alvin Plantinga). For convenience sake, let us continue to call the former âmultiple universesâ and the latter a âmultiverse.â Looking at multiple universes, it should be pointed out that while possible worlds are not sets but states of affairs that have mereological qualities, once one compares the properties of one state of affairs with another, one is talking about sets. Now the interesting thing here is that even if the number of possible worlds is infinite (and as best as I can tell, brane theory stops short of that) that in ZermeloâFraenkel set theory not all possibilities are realized because there can be no universal set. One can argue about Zermelo-Fraenkel, but it is not at all obvious that set of universes is necessary at all.So much for looking at things from the vantage of David Lewis. Looking at things from Plantinga's point of view,9 the reason for the multiverse is that it is a consequence of physical laws of this universe and the Platonic horde of universes is necessary for this universe to exist. Anyone who has read Kant should see what comes next. Simply because the laws that make this universe possible necessitates the existence of a multiverse does not necessitate the multiverse itself. One could dispense with both the consequence and the antecedent without contradiction. It would still seem possible that none of these universes exist or that there could be universes that are superficially similar to ours (at least at the macro level) but whose underlying natures are radically different. That is to say, there might be a host of possible multiverses that could exist, but only at the exclusion of all the others if actual. One might reply that such speculation is quite out of bounds of any science as utterly unknowable and should not even be considered,. However, philosophers are inclined to ask such questions, and if it is unknown that such radically different universes exist that would exclude our multiple universes, it is unknown that this multiples is the only one. So, it cannot be said with any certainty that these universes, even if they as a whole always existed, are necessary.While Krauss supplies no sustained argument, A Universe From Nothing displays a distinctly anti-metaphysical cast. For instance, while Krauss rightly observes that most âwhyâ questions are really âhowâ questions. Questions such as âWhy is the sky blue?â might be better recast as âHow is it that the sky is blue.â Not only is this a more accurateâalbeit less elegantâconstruction but is one that the sciences are ideal at analyzing. Krauss then maintains that all âwhyâ questions that cannon be construed as âhowâ questions deal with ethics. From here it is easy to see that since asking why something rather than nothing is not a moral question it must be a âhowâ or mechanical question. The possibility that why something rather than nothing might be neither ethical or mechanical is never addressed. One could argue that question of existence rather than non-existence is fundamentally an ontological or metaphysical issue.Krauss ends A Universe From Nothing with a reverie on the meaning of life. There is an almost Stoic resolve that although the universe itself has no purpose and his place in it is utterly insignificant, he is able to draw meaning from life. Krauss is at least polite enough not to point out that even if the universe has a purpose, there is no reason to conclude that any given member has one. It is also true that even if we do have a purpose (or purposes), there is no reason to conclude that the universe is the sort of thing that has one.10 What is curious is Krauss' turn of phraseâdrawing meaning from life. One would have thought it better for him to say that meaning was something he created (from nothing?) for himself. However, to draw suggests that there is something there, at least implicitly, that even if there is no meaning in the universe itself, meaning can emerge from the universe. Regardless, metaphysics looms close by whether one draws or creates meaning.There is also the question of just what is meant here by âmeaning.â Is it simply a feeling of fulfillment (in which case, what is one pursuing, the feeling or the fulfillment) or is it some agreement between one's nature and one action or direction. Perhaps the feeling that one's life has meaning is a defense against the fact we do indeed signify nothing.These would seem to be perfectly reasonable questions for anyone to ask. Stoicism (or any other of a host of alternatives) is perfectly respectable. Yet the question of meaning has meaning, though it would not appear to be one within the canons of physics (or biology for that matter). Yet choosing a general ethical outlook is not something that can be done within any given ethical system but upon the nature of the good. That nature is essentially a metaphysical. If such a question is worth pursuing, perhaps others, including why there is something rather than nothing, are worth their while apart from physics.___________________1I'm erring in putting these two in close proximity. They have less in common than the nomenclature might suggests.2There is the old chestnut about scholastic debating about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, treating the Euthyphro dilemma as if it were newly invented, and assuming that like physics, knowledge in theology must be cumulative and progressive. 3Krauss frequently lumps philosophers and theologians together. While there are a fair number of people who can be characterized both as philosophers and theologians, there are a great many from each camp who would rather not be associated with the other. Krauss' target is likely philosophers who have strong theological commitments, e.g. Christian philosophers.4From nothing, nothing comes.5It is of passing interest to note that creatio ex nihilo can be taken in two ways, as creation out of nothing (the affrimation that God required nothing outside the divine nature, or the denial that God made the cosmos from some outside substance unrelated to the divine nature) and creation from nothing (that God used nothing whatsoever to create). One could argue that any theology that allows some meaning to divine attributes must deny the idea of creation from nothing [whatsoever].6Actually, medieval philosophers were more concerned with ex nihlio nili fit as an objection to the traditional doctrine or creatio ex nihlio. The affirmation of ex nihlio nihil fit (with which these philosophers agreed) seemed to entail that the cosmos was eternal. Aquinas, for instance, did not attempt to demonstrate that the cosmos had a beginning, only that ex nihlio nili fit was consistent with the cosmos having a beginning.7Always would almost certainly have be understood in a non-temporal or eternal sense here.8âPossible worldâ is a term of art used by modal logicians for a state of affairs that can somehow be considered complete. Such state of affairs do not have to be very large in order to be considered worlds, but since the cosmos is an actual complete state of affairs, it qualifies as a possible world.9Actually, I'm stretching things a good deal here. Even if Plantinga were to concede that multiple universes could constitute a signal state of affairs, he would still insist there are multiple multiverses.10For instance, during a rush hour commute one may reasonably ask where each of the drivers is going, but it would make no sense to ask where rush hour is going."

I was enthralled because of the brilliance of the genius exhibited by the developments of modern science up to p. 140.I was appalled by the non-paradoxical use of the phrase ""Nothing is something"" on the first quotation page and in the chapter heading on p. 141 and following. At least the medievals had a better way of putting the problem, ""What is not, is.""Addition: In his metaphysics, Aristotle had a short answer to the notion of Nothing is something. ""For everything that changes is something and is changed by something and into something."" The quantum field which is denominated as nothing, changes...Much more to follow. Here it is... Quotes and comments in a rambling sort of way.Krauss, A Universe from NothingXii Nevertheless, the declaration of a First Cause still leaves open the question, âWho created the creator?â After all, what is the difference between arguing in favor of an eternally existing creator versus an eternally existing universe without one?NOTE: To say First Cause assumes that that cause is with all other causes in the same genus.xiv-v Now, I am told by religious critics that I cannot refer to empty space as ânothing,â but rather as a âquantum vacuum,â to distinguish it from the philosopherâs or theologianâs idealized ânothing.âSo be it. But what if we are then willing to describe ânothingâ as the absence of space and time itself? Is this sufficient? Again, I suspect it would have been â¦ at one time. But, as I shall describe, we have learned that space and time can themselves spontaneously appear, so now we are told that even this ânothingâ is not really the nothing that matters. And weâre told that the escape from the ârealâ nothing requires divinity, with ânothingâ thus defined by fiat to be âthat from which only God can create something.âNOTE: Actually, what those who say that there is creation actually say is creation from no preexisting subject.p. 135 Rather, we can imagine an infinite number of universes stacked up above a single point in our space, invisible to us, but each of which could exhibit remarkably different properties. I want to emphasize that this theory is not as trivial as the theological musing of Saint Thomas Aquinas about whether several angels could occupy the same place, an idea that was derided by later theologians as fruitless speculation on how many angels could fit on the point of a needleâor more popularly, on the head of a pin. [Not quite but close. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_many...] Aquinas actually answered this question himself by saying that more than one angel could not occupy the same spaceâof course, without any theoretical or experimental justification! (And if they were bosonic quantum angels, he would have been wrong in any case.)NOTE: I think this paragraph comes close to what is the difference between those who think all is physical and to those who do not. I suspect multi-universes stacked above a single point takes more faith than thinking immaterial beings exist but be that as it may, Aquinas does give a theoretical argument as to why more than one angel cannot occupy the same space. In the first place, it is not occupy in our sense. In the second sense, the angel is âthereâ because of a manifestation of power, not because of a spatial relation.p. 143 At the same time, in science we have to be particularly cautious about âwhyâ questions. When we ask, âWhyâ we usually mean âHow?â If we can answer the latter, that generally suffices for our purposes, For example, we might ask: âWhy is the Earth 93 million miles from the Sun?â but what we really probably mean is, âHow is the Earth 93 million miles from the Sun?â That is, we are interested in what physical processes led to the Earth ending up in its present position. âWhyâ implicitly suggests purpose, and when we try to understand the solar system in scientific terms, we do not generally ascribe purpose to it.NOTE: Right! If one defines science as the empirical and mathematical verification of physical knowledge, absolutely. The issue is whether this is the only kind of knowledge that human beings can have.pp. 146-149 I have already argued in the preface to this book that merely defining ânothingnessâ as ânonbeingâ is not sufficient to suggest that physics, and more generally science, is not adequate to address the question. Let me give an additional, more specific argument here. Consider an electron-positron pair that spontaneously pops out of empty space near the nucleus of an atom and affects the property of that atom for the short time the pair exists. In what sense did the electron or positron exist before? Surely by any sensible definition they didnât. There was potential for their existence, certainly, but that doesnât define being any more than a potential human being exists because I carry sperm in my testicles near a woman who is ovulating, and she and I might mate. Indeed, the best answer I have ever heard to the question of what it would be like to be dead (i.e., be nonbeing) is to imagine how it felt to be before you were conceived. In any case, if potential to exist were the same as existence, then I am certain that by now masturbation would be as hot button a legal issue as abortion now is.NOTE: The shallowness of Kraussâ use of the definition of potential with respect to sexuality stuns me. One definition is: â(often potential for/to do something) the possibility of something happening or of someone doing something in the future.â The problem is that there is another definition of potential in physics: 2 Physics the quantity determining the energy of mass in a gravitational field or of charge in an electric field. There has to be a field of some sort for the electron-positron pair to pop out of empty space. That field is âsomething.â It has to be near a nucleusâ¦p. 148. Letâs now turn to one of the most remarkable features of our universe: it is as close to being flat as we can measure. I remind you of the unique facet of a flat universe, at least on scales where it is dominated by matter in the form of galaxies, and where a Newtonian approximation remains valid: in a flat universe, and only in a flat universe, the average Newtonian gravitational energy of every object participating in the expansion is precisely zero.NOTE: I do not understand this. The theory is apparently opposed to the notion of a curved universe and mandates that parallel lines will remain parallel. Whatever it means, I have always been curious about âspace.âa. First of all, is there an edge to space. Could we get to the edge of spaceb. Secondly, it seems to me that to say there is space implies there is something there, even if there is nothing in parts of it. For space implies extension and extension implies that something is there somewhere which is measurable. p. 149-150. First, I want to be clear ab out what kind of ânothingâ I am discussing at the moment. This is the simplest version of nothing, namely empty space. For the moment, I will assume space exists, with nothing at all in it, and that the laws of physics also exist. â¦ I suspect that, at the times of Plato and Aquinas, when they pondered why there was something rather than nothing, empty space with nothing in it was probably a good approximation of what they were thinking about. 	As we saw in chapter 6, Alan Guth has explained precisely how we can get something from this kind of nothingâthe ultimate free lunch. Empty space can have a non-zero energy associated with it, even in the absence of any matter or radiation. General relativity tells us that space will expand exponentially, so that even the tiniest region at early times could quickly encompass a size more than large enough to contain our whole visible universe today.p. 151. It certainly seems sensible to imagine that a priori, matter cannot spontaneously arise from empty space, so that something, in this sense, cannot arise from nothing. But when we allow for the dynamics of gravity and quantum mechanics, we find that this commonsense notion is no longer true. This is the beauty of science, and it should not be threatening. Science simply forces us to revise what is sensible to accommodate the universe, rather than vice versa. NOTE: I have to presume that there is non-zero energy as a kind of field, in space, or making up space, I do not know. But with both space and non-zero energy, there is something around. In a funny kind of way, Krauss in the paragraph on p. 151 is announcing the new metaphysics. I wonder if Krauss thinks that Plato and Aquinas meant by something, âmatter.â Be that as it may, cf. the following paragraph in (following up on pp. 149-59):Thomas Aquinas and Big Bang Cosmology William Carrollhttp://www3.nd.edu/Departments/Marita...âJoseph yciski has described well the confusion between metaphysical nothingness and the concept of a vacuum in contemporary physics. Even in the absence of particles, ""physical fields do not disappear, and their properties still can be characterized in the abstract language of mathematics.""(35) In attempting to describe the significance of Hawking's discussion of creation, C.J. Isham claims that we can identify the mathematical concept of any empty set with the absolute nothing in the traditional understanding of creation out of nothing: ""The initial space from which the universe 'emerged' can be defined to be that part of the boundary of four-dimensional space which is not part of the (later) three-surface. But this is the empty set, which gives a precise mathematical definition of the concept of 'nothing'!""(36) âOn the other hand, see Aquinas, 12. ""Apparet quod illud spatium in quo stellae moventur, non potest esse vacuum, eo quod impossibile est esse vacuum in natura [...] Relinquitur ergo quod totum illud spatium in quo stellae videntur moveri, est plenum caelesti corpore, quod pertinet ad ipsam substantiam sphaerarum"" (In ii De caelo et mundo, lect. 13, n. 3). Does Void Exist?: The Thomistic Rejection of its Presence in the Natural World. Mario Enrique Sacchihttps://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/ti98/sacc...p. 152. To summarize then: the observation that the universe is flat and that the local Newtonian gravitational energy is essentially zero today is strongly suggestive that our universe arose through a process like that of inflation, a process whereby the energy of empty space (nothing) gets converted into the energy of something, during a time when the universe is driven closer and closer to being essentially exactly flat on all observable scales.NOTE: And there is the conclusion, nothing becomes something. Why canât he say that an energy field gets converted into matter by the mechanics of physical forces (strong, weak, gravity, electrical or whatever it is)?NOTE on pp. 172-173. Krauss comes back to the notion of First Cause and demolishes it. I suspect that he means by First Cause a self-created being. That is certainly not what is meant by Aquinas and probably not by Aristotle. Aristotle spoke of the Prime Mover and he did identify that Prime Mover as God, although many have said he was only talking about form or mind or nous. Cf. Aristotleâs Identification of the Prime Mover as God, Joseph G. Defilippo, The Classical Quarterly, New Series, Vol. 44, No. 2 (1994 p. 393 et seq. Certainly, Aquinas molded Aristotle. Cf. I, 7, 1. Is God unlimited? Aristotle tells us that in ancient times all philosophers considered the first principle to be unlimited, and reasonably so since they saw no limit to the things deriving from the first principle. But because they made a mistake about the nature of the first principle they made a corresponding mistake about its limitlessness. They thought of the first principle as matter, and hence assigned to it a material limitlessness, saying tht the first principle things was some limitless body.â"
211,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,4,"Actually, I'm only about 75% through this book, but I decided to review it now since Dr. Krauss (a guy I like) is delving into religion and philosophy... stuff that is apparently outside his expertise. He says that he has debated theologians and I'm sure he is good at it, but in this book he makes a few errors and slights-of-hand to make his argument easier. I assume he has only the best of intentions. (I mean that because like I said... I like him.)In the beginning of this book, Dr. Krauss explains how frustrating he finds debating religious people and members of school boards. He says this in almost a defensive manner. I see this sort of stance taken by people who feel besieged by others who take a different (and wrong) view. I sometimes experience this myself when I try to explain Judaism to Christians.I am impressed that Dr. Krauss was a friend of atheist Christopher Hitchens, now passed away. I respected Hitchens because I could trust him to always tell the truth even when it did not help his cause. I trust Penn Jillette the same way. I do not trust Richard Dawkins. Dr. Krauss seems to be somewhere closer to Hitchens than Dawkins. Krauss admits the faults in his arguments but does not call a lot of attention to them. That fact that he points them out at all is encouraging. The reader simply has to be alert and realize what he is saying. (That is what I mean by slights-of-hand.)The complaint that sent me running to the keyboard is that he misrepresented Occam's Razor... the general principle that suggests that the simplest or most elegant solution to a problem is probably the correct one. In his book Dr. Krauss says that Occam's Razor is always the correct one as if it was a law of nature. That is an error. Therefore he begins with a flawed premise. That doesn't suddenly make religion correct. It simple means he is not using the English language correctly... a flaw he admitted he might fall into before he even set out. It's an easy mistake to make. I don't fault him. I am warning the reader so that the reader doesn't make a mistake.Defining terms is a prerequisite to any debate. The fact that a religionist would ask him to define his terms is not proof that all religionists are idiots. Dr. Krauss simply has to reform his question into terms the religionist can understand or define his terms. Not walk away in a huff.I get the same schtick from engineers, lawyers or anyone who has a specialty. They try to dazzle me with... uh... lingo... with unfamiliar terms. It is not unusual, but it is also not proof of anything.The problem is that Dr. Krauss is not a religionist himself. Therefore he is unaware that much of what he is saying smacks of a religious argument using science... and an implied ""Trust me. I'm an expert!"" I'm sure he is an expert in physics. I trust him in that. But I don't trust him to tell me about my faith. In essence he is trying to convert me to atheism. Religionists know about conversion and they know an attempt when they see it. Apparently Dr. Krauss doesn't realize that is what he is attempting to do. That is probably why he gets so much push-back. He is clumsy at it.Stick with what you know, Dr. Krauss. You will win more acolytes that way.Over all... well at 75% into it... this is a really good book. I just wish he would feel more comfortable while doing it.Penn Jillette is an atheist who feels perfectly comfortable with religionists and does not require religionists to be wrong so that he can be right. I recommend reading his book: God, No! Signs You May Already Be an Atheist and Other Magical Tales. (Warning: It contains a lot of vulgar language, but when I've seen him debating Christians he leaves the potty mouth at home. Nevertheless, I encourage people to read the book. I would gladly invite him to my home as I would invite Dr. Krauss, but not Dr. Dawkins.) I'll update this review once I've finished the book."
212,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53175625-sven,3,"Nothing is unstable .. that will pretty much be the essence I will recall from this book. It doesn't mean everything is stable, it means that whenever you have nothing, it will find a way to become something. While counter-intuitive this has a pleasantly reassuring appeal. The fact that the author credibly assures us this applies to the universe (where ""stuff"" has been demonstrated to pop-in and out of existence) doesn't seem that far-fetched vs more conventional life-experience. Whenever there's nothing going on..something always seems to pop up.In any case, given that either there is nothing and therefore nothing/no one can ask the question of why there is nothing/something or there is something and whatever it came from must always have come from something else..it's not that hard to accept that the whatever first something there was..it by this logic had to come out of nothing. Well, apparently it is actually hard for certain religions to accept that their deity, if it/he/she isn't a persona, may not even be ""a first cause"". Interesting how cosmologists who appear to be the mathematically smartest, financially most endowed individuals (electron colliders, space telescopes,..) find themselves mostly in debate with faithful, theologists and philosophers. When I refer to cosmologists as the smartest, it's because the experiments they conceive to measure the size and age of the universe (13.67 Billion years) are largely beyond my imagination and comprehension. My limited IQ stretches just enough to not get torn completely but it's hold on this part of the book is tenuous at most times. I was happy to learn that per such experiments late 1990s , our universe has now been unambiguously identified as being flat vs open or closed. At least a flat universe seems to be the easiest to understand of all universes.So this flat universe (which is not 2, and perhaps more than 3 dimensional) doesn't just exist, it expands. (Actually it's the expansion of nothing that created everything). The expansion part I was familiar with from popular Big Bang awareness. What I didn't before realize is that as a consequence of this expansion the evidence of the Big Bang (static on Tv's) will in a couple of Billion years be undetectable for us, similarly, we will not see all the galaxies beyond our own. We, therefore, appear to live in the limited time (limited being a relative term since it's still expressed in billions of years) when we can still detect our universe 's origin and demonstrate the expansion by seeing the red-shift of galaxies which move away from us. As the universe expands those galaxies will become so removed we won't see them at all. Likewise, as the universe expands the cosmic microwave background signature of the Big Bang will fade out of detection. Somehow and quite contrary to the author's intention, this suggests there might be a diety with a sense of humor after all. The author does go so far as to say that our universe might have the exact laws of nature it has because in any other universe we would be unable to survive to detect other laws. That opens up the gates to multi-verses and the TV series Quantum Leap.Everything was well brought, it only gets 3 stars from me because the author couldn't overcome my lack of intelligence on some of the techier parts. I trust he's right when he says it's proven there's more dark-mass than visible mass and that you gravitationally-lense to see further and that supernova's are standard candles but he benefits in this from my faith in him and his position is quite clearly that faith isn't enough !"
213,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/235151-richard,4,"NothingÂ¹ illuminates the unbridgeableÂ² chasm between religion and science as brightly as does the subject of Nothing. The fundamental difference between religion and science won't be found in any particular disagreement of fact, but rather in their foundational epistemologies. Science is built upon empiricism, whereas religion rests on rationalism (and also on revelation and faith, but itâs the incompatibility of empiricism and rationalism thatâs relevant here). Although Universe from Nothing is more about the physics of cosmogony than the philosophy, itâs that philosophical incompatibility that Iâd like to discuss. In Universe, Professor Krauss explains that the empiricistâs answer to the question why is there something rather than nothing? is that an empty universe would be unstable and would spontaneously stabilize itself by becoming a universe of stuff. Energy and matter, and even space and time, emerge into existence on their own. Krauss argues further (and I think somewhat speculatively, and perhaps unnecessarily) that the laws of physics themselves would spontaneously bootstrap if the universe were devoid not only of energy/matter and spacetime, but even of the rules that permit the existence of that stuff in the first place.The theologianâs objection to Kraussâ conclusions is that no matter how deeply an empirical explanation might reach, we can always dig to a deeper rationalist layer. If the laws of physics come into existence spontaneously, mustnât there be meta-laws to permit this? asks the theologian, and then meta-meta laws, and so on, ad infinitum. Theologians will insist that there must never be such an infinite regress (but why not? we donât know that infinite regress isnât a real thing), that the laws of physics must have an ultimate answer (but why? maybe the laws of physics have no deeper explanation but simply are), that we cannot accept that we just donât have an ultimate answer (but why? maybe ultimate answers donât exist, or exist incomprehensibly to us), and conclude that the answer to the question of existence must be God. (Having thus âprovedâ the existence of a generic, deistic God by rationalist means, they then switch methodologies to faith and revelation to âproveâ that this generic God is, in convenient fact, the particular God that they believe will provide them eternal paradise. But those are conversations for another time.)Krauss dismisses these objection out of hand, on the grounds that questions of objective fact that canât be answered empirically canât be answered at all. The point to understand here is that he is perfectly justified in doing so. That this dismissal is justified is something that religious apologists seem never to understand. Which brings me to that fundamental incompatibility. The relationship between empiricism and rationalism can be likened to that between Elvis and the Beatles. As the philosopher Tarantino observed: 
âBeatles people can like Elvis, and Elvis people can like the Beatles, but nobody likes them both equally. Somewhere, you have to make a choice, and that choice tells you who you are.â
 And so it is with epistemology: you can like both rationalism and empiricismÂ³ but you can only choose one to serve as your final arbiter of Truth, and that choice of methodology defines and informs your worldview. Loosely speaking, either physics trumps metaphysics, or metaphysics trumps physics; you canât have it both ways simultaneously on one single topic. Itâs certainly possible, however, to choose to apply empirical standards to one subject and rationalist standards to another, and this is precisely what anyone must do when (futilely) trying to prove that religion and science are compatible. In applying different standards to different realms (i.e. empiricism to scientific questions, rationalism to religious questions), one does not demonstrate that these subjects are compatible in any meaningful sense, but only that weâre capable of arbitrarily compartmentalizing our thinking. This may be a trivial sort of compatibility, but itâs not the philosophical accord that the theologians are after, and passing it off as such is, at best, intellectual dishonesty.Because of this divide, thereâs nothing that Krauss (nor any other empiricist) could ever say on the subject of Nothing that could ever satisfy a rationalist. To the rationalist, the Nothing that science has come to understand through observation is not the True Nothing, the Metaphysical Nothing, because mere observation can never reveal ultimate truth about anything. To the rationalist, that which we can observe is merely the extant manifestation of all the potential realities that might have existed, and which are all just as real as that which happens to have actualized. The ultimate Truth of these potential worlds, and therefore of the real world, may only be attained by means of rationalist arguments. To the rationalist, the rejection of these ideas is ""scientism"" or ""materialist bias."" But if (if) those accusations have any meaning at all, that meaning can only exist within the rationalist's own worldview.So, how do we choose between empiricism and rationalism? In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Stephen Hawking remarked, âthere is a fundamental difference between religion, which is based on authority, and science, which is based on observation and reason. Science will win because it works."" Over the past five centuries or so, empiricism has worked in ways that rationalism, over the course of more than five millennia, has never had and likely never will. Within the worldview of the empiricist, the practical success of empiricism (i.e. technology along with the stunningly wide and deep body of knowledge obtained through science) makes it the undisputed winner. The trouble here is that the value we place on empiricismâs success is in itself axiomatic and therefore unprovable within the rationalistâs worldview. A rationalist can (and must, if he wants to remain a rationalist) axiomatically reject the valuation of practical success as a measure of the worthiness of a worldview. Ultimately, there can be no way, even in principle, to reach into someone else's worldview and convince them that their paradigm is wrong. Ironically, the critics of the so-called ânew atheistsâ who accuse them of being ignorant of philosophy, are themselves missing the philosophical truth that within the worldview of science, theological arguments are by definition non-starters, regardless of how convincing they may be within their own sphere.For me, the debate between empiricism and rationalism (actually I'm veering more towards arguing against faith here; yes it's sloppy but so what?) is settled by the observation that science converges, whereas religion diverges. No matter their starting points, those whose last arbiter of Truth is reality always converge towards consensus. When empiricists hold mutually exclusive beliefs, they acknowledge that at least one, and perhaps all, of those beliefs must be incorrect; their shared reality eliminates the falsehoods to reveal those beliefs most likely to be true. By contrast, when two theologians make mutually contradictory claims, there is no way, even in principle, for them to determine which claim is correct. Each must convince themselves, based on nothing but their internal convictions and predilections, that they alone possess the true revelation and that all of the other theologians, who believe different things for exactly the same reasons, must be wrong.Â¹ Well, hardly anything.Â² Oh, yes it is. Get over it.Â³ Itâs impossible to not like both; rationalism and empiricism are yin and yang. Empiricism couldnât exist without axioms that are necessarily rationalist, yet rationalism couldnât exist without experiential inspiration. No concept can ever be either purely a priori or purely a posteriori."
214,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61227874-vahidlitphil,2,"The highly reputable physicist, Lawrence M. Krauss, sets out to tell us that universe came into existence practically from nothing. In his attempt to explain their latest findings, he wants us to understand that nothing is not nothing, or, alternatively, nothing is something quite significant. The immediate ramification of this assertion is that we should not ascribe undue importance to a divine being, or a creator, something that Krauss painstakingly tries to explain with ruthless objectivity and surgical precision. Inevitably, some feathers are ruffled as well. Personally, I think his account of our universe is unceasingly fascinating, but his personal inferences seem unbearably flawed. Science equals atheism, and you have identify with 1 or 0 or you are dumb! He explicitly puts forward the assertion that theology has no function, but this argument also touches on the importance of all humanities. While it is fascinating that they overwhelm and enlighten us with their findings, they also scare the hell out of you, since there is nothing that counts for something except 0 or 1. Then its safe to say that in the next world war, which doesn't seem very unlikely, human beings will be torn to shreds due to some mathematical equations that will justify actions taken by the leaders. It is quite frightening to see that human beings forget that science is not an end, but a means to better the world and the human condition. Through a scientific line of enquiry, all things amount to and stem from one question, So What?. That is, in any endeavor, we have to first and foremost weigh up the practical outcomes, and subsequently, fall into a soul-crushing pattern of commodifying everything around us, and through this, well, what sort of consequences are more likely?! I guess utter disregard for human beings as ''beings'' and conceptualization of human beings as a means for a lofty ideology. In fact, both Lawrence, and his friend, Richard Dawkins, who has written a compelling afterword for his book, both, openly, and again, openly, encourage ridiculing anyone who holds a contrary view to their beliefs, not sympathetic engagement with the aim of a dialectic that will result in a better outcome, but utter sneer for others. We all tend to brood on the importance of literature and philosophy and related fields that address us as the subject matter mainly, and not universe, as an entity that we should be cut off from, well, it seems like no matter how much knowledge you glean, you are prone to holding prejudice against people from different walks of life, and that's why we should study humanities to know ourselves better, and enjoy poetry and painting for it's own sake, and beauty for it's majesty and things in and for themselves. I can't help but understand Kant better in these cases, what does it really mean to perceive each human being as an end, if one captures that in it's full spectrum, other seemingly important issues might be dissolved.And lastly, I was also wondering how the less privileged will be treated in the future, with this cast of mind, they should either identify with 0 or 1 to survive, even if they have a thick mind to grasp it, they should fake it. Overall, Krauss and Dawkins arguments are amazing, but equally perplexing, when considered broadly in the light of the consequences that they entail for our universe."
215,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26690790-jane,2,"I'm not sure where I saw the recommendation to read this book, but I wish I hadn't.Mind you, this book was way above my pay grade, if you know what I mean, because it was written by a physicist and it's about cosmology. (The universe and all it entails fascinates me, but when you get into the scientific reasons why there is what there is in the universe and how it works, then I'm somewhat lost.)I had high hopes for this book when, within the first few chapters, the author wrote: ""...stars don't explode [go supernova] that often, about once per hundred years per galaxy. But we are lucky that they do, because if they didn't, we wouldn't be here. One of the most poetic facts I know about the universe is that essentially every atom in your body was once inside a star that exploded. Moreover, the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than those in your right. We are all, literally, star children, and our bodies made of stardust"" and ""Go out some night into the woods or the desert where you can see stars and hold up your hand to the sky, making a tiny circle between your thumb and your forefinger about the size of a dime. Hold it up to a patch of the sky where there are no visible stars. In that dark patch, with a large enough telescope of the type we now have in service today, you could discern perhaps 100,000 galaxies, each containing billions of stars.""The above two portions of the book so impressed me that I posted them on my Facebook page.But then, the egotistical author kept denigrating those who believe in creation by a higher power (he is a scientist and feels superior to those who believe unlike him and perhaps feels the need to convey to his fellow scientists his total disbelief in anything that has to do with God or a god-like entity). If he had mentioned once or twice his belief that there is no God and He/She is not responsible for anything in the universe, I may have been able to overlook it. But Krauss goes on and on about it, mentioning it, I think, in just about every chapter of the eleven chapter book and the epilogue.This I might have overlooked, too, but he actually--more than once--calls into question the intelligence of people who believe in creation by a higher entity even though, on page 139, he writes: ""If we wish to draw philosophical questions about our own existence, our significance, and the significance of the universe itself, our conclusions should be based on empirical knowledge. A truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implications."" He does not keep an open mind, but asks that others do. As for me, I believe in a combination of creation and science, and am willing to consider other opinions. The author believes his opinion is the only one. That just doesn't hack it for me.The author's ego so undermined what he was trying to put forth in this book that I would not recommend this book to anyone."
216,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73791019-robin-gregory,2,"For anyone wanting to delve into advances in physics and cosmology since Hawking's excellent 'A Brief History of Time', this is a great place to start. While the prose is not quite as succinct as Hawking's, Krauss nonetheless introduces us to startling range of theories and experiments that have completely changed how we look at the universe around us. In this regard, it is an excellent book and I for one got a far better understanding of Dark Matter, Dark Energy and the behaviour of virtual particles than I had before.So why only two stars..?For one thing, the entire book is littered with derogatory comments concerning religion. Hawking argued that because we are bound by the laws that govern our universe, we are precluded from ever knowing what happened before the Big Bang. In this way, the door is left open for the possible existence of a God, however unlikely or unpalatable that might be to the individual concerned. Krauss on the other hand, absolutely hates the idea of there being a God and does his best to use the physics he introduces, as a means of disproving the existence of a creator or divine influence. Theologians and philosophers are treated as little more than dirt, which in my view, greatly diminishes not only the quality of the end product, but also Krauss' standing as a balanced and respectable scientific investigator. (I am scientifically trained but not religious, by the way.)And this brings me onto my second point. Krauss' central thesis is that our universe arose from absolutely nothing. However, despite presenting a wide range of scientific discoveries that support different aspects of this idea, at no point in the book does he articulate an overarching theory to justify his proposition. Instead, he relies on three separate arguments, none of which, in and of themseleves, really advance us beyond our current state of knowledge, i.e. that we simply don't know for sure what created the universe that we live in. Because of this, Krauss actually ends up as a parody of the very people he is lambasting, trying to persuade us that the universe arose from nothing, without energy or physical laws, without a shred of evidence that this was actually the case.So overall, I found the book disapointing. As an introduction to recent scientific advances and thinking it is sound, but sadly it is diminished by Krauss' repeated attacks on religion and the lack of any solid proof for his central argument. A sensational title indeed and one that certainly caught my eye, but sadly a sensational disappointment when you get right in between the covers."
217,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5330821-jeff-t,2,"I painfully did not give this book three stars. I tried hard to justify it, but I just couldnât get there. I have a few reasons for this decision to give the book a worse rating. First, despite Krauseâs attempt to make physics understandable, clear, and the scientific theories that support the Big Bang theory the basis of his argument he just misses the mark. His whole purpose in writing this book is to prove to people who donât believe in science or the Big Bang the science and the Big Bang actually make a lot of sense. But instead of doing what people like Carl Sagan and Neil DeGrasse Tyson have so expertly done - make science more populist in its explanation and proliferation - he remains dedicated to an elitist approach by patting his own brighter back and stroking his pedantic professorships. Second, his obvious distaste for anyone not espousing his viewpoint or driven by any sort of religious motivation is palpable. No one ever convinced anyone else of anything by telling them they are stupid for thinking otherwise. Finally, Krause and Dawkins (who writes the afterward for him) both are guilty of deep intellectually dishonesty. They both clearly show how the observations of theorists and scientists of the past were flawed by helpful in bringing us to the conclusions that science has reached today. They are a bit judgmental of those of the past for thinking that they had somehow arrived at the definitive truth while through continued scientific rigor humanity progressed to the knowledge we have today. But both these men posit that today is the best time ever and forever to be a physicist! Based on what we know today, someday humanity will not be able to view the stars any longer as the universe expands and the light reaches distances far beyond our ability to see in its past. They make these claims somehow believing that what they know now is all we can know. That it would be impossible to know more. Foolish close minded smart people who think there are no more unknown unknowns. Isnât that the purpose of science? To keeping looking and find out if there is anymore? What evidence exists that would lead us to believe that there is no more to know? Nothing in our past would suggest that there is never anything else to know. It possible the universe sprang from nothing. And there is much evidence that shows it may return to nothing... but until that time, are we really to believe that science has already proved that there is nothing more? Two stars. "
218,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7494007-aaron,3,"Back in 2003, it was cool to rag on theists. You see, back then people were literally talking about a giant religious war between Christians and Muslims. People were talking about civilization-scale warfare. Any thinking person was like, ""I think I remember a John Lennon song about that?"" That's when Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens and Daniel Dennet wrote their classical New Atheism books. At the time they were necessary! The Bible Belt was screaming about religious terror, forgetting that they were still instigating terror at home.""Oh, you want to destroy our buildings, rewrite our history, live off planet-poisoning oil and create a country based on the religious law from a time when everybody on the planet wore sandals? Well, we do everything better and bigger over here in Texas."" Again, in 2003 it was probably a necessary reminder ""HEY GOD ISN'T REAL GUYS"".But by 2012 nobody was super concerned about that shit. We were concerned about whether or not healthcare was a right (it is) and if the government should force you to buy healthcare (it does). So why the fuck did Krauss spend 1/5th of his book ragging on theologians, philosophers and religious folk? I came to read about the ""Origin of the Universe"" as part of my ""read a bunch of history books from Big Bang to Twitter"" project, and instead I got a bunch of poorly executed anti-religious dunking. The scientific content of the book, when it is there, is pretty good: We discovered the universe was expanding, and then we discovered the Cosmic Background Radiation. We probed that and then found the Universe is as close to ""flat"" as it possibly can be (Pythagorean's Theorem works!) This is pretty special because it means the Universe won't collapse into itself, and when you pair it with quantum gravity you have a nice hypothesis for *why* it is flat: rapid inflation in space-time made what would otherwise be a curve into a flat line. Great theory!The book, however, doesn't answer its subtitle ""Why there is Something Rather Than Nothing"" and another 1/5 of the book is spent railing about how people keep changing the definition of ""Nothing"".They don't. Krauss is/was just drumming up controversy for this(/his next) book. 1/5 Anti-Theologizing.1/5 Anti-Philosophizing.3/5s Science.3/5 Stars."
219,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81350561-k-a-ashcomb,3,"The book is about what our understanding of modern cosmos is and how God relates to that. I cannot (or want to) dispute his scientific reasoning as I only have rudimentary knowledge around the issue and to think I could say anything based on that would be kidding myself. I liked the book. It was informative, comprehensive, funny at times, and had a clear purpose for argumentation. But there are two complaints.Firstly, this book was messy at times, and I was a bit surprised at how huge portion Richard Dawkins afterword took (hah, I combined two complaints into one.) But this didn't bother me or affect my reading. Secondly, I have always found it odd that religion(s) are simplified to the belief of God/gods. After getting my masters from Comparative Religion, I have thought of religion being more about group cohesion than anything else. Dogmatism and the rest don't really matter for the ""common"" believer. What they held dear to them are the traditions that combine them to their community. The little rituals that console them. And so on. Yes, the belief in one God who judge the believers and heathens is in the center of Judeo-Christian religions, but it is not the sole point. It is not the point of a wedding or funeral. The argument that disputing God's existence will make religions to cease is too farfetched for me. The rise of the New Age, self-help books, and spirituality (some combined with scientific belief and without God or gods) indicate that there is a need for meaning and belonging. And that is what religions are about for many who seek them. Also, the belief into God/gods are part of our brain structure and how we observe the world, see neuroscientific research done from religion or read Pascal Boyer's Religion Explained for starters. I'm not saying don't have an argument about God's existence or that this book is wrong (or blasphemy as that is far away from what I think,) but what I'm trying to say is that religions are much more than their God or gods.But to finish this review, this book wasn't about religion. It was about cosmos and existence of God and my second complaint is invalid and should be ignored. Krauss arguments against God are well made, but I don't see them as arguments against religion. Yet, what made me like this book was that finally someone knows how to form an argument!Thank you for reading!"
220,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,5,"Got this almost five years ago, now I can understand it. Basically there are three possible kinds of universes from the Big Bang: open, closed, and flat due to whether the total energy is positive negative or zero respectively. A zero energy flat universe can come from nothing, having a beginning and end in nothing rather than collapse on itself (closed) or expand forever (open). Remember with general relativity mass-energy bends space. You can measure the mass-energy of galaxies by their gravitational effects on the light we see. Well only 1% of the matter in the universe is visible matter we're familiar with. But even with matter and dark matter there isn't enough energy to account for the universe, only 30%. The rest is found in the vacuum of empty space, dark energy. The negative energy from gravity balances out the positive energy of matter so that the universe is flat. Zero energy. From this vacuum quantum particles appear out of nothing and vanish in an instant not violating conservation and add energy which is cancelled out by the negative energy of empty space. This is how ours and other universes could have come to be, spontaneously out of nothing. Krauss makes clear that we're not certain the universe is flat and from nothing but he makes a good case for it. The implications are pretty amazing. Nothing is something in physics, something comes from nothing, and nothing is unstable. The way Krauss uses nothing is not in the philosophical sense of absence of being but as empty space with nothing we can detect. With this definition creation ex nihilo is possible but does not require anything supernatural. It also means existence and nothingness are ultimately the same. There is literally no reason things exist versus not exist for the distinction is meaningless or is contingent by what we mean by a particular thing existing. Quite existential. Everything is contingent, even the laws and constants of physics, with no necessary existence with a causal chain terminating in a necessarily existing being. No physical need for a creator, though Krauss' conclusion is that this doesn't rule out God but makes the hypothesis unnecessary. "
221,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5205285-jennifer-stringer,3,"I picked up this book based on the title, and I have to say I was disappointed. I was interested in a purely out of logicâs sake, and not interested in a theist vs. atheist debate. Gratefully, he tells us upfront that he is not going to answer it and I suppose could have stopped right there. I had read a couple of biographies of Einstein and thought I might be up for the intellectual challenge of cosmology, but it didnât take long before the explanations went over my head. He does say we donât know what we donât know, and that is a HUGE caveat. Other explanations include: there is no such thing as nothing, it only appears as nothing (if that didnât sound familiar). Even if there is ânothing,â the laws of physics are still in effect and perhaps laws still unknown can cause something from nothing â gravity could pull a particle from an alternate universe and then it would appear that something came from nothing. (But still, the particle came from somewhereâ¦) So, just very unsatisfactory. 	Also, self-righteousness is just as unattractive in atheists and it is in theists. Personally, I think you only belittle yourself when you attempt to belittle someone else. State your case as a scientist and let your reader come to his/her own conclusions. Anyway, that is my two cents. Iâm glad I plowed through, I think I caught a glimpse of some of the higher science involved, but maybe some better editing might have made this book more readable. In the end, I was put in a Whitman frame of mind:When I heard the learnâd astronomer, When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me, When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them, When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room, How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick, Till rising and gliding out I wanderâd off by myself, In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time, Lookâd up in perfect silence at the stars."
222,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19750450-jeff-gabriel,3,"In general this was a good and interesting book. It's a very complex subject to give insight into and the author does a good job with that. Unfortunately I think much of this type of science requires the related math to be truly grasped - but that's not a fault of the book's so much as maybe the type of book. The thing that confuses me about this book is that it was written only partly to inform about science and partly as an anti-faith polemic. This is an odd addition to several books in this space (brief history of time, our mathematical universe, and others) where it seems like the drive to explain for the author is based in a sense of themselves as latter day Galileos. I am sure they run into faith based opposition and that these anti-intellectuals exist, but are they really reading these books?In the specifics of this book, as well as in the general case they all fight against the god of the gaps - which is a good thing to dissuade people from. However, having dispensed with this god they decide the case against all faith, which ignores revelation out of hand. It seems to me that it wouldn't matter if god sprang from the big bang if this entity managed to communicate with humankind - you would want to check that out. In this sense every one of these books leaves me feeling like the authors didn't do their homework on their secondary concern (or perhaps their primary driver for writing to layman scientists). Finally, the consistent refrain in god of gaps polemics is that people of faith are at ease with no science because they have an easy answer already in hand. The author then turns around to use the science of people of faith like Newton and Leibniz (and a large horde of others). Just a lazy and perhaps disingenuous claim which shows me their fundamental concern is not education but evangelism of their point of view, casting their entire work into a different light."
223,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7552897-sebastian,3,"Okay, first Iâm going to address the 2018 elephant in the room; these days, hearing Krauss lament the poor treatment of women in science sounds, to say the least, brutally hypocritical. I cringed hard every time he brought the issue up, and since heâs dealing with cosmology, he canât help touching upon (ouch!) the likes of Henrietta Swann Leavitt or Vera Rubin. But letâs put all that aside for a moment and focus on the book.Well, the subtitle promises that we will find out âwhy there is something rather than nothingâ, and SPOILERS AHOY from here on out, but I must say that Krauss fails on that front. The key problem is that, indeed, it is difficult to pin down and strictly define ânothingâ as a tangible (heh) concept that could then be shown to produce a, well, something. I would not say that âquantum vacuumâ, as he seems to insist during the initial chapters, qualifies, and although Krauss spends some time lamenting how the philosophers and theologians he discussed this issue with keep moving the goalposts whenever he tries to get a solid answer as to what ânothingâ is, through the progression of later chapters even he acknowledges that a proper nothing would be an absence not only of matter and energy, and not even of spacetime itself, but an absence of even the rules â the physical laws â that govern this void. But just as he removes one element after another of reality to get to the chapter where he promises to show how being emerges from complete non-being, from the absence of any structured substrate or even rules, he suddenly resorts to wild multiversical hand-waving and deftly sidesteps the whole issue, rather rudely leaving the patient reader, who plodded through quite a bit of by now well-known pop-sci cosmology to get to these juicy bits, dangling, with nothing to show for the effort. On a more positive side, at least the book is short, so not a lot of time was wasted getting to this non-answer."
224,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20810712-donato-colangelo,4,"Witty and entertaining. Krauss dedicates large part of this book to explaining the evidence of the big bang and what we can say about the universe's future. Complex and counterintuitive concepts are presented in a clear way. The very last three chapters are about the soul of the book - that which gives the title to it - and I generally found it satisfying when not awe inspiring and jaw-dropping. The only let down is the last question that naturally comes in mind when one inquires such topics. If matter can emerge from space, an act of creation that is well masked by the Uncertainty Principle, and spacetime itself can emerge from the space-devoid nothingness, where do the physical rules that allow spontaneous creation (or, rather, the inherent instability of nothingness) come from? Or, to put it in a different perspective, is spacetime-devoid nothingness the true, fundamental ""nothing""? The existence of physical rules in this nothingness is indeed ""somenthing"", nonetheless. Is thus this nothingness eternal and the physical rules as well? Krauss cannot answer these questions, which are well beyond our capabilities, and perhaps no one will ever be capable of collecting data and evidence to reply. For what matters, Krauss delivered part of the answer to the Origin. The multiverse hypothesis, he claims, can help reduce the importance of the physical rules origin question, but we cannot dismiss out of hand the contrary, i.e. that there is no multiverse and that, alas!, there should have been an origin for the physical rules as well.Inebitably, the author has to acknowledge that we do not have to answer yet. He insists upon one key aspect of the debate, though, and in this he has my full support: that to rely on the easy God of the gaps approach will tell us nothing for sure.All in all, it's a really interesting book, entertaining as Krauss's own debates and interview."
225,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5144353-phil-giunta,4,"Counted among the best of contemporary science popularizers, Dr. Lawrence Krauss presents an edifying and eminently readable guide through the scientific theories of cosmogony, as well as the history of scientific research and discovery on the topic all to answer the question, âIs there truly such a thing as nothing?â An award-winning theoretical physicist and cosmologist, Krauss explains various theories and evidence including the Big Bang versus steady state theory, cosmic inflation, particle physics, string theory (of which he is not necessarily a proponent), dark energy, dark matter, cosmic microwave background radiation, the âcosmic jerkâ effect on the accelerating universe, and much more. He also spends several pages pondering whether cosmologists and astronomers trillions of years from now will be able to ascertain the true origins of the universe once it has expanded to a point where so much physical evidence may no longer be available. I would be remiss if I didnât mention that an underlying theme of Kraussâs book is the dismissal of theology and all Creation myths as possessing any factual basis for the origin of the universeâa point which Krauss touches on sporadically at various points. One aspect that I enjoy as much as the science is learning about the history of scientific theories and discovery. As the book unfolds, Kraussâlike Carl Sagan, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michio Kaku, and othersâtakes the time to offer brief anecdotes and background information on several of the notable physicists, mathematicians, astronomers, and cosmologists who have contributed to our knowledge of the universe over the past century.

I already know the answers to these questions and questioning those answers makes me uncomfortable. Centuries of scientific progress from the sharpest and most diligent humans among us means less than my personal opinion. I do not know of or understand the rigor of the scientific method, so the logical conclusion is that these arrogant scientists have no rigor and are wildly speculating from a couch with no proof or basis.]It seems to me the most arrogant among us often tend to see arrogance where there's the least of it.I won't, though. It shall be an honest 4-stars. This book has great potential, is important, is incredibly interesting, and should be elaborated upon and enriched with any updated physics findings that come in the next decade or so.The book as it is now, I'm afraid, could use better copy editing and better explanatory frameworks.But, to keep it in perspective, this is the best we have so far in intertwining Cosmology with that deep age-old philosophical question (This is what it was written to be!), and Lawrence Krauss deserves much praise for it."

There was plenty that I was just barely holding on to, and some that I maybe just lied to myself about understanding. So how can I critique something I didnât fully get? Iâm just gonna throw 5 stars out there and put my trust in Lawrence Krauss.A lot of these âcelebrity scientistsâ have said that they get annoyed with peopleâs bad arguments because people donât know enough about science to know that they are wrong. I can safely say that after this read I am perfectly aware of where I stand in terms of challenging academia any time soon.Aaaaaand I just had to delete half this review because I started using 2 years of community college to argue an astrophysicistâs definition of âNothing.âGrasping some of the concepts in these pages for a blue collar guy is like trying to wrap your head around infinity or the holy trinity or one of lifeâs many riddles.Despite the restlessness in my mind, this book did contain a lot of easily understandable information about the current state of knowledge we have about the universe. It just got a little complex in the last 50 or 60 pages. At any rate I feel itâs good to check in with science from time to time to see where we stand on figuring this whole thing out and Lawrence Krauss is definitely a great source for current science and theories."
228,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3688138-kurt-anderson,4,"Not at all bad. I was mostly interested in exploring the apparent paradox of why there is still matter when it should have been eliminated with its respective antimatter during initial inflation. (That's definitely the biggest gap in my knowledge in the ""big bang to present"" timeline.)I got a whole lot more than I bargained for! The book walked a very difficult tightrope, and did it well: it was simple enough for me to (marginally) understand complex theories that were totally foreign to me while not being SO dumbed down where I was rolling my eyes and thinking 'yeah, I know that already.'One issue that I had is that the meat of the book, while incredibly informative, is flanked by some moderately militant anti-theism. Part of me understands this; it's like running into someone with a cast. You see someone wearing a cast and you ask them ""what happened"" and the person gets disproportionately annoyed. That might be the first time you're asking that (or seeing her in a cast), but she's been dealing with this crap for weeks now! You're stepping into the middle of something that has a lot of emotional context to which you are not privy (and, to be fair, for which you are not responsible).That's what this feels like. Now, is this kind of defensiveness understandable? Absolutely. Is it a pleasure to read? Not especially.Overall, a fantastic read for those interested in cosmology and quantum physics."

In a similar vein to Sir Richard Dawkins he's anti-religion. Heck, I'm pretty anti-religion myself, I can appreciate Dawkin's points about how much cruelty human to human, has been caused by these man-made belief systems - my problem with both him and Krauss (in lectures) is that they always seem to be singing to the choir. You can't win others to your side by mocking them, putting them down, and refusing to validate their feelings. You don't have to validate beliefs or thoughts - especially if said thoughts are erroneous, but you should try to validate feelings if you are trying to win people over. Otherwise all that happens is that they shut up in your presence and as soon as your back is turned they go back to whatever they were doing. (If you've ever parented a teenager you will know what I mean.) Whew, sorry for the long lead in - because what I mean to say is that I was So Pleasantly surprised by how good this book is. It is very readable for the average reader and did not feel weirdly too complex the way some Hawking books do. The language is at a high school level and very engaging. I imagine this guy as a professor is probably much kinder and encouraging than he sometimes comes off in his public lectures. This is a great book and very illuminating. Give yourself time to savor the implications."
230,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38182641-tiger-lewis,2,"Lawrence Krauss is certainly intelligent and well versed in the subject of theoretical physics and cosmology; however, he is not a good writer - this book, whatever it is, likely is much better inside Mr. Krauss's head - it didn't make it out as a whole piece - instead, it is an epic fail. How? Because instead of reading like a book of science about science, such as those we have from Dawkins or Sagan, it is instead a painstakingly obvious manifesto of atheism. What I would like to say is pick a topic - are you writing a book that is about science? Or are you writing a book about philosophy? I do not care which, just pick one. This book appears to be a book of science, and there is much science in it - but the underlying empty space is dominated by a mission to debunk faith. This may be acceptable in a debate, or a different forum, but, I did not select this book to bolster an argument; I selected it to read about theoretical physics and cosmology. What a tragic lost opportunity of a certain great mind to share his genius in the field of science, rather than hounding faithheads with his atheist pugnacity. Still, underneath that, there is a good dose of science and a treat - an afterword by Richard Dawkins which reads better than the book. That is simply because Dawkins is a stellar writer and summarizes Krauss in a way that is brilliant, simple, and concise without punching one in the head."
231,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8273355-dru,3,"This book had real potential, but fell flat for a few reasons:#1) The author fell prey to one of the most classic audiobook blunders of all time--thinking he's a professional narrator. This guy may be a brilliant physicist and a regular lecturer, but I just called him ""Mushmouth"". Seriously, if you can't enunciate all 5 syllable is ""cosmological"", you have no business narrating a book where this term and others like it occur regularly#2) Like EVERY physicist who TRIES to make cosmology clear to the masses, he FAILS to clearly articulate the many different interpretations of ""an expanding universe"". That is, there's the movement of galaxies away from one another because they are moving in FIXED space, there is the expansion of space itself, which (like a balloon being inflated) will make things get further apart even if they have no actual motion, and there is the combination of these two factors. The author sucks completely at distinguishing between these, often implying he's discussing one when later it seems he's discussing the other.#3) His choice to repeatedly interject his personal vendetta against religion. I'd rather he let religion die it's own natural death than lecture from a soapboxIn general, the book was interesting, and helped clarify Dark Matter and Dark Energy, but not completely. "
232,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79708666-mustafa-mehmetoglu,2,"The author attempts to bring an explanation to how it all began! More formally, the author argues that modern quantum field theory is able to explain how the material world can come to a stable existence as we see it today. Moreover, the author further argues that even space time itself can come to existence from nothingness purely by QFT.The book's explanation of the physics might feel inadequate to many readers, which is understandable. QFT is a highly advanced field and explaining it in a brief book is not possible IMO, so this is not the author's fault. In fact, the book is still able to convey the basic ideas.However, my more important criticism is how Krauss seem to ignore, and he might be unaware of, some important philosophical questions that should be discussed before the question of whether QFT can bring the universe into existence. Our modern knowledge of physics come from observing the patterns in the universe, theories like QFT are models that attempt to predict these patterns. It is not known why the universe obeys this particular QFT model and not some other, for instance, older disproven models. It is not clear, therefore, what it means to have the laws of QFT without having a universe at all! Are these laws eternal and all-powerful like a god? The book's conclusions are contingent on how we approach these questions."

Aside from basic schooling in general principles and the odd, terrible-CGI documentary, I began this book with no knowledge and an open-mind and I hope my review is helpful for those in a similar position. Krauss presents a very methodical and clear argument with substantial evidence (as one would expect) to endorse his claims. For the reader from a very limited physics background, such as myself, it was challenging to grasp a lot of the content as the book progressed. A solid understanding of classical physics is implicitly required for a full understanding of the argument and Krauss wastes no time explaining them. While I also understand his need for including the theological perspective of creation, I felt it was sometimes haphazardly shoe-horned in and superfluous to the point he was making. Despite this, the findings and arguments presented by Krauss are exciting and just because they aren't understood after a first read-through by a layman doesn't nullify them or mean they aren't elegant and compelling. I would recommend the book but ensure you have done the subsequent research on classical physics and give it a few passes if you're anywhere as clueless as I was when first addressing the subject."
234,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8055573-louis,4,"A Universe from Nothing by Lawrence M. Krauss attempts to explain the latest thoughts on âWhy there is something rather than nothingâ in our universe. Dr Krauss Ph.D. is a theoretical physicist and writes a comprehensible book on the subject. He has an easy style and is able to explain complex subjects without completely burying the reader. He provides a nice background of our discoveries that have led us to this point so far in our understanding of the universe and ties it into the latest understandings to explain how the nothingness of âspaceâ is thought to be unstable and that it is expected that energy and matter would explode onto this blank stage. That it is a process that most likely could occur and doesnât require a creator to initiate. He admits, there is no proof to what he writes here nor a way to test it at this time, but in looking at what exists in our universe and the laws of physics, he creates a nice foundation to this explanation. He is giving us an overview without the detailed math that would come with an actual discovery or proof. While the future may turn out different, what he does give us here is a possible understanding to the basic processes and principles that could create universes as something expected. Not a miracle, but rather the result of natural processes. "
235,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40796061-corey-dyck,2,"Iâll start with the positive. I enjoyed the survey of thought over the years is cosmology and physics. This is a mostly a rehash of the work of others which you could find in many other books, but it was well laid out and pleasant to read.My problem with the book is the title and assumed premise of the book itself. The title would suggest that Krauss was going to tell us how, or at least in theory how, our universe could come to exist out of nothing. Instead he ends up redefining ânothingâ in such a way as to suite his purposes. At several places in the book he talks about matter particles popping in and out of nothing. Anyone with a fairly basic knowledge of physics, chemistry, and cosmology will clue in quite quickly to what this nothing actually is. These particles are simply converting back and forth from a state of matter to energy in an electrical field. Itâs common knowledge that matter and energy can change forms in certain circumstances. Kraussâ nothing still requires preexisting laws and in addition to empty space that already contains energy. The whole exercise seems to an elaborate illusion to fool those not well versed in the science or to confirm those people with a priori commitments to materialism."

I did not realize this was the point of the book when I began reading it. This book, although full of scientific intrigue, is more of a philosophical one full of scientific backing to support an Atheistic theology.The beginning of the book was not as enjoyable to listen to because of this and I thought about quitting it halfway through. I quickly decided to see it to the end though realizing this person has every right to preach to me as I have undoubtedly felt a right, even an obligation to preach to others about my own convictions regarding the creation of the cosmos.With this renewed approach, I finished and thoroughly enjoyed the authors explanation of his atheistic ideology on the basis of the science that he deals with on the daily. Although not convincing in any way to shed any doubt on the faith I hold in a Creator, it did help me understand the point of view of the other side of the coin. It proved a healthy and respectful debate that religious folks and non-religious folks can and should be having."
237,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9956536-rick,2,"The book was interesting, but the author is smug. I found the guy to be generally annoying. And everything was an attack on religious belief. It gets old after a while. I also think he landed flat in answering why or how there is something rather than nothing. And how the universe could have been created from ""nothing."" He claims that the universe probably came from quantum fluctuations, which isn't ""nothing.""I enjoyed the part about how we discovered the universe was expanding by measuring the red shift of various stars / galaxies at various distances. The farther away the star is, the more red shifted it is (the faster it is moving). It was interesting to think about how in the distant future the universe will have expanded so much that eventually space itself will be expanding faster than the speed of light (which is allowed, just objects cannot travel faster than light THROUGH space), and therefore if people are still around there will not be much to see in the sky. So, we live in a very unique time where we can observe the universe and gather enough data to conclude the universe had a beginning, etc. "
238,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16195684-thomas-m-burby,4,"I appreciate Krauss' writing style - he is easily comprehensible and his pace is fast but he doesn't gloss over important ideas. However, I can't help but think of this as a tract - a scientific and eminently reasonable tract for the non-existence of God. While I don't agree with the basic premise - that there can be something from nothing - no prime mover, I do have praise for this book. As a tract, the author is thoroughly convinced in his idealogy, as he should be. Science is his filter through which he comprehends the world. But he doesn't seem to think that there might be other filters, lenses if you will, through which we can view reality. Religion - God, either through organized ways or through mystical ways - can exist alongside science. If you think about God, you might wonder, where did he come from? Oh, he's always been there? Okay, then - did he come from nothing? If so, then the title of this book and the ideas that are presented are perfect - except that instead of the Universe coming from nothing - perhaps God did? I give this four stars because it Krauss is one of the great minds of our time and I think he is a dreamer, whether he believes it or not. "

The historical information about Einstein, Schrodinger and others was also interesting.However, I felt the book fell flat in terms of the main theme of it. A lot of science (heady science stuff) is not necessarily presented in an every day Joe type of format. I am a fan of popular science books as well as TV shows that touch on the universe and it's origins. That being said, a lot of the information explained in the book seemed at times like an info dump, while pertinent to the subject, it came off like cheerleading almost. Coming it at under 200 pages, I felt that there was unneeded information presented which made me realize that I am not a scholar in these particular scientific disciplines.I did really like the snippets of humour Krauss dropped throughout the book, and also the calling of religion and educational systems which seemingly exist to attempt to discredit science."

What I loved most about the book was the unbiased tone of Lawrence throughout the book, nowhere did he impose his theories rather even refuted them as a true scientist. This book made me realize why I love science so much. It doesn't impose, doesn't demand acceptance rather prevails after numerous refutations.To quote Lawrence Kraus, ""If we wish to draw philosophical conclusions about our own existence, oursignificance, and the significance of the universe itself, our conclusions should be based on empirical knowledge. A truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implications."""
241,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56989172-james,4,"Quite an interesting book if you are interested in the fabric of reality and origins of the universe. The book only partially answers the question of why there is something by explaining how matter expands and disappears out of existence spontaneously. What is proposed is that 'nothing' is actually dark energy made up of 'virtual' particles. So although the account is fascinating scientifically, we are still left from everything (Big Bang) arising from dark energy, which is a proposed idea of something we cannot measure or detect. The biggest take away from the book though, is that something will always be produced from 'nothing' because 'nothingness' is inherently unstable.I recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject matter, but it may leave some readers behind as the subject matter can get on the technical side, and it helps to have a baseline level of knowledge of physics and cosmology."

Now, normally I don't do this- writing reviews for books not read is a bad habit. After all, how can you fairly review and engage with a book you haven't read? So, let's call this a presumptive analysis or a title review. Now, science is incredibly important and useful in investigating the natural world. There are a plethora of questions that science is well suited to address and useful to help us understand more about reality- these are empirical questions and are of great import. However, there are questions simply outside of the scope of science- questions of (non-qualitative) value, meaning, purpose, and other related topics address things outside the domain of natural science. Being qua being falls into this category- *how* the universe began can (at least in theory) be empirically solved; but, *why* there is something rather than nothing is a question of ontology that is outside of the empirical realm.Edited for clarification "
243,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69313297-jina,4,"While I found the majority of this book quite fascinating, I felt like the last 50 or so pages were unnecessary. Perhaps this is because the last two books I read had covered these topics in greater detail, leaving me to feel as if Krauss was wondering too far from his own book topic. Otherwise, I felt like this book was really thorough, stuck to the topic at hand, and easy to understand. It can be quite mind boggling to think about where our universe came from, where itâs going, and that 99% of our universe is invisible to us. âAs we expand our understanding, we will next see that inflation can represent simply the tip of a cosmic iceberg of nothingness.â Krauss makes a point in his book to explain that the time to better understand our universe is now as it will eventually be too late to do so. Itâs quite sad how little the world has invested in our government run space programs, but thankfully people like Elon Musk exist."

Krauss' style is dense of course, and this took seven months to read - using both my physical copy and the audiobook from the library. Many paragraphs need to be read over several times, and I am no scientist or mathematician, much less a cosmologist. Still, the concepts are made very accessible with concentration, and I know now things I didn't before - like that we've measured how far we can see into the depths of space with a balloon in Antarctica, and how light ""bounces"" off of black holes, and how bubbles of unstable stuff can pop out of nothing for infinitesimal fractions of a second. It was well worth the read!"

As much as I want to, I don't and I don't think I'll ever will. Either write an anti-theism book or a science book. Having one with bits of another is confusing and unnecessary. The afterword of Richard Dawkins made it all even more confusing. The afterword really felt like one for an anti-theism book. But the bulk of the book really isn't.From a scientific point of view, I did enjoy the book although it is complex for someone with my (low) level of knowledge on the subject. I wonder how much more I would appreciate it if the time and effort put on religion was used to make it more approachable for the physics layman."

That said chapter 8 'A Grand Accident' really did make me think.....the idea of multiverses and how they could occur by creation of pockets in space. The underlying theme is that space is filled with a mysterious dark energy and it propels inflation of the universe at ever increasing speeds. I also liked the idea of virtual multiverses existing in different dimensions. It is not a bad book, just a difficult book, both in writing style and grasping the concepts. I did have to re-read paragraphs a few times! I think if it had not kept bringing up religion being superfluous to the universe I think it may have gained 3 stars but by continuing mentioning it, all it did was detract from the book (for me anyway)."

It doesn't help that the book lacks notes, references, and suggested further reading. The material does stretch the mind, and I came away convinced that a universe from nothing is possible for certain values of nothing, but no answer is suggested for ultimate origins except an eternal multiverse. Anyone looking for certainty will be disappointed; Krauss is quite clear that much is yet unknown and that much of what he suggests are plausibilities, not facts (which I, for one, appreciate).

How could it have happened? Is our universe the only one? Later on he does ask why our universe might have been created, but he points out that such a question may be meaningless. Above all, his goal is to show how the universe could have appeared from nothing, and how that means a creator is unnecessary.Written with skill, clarity and economy, this is a superb outline of the state of play in cosmology circa 2012. It simplifies theories without sacrificing their essence or importance - a rare skill in science writing -Â and while it doesn't give all the answers, it does elegantly and clearly give reasons why such answers may be impossible for us to know.

I got somewhat lost in the physics lingo in certain sections and a few more images would have helped I think.In the end, an enjoyable read that explains how far we have got so far in explaining the origins and properties of the Universe.

We now know that something (dark energy) is constantly being created in the ""nothing"" that is space, and almost immediately ceases to exist. This book, and the science behind it, show that the typical person's understanding of ""nothing"" is limited and incorrect, and the creation of our universe from ""nothing"" is not inexplicable. "

The Physics content and arguments for why Science is the best tool to describe our Universe is still worth reading though.

This is within a universe that already exists though. It doesn't go back further to investigate how the nothing was there in the first place.I have knocked two stars off as the author often flexes his own work and tells you how he predicted something before anyone, but in a false modest way. He also criticises other scientists in a passive-aggressive way. It's not very professional, I've never known a science book previously where the author's bitterness shows through the writing. Also the afterword by Richard Dawkins is pointless and a bit cringey. He summarises the book you've just read, interspersed with praising the author."
260,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5912350-chromis,3,"'A Universe From Nothing' is a short read for two reasons: that the author is such a talented expositor of science he requires little space in which to effectively communicate challenging physics concepts; that the author is such a terrible philosopher he requires little space in which to perform naive generalisations whose metaphysical breadth far exceeds their worth. Thus, this book is not just short, it is also wonderful and woeful.Krauss' writing is so energetic, enthusiastic and earnest, particularly during the early chapters in which the breathtaking developments of cosmological understanding are presented in historical context, that his failure to resist the desire to dislocate and wrench the overarching narrative into congruence with his prejudices is a tragedy. Consequently, a wonderful picture is needlessly fractured by polemic. It is as if the driver of a tour bus pulls over at regular intervals, interrupting the flow of the idyllic landscape across the window, to remind us what he thinks of the Prime Minister. Where in the book the models and their evidence, some of which Krauss was personally involved with, are presented with impartiality, is where he shines.Eventually our tour approaches the present day, the province over which the cutting edge will always preside. Cutting edges are fraught with doubt, dispute, weird data and popularised conjecture. Insufficient notice is offered to the reader where the physics becomes contentious and/or speculative, such that the seamless narrative move from accepted cosmological orthodoxy into intellectually premature conceptions of cosmogenesis is misleading in its assumed authority. For instance, where chaotic inflation, a model whereby quantum fluctuations drive regions of the Universe to exit inflation at different times and decay into one of a number of possible causally-disconnected low-energy quantum states, is really one of a number of speculative eternal inflation models currently lacking substantiation beyond their mathematical or philosophical convenience.Sometimes it can appear as though a multiverse, as an assumed physical correlate to the extra-dimensional string landscape, or as assumed 'bubbles' causally disconnected by the exponential metric expansion of space in eternal inflation models, is posited merely to justify a probabilistic interpretation of the anthropic principle, thus circumventing the question of life-enabling 'fine-tuning'. Krauss struggles to convince that multiverse models entail scientific validity...because they don't, yet: a state of mathematical and sociological affairs Lee Smolin has been careful to chart in detail in his work. Ultimately science is not about what model might be optimal to refute theistic conceptions of reality (ironic that Krauss himself reminds us of and later reiterates the immortal principle regarding our worldviews conforming to nature and not the other way around), but what can be inferred is the case from evidence retrieved by experiment and observation. In his eagerness to score points against believers, Krauss has lost sight of the role of science in the quest for truth.It would be inattentive of me not to comment on the popular complaint regarding 'A Universe From Nothing'. The book makes an extraordinary claim to its contents on which it unsurprisingly fails to deliver. In summary: a model whose dynamical laws account for a change in state from relativistic quantum fields (or more fundamental precursors derived through quantum gravity) not arranged in accordance with our understanding of matter, to relativistic quantum fields arranged in accordance with our understanding of matter - or significantly more speculatively from something that isn't space to something that is - falls short of qualifying the book's tagline and marketing hyperbole. Despite Krauss' protestations to the contrary, his version of 'something from nothing', just isn't. Fundamentally, absolutely, and unequivocally, his theoretical prestidigitation constitutes merely a state change, a reconfiguration, albeit an especially interesting, counter-intuitive one, between states which once would have been regarded as ontologically incompatible before we knew our Universe better. That in his eagerness for his book to be the last word on cosmological creation he has exaggerated its metaphysical reach, diminishes what would otherwise have been a revelatory crescendo to the story of physics so far.Here is an example of Krauss-style philosophising in action:""[...]if potential to exist were the same as existence, then I am certain that by now masturbation would be as hot button a legal issue as abortion now is.""Aside from the terminological ambiguity underpinning the assertion, it is curious that a physicist did not immediately catch the obvious natural analogy: the ontological equivalence, in mathematical terms, of potential versus kinetic energy, as we've learned from Einstein.It's not all this bad. He makes some decent enough criticisms of naive theological convictions, but such worldviews are rather an easy target and we've heard their refutations many times before.Eventually I suspect the interest in this book from physics-curious laypeople will be irreversibly outweighed by interest from academic historians studying the anti-theist vs theist social paradigm of the early 21st Century. Because the historical overview is so well communicated, engrossing and accessible, the book deserves at least three stars. Consider the missing two a caveat to the above criticisms."

""Empty space"" is teeming with phenomena and is very far from nothing.

Because the universe is expanding, we will lose the ability to make measurements because everything outside of our solar system will have moved away from us and the distance will be insurmountable.

Nothingness is discussed at length, and how something came from it. Einstein's contributions to the field are covered, so are thinkers such as Planck, Feynman and Hawkins.

275,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26751963-abhilesh-dhawanjewar,3,"Why is there 'something' instead of 'nothing'? As humanity inches ever closer to unravelling the hidden secrets of the universe it inhabits, the fundamental laws of physics as we understand them now reveal a universe that is astonishingly calculated and bewilderingly fragile. For if the values of the âcosmological constantsâ were off just by a wee bit, the universe as we know it, could not have possibly existed. This leads us to the question of why should there be something when nothingness is infinitely more probable, a question that has been asked since the time of Aristotle and Socrates but one thatâs become more pertinent in the age of quantum physics.  Dr. Lawrence Krauss, a theoretical physicist and cosmologist at Arizona State University is one of the key players in the ultimate quest to understand how our universe functions. In the current offering Dr. Krauss presents and defends the thesis that âsomethingâ can indeed arise from ânothingâ and that this impossible-seeming scenario is a direct consequence of the quantum weirdness of the universe we are a part of. He starts slow with a short and simple historical narrative of the established bits of modern cosmology such as the Hubble expansion and the cosmic microwave background, then quickly switches gears to talk about the most fascinating discoveries of recent times; things such as dark matter, dark energy and the quantum properties of vaccuum. Kraussâ narrative genius shines through in this part of the book where he intelligibly describes the most plausible picture of the universe presenting solid evidence behind every aspect of this theory. He pauses sufficiently, reiterates the most important concepts and points out the potential problems/inconsistencies with each concept he describes. At the end of this part, you will be convinced that we live in a flat and accelerating universe that started as a tiny speck expanding 24 orders of magnitude in merely microseconds of its existence.  Here is where things start to take a turn, Krauss suddenly dons a profound and somewhat melancholic tone and speculates whether scientists living in a different time and era could ever possibly reach the same conclusions about the origins and fate of the universe as us. All of science and all of our understanding of the universe is limited by physical evidence and the evolution of the universe itself might erase some of this evidence leaving no avenues to find out what exactly happened. According to Krauss, we live in a special time and space, one that enables us to make the precise inferences about the origins and the fate of the universe; inferences that simply would not be possible given the physical evidence that will be available to the scientists of the distant past and future. With this argument, Krauss then introduces the âAnthropic principleâ: a logical yet dull explanation for why things in the universe are the way they are. Simply put, the âanthropic principleâ states that had the universe been any different, we would not have been here to ponder this very question. Following this is a long and tiring tirade about atheism: an extrapolation about how the flatness of the universe is a proof of the non-existence of God. Being an ardent believer of science, I personally find arguments for atheism tiresome but I guess a thorough discussion is essential in todayâs science-doubting world. Overall it is a very fun and accessible read about the origins of the universe with enough intellectual fodder for the philosophically-inclined. Just skip the final few chapters."
276,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2432326-nick-stengel,3,"I think Krauss' editors bit off more than they could chew in picking this title. All of it is good, and some incredibly difficult physics is well explained. However, the whole book suffers from a classic physics problem, the lamplight. A man loses his wallet in an alley, and starts to look for it on an adjacent street under a street lamp. When asked why, he answers, ""the alley is too dark to see anything."" Why is there something rather than nothing is not answered. What is addressed is instead what is under the lamp on an adjacent street."
277,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25759537-vijay-ravisankar,5,"The best book I have read till date. Although I am not a physicist or probably not anywhere close to it, I was able to grasp most of the topics in the book, probably a little bit due to my scientific background in school. The best part of the book would have to be the illustrations that are in between certain paragraphs which help understand certain topics so clearly. I would definitely suggest this book to anyone who is interested in knowing how universe could have originated from big bang. Solid 10/10 book."
278,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36558414-luke-woolley,3,"While the concepts are stirring, I felt mostly left in the dust. Complex physics that are not clearly described with appropriate analogies made me zone out frequently and wish for a more approachable method of presentation. In its current form ""A Universe From Nothing"" was difficult to follow and seemed hardly to attempt an answer to the central premise.If you're like meânot dumb but also not a physicistâyou may find yourself somewhat bored at times. I feel this book was largely written for other physicists or students in that field."
279,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24827518-steven,2,"The text is 180 pages, normally considered a short book. This text required my close, consistent attention in order to get much (anything) from it. Not that I am normally an inattentive reader. It is just that this subject matter is very unfamiliar to me.I have had the book for a while and canât remember what prompted me to buy it. It became a grind to read, my interest level not matching the effort I found the book to require. Not without some amount of interest to me though, thus the 2 star rating."
280,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/272480-sina-jahandari,2,"Krauss is like give me one free miracle and I will explain the rest. And the free miracle is the appearance of all the matter and energy in the universe and all the laws that govern it, from nothing in a single instant. He tries to circumvent this miracle by trying to justify it but I think he fails. Although there are insights to be found in the book, I did not like it. Many parts are ambiguous and poorly explained. There are far better books on the topic.Moreover, Krauss's hopeless attempts to imply that he has contributed to Physics or science, in general, was pathetic."
281,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93193751-levi-williams,2,"This book does not justify a reason as to why the universe can exist from nothing, but rather it redefines ""nothing"" as the potential of everything according to quantum theory. There is no deep insight- just basic quantum mechanics. Nothing cannot produce something, but unstable quantum fluxuations can produce spacetime and matter. String theory and ""bubble universes"" is a dying theory that is becoming harder and harder to justify. Loop quantum gravity is the future. Never start with space or time, rather start with particular information."
282,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45132653-allister-graham,3,"Firstly, I must say that the title of this book is a little misleading, with which I was disappointed. Krauss pretty much redefines the word 'nothing' to mean SOMETHING: virtual particles which pop in and out of existence.Some of the ideas in the book were quite interesting, so it has some redeeming qualities. I liked how Krauss is talented at explaining complex concepts in easily graspable language. Overall however, I don't like the trickery Krauss employs with the title 'A Universe From Nothing'."
283,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16536500-dave,3,"I canât say it any better than Mr. Dawkins:  âEven the last remaining trump card of the theologian, âWhy is there something rather than nothing?â shrivels up before your eyes as you read these pages. If âOn the Origin of Speciesâ was biologyâs deadliest blow to supernaturalism, we may come to see 'A Universe from Nothing' as the equivalent from cosmology. The title means exactly what it says. And what it says is devastating.â  - Richard DawkinsIt is a challenging read if, like me, you are weak in math and physics skills."
284,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90320864-robert-fillpot,0,"This was a great book. It's so exciting that we are living in a time when we are discovering so many fascinating things. Even how the universe began! I'm so excited to live in a time when we may find some more answers from the James Web telescope. If they would ever launch the damn thing! Lawrence Krauss is another great thinker of our time, and like the other great thinkers, what he doesn't yet know, only excites and inspires him. As it should in all of us. It doesn't cause him to turn to thoughts of magic. "
285,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20899244-chris-kirkby,4,"A fascinating dive into our current understanding of the universe, and how it could possibly have begun for nothing at all.Krauss makes an excellent attempt to explain some very complex ideas in a way that a non-scientist such as myself can understand, but even still there were parts that were hard to follow. Iâm also aware of how quickly our knowledge of the universe is evolving, so some of the ideas presented here may have been confirmed or refuted in the years since this was written (2012). "
286,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51484727-chris,4,"So while I could just barely grasp the scientific posits Krauss shared, I am thinking others may not expect a heavy side of science when looking for an atheist read. Krauss actually does a very good job sharing these scientific discoveries and theories in a way pretty easily understood by the lay reader. From focusing on Einstein's Theory of Relativity, to some of his own discoveries, it was an enjoyable read. While this probably gives me no new ammo for my arguments with Christians, most would be well over their heads, it did do much to further entrench my beliefs."
287,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49671121-sebastian,4,"I love to read this kind of book. The last books of this sort were from Feynman and Hawking, quite some time ago. So it is very refreshing that even with the fundamental questions we are making progress. Or did you know, we measured the shape, aka curvature of our space? I didn't before. The only problem I see is, that I have to attend a day job and cannot go down just another rabbit hole. Too many worthwhile things to do in such a small amount of time...But nothing to despair about, just let us go on, wherever this will take us!"
288,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79869984-ray,5,"I think Krauss does a great job of ""dumbing down"" this subject material for the lay reader. I do think that it requires some level of scientific understanding and probably would be difficult to understand for someone without any scientific literacy but he does a great job of keeping it simple. The subject material is fascinating and he takes a few jabs at theology and anti-science fanatics but I think they are fair and entertaining, though maybe not necessary in a book like this. I highly recommend for anyone interested in cosmology."
289,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49133185-rocky-schulz,4,"This book has so many concepts that are so complex, it's hard to understand it completely, but it really gives a perspective of how enormous this universe truly. What our limited senses consider nothing may just be another dimension. This universe us full of mystery and Lawrence Krause shows how beautiful and intricate the universe(s) is.http://www.10secondbooks.com/2017/02/..."
290,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2701976-dennis-gerwing,4,Fascinating. I think that I understood the author's main points and conclusions but admit that I was unable to follow all of the arguments and proofs that lead up to the conclusions. Recommend that you watch some of the author's lectures and debates which are readily available on YouTube ... which serve as an excellent introduction to the book ... and will also inform you as to whether or not you want to read the book.
291,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50516507-rodrigo-castilho,5,"A great read, but the title can be somewhat misleading to mere science enthusiasts although still laymen such as myself. It never approaches the literal nothing one might be thinking of when purchasing this book.However, again, it's a great read - and although Mr. Krauss's pocket table might be a little complicated to wrap your head around, it should be a must for anyone who wants to better understand the place we currently exist in."
292,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47111898-daniela-d,5,"Amasing book. A very good introduction to the space works, however still overwhelming for me and I had a quantum chemistry class in college. There are of course opinions and facts, and was glad to know that most of Krauss's book is factual and he talks about research that has been done in the field. Also some opinions about the how and why of the universe which are of course up to the reader to interpret. Would recommend this book for anyone, and for myself definitely reading it again."
293,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24847694-timo,1,"Equivocation defined...At the end of the book he declared the question meaningless. He simply avoided the real question. He used it as a trick to keep the reader reading (and to sell a book, apparently). But in the end, Krauss DID create something out of nothing. He created this book....and for the love of Godâ¦can we stop framing these debates against the idea of God? It's punching down. Let's move on to deeper framing."
294,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25098491-kevin-mccormack,4,"the science is fascinating, but throughout the book the author is compelled to say how Religion is foolish, vapid, etc. There are several mocking references to angels dancing on the head of a pin. Ok I get it, but those who believe that the world was created in 6 days are probably NOT reading the book anyway. I don't fully understand the science, but I was annoyed at the straw theologian that the author felt needed to be leveled repeatedly. "
295,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67381803-lord-zion,3,"I am not a science guy and my knowledge of quantum physics begins and ends at the spelling of it. I had hoped that this book might be slightly more accessible than it was, moreso once I had read it as some of the ideas and theories are compelling and I would have liked to have wrapped my head around the subject a bit more.It is worth a read, if only to get your own grey matter whirring, but it's not a light read. One tip: read it just prior to sleep for rather bizarre dreams!"
296,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4949864-christian,4,"This was a very challenging book to read that presupposes the reader has a background in physics and math. I only have high school physics and whatever random bits I have since accumulated. The book posits that âWhy?â Should really be âHow?â and that ânothingâ is not really nothing as we know it and that there canât help but be something from nothing when quantum mechanics rules are applied. Also, our sense of time is limiting. "
297,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22913220-toni,3,Good info much of went over my head for one sitting and I'll definitely have to research much of what he said as there are not many references or citations. A good book to put in the toolbox for future reading. I believe some of the information needs to be updated from 2010. The narration was dry and I found my mind wandering but mostly due to the material. I couldn't help but jump from the thought to thought and think of other data and/or information.
298,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16487328-bim-santos,3,"Despite the modest page count this book has a sweeping and majestic canvass that boldy aims to cover the universe, from its perceived genesis toward its perceived end, including all the theories that try to underpin this ambitious narrative. Unfortunately, there were many times I was bogged down by fascinating but high-minded scientific muddle that on hindsight could have been better told and better explained to readers outside the scientific community"
299,145162445X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71151981-artiom,5,"Mind blown. We're all fucked. In a few trillion years from now. This book is nice to listen as audio since there are any complex mathematical formulae, or to be honest any other than E = mcÂ². Due to my lack of knowledge I got lost somewhere in the middle of the book where concepts got more complicated, however I am still extremely grateful for the very simple explanations of complex cosmology problems."
