Which turns out to be a good thing, considering the God most Americans believe in is a crazy, vengeful, ego-maniacal monster. Dawkins’ insights are so cunning and profound you can’t help feeling embarrassed for the believer.Some of the main arguments:Believer #1: The diversity of life is too complex to be random, so it must have been designed by someone even more complex.Dawkins: If the designer is so complex, then it must’ve been created by someone even more complex. And on and on like that. In philosophical terms it’s an infinite regress. In simpler terms it’s: “So who made God?“ The only plausible explanation for the complexity of life on Earth is natural selection.Believer #2: The chances of having all the right conditions to develop life are so miniscule, it had to be done on purpose.Dawkins: It’s true the odds are probably about a billion to one. But there are potentially a billion billion planets in the universe. I’m not very good at math, but that definitely improves the likelihood. And we know it happened here, so it could definitely happen again.Believer #3: Without God to teach us, we wouldn’t know good from evil.Dawkins: People all over the world make the same moral decisions in thought experiments, regardless of vast religious differences. We do not need God to teach us good and evil. Not only that, no person in modern times can seriously claim they are basing their behavior on Biblical guidelines. We’re talking about people who were ready to kill their own kids, or at least offer up their virgin daughter to be gang raped. In the example of Lot, God only spares Lot and his daughters, because they are the most righteous people in town. Then the two daughters proceed to get him liquored up and seduce him. Which begs the question, wouldn’t God have seen that coming?QUOTES TO LIVE BY“I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.” Mark Twain“Let children learn about different faiths, let them notice their incompatibility, and let them draw their own conclusions about the consequences of that incompatibility. As for whether they are ‘valid,’ let them make up their own minds when they are old enough to do so.” R. Dawkins“But how has it happened that millions of fables, tales, legends have been blended with both Jewish and Christian revelation that have made them the most bloody religion that ever existed?” John Adams“What is there to respect in any of this, or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around the world in religion’s dreaded name? How well, with what fatal results, religion erects totems, and how willing we are to kill for them! And when we’ve done it often enough, the deadening of affect that results makes it easier to do again.So India’s problem turns out to be the world’s problem. What happened in India has happened in God’s name.The problem’s name is God.” Salman Rushdie, ‘Religions, as ever, is the poison in India’s blood’“That it will never come again is what makes life so sweet.” Emily Dickinson“There is something infantile in the presumption that somebody else has a responsibility to give your life meaning and point… The truly adult view, by contrast, is that our life is as meaningful, as full and as wonderful as we choose to make it.” R. Dawkins"
1,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/588238-aeisele,1,"This is perhaps the worst polemic against religion I have ever read. Really, if Dawkins actually knew anything about religion, he wouldn't have written the book. Instead, he knows nothing about the subject, and so if you know nothing about something, you don't even KNOW when you say stupid things. For instance, Dawkins brings up John Hartung's article about ""love thy neighbor""(Hartung is not, in case you were wondering, a biblical scholar. He's a Professor of Anesthesiology). The argument is that both the Old Testament's (or Torah) and the New Testament's idea of ""neighbor"" is an in-group conception - in other words, other Jews. Now, let's not get into the issue that Dawkins and Hartung seem to be more fundamentalist about the bible than most Christians (I mean, Hartung says that ""Moses"" wrote the law - guess what? Most Christian scholars don't think this!). Hartung points out many verses that seem to argue this. Yet in bringing up Leviticus 19:18 (love your neighbor as yourself), and then arguing this means only other ""Jews"" (even though there was no such thing as ""Judaism"" when this book was written), he seems to forget Leviticus 19:32-33. There, aliens are to be considered as ""citizens"", or ""natives."" In addition, please tell me what example Jesus uses to illustrate what ""neighbor"" means? The good Samaritan! (who were of course considered inferior by the Jews).  This is just a smattering of his ignorance. Would you think that Dawkins MIGHT have consulted someone scholar in religious studies for this work? Ehrman is about the only one. He quotes Douglas Adams more than any specialists in the field. There are other annoying things about the book. Like the fact that he basically treats the most violent and fanatical of the religious as the standard. Of course, does he treat Nazi Eugenics as ""standard"" science? Of course not (and for anyone who thinks ""science"" is self-correcting - well, that's just naive).  Another thing: he gives T.H. Huxley a free pass on his eugenic racism (his statements that blacks in the south might not be evolved enough to have democratic rights- which by the way, he made at the same time Christian abolishionists were establishing universities and cities in the mid-west that were race-inclusive), because it was a part of the ""Zeitgeist"", yet using the violence of the Old Testament against religion.  Another thing (are you sick of this yet?): in arguing that there most likely was no religious conviction in anyone who did anything good he said that Martin Luther King Jr. basically just got his ideas from Ghandi, who of course everyone knows wasn't ""really"" religious. Well, if you read Dr. King, and believe him (which Dawkins, by the way, doesn't like doing - he'd rather foist his own ""intelligent"" interpretation of what they were doing on them), King actually got much of his social justice vision from the theologian Walter Rauschenbauch. He got his notion of non-violent resistance from Ghandi, which is much different. Anyway, if anyone out there is really looking for atheistic resources, do NOT read Dawkins. He'll just make you look like a fool in any educated person's view. Instead, read an intelligent atheist, who understands religion, like Nietzsche. Start with Beyond Good and Evil, go to the Genealogy of Morals, and then finish with Twilight of the Idols and the Antichrist. They will give you a better perspective. "
2,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/191578-xysea,2,"I am not an atheist, but neither am I a 'true believer'. I border more on 'agnostic', that is to say I believe there is some force beyond this Earth and that I don't know what it is, but I don't subscribe to any particular set of beliefs, per se.Until I come across books like this one. Then, I get an irrational urge to defend spiritual beliefs (but not religion, and that's another discussion).What I mean is, I am generally docile and private about my spirituality and my beliefs until someone goes out of their way to make inflammatory comments designed to browbeat me into supporting a point of view. That is true for prosthelytizing believers of any religion, as well.(No one ever persuaded me to become a Christian by telling me I was going to Hell if I didn't.)But Dawkins manages the atheists' equivalent, and its my main quibble with atheists and their arguments. It's all condescension and ridicule, moral superiority and incredulity. Followers of Dawkins' mantra are the evangelicals they despise without the religion. Its quite entertaining to watch a conversation between these two groups devolve, but very rarely is any substantive progress made in making one group better understand the other. And I believe we will need that reconciliation, as a society, sooner than later.Which is what annoys me about this book. It's well written, and somewhat well-argued (though Dawkins does engage in some sophistry, but not as bad as Sam Harris did in his book), but the tone of it is all wrong. He clearly isn't trying too hard to engage the people he should be, in favor of those who already believe or are sympathetic to his views. Because of that, I consider this book largely a masturbatory enterprise and not something that seeks to seriously put forth real arguments, or to promote understanding. It merely serves as a platform for Dawkins to illustrate his views. "
3,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"[Original review, Jan 19 2016]I must admit that I was somewhat taken aback when Donald Trump suggested the US should deny entry to Muslims and require them all to carry ID cards. But having had time to get over the initial shock and consider it on its merits, the idea has definitely started to look more attractive. The only problem is that Trump doesn't go far enough.Come on, we need to be realistic here: half-measures won't help. We simply have to face up to the fact that monotheists are extremely dangerous. From the thousand Philistines that Sampson slew with the jawbone of an ass (Judges 15, 14-16), through the Conquistadores and the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre to the Thirty Years War, monotheists have shown time and time again that they are ruthless terrorists who will stop at nothing to spread their sick, perverted ideology. And it's hardly surprising. What do you expect of a religion originally founded by a man who was on the point of killing his only son because the voices in his head told him to do it, and whose most important principle is to deny the validity, or even the right to existence, of all other faiths?Don't get me wrong. I'm saying all this in a spirit of tolerance - some of my best friends are monotheists! - but we need a complete ban on them entering the United States, or indeed any other Western country, until we figure out what the hell is going on. Nothing else will do. Vote Trump!______________________[Update, May 18 2018]I hate to say I told you so, but Dimitrios Pagourtzis, the 17 year old psycho who today killed ten people in Santa Fe, also turns out to be a monotheist. He shamelessly flaunted his fanatical monotheistic beliefs to the extent of being a member of a dance squad with a local Greek Orthodox monotheist church.Under Obama, people would just have been wringing their hands and asking for tougher gun-control laws. But I think President Trump will actually do something. These monotheists must be stopped."
4,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84023-j-g-keely,3,"Athiests have been ranked as one of the least trusted groups, and the oft-repeated notion that atheism is the same as amorality is always saddening. A common argument I've encountered is 'if you don't believe in god, then what's to stop you stealing, raping, and killing as often as you like?"" And of course, I do steal, rape, and kill as often as I like to--which is not at all.However, if you turn the question around, it has very unflattering implications for the believer who asked it: 'Are you saying the only thing preventing you from violating and killing strangers is your belief in god? That most of the time, you're sitting there fantasizing about murder, and the only thing stopping you is fear of divine punishment?'Of course, that isn't how morality works. It's not that most of us are sitting there wishing we could do these awful things, and being held back by fear of punishment. No, for the most part we don't like to see other people hurt. Even soldiers and doctors, trained to deal with death, still experience psychological trauma when confronted with its reality. We don't want to live dangerous, criminal lives, fearing constant reprisal. We want to live normal, pleasant lives of friendship and respect.For all his flaws, Dawkins helped me to realize that there is something to be achieved by identifying as an atheist. Not merely because it represents my position on any theology, but because people won't come to trust or understand atheists unless they are willing to speak openly.It shouldn't be a dirty word in America, a country founded on dissent. Our legal documents outline a system that holds personal beliefs and opinions to be of concern only to the person holding them, yet particular kinds of belief still carry political clout and others, social stigma. This Scientific American article looks at various studies analyzing how Americans think of atheists, at one point showing that the average person trusts an atheist about as much as they do a criminal. Some might suggest that it's a choice, no one is born an atheist, any more than they are born a criminal (though arguments could be made there, too), but how much of a choice is it, really? We each look at the world and try to determine what we think of it, and while some people make these decisions blithely, I don't feel like I have ever had much choice in my views. If I looked at a red shoe, I couldn't simply believe that it was blue, I have to base my conclusions on what I see. I won't pull out the old 'I was raised in such a way, and came to atheism in such a way' story, because it's hackneyed, and it isn't really useful here. Suffice it to say that, as a child, I assumed a lot of mythical things were real, because people talked about them all the time--gods and angels and hell and ghosts and Santa and all those familiar cultural symbols appeared everywhere around me, even in cartoons. Eventually, as I learned more, none of it made any sense, nor did it answer any questions, so I stopped thinking any of it was real. Is that really a choice?Should I take Pascal's Wager literally, and choose to believe in god merely because if I do, and I'm right, I go to heaven, but if I don't and I'm wrong, I go to hell? Pascal didn't mean it seriously in the first place, but I'd be fucked for Buddhism, Hinduism, Catholicism, Islam, Judaism, Anglicism, Orthodox, Shinto, the Norse Gods, Zoroastrianism, Mormonism, and Scientology.There's also the fact that 'deciding' to believe in god, but not actually believing in your heart suggests that we can somehow 'fool' god, getting in on a technicality. None of this indicates that we have any real choice in the matter. It isn't like voting for a politician or picking a favorite band.If there was a god who wanted us to believe in him, then he probably wouldn't have created a world where his existence was merely one of numerous equally-appealing options, which are all surmounted by the final option that none of them exist. But to suggest this, to most people, is apparently tantamount to admitting that I molest children, employ and murder prostitutes (which is worse?), steal, lie, cheat, donate to the nazi war criminal retirement fund, and hate America.And it's this view of atheists as amoral that convinced me to openly identify as an atheist, instead of mere agnosticism. Like women, blacks, and gays, the first step in gaining respect is admitting what you are, and insisting that you are still a human being. Eventually, simply identifying with a movement is pointless, and even unproductive, since it strengthens the very separatist ideology that must be torn down for the sake of moving past the original conflict--but it's an important step in the beginning.Agnosticism simply isn't a strong enough stance, since I disbelieve in god in the same way that I disbelieve in a machine gun bunker under my bed. I'm not going to live my life as if my bed will kill me, or as if working on Sunday will cause me to end up in a trash dump in a suburb of Jerusalem.I agree with Dawkins' conclusions, yet I don't find him convincing. His books have threads of argument, but I rarely feel that the metaphors and examples he uses are ultimately useful. He never goes quite far enough, and so I think he falls short of his stated goal of a reader starting this book as a believer, and finishing it as an atheist. It feels more like a book to help confirm atheists. If you're already familiar with these arguments and their implications, then the book will make sense to you--if you aren't, then it's going to feel a bit incomplete.For example, at one point he talks about the idea of the 'sacred', that there are some things in religion which are not allowed to be discussed, and asks why this should be the case. We are scrupulous about discussing every detail of the rest of our lives, so why does this specific subset get its own special rules?Unfortunately, Dawkins doesn't provide us with the obvious answer: that every controlling political structure has set certain topics as 'off limits' in order to protect its power. As Orwell explores in 1984, controlling language, controlling what people are allowed to talk about is the hallmark of any tyranny. And lest we forget, various churches have exerted this kind of political power throughout history, and some continue to hold that power today. So, it would be in their best interest to forbid discussion of dangerous ideas that might threaten their power.Yet Dawkins is certainly familiar with cultural Darwinism, with the way that ideas grow and change within a culture, the importance of 'infectious ideas' that take advantage of the natural fears, hopes, and habits of human beings--this should be all too obvious to the man who coined the word 'meme'. And yet, he isn't working here to make obvious and deconstruct these infectious ideas, to reveal their origins and purpose, and to show why we might hold such beliefs.But if his arguments are fundamentally dismissive and incomplete, it seems obvious to me why this would be, looking at the trajectory of his career: Dawkins has put himself in the unenviable position of being a public philosopher. He is a man of ideas which he constantly presents and defends against people who are uninformed, emotionally unstable, and self-assured. Something I've learned here on Goodreads is the more often people miss your point, responding only with the same tired antagonism, the more flippant and distant you can become.You start off reasonable and patient, which is time-consuming, draining, and rarely achieves anything. Watching Dawkins give one of his many lectures to believers is painful, because during the questions afterward, it becomes clear that almost no one there had sufficient knowledge of either rhetoric or theology to understand his points.It's like watching a mathematician explain his solution for the Reimann Hypothesis and then, in the audience, a man stands up and says ""I don't know what 'zeta-function' means, but you're wrong"". Few seem to recognize the thought and study that goes into disbelief, since belief can be achieved quite easily by telling children that if they don't follow the sky man's book, they will be set on fire forever.But your average believer is a different from a biblical scholar, who has some understanding what he means by his belief, and who tends to reject the bible as 'word of god' simply because he knows that there is no single bible to believe in--there are a hundred different versions, each full of extraneous parts, errors, conflicts, and revisions.A discussion with a well-informed atheist (there are, of course, many who are fundamentally ignorant) is similar to a discussion with a biblical scholar: both have an understanding of what they are discussing. One can see Dawkins engage in these discussions in various documentaries, and he comes off as much less of a stuck-up prick.But by taking his ideas public, he encounters angry conflict with a mass of uninformed, self-righteous people, both believers and atheists, and he is invariably dragged down, slight for slight condescension for condescension. More's the pity, he has an excellent background and a respectable mind, but fighting with the mob never elevates an intellectual argument.In the end, his responses should not be tailored to the ignoramus who asked a question he already answered. A big part of the reason I stopped studying atheism was that I realized all I was doing was training myself to argue with people who had very strong feelings about an issue they didn't understand. Instead, we should write for posterity, for the larger cause of human knowledge. A lesson we all could learn, in an age when our words and actions may often be recorded and remembered. Perhaps it will lend me patience when I must answer the same question I have already answered a hundred times in the same thread, from someone who is responding not because they feel intrigued, but because they feel threatened. Even if, in the end, there can be no coming together in understanding, merely fight and flight, at least I can do right by me, and put forth my best and most patient face. As far as turning believers into atheists, I'd send them to Bart Ehrman before Dawkins."
5,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"The God Delusion - Why there almost certainly is no God?I have been a big fan of Dawkins from the time I read The Selfish Gene. This book does nothing to damage that, even though it is not as logically cohesive as The Selfish Gene. The God Delusion is easier to argue with and maybe even win, if only in my mind. Dawkins argues mostly against the Christian God that created earth and knows nothing of the vast universe beyond. He remains silent about the God hypothesis that can arise from new physics and eastern cosmogonies. I feel that while The Selfish Gene was a standalone book intended to convey a brilliant concept in a very articulate fashion to the general reader, The God Delusion is a more of a glorified pamphlet meant to be a handbook of reference for any atheist for the range of illogical, childish or even intelligent arguments that might be addressed to him. An atheist who reads and remembers a fair bit of The God Delusion will always be well equipped to blunt any argument against his position.But this huge strength of the book is also its major flaw that demotes it much below the Selfish gene in my opinion. The Selfish gene is a must-read book that I would thrust in the hand of anyone I like - because I want them to learn from it, raise their consciousness or because I want to have a wonderful discussion with them. In contrast, the God Delusion is a book I would thrust in exasperation at someone with whom I am tired of arguing and would rather prefer them to go through Dawkins' exhaustive repudiation of most arguments. That is the difference. The book would be useful if I want to convince someone or If I wanted to win an argument. But what if neither was ever my objective? It gives me no intrinsic value that is not situational. But then, perhaps I was never one of the intended audience of the book; the purpose of this book, is not to explain science. It is rather, as he tells us, “to raise consciousness"".He also spends a lot of time debunking obvious fallacies and beliefs purely because they are prevalent. It might be important to show how silly they are, but I frankly was impatient to get on with it and not spend time on such obvious facts. Most of the arguments in the book are ones that I could have come up with too if I had sat down and though about it. True, Dawkins has made my job easier, but what if I am comfortable with not having the God Delusion and with the fact that a lot of people have? What if the formula of zeitgeist that Dawkins proposes about what is moral is applicable to religions too? After all, the religion of today is far from what it was in the 1900s. maybe religion too will evolve and become more and more liberal. The only genuinely useful sections in the book for me were the intriguing discussion on morals and that wonderful last chapter on model building. If only the rest of the book was as memorable.I have a few other peeves with the book too - It condemns anyone who understand religion and science and takes the informed decision to be an agnostic. This condemnation by Dawkins of agnostics is perhaps my single biggest point of difference with Dawkins.I have no problems with the debunking of the God Hypothesis as Dawkins defines 'God'. But, his atheism goes into exactly those realms which he accuses religious fundamentalists to be going in. He gives an example of a Priest who says that even though he has moments of reservation about the existence of a God, he keeps such doubts to himself and extols God's virtues purely so that the common man is not mislead into doubt. Dawkins condemns this as intellectual and moral cowardice.Then later, in a section titled 'Why there almost certainly is no God', he freely acknowledges that ""most probably"" God does not exist and then classifies himself as an agnostic leaning heavily towards atheism. Then he says that such agnostics should refrain from calling themselves agnostics as it will cause damage to the common people who want to support atheism. Is this not the same intellectual and moral cowardice? If you cannot in your own logic call yourself a full blown atheist, do not do that just to prove a point or to support a pet theory. If there 'almost certainly' is no god, then it is 'almost certainly' a 'delusion' to say that pure atheism is fully reasonable too.Dawkins makes an appeal to closely define the meaning of the word ""God"". But then, not matter how you define it, as long as the basis is in irrationality, the same principle is being attacked. And hence to say I believe in Science as the ultimate answer when it has so far been unsuccessful in furnishing one is just to substitute the term ""Science"" for ""God"".Of course I understand the value of people like Dawkins being there to be the vanguard for this change. And there is a real need for a spokesperson for the atheists when the other party has so many very vocal ones. But that does not mean that he should call for educated agnostics to brand themselves as atheists just to add religious fervor to the brand. All that is still no reason to call for making atheism an organized religion too. agree with all the points and the logical arguments of The God Delusion but I disagree with the spirit of the book which seems to convey that religion is the enemy for us to combat by organizing ourselves. There are too many paradoxes and unknowns in nature which science is more and more throwing up its hands in utter confusion towards. What if the universe truly is 'queerer than we can suppose' as J. B. S. Haldane puts it? Dawkins manages to explain most phenomena with natural selection but dismisses the larger conundrums and paradoxes with the great sweeping idea called the 'Anthropic principle'. The Anthropic principle might be a good tool to stall an argument but is no authentic scientific theory as he pretends it to be. It would be the equivalent of saying that the clock is telling time correctly isn't it, so that explains its form and function and hence it needs no designer. I just paraphrased above the argument Dawkins uses to prove that atheism is absolutely valid. Well, unless we resort to such rhetoric devices, it is not. And in the 'belief spectrum' ranging from radical theism to complete atheism, the only position we can take without resorting to faith is one of doubt - agnosticism.In conclusion, my opinion is that pure atheism is not possible under present scientific knowledge and that is why agnosticism is the only reasonable position to take - without slipping into blind belief in science after climbing out of blind belief in religion."
6,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,5,"THE GOD DELUSION BY RICHARD DAWKINS: Dawkins latest book is as brutal and honest as its title. For those who aren’t looking to have their faith and beliefs gravely challenged, you may want to skip this book. Though Dawkins is looking for everyone to read this book with an open mind, whether you’re devoutly religious, agnostic or atheist. Having an open mind is actually one of the New Ten Commandments Dawkins cites. The book begins in a calm and orderly manner, with an opening chapter on the “god hypothesis,” where Dawkins talks about the idea of a god through history and how we are now in a time where medicine and science have come such a long way from the days of thinking the world is flat, balancing the humors, and believing there was a demon or god causing a every catastrophe. And yet religion – especially Christianity – remains stagnated in the ideas of men from thousands of years ago. As the book progresses, Dawkins seems to grow more impatient with religion and its whole-hearted certainty in a book and a god.He does an impressive job of going from chapter to chapter in defending different stances on science, always providing the evidence – a facet, he says, religion is lacking. One point Dawkins makes that I really found fascinating was his evolutionary reason for the existence of religion, in that it was a component of our very early societies in helping to unite communities and keep them together as a whole. As human beings, we strive for companionship and the evidence speaks for itself when we look back to the time when there was a shift from the nomadic hunting and gathering societies to settling down in groups and communities, which started farming, large scale food production, and ultimately leading to technology, writing, law, art and so on.After this, Dawkins tackles the question of morality and makes it a very big deal that everyone understand we keep this separate from religion and not think them one and the same. The Bible is full of murder, rape, fratricide, torture – for a book on teaching us how to lead supposedly “good” lives, this book has a very strange way of trying to do that, says Dawkins. So he goes back into our ancestry to the days of Cro-Magnon, in the time when all humanity cared about was trying to survive. He posits that this was when we began to develop a sense of morality, because in being good to others, families and groups were formed, which helped improve survival. If we’d stuck to stealing and killing, we wouldn’t have lasted past that first winter.Another big issue with Dawkins is the labeling of children as belonging to the religion of the parents without any consent from them: they’re Protestant children, or Muslim children, or Jewish children; even though in all likelihood they are far too young to comprehend what this applied label means. These children of heavily religious and fundamental families don’t have a choice. One of the most horrific groups I learned about in The God Delusion are the so-called “Hell Houses,” where children – ideally twelve year olds, because this is the perfect age for indoctrination – are taken through a labyrinth of horror revealing the terrible sins of sex before marriage, homosexuality, and abortion, and what happens in hell if one were to commit any of them. A cast of actors rehearse these scenes to create the greatest sense of terror in the children – yes, there’s even a tall and scary looking man playing the part of Satan.If you liked this review, and would like to read more, go to BookBanter."
7,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37861-nick,1,"Ok, we get it. Religion is bad. Christianity is evil, Islam is maniacal, and all other religious zealots are out of their mind. I guess Dawkins is right...public hospitals, orphanages (both Christian inventions in the West), as well as communal values all have destroyed Occidental culture. I wish we still practiced 'exposing' infants (i.e. literally throwing out unwanted babies, as made popular by the ancients). Although there seems to be correlation between violence, homocide, and arrogance with organized religion, is a state without a god any better (say, Maoist China)? I think Dawkins has forgotten the most important axiom of science in his contentious ramblings and methodical deconstruction of ancient texts, history, and religion (of which he is no expert)...that correlation does not mean causation. Dawkins is only emboldening the religion of science at the exprense of the world's major belief systems. I just hope humanity will resist a ""brave new world"" in which organized religion is replaced by other systems that devalue human life in the name of progression and knowledge. Let us take a step back from today's trend of catagorizing individals into bipolar groups (for example, either zealot or atheist) and embrace a both/and critique of religion and its sociological effects."
8,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"I thought the very best point this book made came right at the beginning. Dawkins reports on surveys carried out in the US, where subjects received a description of an otherwise sympathetic political candidate, and were asked whether they would still vote for them if one extra feature were added. Would it still be OK if they were a woman? 90% or so say yes. Black? Yes. (Well, we have hard evidence on that now!) Gay? Most people still say yes. Atheist? Half the population says no! Considering that many of the Founding Fathers had deep reservations about religion, this should sound warning bells. If we going to claim we believe in religious tolerance, surely that should include tolerance for people who don't belong to any religion and think it's all nonsense? Everyone bends over backwards to show understanding towards Christians, Muslims, Jews and what have you. Why not atheists? Dawkins just says what he honestly thinks, and doesn't see why he needs to be ashamed of it. Why should he?I didn't like this book as much as The Selfish Gene and The Ancestor's Tale, but that's more because they are positive books celebrating the amazing beauty of the new universe that science, and in particular evolutionary theory, have opened up to us; this is a negative one, attacking the ugly and constricted world that many self-described ""religious"" people still choose to live in. Sometimes you need to be negative, though, and many deeply respected figures in the history of religion were negative about the prevailing orthodoxy. If Martin Luther had been a nicer guy, he'd probably never have offended so many good Catholics with all those unpleasant theses, and I bet the money-changers weren't particularly thrilled when Jesus threw them out of the Temple. As far as I'm concerned, Dawkins is in pretty good company.*******************************************************There has been so much discussion on this page that I am getting slightly lost. I'd love to think that I'd started it, but of course Dawkins gets all the credit. Still, I would like to expand on my initial review, and clarify my own position.I admire this book, and Dawkins's stand in general, because I think he is being decisive about pointing out a very serious problem in the world today. Religion is in a state of crisis. Once upon a time, its job was both to explain to people how the world is, and also to tell them how to live in it. The first part of that mission has now been taken over by science. Dawkins is a scientist, and if you have scientific training it is impossible to take creationism and similar ideas seriously. It's very tiring even to discuss them. If someone told you the Moon was made of cheese, you wouldn't want to endlessly go back and forth over whether or not you'd thought about the fact that it could be Mozzarella, or possibly Vacherin, and that maybe that would solve the technical problems. The Moon obviously isn't made of any kind of cheese. Similar arguments apply to creationism. Religion has to get its act together and acknowledge that, on this particular ground, it has been supplanted by science. If this were the only problem religion was facing, it wouldn't be so bad. Mainstream religion is, however, also being hijacked by some very unpleasant characters. I've been brought up in the Christian tradition, so it's easiest for me to talk about Christianity. I'm no theologian, but it is impossible for me to believe that most of the things you regularly hear from spokespeople of the Christian Right follow from the teachings of Jesus. For example, I once spent 30 unpleasant minutes leafing though Ann Coulter's Godless at a bookstore. This hysterical, bigoted stream of hatred has nothing to do with Christianity as it was conceived by its founder. Indeed, in most respects it is diametrically opposed to it. The scary thing is that the book was a major bestseller. I don't know Islam at all, but every now and then I chat with a moderate Muslim. It sounds like they are even more concerned with what's being done in the name of Mohammed.So, it would be easy to conclude that religion is obsolete, and we should only rely on the teachings of science. I don't think that's correct. Science is only designed to tell us objective truths about the world; it doesn't have a conceptual apparatus for determining what we ought to do, as opposed to what is. I've been working in science for over 25 years, and most years I write at least a couple of grant proposals. If I were asked to write a grant proposal for a project that would use scientific techniques to compare the value of moral frameworks, I don't see how I could even get started. One of the key questions the funding authorities always ask is what objective metrics you will use. Where would these metrics come from? It's no use waving your hands and saying ""philosophy"". Which philosophy? For example, given that the Nazis were rather fond of him, I'm guessing that most people would prefer not to get Nietzche involved. But what objective reasons do we have for excluding Nietzche, rather than other philosophers? I think most people who've read him would agree that Dawkins is a very moral person, and he isn't averse to moral principles that derive from traditional religion. He doesn't think this conflicts with being an atheist. (As he says, ""Atheists for Jesus!""). My interpretation of all this is that it adds up to arguing for a massive reform in the way mainstream religion is organized; that's why I'm comparing him with other religious reformers like Martin Luther and Jesus. He'd probably find this annoying. But, if I may criticize him for just a moment, what goes around comes around :)"
9,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64078-richard,5,"I'm going to get the criticism out of the way before I move on to why I *love* this book.Richard Dawkins is not an easy read. He never pulls a punch, and if any of the beliefs he is attacking in his book are yours then this is going to get your back up. Not for nothing was he passed over as a witness in the intelligent design trials in America. His appearance on the witness stand would probably have worked for the ID advocates as he pointed at every 'believer' in the room and berated them for their gullibility and simple mindedness. The book tends to read at times like a diatribe which pummels you, and leaves you wanting to put the book down for ten minutes to get your breathe back.However, having said that, I think this book is just fantastic. At times its a comedy masterpiece as he quotes various religious bodies, allowing them to shoot themselves in the foot by highlighting their own inconsistencies or the avoiding of debate. For instance, The Catholic Encyclopedia dismissing Atheism:'Formal dogmatic atheism is self-refuting, and has never /de facto/ won the reasoned assent of any considerable number of men. Nor can polytheism, however easily it may take hold of the popular imagination, ever satisfy the mind of the philosopher'Why not? That isn't reasoning, beyond the simple 'I say it ain't so, so it ain't so'.At other times the book is a very clear explanation of the evolutionary pathway which may have led to humans becoming susceptible to such simple fairy stories.The second half of the book then concentrates on the downsides of religion and argues for all sensible, intelligent non-believers to make their voices heard, to help the scales fall from the eyes of those infected with faith.What I particularly loved about this book is that I have been atheistic for many years (more than half my life, and I'm almost forty now), but this is the first time I've read a really coherent, well argued text on what is wrong with religion (all of them). The scientific approach to ripping down the pillars of faith probably won't achieve all that it should, faith being what it is. But it was an excellent read anyway."
10,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/911195-james,2,"This book was a dramatic disappointment that did not live up to the ""finally someone has proven religion is poppycock"" hype it received. Dawkins fails utterly to tear down any meaningful experience of religion, instead he merely reinforces the petty grudges that some atheists have against religion, grudges that betray one's own lack of spiritual maturity and suggest a deeper ailment at work. It's a shame. I saved up my energy to read the radical atheism espoused in Richard Dawkins' The GOD Delusion. As a man of faith with a passionate interest in science, I understand -- and personally experience -- both sides of the God vs. science debate. Dawkins' book was such a smash hit that I anticipated it would contain some powerful new arguments that would lead me to days or even weeks worth of pondering. Sadly, it did not. The bulk of his attack centers on disproving the arguments that religious apologists have offered to justify God's existence. But those arguments were never very satisfying to believers, much less nonbelievers, so seeing them dismantled triggers a yawn instead of thoughtful introspection.His arguments lack imagination and often fall into cheap mockery rather than intelligent reasoning. (Note: it's amusing to see how a man who triumphs rationality would resort to so many tawdry taunts to make his point. If God can be disproven rationally, why must he fall to such ad hominem rhetorical tactics? Methinks he doth mock too much.)Most disappointing, Dawkins attempts to discredit the subjective experience of God by asserting that there are lots of crazy people out there, and the religious must simply be afflicted with a form of mental illness. He does this in a single paragraph, even tossing in a sentence linking personal religious experience to epilepsy. This is not just lack of imagination, it's intellectual dishonesty. Either he is simply not smart enough to parse the difference between real spiritual experience and mental illness, or, more likely, he has chosen to lump all subjective experience of the divine in with insantiy as a cheap way to escape grappling with the amazing variety of spiritual experience average believers have on a regular basis. Admittedly, there is a third alternative. Maybe religious experience is simply outside of his capability to perceive it. Like a person born without the ability to taste, Dawkins is unable to relate to religious experiences because he can't savor them himself. As a result, he can't understand why so many around him are enraptured by the delights of the present feast because sample as he might, he cannot taste a thing. That's why it's so easy for him to dismiss subjective experience -- because he doesn't have any.The book is worth the read just so you know what all the hubub is about and so you can understand that modern atheism as represented by Dawkins is a bland meal. Perhaps a little ""salt of the earth"" would help?"
11,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/615253-jasper,1,"As an agnostic I can wholeheartedly promise you that this book is so tedious it will reduce you to tears. He debunks God as a concept and in the process completely misses the point of God. He then just carries on repeating himself through chapter after chapter after boring chapter. If there really was a god, he wouldn't allow people like this idiot to write mind numbing drivel and then market it with tacky gimmicks like the ""Come all ye faithless"" Christmas Card I got with mine....I should have smelt a rat there and then."
12,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily,4,"This book is so well known, it seems almost pointless to review it. If you are a believer, you will not like it, though you're probably aware of that. Dawkins' explicit aim is that “religious readers who open it will be atheists when they put it down” and that unbelievers shouldn't be ashamed to say so, to which end he presents a detailed and cross-referenced set of arguments, examples, discussions and thought experiments, touching on science, philosophy, psychology etc. Many of his points are familiar (e.g. where did god come from, how do we explain suffering?), but some are fresh and intriguing. He does have a tendency to repeat himself and be annoyingly strident, but in general he makes a very good case. Dawkins knows the Bible well and relishes exposing its grisly (genocide, gang rape, innocent sacrifices) and contradictory aspects (omniscience and omnipotence are contradictory – how can god have the power to change is his mind?), asking if you pick and choose only the nice bits, who decides which to follow and which to ignore? With a background in evolutionary biology, he is particularly incensed at and fearful of the rise of creationism, under the guise of “intelligent design”, giving considerable time to debunking irreducible complexity, the “god of the gaps” and the idea that evolution is the same as chance.There are two themes he keeps harking back to. One is the injustice of the way we are expected to be tactfully respectful of people's religious beliefs in a way that does not apply to other irrational beliefs, yet it’s the doubters who are expected to provide “proof” (even though it’s impossible to prove a negative), coupled with the injustice of the need to appear religious in some circles, especially US public life (George Bush Sr doesn’t think atheist should be citizens or considered patriots). I’m sure it’s no coincidence that a pertinent Douglas Adams quote is on page 42. The other hobby horse is the wickedness of ""indoctrinating"" children in a religion, which he even likens to actual abuse: ""there is no such thing as a Muslim child"", just as there is no such thing as a Conservative or Republican child. He mentions that only about one in twelve British children break away from the religious beliefs of their parents as evidence of the power of such indoctrination.He is sneakily arrogant at times, quoting big names such as Einstein and where the quote doesn’t appear to say quite what he wants it to, he assumes they expressed themselves badly and actually meant something else (“I simply do not believe that Gould could possibly have meant much of what he wrote”)!Marx was snappier, but Seneca or Gibbon (see comment #14), quoted by Napoleon, had the same idea rather earlier when he said, “Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false and by the ruler as useful”. Overall, Dawkins confirmed and clarified my unbelief, which is what I was wanting. MAIN POINTSBIBLEDawkins knows the Bible well and relishes highlighting the brutality of the Old Testament god, then says that’s too easy a target so he will focus on a more generic god, but still harks back to OT examples at regular intervals.He makes the obvious, but often overlooked point that the Bible was written a very long time ago, but long after the events it describes, in a very different culture and translated through multiple languages. Chinese Whispers. Also, some of the writers probably had motives of which we are unaware but which are pertinent to interpreting what they wrote. On p118 he compares the different nativity accounts to show how contradictory they are both with each other and known historical facts. He also points out that earlier translations, the adjective for Mary meant “unmarried”, rather than “virgin”.If the story of Adam and Eve is symbolic, where does original sin come from? And why was Jesus painfully and humiliatingly killed for a symbolic sin?Some examples of the “immorality” of the Bible:•	Lot offered his daughters to a nasty gang (to be raped) in place of the angels they had wanted.•	Bloodthirsty ethnic cleansing, e.g. Joshua in Jericho.•	Abraham being willing to sacrifice his young son, Isaac.•	God punishing everyone by flood, including babies and animals.•	Leviticus 20 lists numerous sins for which the penalty is death, including cursing your parents, working on the Sabbath and adultery.•	Jesus exhorted people to leave the families (as cults do today).•	What is the moral message of spilling the blood of an innocent (whether an animal or Jesus) to atone for the sins of others?•	Is the inconsistency of anti abortionists supporting the death penalty and gun ownership in a similar vein? Which life is sacred? And why is euthanasia wrong if they’re going to a better place?But if you pick and choose only the nice bits, who decides which to follow and which to ignore? You can’t claim Biblical authority if it’s subjectively selective. Morality comes from elsewhere.We can still enjoy the Bible as literary and cultural heritage in the same way as we enjoy the Greek myths and Chaucer.RELIGIONSIf religion is so good for our moral wellbeing, why is atheist antipathy restricted to words, whereas religions often resort to violence to gain support?It’s often assumed that moving from polytheism to monotheism is some sort of progress – so Ibn Warraq suggested the logical progression is to subtract one more god and end up with atheism!Surely Roman Catholicism is polytheistic? A trinity, Mary in multiple forms (“Our Lady of Fatima” and “Our Lady of Lourdes” etc), saints as demi-gods, ranks of angels etc.Religion is expensive: building shrines, supporting priests and ultimately leading to death in some cases, yet it appears across the globe, so there must be some evolutionary advantage to its existence, even if there is a parasitic aspect. Human survival is complex and our babies are born very immature. They need to believe and obey parents about dangers around, so they’re equally credulous of irrational beliefs. Also, children are inherently dualist (mind and body are separate, so the mind can be a disembodied spirit) and teleological (inferring purpose in everything): both make fertile ground for superstition of all kinds.Religious beliefs are collective memes, that evolve in context with each other, echoing human psychology (dualism and teleology), further tweaked by priests.The “cargo cults” on the Pacific islands (e.g. re John Frum) are similar, but arose independently on different islands. Each rewrote their own history to fit events.Religion does not correlate with “good” morals: the US is more religious than the UK, but has more crime, murder, abortion and divorce – and Republican states are worse than Democrat ones.As Steven Weinberg said “with or without it, you’d have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things it takes religion.”Tamarin paraphrased the story of Joshua’s destruction of Jericho to Jewish children. When it was a Jewish story they fully approved of the genocide; when it involved Chinese names, they didn’t.PRAYERAmbrose Bierce defined “pray” as “to ask that the laws of the universe be annulled on behalf of a single petitioner, confessedly unworthy”.He quotes an experiment where some patients were prayed for and some not and of the former, some were told. The ones who knew they were being prayed for fared slightly worse than the others. The methodology wasn’t rigorous, but if it had shown that prayer worked, few would question it.PROOF AND FAITHPersonal experience is the most convincing proof to those that have it, but the least convincing to anyone else. If lots of people believe something, it’s religion; if one person believes it, it’s madness. So what’s the difference between god, an imaginary friend and MPD?In general, religious belief is correlated with lower education, lower IQ and less interest in science.We look for patterns: in marks on a page, clouds in the sky etc and our brains are especially attuned to see faces. Thus we easily interpret other things as faces, voices and visions and we’re more likely to think a shadow is a burglar than the other way round.Temporal lobe epilepsy, and direct stimulation of the temporal lobes, can induce visions very similar to those described by some religious people.Arthur C Clarke observed that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”, so would aliens be viewed as gods?If we accept arguments from personal incredulity, then we should accept Derren Brown actually has supernatural powers, even though he denies it.George Bernard Shaw said “The fact that a believer is happier than a sceptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunk man is happier than a sober one.” Even if it’s comforting, that doesn’t make it true.Science can be proved or disproved, debated and, if necessary, revised; scientists are prepared to change their minds. Believers are unquestioning and no amount of evidence will change their minds.CREATION AND EVOLUTIONIt doesn’t matter if life is improbable; it only needs to happen once. But in fact, if the odds are 1 billion to 1 against, that still means there should be life on 1 billion planets.The reason the Earth is perfect for us is that we have evolved here, to our environmental niche.Improbability and complexity are not “solved” by intelligent design; evolution is the answer. Evolution does not say that things happen randomly, by chance, but rather, by natural selection.Just because something is so complex it seems improbable doesn’t mean it’s a case of “irreducible complexity”. He answers the oft cited question of “what’s the use of half an eye/wing?” on page 149.Irreducible complexity does exist, but only if there are interim stages that are no longer there, e.g. an arch that will collapse if you remove a single stone.Young Earth creationists believe the universe began after the domestication of the dog! This is a scale error equivalent to saying New York to San Francisco is 7.8 yards.PHILOSOPHY	If complex things can only be explained by the existence of a designer, that designer must the most complex of all, so who designed him?“God of the gaps”: why do people assume god is the answer? Such an approach accepts ignorance, rather than driving scientific progress.Does the fact that suffering (including the holocaust) provides opportunity for bravery, sympathy and generosity make it OK from a loving god?Omniscience and omnipotence are contradictory – how can god have the power to change is his mind?What sort of god values belief (which is outside one’s control) over kindness and good works?Altruism either ensures the continuation of one’s genes (aided by the consequent trust and prestige) or is reciprocal/symbiotic, to a similar end. It was especially important in small kinship groups and is not diminished by our knowledge of that, just as our desire for sex is not diminished by contraception.Hauser’s and Singer’s thought experiments (train tracks) find similar responses from everyone, regardless of their religion or lack of it, so you can be moral without god.If we need the threat of eternal damnation (or promise of heaven) to be good, then we are without morals and only worthy of the fires.Morality shifts externally and religions catch up, so again, morality is not coming from religion. Christians had slaves; liberal Lincoln (who freed the slaves) was nevertheless racist by today’s standards; civilian casualties in Iraq cause outrage, but they’re far fewer than those in WW2. We think of Hitler as worse than Caligula or Genghis Khan, but was he, or is it just that he was more recent and we have film footage?GLOSSARY•	Theist: believes in a supernatural intelligent creator who still supervises and intervenes.•	Deist: believes in a supernatural creator who doesn’t subsequently intervene, so it’s “watered-down theism”.•	Pantheist: a non-supernatural synonym for nature and natural laws, so really just “sexed-up atheism”.•	Temporary Agnosticism in Practice (TAP): i.e. where there is a definite answer, but we don’t have the evidence to settle it. Disbelief in god should fall into this category because it is conceivable that it could be proved and even if not, you can consider probability.•	Permanent Agnosticism on Principle (PAP): only relevant for things that are impossible to prove, such as whether my experience of the colour green is the same as yours.•	Non Overlapping Magisteria (NOMA): saying science and religion are separate is a cop-out, to sideline the creationist/Darwinian divide.•	Teleology: everything has a purpose, including weather, coincidences etc.•	Dualism: mind and body are separate, so the mind can be a disembodied spirit."
13,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"I've had a love / hate relationship with Dawkins over the years. I didn't really like his The Selfish Gene, mostly because I think it tries to explain things on the wrong scale. I quite like his meme metaphor, but think people like Dennett take it too far by forgetting it is a metaphor. The Blind Watchmaker has that long (and dull) bit at the end about computer program insects that is just too painful to read. And then there is the ongoing fight between him and Stephen J Gould. I always loved Gould's writing and (as shallow as this sounds) would have picked him over Dawkins for that alone. But Gould's last book in which he claimed science and religion are complementary was a sad and unforgivable mistake by a truly great man. Dawkins is never likely to make that same mistake.I was brought up an atheist and so am fascinated that people can actually believe in religion. It literally shocks me when people say they believe in God or that they are religious. Not so much if I think the people are basically stupid, but much more so if I think they seem relatively intelligent. For a long time I used to believe that when people said they believed I thought they were being disingenuous. It was only after reading the Bible and talking to 'Christians' that I realised that many people don't believe in religion at all - well, not in Australia at least. People who consider themselves Christian often know virtually nothing of the New Testiment and nothing at all of the Old. People just assume that the Bible is a book of moral instruction. That is what I thought it was going to be when I started reading it. I was shocked to find that it was anything but. Dawkins's book is a good introduction to some of the less well known and much less morally instructional stories in the Bible - and for this alone it serves a worthy purpose.I was talking to a friend yesterday about an article in the paper about global warming and what needs to happen if we are to save the planet. He said, ""Let's just hope the climate sceptics are right, because the US believes Jesus is coming back to fix things up - so they won't do anything about climate change."" This might be overstating the problem, but unfortunately, not overstating it enough. Religion is a danger to our existence we can no longer afford.There is part of me that understands that religion offers lots of comfort to lots of people in the world and I never feel quite right taking that comfort away from people - particularly when I've nothing to offer in return. It feels almost like telling a five year old there is no Santa. But at other times I feel much as Dawkins does - that there is simply too much at stake to leave the fate of the world in the hands of people who believe in sky gods who are coming to fix things. God is Not Great is probably a better book - but since this one explains evolutionary biology too and in terms, surely, even a creationist can understand, I would have to recommend it.The more frightened I become about the future we will be leaving our children, the more opposed to religion I become."

Whew, I feel better. He's just so annoying, even when you agree with him. Grr. Okay, well, so, some time ago I watched Richard's two documentaries ""The Enemies of Reason"" and ""The Root of all Evil"" so I should get round to this book at some point, but really, it's so hard to make any kind of sense of this debate. Right now, I kind of know what the Bible means when it says in PsalmsThe fool hath said in his heart that there is no GodIt's because of the giant ineluctible fact that there IS an IS - that things exist rather than not exist. I am here rather than not here. And so are you! Deny that if you can!That's a rather large elephant in the room of all atheists. Try and shove that one out of the door. Existence rather than non-existence. let, indeed, there be light.The God delusionals will say ah, you see, this guy PB, he's one of us now. (Some of them might then be saying ""But that's not a good thing, though, is it?"").Now, excuse me, i have to take a phone call.Pardon me...Oh, it was a scientist saying that what with the Bean Bag Collider they now have in Switzerland and their up to the minute research into the first part of the first part of the millionth subdivision of the first nanosecond after the Big Bang, they are in the happy position of being able to confirm that within two shakes of a lamb's tail (that's a scientific term) they will KNOW how the whole thing went down. They saw - with their own eyes - the Hugo Boss particle the other day. So now they know.Great.I told her, keep up the good work. I want to know how it happens that we're all here and not not here.But when the scientists do explain how everything began, it's going to be just as mystical for your average punter as Genesis chapter 1 verses 1-18. But Genesis will win out on poetry. And because of Peter Gabriel.So we'll be none the wiser. Except some clever-clogs 15 year old somewhere who reads it all in Nature or New International Geekery and saysoh, is that all it takes to create a universe? And he'll make another one right there in his bathtub.*****THE PREVIOUS RANTHere are a few things I want to know now : - The fundamentalists reject evolution and therefore geology too. How much more do they reject - physics? Chemistry? Botany? Medicine? Or is science perfectly okay until it mentions anything in the Bible? Where is the examination of scientific evidence leading to its rebuttal and rejection by the fundies? You know, like they used to believe the fossils were put there by God to test the faith of Christians... I mean, I guess they must also reject astronomy, with its concepts of light years and galaxies and what-all, because it's obvious that if you have a galaxy that's over 7000 light years away the universe is older than 6000 years. Doh! So that has to go. One of the stupidities of this God debate is that the debaters mostly screech slogans at each other. Sometimes the slogans go on for 300 pages! How can we get past the slogans? - One of RD's arguments in favour of science is its undogmatic provisional quality - it proceeds on the basis of evidence and its theories are promptly tossed into the dustbin if better evidence is discovered. And this is good. But alas it does not therefore follow, as RD thinks it does, that ordinary people can say to themselves well, I'm therefore just going to accept things which can be proved, not blind faith. Does RD think we should all troop off to the laboratories and observe the truth of all scientific discoveries for ourselves? No, surely not. We would not be let in. Therefore we're back to faith. I have faith in the teachers in schools and professors in universities - and you may have faith in priests, imams and rabbis. And furthermore, the religious may well retort rudely to Richard ""Hey, Dawk, why should be believe in any of your shit if as you say your theories may be upturned, reversed and rescinded six months from now when better evidence is discovered under your Grandma's sofa? I mean, maybe GOD is underneath your Grandma's sofa - have you checked lately? Dude, you are asking the absurd."" So how do we get past these inanities? "

It's full of scientific goodness, and refutations of common defenses of religion and attacks upon atheism. Suddenly, I don't feel so alone. It's well known how many horrors are perpetrated in the name of religion, but Dawkins manages to unearth a few more of which I'd never heard. There's also a great chapter on the many hypocrisies of the Bible - and there are plenty more than what I'd even been using in prior arguments with religious friends. "
19,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,1,"When others throw such words as ""god"" or ""spiritual"" or ""soul"" into their conversation I must ask them what they're talking about unless the context is clear. Unchurched, when I was a kid I thought they all meant something, something obscure to me, but still significant. Feeling ignorant and ashamed of this, I generally would let such remarks pass, but they haunted me.The study of Latin in high school was a start in unpacking such nebulous words via etymology. I was lousy at Latin, good at effortlessly retaining word roots. In college this interest expanded into Greek and German. ""Spirit"", I learned, was a wind or breath word which came in its various forms to be associated with life and its principles. That made sense. ""God"" was more obscure, becoming even more nebulous upon my first reading of the bible. There the concept seemed more a whole host of concepts bearing what Wittgenstein called ""a family resemblance"" to one another, concepts ranging from war host(s) to clan leader to monarch within contexts ranging from polytheism and henotheism to monotheism and even to the neo-Platonic theory of forms. ""God"", in its biblical reference at least, was nebulous certainly, but one could discern discreet elements to the cloud of metaphors and concepts.I got a degree in religion in college, went on to four years of seminary, proceeded to degrees in depth psychology and philosophy, read and continued to read quite a lot about religions, theologies and metaphysics. Along the way, on a few occasions, I even encountered a few apparently non-human, but intelligent, entities, some by my own intention via ""consciousness-expanding"" drugs, some quite by surprise--enough, in any case, to appreciate the possible experiential bases for belief in such extraordinary entities.Then, of course, there are dreams. We, all of us, dream and meet in our dreams hosts of apparently non-human, but intelligent entities. We don't, however, generally take our dreams very seriously as witness my treating them in the possessive. We, in our culture, tend to treat dream contents as derivatives of waking life. This has not always been the case, nor is it the case in all cultures. I paid a lot of attention to dreams, keeping daily records of them for at least six years, reading books about dream theory.Dawkins, unfortunately, appears to have done very little study about any of this. He is upset by the religious right and has at least perused the bible. Reading it as a biblical inerrancist might, he is understandably quite upset. In addition to this, he has also paid some attention to some of the histories of doctrinal orthodoxies in the Christian tradition. There, too, he has been upset by both the conceits of medieval metaphysicians and the intrinsic authoritarianism of the whole mindset. I share these concerns, but have the psychologist's concern to understand whence such doctrinaireauthoritarianisms come from, a concern which, for him, seems to start and end with the observation that many people are either thoughtlessly insecure or cravenly prone to prey on the insecurities and ignorance of others. There are plenty of instances of such to be sure, as witness cynical manipulators like his fellow atheist Karl Rove, but there's more to all of this religion business than that and his simplistic and insulting dismissal of the religious is unlikely to give him much of a hearing among the people he wishes to convert.Dawkins is a scientist and modern science has prejudices which, while heuristically productive, are limiting. They include (1) a preference for the quantifiable, (2) a rejection of phenomena which are not etiologically reproducible, and (3) a rejection of models of causality which are not etiological. The domains within which these assumptions are profitably employable are many and broad, but they are not exhaustive and they have very little direct bearing on how we experience our lives day to day. While such methods can be, and are, applied to the phenomenology of religious experience, the experience of, say, parapsychological research seems to indicate that some very real phenomena are not--not now at least--replicable. Perhaps they are just too complex, just as god-concepts which try to represent what amounts to the philosophical interpretation of the world must needs be complex and variable.One of the possible etymologies of ""religion"" pertains to paying due reverence to ancestors and traditions, much as is found in ancient Roman religion and modern Shinto. While many traditions taught in comparative religion courses are atheistic (classical Buddhism for one), ""our"" tradition in the West has been predominately tied to one or more kinds of theism for quite some time. If it is okay to treat such precursors as Copernicus or Galileo or Newton or Darwin as revered contributors to our modern scientific interpretations of the the world, then too it should be appropriate to pay a bit more reverence for and attention to the theologians, their circumstances, their evidences, their methods and their interpretations."
20,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3270188-kat-kennedy,4,"Rather like the meme, which Dawkins so helpfully coined the term for, this book has permeated through many parts of our culture. And Dawkins himself has become synonymous with the Atheist movement. How else does a book garner more than 10 books published simply to refute it. The first half of The God Delusion is a thoughtful, fact based response to religion, one that I thoroughly enjoyed. The second half tended to veer away from science based theory to more personal opinions of Dawkin's and this was a mixed bag for me. The God Delusion is about raising the consciousness of people to the possibilities of atheism and the many follies of religion. Of the attributes of atheism, Dawkins has me hook, line and sinker. Of the follies of religion, I am less convinced. (Not to say that there aren't follies in religion, but I'm less concerned about them than Dawkins is.)I was, for a long time, both a fundamentalist Christian and a young-earth Creationist. And I asked myself many times if this book would have reached me, had I read it back then. There's no way to test my conviction that the book probably wouldn't have changed my mind. I can only say what did.That was my own, self-guided research. I decided to get to know my own religion more intimately by reading From Jesus to Christianity: How Four Generations of Visionaries and Storytellers Created the New Testament and Christian Faith, The Gnostic Discoveries: The Impact of the Nag Hammadi Library, A History of the Roman World 753 to 146 BC and The Other Bible.I wanted to go from purely fact-based, research-focused books, perhaps because I already had a sense that what I was being told would be skewed. I had that sense, I believe, because I was lucky enough to be connected to more intelligent people who were not afraid to speak the truth. But they were also kind about it. I remember reaching out to Manny at one point to ask his opinion on the matter. He was very polite and thoughtful in his response and it, in turn, made me think and raise my consciousness.So the question of whether this book would have converted me goes somewhat unanswered. I say somewhat because, obviously, I didn't read this book. I made a conscious choice not to, at the time, due to Dawkin's reputation as being antagonistic towards religion. While I can say that the book is far more moderate than I expected, it certainly doesn't pull any punches.And maybe this comes to my final point which is Dawkin's inability to comprehend why discussing religion requires one to pull some punches. (As a point, I'm not saying be super nice to religious people, or hide your opinions.) He complains in the book why religion is treated differently by society than, say politics or sports. I can see why it is. Because leaving one's religion, seeing the truth and learning to change your worldview from everything you've ever known is an intensely painful, difficult thing to do - especially if you have been fundamentalist. There were nights I cried and was distraught. Nights I thought I was losing my mind. I clearly remember the confusion of trying to relearn the world. Remember, this is something I inflicted on myself, and it was confronting enough. Nobody was putting facts in my faces or forcing me to see the truth.So I respect Dawkins and the amazing work he's done, even if I don't agree with all of his opinions or all the ways he expresses himself. But maybe this book would have been even better if, like the first half, it had stuck to studies and research and veered less into gloves-off territory. DID ANY OF THAT MAKE SENSE? I don't know."
21,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444651-david-katzman,4,"I don't commonly read non-fiction, but I've had this on my shelf for years so finally got to it.You know what it's about. It’s entertaining and informative, and I think an excellent read for anyone who is either on-the-fence, open-mindedly religious, or for those who are recovering from a religious upbringing. And of course, validating for atheists. For those who have dealt with the trauma of any sort of oppressive religious childhood, this is a refreshing book that will reassure you about your escape from the brainwashing and social control.Overall, his arguments are solid. There are couple things I want to quibble with. First, I did not like how he said that inflicting belief in hell on children is as abusive as sexual abuse. I do believe that inflicting the concept of hell on kids is terrifying, and it is abusive to terrify kids, however, does it rise to the level of actual pedophilia? He trots out a letter from a woman who wrote to him to tell him that she was both sexually abused by a priest and tormented by fear of hell, and she claimed that the religious torment was worse. It may well be in some cases, but overall, I don't buy it. Rape of a child is worse, and his case is not strengthened by the comparison.The second weakest part of the book was Dawkin's attempted explanations for how religion or belief in god fulfills some sort of survival need (natural selection) or some genetic imperative. I think culture has become quite divorced from survival needs. One can trace back certain aspects of culture to survival needs, like money as the proxy for food and shelter. But many aspects of culture have become highly detached and even contradict survival needs. Religions may form some false connection to survival of genes, but I don't think his attempt to connect that story was very convincing. And his long-winded story about an imaginary childhood friend (I never had one) called Binky was rather annoying.I was also annoyed that he dismissed Pascal's Wager so quickly. Yes, it is fairly easy to dismember this argument from a logical perspective. The flaws in it were obvious to me from a young age. However, he should have taken more time to critique this position because I think he deeply underestimates how so many people fear leaving their religion primarily due to the premise of Pascal's Wager. Fear of hell is at the core of what gives Pascal's Wager its power, and it is fear of hell that keeps a large number of people psychologically attached to their religion. So I think he should have spent a lot more time dissecting the flawed logic of this assertion.I was raised Jewish, and we didn’t have a hell, and as such I have always thought that the use of hell in Christianity was a form of psychological terrorism to drive conversion and retention. There is a huge illogic to claim that god is all-good, and yet he permits a place of eternal torture to exist. I ain't ever gonna buy that those two things could exist in any one universe. And I always have to LOL big-time about (even worse) a god who would doom a living thing to eternal torture just because she or he DIDN'T BELIEVE IN HIM. Boo-hoo, what is god a fucking baby? Is the deity Donald Trump? Has god never even heard of the concept of rehabilitation? Whatevs.Last, I want to say that one of the most interesting parts of this book was learning about some of the contradictions in the Bible stories and the horribly cruel immoral violence in it (much of which probably never happened because there is no historical evidence for a great deal of it). I found this to be a great angle by Dawkins to demonstrate how we should not (and most of us do not) derive our morals from the Bible due to all the horrible things that key Biblical figures did. Like, for example, how Lot gave his daughters away to be gang-raped. I thought this was a very strong premise to contradict those who claim that morality can have no grounding without god. Well, that damn Bible exhibits some pretty shitty morals so that doesn't work either. I guess we'll have to figure out what is moral without it."

I am arguing that, notwithstanding the polite abstinence of Huxley, Gould and many others, the God question is not in principle and forever outside the remit of science. As with the nature of the stars, contra Comte, and as with the likelihood of life in orbit around them, science can make at least probabilistic inroads into the territory of agnosticism.”In “The God Delusion” by Richard DawkinsUhm...How can you do that Dawkins, when your knowledge of Statistics is so frigging fuzzy (I’m using a polite word here)?"
23,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5022264-ian-marvin-graye,3,"PRE-CONCEPTIONS:Singular White Male DominantI thought I might write down some of my thoughts in anticipation of reading this book, so that I can see what changes (if any) I go through.I believed in God, until I was about 13 years old.He was singular, white, male, Anglo-Saxon and Protestant. Anglican, actually, although back then, it was the Church of England.I can't remember exactly why I started to doubt the existence of God. However, suddenly, I believed that there was no God with the same level of certainty that I once believed there was a God. Suddenly, I was on the other side of the divide, without any doubt or agnosticism, an atheist. It was as if I'd gone through the looking glass and was now looking back in exactly the opposite direction. I've enjoyed the same perspective ever since.Secular MoralityWhat replaced religion was a secular humanism. The humanism allowed me to discard all of the God bit, and retain the underlying sense of good or morality.I've never accepted that morality is the exclusive domain of religion or God. It belongs to (and is made by) people, not religion or God. It existed before God, if not before gods.Multiple Choice DeitiesSo how do I regard God now? Why don't I believe in Him, Her, It or Them?Humanity needs something that explains things, and potentially sits above us and in judgement of disputes between us.Across time and space, we've satisfied this need in diverse ways. I don't know whether atheism was the first or last option. However, I suspect the next, if not the first, was polytheism. We resorted to multiple Gods or gods to explain things.Who knows how many centuries this belief lasted for. Then gradually monotheism arose and started to dominate.Whereas polytheism had both male and female gods, most monotheism (apart from Islam) has a male God.Man made God in his own image, but more importantly it was male Man who made God in his own image.The Persuasive Power of ConsensusMy scepticism derives from these facts or beliefs: we needed an answer, we made one or more up, we opted for one solution and then another, and finally we men opted for something as like us as you could conceive (immaculately).It's the very coexistence of different options, the absence of consensus, that persuades me that God is a fabrication.  If my God exists in truth, why don't other believers agree with me?How can believers persuade me, if they can't convince each other?In a way, I don't feel any compulsion to adopt any one version of theism, while there are multiple contending versions.Liberal Secular HumanismusHumanism is what remains for some, when you abandon religion or a belief in God.Religion can inform humanism as well. However, the secular aspect is the beginning of something more problematic.If any particular religion believes that it is right, then it follows that every other view is wrong.Traditionally, religion has dealt with others as heretics or infidels.Secular humanism grew out of a philosophical movement that embraced tolerance or liberalism.One religion or denomination should tolerate another.However, this requires atheism, having abandoned and rejected religion, to tolerate religion, even though it regards it as wrong.A new sort of relativism arises. Religion might be wrong for me, but it might be right for you.I have no desire to stop you believing in what explanation works for you.Thus, secular humanism and Christianity have reached some kind of peaceful co-existence.Jihadist IslamIt becomes more problematic when you juxtapose either Christianity and Islam, or secular humanism and Islam.Jihadist Islam has tended to emerge in different communities and contexts to secular humanism.There is less of a tradition of mutual tolerance (perhaps because Islam has always been under threat?). There is a greater differential on more earthly issues like the role of women in society.If the equality of women is a fundamental tenet of secular humanism, is it supposed to tolerate a version of Islam that denies the equality of women?Tolerance FactorsWhat is the limit of tolerance?This is an issue that currently divides the Left.It's exploited by authors like Nick Cohen, who regard it as a sign of hypocrisy on the Left.In a way, his sniping makes you question whether, if you don't believe that something is right (and you believe it is wrong), that makes it wrong for everybody.If so, if religion is wrong for me, does that make it wrong for you as well?Tolerance or Militarism?The real challenge, then, is how militant should secular humanism be? If it believes that religion is wrong, a fabrication, what should it do about it?Should it try to exterminate religion? Should it approach all religion the way Christianity approaches Jihadism?Is secular humanism weak, because it prefers to tolerate what it disagrees with?Is sectarian religion superior to secular humanism? If so, why?POST-CONCEPTIONS:Killer ArgumentsSo what was I expecting from Richard Dawkins, and did I get it?I suppose I thought he might come up with some killer arguments that, when tried out on a Catholic priest of 40 years experience, would lead him (!) to declare, ""OK, you win! Fuck God! Fuck the Pope! Fuck Catholicism!""Did he deliver? Nope. Did he try? Not really.Dawkins preaches to the converted, when I wanted to witness him convert the preachers.I Can't Believe You Believe This Shit!If pushed, I have to say that I don't disagree with much of what Dawkins says. It's just how he says it.I was especially disappointed in his tone. I'd hoped that he would somehow play by the rules of debating. No ad hominem attacks. No ad deum attacks. No blows beneath the belt.Instead, Dawkins adopts an aggressive adversary stance, like he seriously believes religionists are all fucking crazy and, left to their own devices, threaten the lives of everybody else.His tone in the beginning is scornful, scowling and sarcastic, then he indulges in a bit of name calling, until finally he pulls out all the big and little adjectives: smug, nasty, fatuous, unpalatable, vindictive, presumptuous, divisive, odious, horrifying, repellent, wanton, callous, obnoxious.His attitude towards all religions seems to be, I can't believe you believe this shit!Fight to the DeathYou don't get the sense Dawkins respects the other side of the debate.You don't get the sense he wants a polite and reasonable adjudication at the end. He is fighting an age-old battle. He wants to win at all costs. He doesn't want to take any prisoners, nor does he want there to be any survivors. He wants to see the corpse of his gladiatorial opponent dirty, bloodied and lifeless before him. He fully expects that, if he were to lose, the same outcome would apply to him. He would wind up dead, and with no prospect of Heaven.His scorn, therefore, is both anticipatory and retrospective. He is fighting for his life, while trying to reciprocate the contempt with which religionists have held atheism in the past.His contempt is all the greater, because of the imperiousness of religion.However, he chooses to rise or descend to the occasion, by attacking religion with an equal and opposite imperiousness.Accepting the Good Faith of JihadistsThe irony is that Dawkins seems to be more accepting of the good faith of jihadists than other religionists are.He finds all theists, deists and pantheists equally ridiculous. His ridicule makes no distinctions. There's no point in differentiating between particular beliefs.On the other hand, he finds it amusing that Christians (not to mention many agnostics and atheists) can't believe that jihadists believe their shit. In other words, I genuinely believe my shit, but I honestly can't believe you genuinely believe your shit.If it's all shit anyway, what difference does it make that one belief is allegedly shittier than another? We're all of us stuck in the crapper!In effect, Dawkins says you can't fight religious fundamentalism without fighting religion. Religion is the root of the problem, not fundamentalism or Jihadism per se.Alternative Belief SystemsDawkins' approach doesn't really provide an adequate foundation for the co-existence of alternative belief systems.If you accept that religion dwells in the realm of faith and belief, what makes your own belief (whether religious, agnostic or atheist) any better or worse than someone else's? Should we have a laissez-faire system when it comes to freedom of conscience? Should we respect a belief, even if we think it's weird or a clear and present danger?Whether to Cower in DisbeliefSo how can a society exist harmoniously, if everybody believes that everybody else's beliefs are ridiculous?Even if you privately believe religionists are deluded, do you say so? Do you signal your view in the title of your book? Do you simply hold back and wait for the opportunity to start bombing their safe havens and strongholds when you think there's enough of a case? What if they start shooting the staff of abortion clinics? Do you fight back? What if they outnumber you? Do you give them a chance, even in a democracy, of achieving an electoral majority and taking power? Is any one redneck government better than any other? At what point do you act in self-defence?Do you just shut up and keep your head down? When it comes to the first amendment, should you plead the fifth amendment?Perhaps, things haven't really changed that much since Bertrand Russell's time:""The immense majority of intellectually eminent men disbelieve in Christian religion, but they conceal the fact in public, because they are afraid of losing their incomes.""The Quest for Being, Meaning and UnderstandingI still find it anomalous that we have to deal with the most fundamental aspects of being and meaning on the basis of belief rather than fact.On the other hand, if it were proven beyond reasonable (or any) doubt that God did not exist (or having once existed, he had carked it), we'd be able to study the phenomenon of religion itself from the point of view of, not just philosophy, but the sciences, such as anthropology, sociology and psychology.For once, we'd be able to legitimately work out why people continue to believe their/our/this shit. Faith would no longer obstruct philosophy or science or the desire of humanity to understand itself and the universe.Why must we forever remain in the lap of the gods?SOUNDTRACK:Queen - ""In The Lap Of The Gods...

24,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1133461-julian,4,"Reading The God Delusion took a while, but not because it’s long or somehow difficult. It is a jaunty text, in fact, and I found myself often stopping to ponder and/or revel in Richard Dawkins’ happy heathen insights. Also, I do much of my reading on the bus, and you never know when some surly Christian’s going to appear in the seat next to you. Dawkins’ arguments for not believing in God or the “perfection” of the Bible (or the Koran or whatever basic religious text you please) are strong, cogent, and thorough. But as my goodreads friend, laura (small L; I don’t know why) has already entertainingly said in a different way, he does not offer pithy sound bites for use in sudden throwdowns with hostile, bus-riding believers. It’s not Dawkins’ intention to arm us with atheist verbal weaponry. His expressed hope, rather, is that the lonely non-believer might find in his book a few measures of comfort, consolation, and community. Still, I admit that I have a certain smug Baptist nephew whose prefrontal cortex I now, after reading The God Delusion, imagine splaying with Dawkins’ logical observation that God cannot be both omniscient and omnipotetent.God walks into a bar. He calls out, “Barkeep!” (yes, Yahweh, old school God, says “barkeep”) “Draw me a Guinness!” The bartender places the frothy black liquid before the deity. God eyeballs it and booms (God can’t help but boom when he speaks): “I have changed my mind! I want a Sapphire martini!” The bartender gives God a look and says, “You can’t do that.” God grows indignant: “Whaaa-?! I can do whatever I want!” The bartender shakes his head. “You can’t change your mind,” he says. “But I am omnipotent!” “Look pal,” says the bartender, “didn’t you tell me last time you were in here you’re God the Omniscient?” “Yes, of course!” “Well, then, you can’t change your mind because when a mind changes it moves from a held thought to a previously unheld thought. But you say you know everything, including all thoughts all the time, thus for you there are no unheld thoughts, which means that changing your mind is something you cannot do, thus you cannot do everything, therefore you’re not omnipotent.” God seethes. “Look, you can be omnipotent or you can be omniscient. Not both. Your choice,” the bartender adds, smirking. So God calls forth a lightning bolt and smites the bartender, who bursts into flame. The bar burns to the ground. As God walks away, he mutters (boomingly), “I knew that was going to happen!” If you don’t think that’s funny, blame my paraphrase, not Dawkins. He does like to joke around, though. And laura gets some jocular mileage herself out of calling Dawkins a “smarty-pants” British professor with a “holier-than-thou attitude,” although I suspect that her discomfort may largely arise from the fact that Dawkins’ own jokes tend to fall flat (he did do pretty well on Bill Maher’s show, though, so maybe it’s writing jokes that stumps him). He plays it smart. He quotes lots of funny people, like Woody Allen and Douglas Adams (who once was his bff, quite apparently). And he’s not really as all-fired mean or ungenerous as laura implies, but he is blunt, and he’s fed up with religious tyranny of all kinds and the wide slack we Westerners habitually cut religion lest it get its sensitive, little, millennia-old feelings hurt. He’s also damned sick, as we all well should be, of the mental and emotional religious abuses to which children are put every day – and we’re not just talking about the inexcusable pedophilia of certain religious “leaders,” either.Rather than generate pro-atheist talking points, The God Delusion illuminates the rationale for atheism, answers old criticisms, and anticipates new ones. One thing Dawkins makes especially clear is that religion and atheism are not two sides of the same coin. They are not coequal ends of some human belief spectrum. Faith is the (stubborn) adherence to an idea despite a lack of evidence for it. In fact, it seems that the more evidence against an idea (like virgin birth) mounts, the more obstinate grows the believer’s insistence upon it. In the parlance of faith, this is known as “strength.” Atheism (or rationality – Dawkins uses “atheism” and “reason” pretty much interchangeably), does rely on evidence. What atheism knows about the universe is not hard and fast, it’s open, and it changes and adapts and grows as new discoveries are made and new evidence is revealed. Inert, unchanging, incurious faith does not balance the rational appetite for knowledge.My nephew would so rail and flail at me! He would hurl all sizes and shapes of disputation cherry-picked from King James’ centuries-old, “infallible” text (that can get barely even one of its own stories straight) directly at my head. Yet I doubt that the little Levitican has ever considered how decimated our family would be if we were to stone to death all its adulterers and pre-marital partiers, then sell our sisters (one being his mother) into slavery, or that he’s ever allowed himself to be puzzled by “infinite regress” (or, put vertically, the notion that it’s “turtles all the way down”) and why any god presumed to be at the “end” of that infinity must therefore be one that begat Jesus. Could he entertain the thought that all believers are atheists when it comes to religions other than their own? I don’t think so. I should just leave his brain be, I think. And give my own a break. A sadness thus overhangs this book and all its kin, such as God Is Not Great, by the politically confused Christopher Hitchens, another stuffy Brit, and Sam Harris’ Letter to A Christian Nation, which, thanks to Dawkins and laura, I’m reading now. The lamentable truth is that The God Delusion is unlikely to reach those who could most benefit from it –even if they were to actually read it. Faith that allows reason is weak in the knees.  Dawkins’ wants The God Delusion to incite consciousness-raising – actually rationality-raising, if you ask me, given Dawkins hypothesis that an increase in reason will yield a decrease in delusions of holy imaginary friends. He repeatedly turns to the women’s movement for examples of consciousness-raising as a strategic zeitgeist-changer. But the successes of the women’s movement have taken time, and are still taking yet more time. Collective consciousness rises ploddingly. How much time do we have before the jihadists or a General Boynton, lusting for Armageddon, blow us all to smithereens? I don’t know, but I’m pretty sure that Richard Dawkins is running out of patience. "
25,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/584195-natali,5,"I am so thankful for this book. When reading Dawkins' deconstruction of religion, I felt as though he was articulating thoughts I had thought in some form or fashion throughout my entire oppressively religious upbringing. I had notions of these things but never was able to present them to myself quite as logically. The God Delusion addresses just about every religious argument I've ever heard in a convincing and organized manner. Each chapter builds on the same argument fluidly and cogently, although the last chapter leaves a little to be desired. Nevertheless, I definitely plan to read more literature of this type. "
26,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/304492-darrell,5,"Dawkins starts out by citing a recent statistic that shows atheists are the most discriminated against group today. Declaring yourself an atheist in America is political suicide. George Bush the elder once said atheists shouldn't even be considered citizens. People have lost their jobs, lost their spouses, and one man even lost his life simply for being an atheist. Afraid of losing their friends and having family members turn against them, there are many atheists who are afraid to ""come out of the closet"" about their atheism and continue going to church in fear of being found out. Other atheists keep their lack of believe under wraps so they won't be considered arrogant.Dawkins tells us that, like homosexuals, atheists should have pride in themselves instead of being ashamed. Dawkins also notes that there are more atheists in America than Jews, and yet Jews have tremendous political clout while atheists have none. (If you doubt this consider the amount of money the US sends to Israel.)Dawkins makes the case for atheism by systematically tearing apart all arguments against it. He demonstrates that all the so-called proofs of God's existence don't really prove anything and counters with his own proof that God almost certainly doesn't exist (he stops short of saying God definitely doesn't exist). He also points out that everybody is an atheist in some sense. Even the most religious people in the world don't believe in Zeus or Thor. Any argument that can be used to convince someone to believe in God can be equally applied to Greek or Egyptian gods, yet this doesn't convince any Christian to convert to the worship of Osiris.He covers a lot of the same ground Sam Harris did in Letter To A Christian Nation, and in fact quotes from Harris quite a bit. However, since Richard Dawkins is a biologist, he goes on to explain how religion is a by-product of Darwinian natural selection and explains it using evolutionary psychology.To those who say atheists have no sense of right and wrong, he brings up examples from nature showing that evolution instills a sense of altruism into animals. If animals can be kind to each other without religion, why should humans require it? Besides, the morals taught in the Bible (such as putting a child to death if he disobeys his parents, or putting a man to death for gathering firewood on the Sabbath) are not the morals we live by today. Christians don't believe in Biblical morality any more than atheists do. Our own internal sense of right and wrong derived from evolution is what really guides us, not an allegedly ""good book"" which encourages genocide (Joshua 6:21 among others).Dawkins destroys the current myth that the founding fathers of America were Christian with several quotes from our founding fathers in which they warn us of the dangers of Christianity and insist that America is not a Christian nation. He also destroys the myth of Hitler being an atheist with quotes from Hitler showing rather definitively he considered himself a Catholic and crusaded against the Jews because he blamed them for Jesus’ death. It's interesting to note that the Pope at the time repeatedly refused to denounce Nazism.The wonders of science are so fascinating that we don't need religion to instill a sense of wonder or awe into our lives. In fact, as hardly needs pointing out, religion can be a danger from people who kill doctors for performing abortions to suicide bombers. George Bush the younger said he invaded Iraq because God told him to. Taking God away won't automatically make everybody good, but it certainly won't make everybody turn evil either, and in fact, it will likely improve the stability and overall morality of society.This book will make atheists proud to be atheist and maybe even convince some to ""come out of the closet."""

Original review posted on 28/09/2011
Even though I am not a believer, and agree with most of Dawkin's points, I found the book only ""so-so"". Why? Well, it's a case of ""the lady doth protest too much"".Dawkins is so angry with religion and God that he overstates his case to the point of nausea. He dismisses all concepts of God as nonsense: and Buddhism, a religion without a God, he says ""cannot be called a religion but an ethical system of philosophy"". He reduces all religions to reflections of the monotheistic one he's attacking, then uses the most extreme examples of the same to debunk it. Talk about straw men.The author throws away a chance to present his argument constructively, and uses the same polemic of his opponents. He must have alienated a lot of open thinkers in the process.Read it if you hate God and would like to listen to someone ranting against Him. Otherwise, you might be a tad disappointed.

Seeing Donald Trump, ISIS and the idiots of the RSS in India, I am now more sympathetic towards Dawkins. I think he has a point!"

It is possible to not believe in god without mocking religious people. I have friends who are Muslim, and they find 9/11 a horrible event that doesn't represent the fundamentals of Islam in the least. I have Christian friends who don't force their beliefs on others and who aren't prejudiced at all towards other races or the LGBTQ+ community. To ridicule all religious people as deluded morons is wrong in my view and this book is a slap in the face of the freedom and reason that atheism stands for."

Some of us just go one god further.”This is my second reading of this book. The first time I read it in Arabic – and I didn’t enjoy it AT ALL!! Now I’ve changed my opinion! It’s really enjoyable. The language was smooth, and Dawkins’ introduction of his ideas was very interesting.BUT! Essentially, my opinion about Dawkins and his attitude didn’t change. I still consider him as rude and unscientific as most of the religious people who attack him! They both think that they’ve got the absolute truth. THIS LOGIC IS FUNDEMENTALLY FLAWED!!NOW, Here are some of the ideas I didn’t like:1. Dawkins’ criticism of Agnosticism. He didn’t convince me AT ALL!2. He was pretty convincing when he discussed the arguments for God’s existence, but I didn’t feel that he was talking as a respected scientist or a respected philosopher. He sounded more like a preacher!! And I REALLY didn’t like that!3. His refutation of the ‘Beauty’ argument was pretty weak and SILLY!!4. Silliness continues as he assumes that scientists like Galileo and Newton, who were believers, were actually atheists! But they were afraid of being murdered by the Church or losing their income!! WTF?!!!!!!!5. Finally, his BIGGEST mistake was that he links God to people who commit horrible acts in his name - especially when he argued Morality.Anyway, I liked this book. It was worth a second reading. This reading taught me NEVER to read a translation of an English book – especially a book about God or Science!I recommend it._________________________هنا مراجعتي الأولى للكتاب - بالعربية:بداية،السبب الرئيس لتقييمي المنخفض للكتاب، ليس بسبب انه كتاب يدعو إلى الإلحاد، ولا لأن كاتبه هو ""ريتشارد دوكينز"". بل السبب الأساسي في عدم إعجابي بالكتاب هو أنني قبل قراءتي له، توقعت ان رجلا عالما له وزنه مثل السيد دوكينز، ستكون له دراية واسعة وكبيرة في مجال الأديان والفلسفة العقلية وغيرها من المجالات المهمة المتعلقة بموضوع وجود الله. ولكنني خلال قراءتي للكتاب، ومن خلال الأمثلة التي أوردها السيد دوكينز، فوجئت بأنه لا يملك أدنى فكرة - فضلا عن ان يملك رؤية عميقة تليق به - عن حقيقة الدين! هو في الحقيقة لا يطعن في الدين الحقيقي ولا يذمّه! هو فقط يطعن بالدين او التدين التاريخي، ويذم رجال الدين وتصرفاتهم وأشكال استغلالهم للدين لخدمة مصالح بشرية أنانية. هذا الذي ينتقده السيد دوكينز وهو لا يدري! هو يعتقد انه ينتقد الدين، ولكنه ينتقد شيئا اخر، ابعد ما يكون عن الدين!انا لا ألومه في ذلك! فرجال الدين (سواء في اليهودية او المسيحية او الاسلام) حولوا الدين إلى سلك كهنوتي سياسي مبني على المصلحة الأنانية البحتة، وشوهوا بذلك فكرة الله وشجعوا على تخفيض صورته. باختصار، انا اعتقد ان الكتاب بشكل عام لا قيمة له!لسبب واضح، وهو ان العِلم لا يستطيع ان يثبت ولا ان ينفي وجود الله! ببساطة!فالذي يدعي انه يملك ادلة علمية على وجود الله، فهو جاهل! والذي يدعي انه يملك ادلة علمية على سخافة الدين وفكرة الله، فهو عبيط!!العلم له مجال محدد، لا علاقة له بالميتافيزيقا والماورائيات، العلم يختص بالعلوم الطبيعية. والنظريات العلمية التي تُطرح هنا وهناك من قبل الملحدين والمؤمنين لا معنى لها في هذا السياق!إثبات أو نفي وجود الله هو من مجالات الفلسفة العقلية. فهي التي تبحث بعمق في الميتافيزيقا والماورائيات، والفلسفة تتخذ الكشوفات العلمية كأحد وسائلها (لا أدلتها). فهذا الكتاب بأدلته (العلمية) ونظرياته (العلمية - المتهافته في بعضها) وإن افترضنا صحتها، فهي لا تعني ان الله موجود او غير موجود! على كل حال، انتقاد اخير للكتاب: وهو ان السيد دوكينز لم يكن منصفا (من ناحية علمية ومهنية) في بحثه. فقد ابتدأ كتابه بالاستهزاء بالمتدينين وتسخيف افكارهم (وهو تقريباً نفس الأسلوب الذي يستعمله المتدينون في بحوثهم ايضاً). كما تحدث السيد دوكينز في بعض اجزاء الكتاب وكأنه يملك الحقيقة المطلقة التي لا مجال للشك فيها! لدرجة انه توقع جازما ان كل من يقرأ كتابه سيتحول مباشرة الى الالحاد! وهذا شيء مضحك للغاية!وجهة نظري المتواضعة، ان هذا الكتاب لا يتعدى كونه وصلة ردح إلحادية! تشبه إلى حد كبير وصلات ردح رجال الدين!!"
30,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/277749-julia,2,"Witty and well-written, Dawkins is obviously well-read and an intelligent force in the atheist movement.Even so, his book did not sway me towards the atheist worldview, at all. Which surprised me. I expected at least a bit of a philosophical struggle to work through. Instead I found cherry-picked examples of the horrors produced by ""religion"", plenty of witty insults lacking real substance, a few astonishing and unsupported claims (""[Religion] teaches us that it is a virtue to be satisfied with not understanding."") and lots of personal hypotheses.About halfway through the book I realized that part of my problem is that Dawkins holds such a completely separate worldview than me. I do feel that many of his points against specific religions and religious sects are valid and of course his points against people that do unspeakable acts in the name of their religion (like abortion doctor murderers) are also valid. But for me personally, the fact that humans can think and do weird/bad things in the name of religion does not negate the possibility that at least one religious worldview has got it right. If you are ambivalent about religion to start with (agnostic) you may find Dawkins making more sense to you. But if, like me, you already hold to one specific belief system, you will not find much meat to chew on.In the last few chapters, Dawkins seems to ease up on the bullying and his compassionate side really shines through. Here we see just why he is so militant against religion (people emotionally scarred by excessive fears of hell, the hideous antics of ""Christian"" demonstrators, quotes by ""Christian"" leaders like Pat Robertson). I definitely found myself relating to this indignation and wanting to do something about it!What Dawkins fails to realize, though, is that atheism/secular humanism/naturalism is just another religious worldview and one, in my opinion and experience, that is as wrong and incompatible with the actual world as so many others. Throughout my entire reading of the book one phrase kept coming to mind: Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater!"
31,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,2,"I’m aware it is very difficult to discuss and judge this kind of book without offending anyone. On the public forum only the extremes - both fundamentalist believers and assertive atheists – seem to monopolize the debate, it is all black and white, you can only be for or against. This book, and the associated emergence of ""New Atheism"", just as its radical counterparts on the religious side, is an illustration of this.Let me start by stressing that I admire the passion with which Richard Dawkins expresses his atheistic opinion. That passion clearly stems from personal anger: anger because people continue to believe in fictions that make no sense, anger because people do not see that those fictions have been punctured by science, and anger because these opinions nevertheless are maintained by institutions (churches) that abuse their power, monopolize public discourse, propagate a pernicious ethic and sometimes incite direct violence.Though Dawkins' passion surely is negatively oriented (although there is also a positive pendant, as we will see further), he has a fundamental right to express it. I even admire the courage he has, knowing how much opposition and even threats he has to endure because of it. Now, you may say that he owes part of that polarisation to himself, because in turn he is not treading softly, nor does he shun some aggressiveness and even arrogance. But that's just it: he may be conducting a crusade against faith (pun NOT intended), but it is one with words, not with weapons.Moreover, I can personally agree with quite a lot of Dawkins' criticism of religions. I too regularly shudder at the doings of institutionalized religions, I abhor fundamentalist interpretations and statements, and rigid morals. Dawkins' rants against this fundamentalism, against the sometimes very hypocritical moral positions, and especially against theocracies often are spot-on. And his extensive, Darwinian argumentation against creationism and intelligent design are completely justified.And yet a few things fundamentally bother me about this book. First, Dawkins has a very reductionist view of religions: he restricts them to their extremes, their most radical expressions, and of course that are easy (though justified) targets. I feel he has far too little attention to the infinite diversity and multilayeredness of religions. For instance, this reductionism is obvious in his analysis of religious texts: he engages in an equally literal reading of these texts, just like the fundamentalists do, and then of course it is an easy task to unmask their contradictions and improbabilities.The same reductionism can also be found in the way in which Dawkins presents science as the only sound alternative to religions. Here he shows himself to be a 19th century positivist for whom reality consists only of the empirically observable and the scientifically verified. This is reflected, for example, in the chapter in which he tries to demonstrate that moral progress of mankind was not brought about by religions, but by an unstoppable force in history, driven by rationality, science and technology, which he literally calls the “enlightened consensus of the moral Zeitgeist”, an unambiguously progressive trend that will continue. Here Dawkins shows himself to be an adept of naive scientism.Time and time again it seems that much of Dawkins' criticism can be reduced to his exclusive focus on the issue of ‘truthfulness’ of religions. And by truth he obviously means what has been tested empirically or is plausible within a scientific framework. Don't get me wrong: these are valid and valuable criteria, but they cannot possibly count as the only sufficient criterion for statements about reality. Because if you just look at the history of science, you will see how often scientists have missed the point, how much science always gives a preliminary state of affairs, and finally how science cannot possibly serve as a sufficient explanation for what really is important in a human life (why am I here? What am I entitled to? What is expected of me?).In the end, what I think Dawkins fundamentally lacks when looking at phenomena like religion is imagination. And by that I mean the lack of creativity to see that truthful statements can cover a wider range of reality than what can be proven scientifically. His greatest criticism against religions is that they are fictions. And of course, up to a point that is correct: religions absolutely are human constructions, there is no doubt about that. But that alone does not make them untrue or invalid. Because just about everything in our lives is a human construction, we cannot live without it, just think of art, or love, or even science. Imagined reality, with its fundamental linguistic shape, is a necessary way of dealing with the world, of giving meaning to life, and it is often based on deeper intuitions that are not necessarily provable (at least not scientically). And, of course, not all those fictions, imaginations and intuitions are equally valid or valuable, and a confrontation with scientific insights can be useful, but with that test the last word is not necessarily said. So, it is not black or white, not ""either-or"", but often ""and-and"". And in that sense, religions certainly have their own place in the human universe, as attempts to come to terms with reality, within a very own linguistic, practical and spiritual framework. They may be a by-product of human evolution in a Darwinian sense, as Dawkins states, but so what? Isn't science too such a by-product?So, I must conclude that in my opinion this book is faulty in its basic premise, the worthlessness of religion, because it contains a much too reductionist view on reality. But at the same time, it provides many valuable insights to critically look at phenomena like religions (and rightfully so). So, this is a book that should be taken seriously, and in that way I definitely recommend reading it (rating 2 1/2 stars). Of course, you have every right to disagree with me, as long as we remain respectful and reasonable 😊."
32,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"This is only the second book of Dawkins' that I've read & I liked it a lot even though he was preaching to the choir. In audio, he does a great job of narrating & his voice is interspersed with that of Lalla Ward, who is also fantastic. Makes for a great listening experience & helped deal with some repetition. The text may not have seemed so repetitive if I hadn't worked out so many of his arguments on my own & wasn't already convinced that 'God' is a delusion.Dawkins makes it clear he really dislikes religion because it elevates ""Faith"" above rational thought, the complacency of ignorance, & the harm it does to children by brainwashing them. He also doesn't think it deserves a free pass simply because it is religion since it spawns terrorism & some of the most common & worst crimes against humanity.I never had FAITH or belief without evidence or thought. Like Dawkins, I went to religious schools early (Church of England for him, Episcopalian for me) & often had to read or was read the King James version of the Bible. Unlike him, I never went through a religious phase. No one could ever explain the irrational parts of the Bible (most of it) to me or how certain things were cherry-picked from it.The complacency of ignorance is inexcusable in our opinions. Dawkins is a scientist, so not knowing is one of his favorite things. Mine, too. There's always so much more to learn. ""God did it."" isn't an answer. If it was, the Scientific Age or Age of Ignorance wouldn't have come about & we'd still be using candles made of fat & dying in droves from disease thinking it was bad vapors.Brainwashing children into absurd beliefs is criminal child abuse. I never told my kids what to believe & let them go to church if they wanted to. I also let them read anything they wanted to. I just always discussed it with them. There are good themes to take away from a religious service or a fictional book, but it doesn't mean they had to believe in fairy tales.Chapter 1: A deeply religious non-believer - The word 'god' isn't well defined & can mean many things to many people. It's often a default way of phrasing, such as when Einstein said, ""God doesn't play dice with the universe."" He was an atheist.Chapter 2: The God Hypothesis - Dawkins mostly holds up the Abrahamic religions since they're the ones he's most familiar with. The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction... I agree with him & could have added to his long list.Chapter 3: Arguments for God's existence - are actually funny. He lists Thomas Aquinas'.Chapter 4: Why there almost certainly is no God - The argument from improbability of a being as complex (irreducible complexity) suits a god far better than an eye.Chapter 5: The roots of religion - was really interesting. I've read about it as an early form of politics, but Dawkins proposes a few other reasons such as it being a byproduct of other behavior(s) that did benefit us. His analogy is why a moth flies into a flame.Chapter 6: The roots of morality: Why are we good? - Obviously not religion given the change in our morals. I hadn't realized the Trolley problem had been tested in so many areas. Apparently practically everyone comes up with the same answers.Chapter 7: The 'Good' Book and the changing moral Zeitgeist - It's amazing that people think we get morals from religion. The Bible isn't just OK with, but demands that we do all sorts of things every civilized person finds abhorrent today such as killing adulterers, slavery, & such.Chapter 8: What's wrong with religion? - Giving religion a special pass is dangerous to us all. Belief in absurdities has led to far too many atrocities & continues to do so. Chapter 9: Childhood, abuse and the escape from religion - He gives an example where child molestation (the current bugaboo of society) is shown to inflict far less harm than the brainwashing of a child. Chapter 10: A much needed gap? - We need to find something to fill the perceived gap that a world with no god needs. I don't think Dawkins covered this as well as he could have, but he still made a lot of good points. Why do religious people cry at funerals? I've never understood it, but agree with him that they probably don't really have faith in an afterlife.I think we do need to fill the gap between the irrational mind we've evolved & our aspirations for true rationality. I call that spirituality & I'd guess that it is individual to people. It doesn't require believing in fairy tales & can be helped by understanding our brain bugs. All told, a very interesting book. Dawkins gave his position a lot of thought & I found most of it meshed very well with what I came up with independently for many of the same reasons. Unfortunately, I doubt those who really need to read it will.Update 1Jul2020 I haven't read ""Richard Dawkins: Vox Populi"" by Jason Giannetti which is supposed to be a rebuttal to this book, but I happened across a rebuttal to it by Will Patterson. It is ""In Defense of Dawkins: A Response to Jason Giannetti"" which probably does a good job. I'm not really interested in reading either one at the moment, though."
33,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2508169-paquita-maria-sanchez,0," To be honest, reading this book was sort of like having your parents give you the ""birds and the bees"" speech at age 16...more than a little bit pointless. Herein lies the dilemma: I feel like the people who probably should be reading this book will NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS read this book, and if they do it will only be in order to cherry pick it for their own purposes (which would clearly be at odds with the author's stated intention). All the same, the text is extremely informative due to the obviously broad scope of smarmy ole Dawkins' knowledge, from sociological and psychological motivations behind religious belief, to evolutionary science and even a bit of literary criticism (where would the written word be without wonderful biblical phrases such as ""a wolf in sheep's clothing"" and ""the root of all evil?""). Basically, whether you're a skeptical agnostic, or a devout atheist in need of a good old scientific hand job and some motivational sweet-nothings in your ear (good job you smarty pants, you were right all along!), then this is definitely the book for you."
34,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897097-christian,5,"One of the best non-fiction book I've ever read. Actually, one of the best book I've ever read period. Dawkins is well-researched and has a good prose. He has a thorough analysis that is to the point, and although he is on a few occasions slightly speculative, he sets his argumentative boundaries very well and explains what he argues and what he supposes or tentatively explores for the sake of expanding the discussion to get a broader picture. The point of the book is spelled out pretty early and is to give people who believe in God (or in the need of the supernatural / suprahuman to set their morals or give themselves purpose or hope) the tools to do away with this myth that was perpetuated through millennia for the wrong reasons.His chapters, sub-divisions and thoughts are very well-structured and he starts by pointing out the undue respect people offer religion. This protective aura that anything remotely religious gets from people, the media, to the government and legislation. Why should religion get automatic respect?He later makes an argument for the high probability that God does not actually exists, by first rebuking the classical 'proofs' of God and advancing the more robust hypothesis that there almost certainly is no God. He also reveals a few truths about the writing of the Bible and other religious books and picks apart the Bible in particular as Christians' supposed ultimate truth when it comes to advancing moral values and setting an example for the way to lead one's life. He argues that even devout religious people do not take their morals from the Holy book, because firstly, most of them have not actually read it, and that the ones that have or know more about its content pick and choice what is relevant to their lives with their own set of right and wrong morals. Why then pretend that the Bible or Word of God is the be-all end-all or should even be the basis of any moral system?I was raised catholic, turned agnostic as a teenager and was heavily leaning towards atheist. I went to explore other religions, traveled, read and had many discussions to find answers. This book opened my eyes to things I had never before came across in the extend in which religion has been controlling many aspects of our private and common lives for centuries. It also puts light on what the real questions should be to have real answers to such treacherous territory and many people being misinformed while others have vested self-interest. His argument for the unlikelihood of God, if you can properly follow it without a clouded, pre-convinced judgment is very convincing. He does not only convince you, but he makes you ask yourself the right questions.Even more reaching than this pretty crucial element of the book is his later analysis on what religious upbringing brings to our children as a society, namely that they are not allowed to think for themselves when it come to the 'word of God.' That they should lead their lives without ever questioning this aspect of their 'heritage.' He makes a case that children are not able to make such decisions early on in their lives and that it is actually a form of mental child abuse to indoctrinate them at an early age and label them as Jewish kid, Catholic girls or Muslim boy if they were never given the openness and opportunity to make up their own mind with the right unbiased information in the first place.This book is not perfect in any way, yet if you had to judge it by the task it set itself out to do and the results and reflections he was able to raise, it far than exceeded what was intended. Hopefully this book will also make you see the hidden and not so hidden problems and dangers religion and faith has and continue to affect our human society in a subversive and supremacist way. One hopes that more people, like Dawkins will openly stand up against this chokehold of religion and liberate us from this calamity for the better good of all, like we progressively did slavery centuries ago and are still working on discrimination against sex, sexual orientation, culture, physical traits or attributes and child abuse!"
35,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7407364-luffy,5,"If you want to read my choice of the best review of The God Delusion, it's right here.:P I cannot pretend to be a student of philosophy. Much of what I've researched has not been within my grasp, unless it's about an easy to understand proponent. . Ever since the heat of science has caused the separation of theology and philosophy, people have been aware that religion has been hobbled, at least in developing countries. People like Dawkins, who can multitask easily, have gained fame with their stance on this touchy subject. I'm not going to analyze this book directly. There are far better reviews than mine on Goodreads. Well, that's true for every book review of mine, but this time it's subjectively so. Therefore I want to talk about my biggest regret as a reader and as a person. I have a poor memory. I read to be entertained. The God Delusion was like this large pie that I consumed hungrily. But...I don't want to try hard to remember the knowledge in the book. That is neither here nor there for harmless, and fun-filled fiction. But for wisdom filled books, not learning the ideas is not that bad. That's because the wisdom gained from the books make me wise, regardless of whether I remember or not. I don't remember most of the journey but I'm where I want to be. If you want to travel and come to Mauritius, where I live, you will remember some things correctly and others not so clearly. Your immediate memory and your long term memory will form your experience of what you've seen in your travels. Maybe you will have waited for too long in the airport queues, or you're disappointed by the unambitious, unimaginative, and risk free architecture. Maybe you don't like the transport system. But, your joy at going about your way in very casual clothes, your discovery of the local fast food(not an oxymoron), the world class seaside, the pleasant scenery etc will make you dim your memories of the niggling parts. Now is there a silver lining to having a poor memory? Here's one way an ordinary memory can serve us well. If you rarely experience a bad situation, and when one comes by, it stays in your brain like a sheet of flame. If you encounter one bad memory each day, you can make that situation work in your favor and reduce your unhappiness. Most memories fade slowly don't they? Well every time you have a bad moment, consider that it replaces the penultimate bad experience. So the good news is that a) the previous bad memory has been superseded b) The current one will be overhauled by another bad moment. And it might be a memory that's not even as bad as the earlier one. The thing is that however bad a situation you've experienced, it does not sit in your consciousness's front seat for long. Anyway, a word about Dawkins. He is an articulate and charismatic speaker and teacher. The arguments he deploys against supernatural beliefs are interesting. I've sampled several of his youtube videos where we see him taking to religious officials or with fellow scientists, such as Neil deGrasse Tyson. I'm perplexed to find a slight dullness, both in terms of bluntness and interest, to Dawkin's rhetoric. Oft times he simply doesn't use his own material in his discourse at all. He doesn't exploit openings, even against much inferior opponents. So I say to myself, if Dawkins can forget his own material and gets to live another day, surely I can be forgiven for that myself."
36,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52613-susan,4,"I just finished the book this weekend. Although I don't like his derisive approach, and feel that he should have put the last chapters first (and done away with some of the opening pages), I have to say that I agree with his basic points. Where does this put me? In an interesting place to tell you the truth. At the same time, I have to admit, following through with atheistic thought is much more comforting than I would have imagined. It gives responsibility back to me in a strange way, although Dawkins biologic determinism bothers me just like Calvinist determinism bothers me. Strange that it should be there on both sides. Nevertheless, atheistic thought makes the every day even more precious. ""Is this all there is? Becomes THIS is all there is, therefore make the most of it."" It makes each person I love more precious, because time is short and I want every moment to be full of significance for NOW because all we have is now. I did away with Christian soteriology a long time ago. As a result, the whole scaffolding for Christianity fell away and there was not much left except some moral teaching. The only things I will hold on to (and don't we all hold on to some magical thinking) are those things that I cannot explain: my dreams (which, to my mind, have some significance beyond the brain cleaning itself out); my intuition (that has never seemed unusual to me but startles most people when they come in contact with it); my imagination (that startles me all the time!); my love for the fanciful and fantastic. *******I'm not finished yet. In the first 100 pages, Dawkins began with such derision and ""straw man"" arguments, that I was frustrated. I laughed out loud that he had to limit the definition of God to ""supernatural."" What if God isn't supernatural? And of course, he admits that a ""pantheistic"" God is acceptable yet still undefinable except as a metaphor. I was amused, too, that he hates the ""metaphorical god"" vocabulary that Hawking and Einstein used. (Except for the fundamentalists, most people's concept of God is quite pantheistic. That is where religion is going and has been since the Transcendentalists. Karen Anderson would probably argue that it goes back further than that.The Feminist Spirituality movement would claim that that it goes all the way back to the ""pre-patriarchal"" time,and that the ""patriarchal religion blip,"" though it has caused much chaos and suffering, is going away. Of course the Feminists are all over the ""political"" background of monotheistic religions.I am of the opinion that it wouldn't take science to persuade ""fundamentalists"" of their delusion. I think it has to do more with the political/historical/anthropological/psychological aspects to persuade them. It also has to do with using their vocabulary. Perhaps he gets to this later in the book.I wish Dawkins were in further conversation with psychologists about some of his assertions. I feel conversations with some of the more recent developments/ideas in psychology as it has to do with what some call ""spiritual emergency"" and others merely call ""psychotic break"" would help his cause and give him a more sophisticated vocabulary with which to work. But after 100 pages, Dawkins seems to finally gotten down to business with less vitriol and embarrassing comments (such as his comment about ""if we are gullible, we don't recognize hallucinations or lucid dreaming for what it is, . . . . especially if we are young, female, and Catholic."") and more substance and intelligence. He finally brings into his the work of theologians that is scholarly. He is acknowledging the roles of anthropology, sociology, and psychology. "
37,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11566185-alan,1,"As a Christian who is capable of deciphering fact from fiction, I felt it would be responsible to enlighten myself with the writings of the atheist idol Richard Dawkins', 'The God Delusion'. As expected, I was disappointed. Not simply because I disagreed with the material but because he is a horrible philosopher and spends the entire book negatively speaking of Christians and other religious folk as if we had just crawled out of Dark Ages and still burning witches at the stake. It's discouraging how he takes the worst of religion and uses this as his foundational understanding of religion, particularly Christianity. Dawkins has an impressively bad understanding of the Bible, so much so that I'm surprised a publisher could distribute this material without worrying about how their credibility will be affected. In regards to evidential arguments for atheism, he fell short here as well. His idea regarding the complexity of the universe and how everything 'appears designed' is that no matter how infinitesimally improbable the universe is along with how incomprehensibly improbable biological life is, none of this compares to how improbable God is. He doesn't substantively address the fine-tuning argument nor does he address why he feels God is improbable, but he speaks of this as a basic truth; almost as though it should be easy to understand even in spite of the evidence against this being the case. This isn't an official review by any means but these are thoughts that come to mind regarding this book. Dawkins, of all people, should be capable of making a compelling case for atheism. I heard how this book converted Christians to atheism. To this I say, 'were you paying attention?' Dawkins spent 2/3 of the book complaining about things he doesn't like about religion. To end, to those that consider reading this book, be skeptical and learn to decipher truth from falsity. Read between the lines and filter the ideology. It's a must when reading this book."
38,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,3,"This book so weighed on me that I couldn’t finish it the first time, so began again recently, to refresh his points in my mind. One might think I was depressed to hear his hypothesis, that there can be no God, but frankly, it was not that. I have tended to think in his direction for many years now. More, it was his description of the profound hatred those who profess religion exhibit towards others outside their sect. It is stomach-churning to hear the vitriol harbored by folks who believe themselves “chosen,” no matter which religion it is that believes itself the one, true religion. It is enough to make one despair of humans.Humans should challenge their beliefs frequently to make sure they are not just spouting rote learning. We have brains capable of thought, so we should at least try to work it out. Why say, these are things I cannot understand? In that case, we would have more humility and doubt about our beliefs than the certainty too many exhibit. When one does the “homework,” one will turn in one’s mind many of Dawkins’ arguments, and his work will feel familiar, simple, and clear at first. But that is only at first. The thing Dawkins does for which I am grateful is that he takes all baby steps that a questing individual must take, buttressing his points with work from those who have walked this questing path before as well as giving us sometimes amusing, sometimes heartbreaking examples of those who have not challenged received wisdom and who adhere violently to things they admit they do not understand but merely believe. Years ago I read the Bible. A couple of things hit me: the source of much that is memorable in our literature is referenced from the Bible; The Old Testament documents revoltingly violent and cruel behaviors; both testaments are filled with superstitions and magic (call them miracles if you prefer) and stresses the importance of faith over the evidence of our own experience. That’s why Dawkins’ examples roll off the backs of Christians. They were taught to distrust evidence and believe. The kindness and magnanimity taught in the New Testament did not take as well, clearly. Why? That is much harder to pull off than “not thinking.” Yes, I think many self-professed Christians are lazy. They are “saved” by virtue of “accepting God.” Why bother with goodness? But all they need to do is “confess” and they are forgiven. Again, why bother with goodness?How can we evolve (read: improve, for those who rankle at the thought of evolution) if we do not challenge accepted wisdom? Many of us learned religion as children, when we were accepting the teachings given us by adults, presumably wiser. By the time we reach our teens most of us have discovered wide disparities between the reality we experience and what we were told by adults. We begin to question. It is only much later that we can piece together our own beliefs. This should include religion since it is one of the more mysterious and irrational of our belief systems. It is always wise to check now and again what we believe when it comes to religion, especially now, in a time when the religious beliefs of others are once again threatening all we hold dear.For a long time I thought the teaching of morality might be an important role of religion. My own experience has taught me, however, that self-professed Christians are among the least tolerant and accepting of those outside their religion (outside of ISIS now) of all religious folk. There is no hostility that exceeds Christian hostility.”—Montaigne Surely this hostility is amoral. While I myself learned the beginnings of moral thought in a Catholic environment, I also learned many other questionable practices from the nuns, amongst them that creativity is not prized. Dawkins points out that morality and goodness can be taught outside of the constraints of religion. But somehow this seemed the least strong of his arguments: that “do not treat others as you would not like them to treat you” is good evolutionary behavior that will succeed where other behaviors will not. It seems amply clear to me that religious folk have a tendency to kill those who do not believe their brand of God, surely ending evolutionary advancement along those routes. [Dawkins responded to this comment with a tweet explaining The Selfish Gene--how it is genes that survive. Not always, sadly.]It matters, I suppose, whether or not there is a God, though I still haven’t figured out why. Truthfully, the first time I read Dawkins I put aside his book aside thinking, who cares whether or not there is a God? What difference does it make? God does not act in the world, or if He does, He is not orchestrating. That seems clear to me. So, if He exists, so what? We still have to get on with doing the best we can with what we have. Be moderate in all things but strive for goodness, kindness, generosity, creativity. It makes you live longer and feel better, and just in case, it may also be good evolutionary behavior. I listened to the AudioFile audio production of this title, for which it won the coveted AudioFile Earphones Award when it came out in 2007. What makes this such a rewarding listening experience is that the two readers, Dawkins himself and his wife, the actress Lalla Ward, take turns with the reading. The two voices break the text into digestible bits and refresh our listening every couple sentences so that we concentrate on what is being said. This is difficult material which might evoke strong reactions or may tend to make the mind wander off in different directions. The two voices help to keep our mind on what is being said. That must demonstrate a bit of evolutionary learning right there.Four stars for taking the time to go through the steps that we need to consider when examining our belief systems when it comes to religion. One star deducted for making it so uncomfortable."
39,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1721150-toe,5,"This book knocked me on my ass. I originally read it planning to strengthen my faith. I reasoned that if I could understand the best arguments against God and still retain faith, then mine would be that much stronger. Moreover, if we truly believe what we claim we do, then we shouldn't be unwilling or afraid to explore those beliefs. The question of whether or not there is a God is the biggest one of our lives. The answer changes everything. Dawkins says that God does not exist because there is zero evidence for such a being. He puts the burden of proof where it belongs: on the party making the positive claim. You can never prove a negative. (E.g., Prove that there isn't a giant, invisible tea pot floating around Jupiter. Prove that God isn't actually a Flying Spaghetti Monster with noodly appendages.) He also attacks faith--which he refers to as blind belief based on nothing--as a vice. He submits that people do not show faith in any other area of their lives. Rather, they behave and modify their behavior based on tangible evidence as it becomes available. Dawkins further claims that all the religions of the world are wrong and misguided. Just because people want God to exist doesn't mean he does. Dawkins treats religion as an example of a Darwinian survival trait gone wrong. Children who listen to their parents are more likely to survive. For example, the kid who ignores warnings about hot stoves, high cliffs, or dangerous animals is more likely to die, thereby failing to pass on his genes. Dawkins suggests that religion survives because people's parents told them to believe it--and most do.I think Dawkins exaggerates the harm that religion has caused in the world and ignores the good it has brought. Obviously, religious fanatics unwilling to compromise their beliefs and perfectly willing to behave violently are a problem. D'Souza makes two points about this. 1. These people misrepresent religion. It's like blaming automobile manufacturers for drunk driving accidents. 2. The evil actions of atheists are at least on par with--and probably surpass--those of theists. I would add the ideas that human life is sacred, the Golden Rule, human equality and dignity, and the existence of absolute moral truths have their bases in religion. It's difficult if not impossible to preserve certain aspects of religion and throw out the rest; you're tossing the baby with the bathwater. Dawkins seems to want to keep all the aspects of religion he likes while ignoring the inconvenient things like obligation, self-restraint, and ultimate right and wrong that spoil his fun.I also don't believe that religious people are psychologically maladjusted. Belief is not a sickness, and his claim to the contrary overstates the case. He is on his strongest ground when he's espousing the low probability of a supreme being. He doesn't claim the probability to be absolutely zero, but it's close enough.The implications of his conclusion are still terrifying, and I find myself convinced but disturbed. Dawkins spends so much energy destroying belief and faith that he doesn't have enough to replace the destruction with anything. He says that atheism is liberating and exciting because you learn to appreciate these precious moments even more. I disagree. I don't feel liberated or excited, I feel tired and willing to succumb to nihilism. What's the point of anything if there is no God? Why be good? Is there even any such thing as ""good?"" Nothing matters at all; why not commit suicide? As Dostoevsky put it in The Brothers Karamazov, ""Anything is permissible if there is no God."" What's the basis of morality without God? If I rape Dawkins's girlfriend (or boyfriend, I'm still unsure about which way he swings, but South Park seems to think he likes boys) and kill her, he would surely believe, ""That's wrong."" But isn't he merely saying that he's not particularly fond of my actions? The universal claim ""that's wrong"" is very different than saying ""I don't happen to like that."" How can he possibly turn the latter into the former without God? By what standard does he make a sweeping claim that something or anything is right or wrong? And what if I don't agree with that standard? Wouldn't might make right in nature? Shouldn't we just do whatever we can get away with? Assume Dawkins and I are alone in a field, and I say it's ok for me to kill him while he says it's not. How do we resolve our disagreement? If I succeed in killing him do I then automatically become right because the person arguing that I'm wrong no longer exists?These are the questions for which I find Dawkins short on answers. He believes that it will all just work out, and people will behave themselves out of enlightened self-interest. The tyrannies and genocides of the 20th century expose the wishful nature of this thinking and force Dawkins into the ludicrous position that Stalin's Soviet Union became a kind of religion of its own. That line of argument stretches reason beyond its breaking point.Along the same lines, Dawkins places much faith in the explanatory power of evolution. It may explain morality and provide answers to the above questions (i.e., actions that promote the survival of our species are moral, and actions that risk the survival of our species are immoral or ""sins""). From personal experience since reading this book, it seems entirely plausible to me that a belief in a higher power helps promote the survival of our species. Believers seem so happy. They have purpose and something to live for. They can celebrate their bringing new life into this world, and take comfort in the warm blanket of God's eternal Truth. They procreate with abandon.Atheists, by contrast, have no respite, save some Sisyphean smiles, from the brutality of nature. If there is no afterlife, no absolute moral truth, nothing to live and struggle for, then suicide is at least one rational option. That option's appeal only grows when the cynical humor poked at the absurd turns stale. Why endure suffering if it can all be ended? (""[B]y a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to—'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep..."") A simple cost-benefit analysis would indicate that once the balance of one's life tips in favor of unhappiness over happiness, the game is no longer worth the candle. Is the balance tipped when one must work 5 days out of 7 at a job he hates? If so, quite a few of us are doomed.This book made me depressed for a considerable time after reading it. In conversations with friends, I would say things like, ""Life is an unwelcome imposition upon my nonexistence. I didn't ask for it, I don't want it, and, thankfully, soon enough, it will be over."" And I certainly felt (still feel?) that bringing a child into a doomed existence and a senseless universe is highly irresponsible. Speaking with nonbelievers, this seems to be a common sentiment, though I have no polling data. Thus it seems that atheism leads some, if not many, to depression and/or nihilistic attitudes, which in turn lead to a desire to escape feelings of misery, which in turn lead to desire for ""sleep,"" a refusal to bear children, and ultimately a decline in human population.All this is to say that if morality's roots are to be found in evolution and the promotion of our species, atheism is a powerfully immoral idea to the extent that it decreases fertility rates and accelerates a ""shuffling off this mortal coil."" But perhaps Dawkins isn't particularly concerned with humanity at all. If not, how pernicious his assault on it has been."
40,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia,3,"Contrary to what Dawkins thinks, in my point of view, religion and faith are two different things. I, for one, do not believe in god, not as an almighty being up in the sky, who looks at us, knows everything and imparts justice or punishment based on our thoughts or deeds. The way I see it is more like an idea capable of making one feel better, let’s say, some kind of hope. Most people need this kind of hope, some personal god, guardian angel, imaginary friend, alien, whatever you might call it, and I don’t see anything wrong with that. What anyone thinks and believes in is their problem, if it remains personal. As for religion, I am amazed every day that in the 21st century, it still has so much power. Their greed of money is disgusting, to say the least, and their precepts as well. But then I remember the flat-earthers… Well, what Dawkins is trying in this book is to debunk the idea of god, and I don’t think he succeeded. In the first place, he rants extensively on religion mostly, which I totally agree, but less on the idea of god, which is supposed to be the main thread in question. I was shocked by some examples what religious people do even nowadays. Second, the book is choked with hard science. Someone who doesn’t have biology knowledge, will find it hard to understand, not to mention being convinced of god non-existence. Third, those who should read this book, won’t, and those who will, have no need to be convinced about evolutionism. Forth, an atheist should not be considered superior to those who believe in the idea of god, however Dawkins surely thinks he is and even if I’m not in the intended audience, I was bothered by his patronizing tone.Is god a delusion? From my point of view, yes. And many who believe in god think the same, but they still choose to believe in it, as this idea gives them comfort. And who am I, or others, to judge what one needs? As long as they keep their beliefs on them and not impose on others, I think it’s their right to believe in everything that keeps them sane. It's our deeds that speak for us, not our beliefs. Religion extremists, fundamentalists are another matter altogether.Bottom line is that the book is an interesting read and Dawkins sure has a very extended knowledge in a multitude of fields. He just doesn’t know how to express this knowledge to appeal to his readers, or at least, to me. But I wholeheartedly agree on the fact that children should not be raised with religious views or fear of god. Let them think for themselves after growing up."
41,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,4,"Not to give anything away, but Richard Dawkins doesn't believe in God, that's not a spoiler. I'm not going to write about the end of the book, because it just gets all fucked up in ways that I wish someone had explained to me when I was 16, or 18, or 21, it's like fucking Parmenides jacked up with numbers and shit. But that is only the last few pages. Most of the book is about what is wrong with believing in God. I need to choose my words carefully here, because I know one slip up and My Flesh Sings Out is going to be all over my arguments and thrash them apart with ease. I'll also state that in my past I am not a fan of science, according to Edge.org I'm a dinosaur of sorts raised on a 1950's academic diet of Freud and Marx and for all purposes anachronistic now. I have my reasons for disliking science, they are as follows: 1) as a product of American schooling I was raised learning that science was little more than rote memorization, doing tedious tasks, that were called experiments by teachers, but were really just technical training, and none of what was taught had any relevance to anything at all of interest to me. I blame teachers for sucking the life out of science, just like most English teachers did to literature. Later on reading Adorno I would find the technician drudgery confirmed in his writing, and my early dislike of science confirmed as being sluggish and part of a type of thinking that could lead to Nazism (ok, this is simplistic, both in my belief and my reading of Adorno here). 2) My social science background in college led me to actively dislike the whole idea of the social sciences and their general methodologies that reduced everything to easily manipulated statistics. I believed that most of what we were learning was kind of silly, and really could be used to confirm just about anything the researcher set out to find. I also found there to be too many silly statistics being bandied about. 3) I give science a go, find myself weirdly sponge like in my ability to learn about the parts of the brain and what chemicals do in the brain. I join up with a research team and find myself disgusted with the research process. Further I wrongly (but knowing that I'm wrong) assume that much of the research being done in the world is done in terrible situations. It's possible that at point three if I wasn't depressed at the time, and if the research project I was involved in didn't involve having to kill rats by putting them in this contraption thing, cutting them so that they bled to death while they were conscious (well they weren't conscious when they died obviously, but they were when the murdering started) and then guillotining their little heads off of their bodies then maybe I would have stayed interested in science, instead I feigned sickness the first two times 'death day' rolled around and dropped out of the project by dropping out of school at the end of the semester (yes, here is the answer to why I left college for a year and a half, depression mixed with doing anything possible to avoid seeing the rats get killed). So disillusioned with science, I did the only sensible thing I started reading difficult books of literature and philosophy and eventually went to the anti-science side of contemporary continental philosophy. Reading this book though has sort of reawakened some of the wonder I used to have when reading about certain case studies in my bio-psychology or cognitive psychology classes, or in Oliver Sacks books I used to take out of the college library. What a fascinating idea, you find a problem that you don't quite understand and then you figure out why it happens through some kind of legitimate research. It sounds so nice and productive. Instead of say find something that isn't necessarily a problem that anyone would care about, and then swing the deconstruction hammer at it to figure out a way of looking at the problem in a whole new way and laughing smugly to oneself at all of those who cannot see the importance of what you have just done. Now the latter is fun, and makes for some very enjoyable hours of thinking, especially when one does a relatively tedious job such as shelving books all day, but at the end of the day what difference does it make to the world if I can successfully give a Heidegger/Derrida reading about the techne root of the world technology and how it differs from the common latin translation of techne as vertias and how all of that can give a new understanding to the role electronic technologies play on archives? Seriously, who cares? (yes this is something I'm planning on writing in the near future). Ok, Greg, get focused this is a book review not another chapter in your boring memoir being forced upon anyone reading your reviews here. So, the book. This is the first of the New Atheist's that I've actually read. I can't say that it wasn't what I expected, and all previous criticism on New Atheism aside, I enjoyed it a lot. The book is entertaining to read, but what makes it so entertaining is the snarkiness of Dawkins, a tone that I doubt will win over many religious people to his side. But for someone who is pretty much already on his side I found it very funny. Part of my problem with the NA movement is the lack of knowledge about the bible, or any desire to know anything about the bible or religion among too many professed non-believers that I've met. Maybe this is just a big city thing, where it is almost the norm not to believe, and it almost like the default choice without any kind of critical thought put into why one chooses not to believe, and then avoids all contact with religion, as if touching a bible will burn your skin on contact. In this respect I was happy to have Dawkins say that it's important to read the Bible, that it's a part of cultural heritage that needs to be appreciated, but taken for what it is, a piece of literature. Not that I needed to hear someone say it, but it's nice to know that we aren't being told to avoid the book. * (footnote)I like the Bible too much to leave it alone. MFSO may disagree about the games that can be played with the Bible and if they are fruitful or not, but there probably has never been another book written, ever, that is so disjointed, so misaligned and fucked up, and just ripe for pulling all kinds of interpretations out of. It's so much fun to play and read about say pulling an Atheist message out of the book, or lets turn Paul into Lenin, Jesus into an Existential hero to name just a few. Or wonder why there are two creation stories, you think after going through the endless revisions and manipulations, delations and what-nots over the years that someone would fix some of these glaring inconsistencies. But no, the book is full of them. It's a deconstruction wet-dream of a text, ripe and waiting to be manipulated and opened up in oh so many ways. This is a bad thing too, since the book can be cherry picked to justify all kinds of evil shit. If I was an evangelical I'd make sure to take advantage of all the sexual license allowed to the patriarchs, they are allowed to fuck just about anybody.(MFSO, or anyone else; have Christian Apologists ever tried to make Evolution fit with the two creation stories? Why not just say Genesis 1. God makes the universe, starts life, evolution begins, god goes and watches TV or whatever it is he does. Knowing all, he comes back to look in on Earth in Genesis 2, sees the world ready for his creations, there are others that look like his creations and thus like him already wandering around this big planet he made, so he drops his own special Adam in the garden, makes Eve to start the whole chosen people that he will act out his weird psycho-drama with? It would seem to make a whole lot more sense than Creationism and young-Earth theories.)Dawkins at times I think assumes his audience knows more about science than, well I, know about it. I would have liked to have somethings explained out a little bit better (for example when he talks about how moths fly to a flame because they mistake it for the moon, which they use for navigation, and that if you drew out the patterns of how a moth flies nearing a flame it would make some kind of neat-o math thing, I kind of wanted to know how I could do this, and he made me feel kind of dumb because he mentions it like everyone knows how to draw these math thingies). He is also very sparing with his footnotes, I would think that he would want to document everything he writes to make his arguments air-tight, but from what I've seen in the Christianity section at my store, the rebuttals to his book don't move in the realm of logic and reasoning so he's safe there. The footnotes are a little weird at times, just what he chooses to footnote, while other things I guess it is up to the reader to track down using the very lengthy bibliography he includes. I'm not saying that Dawkins is making shit up, I'd just like a clearer trail left on how to find out more about some of the science stuff he is talking about. Similarly, there are a couple of times where he admits ignorance to something that could have easily been googled, for example if the Bart Ehrman book Misquoting Jesus is the same book as one of a different title that came out in England. I'm sure that information is easily found, no need to shrug and say you don't know if they are the same. It makes a hole that religious people could use to start battering down other things you say. But again, they aren't looking to dispute facts but just say Dawkins is wrong because they know it is so. Where Dawkins is weakest is in the role of religion as consolation in ones day to day life. The giving meaning to someone's life. He focuses on death, which is interesting that nurses' report atheists as accepting death in a calmer manner than religious people on a whole, but what about the day to day, why are we here, what is the meaning of it all? He gives excellent examples of people who find the beauty of the world, their place in it, and the wonders of science as more than enough to go on, but what about someone whose grounding was in the teleological aspects of religion, and now those are ripped out from under them? Or the people who have based their morals on the fear of punishment or expectations of reward in the afterlife, and now have their moral ground pulled out from under them? In my own various existential crises' that occur about every other day or so, I never thought that wow, science, maybe I will now, but it never really crossed my mind before. Maybe I'm just asking the same questions that people always put to me about my idealistic belief in anarchism, but I see it as the same question, and I think that there are lots of people would be lost without the structure of religion, same as even more people would be lost without the framework of hierarchical government (my personal answer to both is that it's through raising consciousness, being a decent human being and learning to treat others decently from internal knowledge of basic goodness and not from coercion from external forces that both can be possible, the idea that religion or strict / rigid forms of government will disappear in any foreseeable future is just silly though, but I don't want to get my ass kicked around again for my token idealism, so I'll leave it at that). I don't know if this is realistically a problem though, because people with a faith-based view of the world, are not going to all suddenly be convinced about the errors in their thinking all at once and create a society that falls into utter despair, resublimates their strange tendency's towards outward manifestations of violence or anything like that. Even with this weakness Dawkins still gives a good showing to how one can lead a meaningful life, and overall has created a book that is entertaining and informative, albeit maybe only to the already converted.** *Not that 'secular' christians on the Right may not fair much better in their bible knowledge. I use my parents as a case in point here, they would call themselves christian, and get angry about liberals attacking religion at times, but don't go to church, and did almost nothing to indoctrinate my sister and I to religion. They didn't believe me when I told them some of the things that George W. Bush believed in regarding The Rapture, and treated my talk about him believing the zapping away, the seven years of tribulation, the antichrist and all of that as some kind slander Michael Moore may have made up about our then President. I wonder how much of an anomaly they are, it's surprising to me how many people I've met that don't know anything about the eschatological beliefs that many many people in this country have. **I take back much of what I said in my review of Dis-Belief 101. I still believe the book is moronic and obviously an attempt to cash in on the Hitchens bandwagon, but I take back the things I said about the importance of saving kids from religion. Dawkins made me realize that kids can be really harmed by religion, I was only thinking in my limited only going to church ever other Christmas and Easter sort of upbringing, and didn't think of the fucked up things that friends of mine have gone through because of their parents religion's. From Jehovah Witness parents that made life hypocritical nightmares and Pentecostals who scared the shit out of their kids with visions of damnation to name two examples that quickly came to mind. Even myself, who wasn't religious counts things surrounding the Crucifixion as being central to two of my most traumatic childhood experiences. What kid needs to know how a dude got tortured and nailed to a cross? For at least a year after learning this, I was scared shitless of anything resembling a cross, especially if it was made of wood (like for example the wooden supports for a clothes line a house had a few blocks over from my house, or the scariest of scaries the convent at the top of my street, with it's crosses and hanging Jesus' where I had even heard they enacted the passion every Good Friday. The horrors I imagined happening there. Remembering these things children should be protected from religion. It's like fucking neuroses in a book to kids, especially if they have any kind of imagination like mine. "
42,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2962464-omar-hafiz,1,"It is both really disappointing and quite depressing that many of my friends who tend to call themselves ""smart"", highly-educated and intellectual had given such a preposterous hogwash of a book four (and sometimes even five) stars. And it kind of makes me think..And I guess I should learn to think quite carefully before I finally decide whether someone truly deserves the title ""smart"".If anything, the tediousness of this book reveals quite exquisitely that Dawkins is no more than a pseudo-scientist. The book seems more like a practical demonstration of how different kinds of logical fallacies work, because that's basically all Dawkins had to offer, one chapter at a time. Ad hominem attacks, ad populum nonsense, strawman fallacies, circular reasoning and discussing issues which he clearly has no idea about.. etc. etc.It's basically a book to be bought, laughed at(or even spat at, if you prefer) and defenestrated. That's all.[ NOTE: What you have just read was not really a review. All I did was use Dawkins' own unprofessional, unaccademic language against him. ]"
43,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,5,"I like the classic style of Dr Dawkins. He has a good grip on explaining complicated arguments.Also this books specifically, does a good job in arguing against the most powerful or the most popular arguments about god or religion. I like this book and I think of it as a well written piece which did and will change the life of many of its readers."
44,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1637903-curtis,2,"Richard Dawkins is an insufferable ass. I mean that wholly as an ad hominem attack; it has no bearing on the quality of his arguments. He secretes a superlatively patronizing tone that only the snootiest of Brits can attain, and he fully admits his abhorrence of the people that he claims to want to convert to his beliefs. As such, it's hard enough to read a book like The God Delusion without being distracted by all the snide parentheticals. Listening to it, as I did, is even more difficult because you get to hear every condescending inflection the way he intended it.Moving past the tone and style of the book, however, I have to admit that I agree with many points Dawkins makes. In large part, he lays out his arguments rationally, coming to many of the same conclusions I have come to myself. He debunks a lot of illogical, contradictory and downright asinine ideas held by many religious people, and generally shows the unreasonability of belief in a supernatural being (or set of beings) that actively participates in the events of the world. Taken as a whole, I have to say that I agree with about 75% of what Dawkins says.But there is at least one very big thing that he does not address, and a few conclusions that I think he simply gets wrong, particularly with regard to ethics. I will outline these counterpoints below. NOTE: As Dawkins includes many definitions and manifestations of supernatural beings in the word ""God"" I will use the same convention when I refer to ""Dawkins,"" by which I mean all atheists who essentially agree with him. I think he would be amused by this juxtaposition.Preferring reason because it is reasonable is a tautology. Dawkins' use of reason is aptly summed by a line Benjamin Franklin penned in his autobiography: ""So convenient a thing is it to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.""Perhaps the simplest argument against Dawkins' viewpoint is the axiomatic nature of reason. One cannot prove, without using reason, that reason is better or more useful or more valid than unreason. (Although, one can find evidence that sometimes irrationality is reasonable--that's a paradox for another essay, though.) A preference for reason is, therefore, no different than a preference for unreason. The very act of arguing for reason requires one to accept reason as an a priori virtue.Furthermore, Dawkins' reverence for Reason (with a big R), almost as though it were a divine entity in its own right, seems a bit strange in light of his constant jibes at those who believe in God. He tends to overlook the limitations of reason as a human construct, which include imperfect and incomplete knowledge, differences in reasoning capacity between people, and the equal (or near-equal) validity of differing conclusions based on the same evidence. These limitations may not be enough to parry his attacks against religion, but his failure to address them sufficiently puts him in the same category of disingenuous debaters that he riles against.Please, please, PLEASE do not take the above paragraphs to mean that I do not value reason, or that I believe unreason is better or more valid or more useful than reason. I agree with Dawkins that reason is a virtue. But I also admit that my preference for reason rather than unreason is exactly that--a preference--not a universal truth that must, or even should, be followed by all.His biblical examples are lacking. Dawkins uses several examples to show that people pick and choose the parts of the Bible that they want to believe. I agree with him here, but I take issue with a couple of stories he chooses as examples. In several instances, he uses a formulaic argument against each story, saying something to the effect: ""Look at how utterly immoral these people acted, and yet we are supposed to believe that they are God's chosen people."" Then, he says that Jews and Christians are either ignorant because they don't know about these stories, or worse, they are inconsistent and hypocritical because they choose to overlook them.In the specific stories of Lot in Sodom and his subsequent incest (Genesis 19) and the Levite at Gibeah (Judges 19), the only thing Dawkins proves is that biblical exegesis skills are weak. I find it interesting that he rails against the ignorance and prejudice of religious people, but then exhibits the same ignorance and prejudice when it comes to exposition of some passages in the Bible. Essentially, in each of these particular stories, I disagree that the actions taken by the main characters are meant to be examples of how people should act. Dawkins conveniently ignores certain portions of the text, instead putting forth the actions of Lot and the Levite as being sanctioned by God. (In Lot's particular case, the incest is the genesis of later Israel's two most hated enemies, the Moabites and Ammonites, which is perhaps the strongest symbolic, if not literal, damnation of the act of incest in any religious or literary work that I have ever seen.)As I stated above, I agree with Dawkins' premise that people choose which parts of the Bible (and religious texts in general) that they follow. But his own choice of some stories to illustrate his point seems strange at best and deceptive at worst. Removing these examples from his book would not negate the larger argument he is making--which makes me wonder why he put them in to begin with.Arguments against the first mover. The first mover ""proof"" of God, first posited by Thomas Aquinas, goes something like: Every effect has a prior cause, but at some point there must have been a first cause, which we call God. (Aquinas actually makes three arguments which are basically variations on the same theme.) Dawkins, however, says that even if there is such an initiator, there is no reason to call it ""God"" or to imbibe it with supernatural powers, such as omniscience, omnipresence and/or omnipotence. After going on a diatribe about the incompatibility of omniscience and omnipotence, he remembers that he is making an argument against the first mover, and says that we might as well call it the big bang instead of God.His longer argument seems to boil down to the declaration that such a first mover, if indeed there is one, is necessarily simple. Oddly, his reasoning is rather Aquinian: Since things tend to become more complex as they evolve, any first mover must have been very, very simple--much more simple than the monotheistic God of the Jews, Christians and Muslims possibly could be. Dawkins rules out any complex being's existence simply by reason that such a being would not be a first mover--there would have been something even simpler before it, which would mean that ""God"" was not actually God, but a product of his own evolutionary sequence (begging the question as to whether God's evolutionary sequence could have had an initiator). Dawkins' argument is largely a straw man: Aquinas never attempts to prove God's attributes with the first mover argument, simply that a first mover exists. Aquinas uses other arguments to ""prove"" the various attributes of God, but Dawkins never acknowledges those additional arguments, let alone addresses them.Secondarily, Dawkins' assertion that God would have developed from a similar evolutionary process as those established on Earth is merely conjecture based on observations of the universe as it is now. But if God created the universe, why would the current rules apply to him? Also, as Dawkins discusses near the very end of the book, our knowledge of the world is based on how we experience things through our various senses. Very small animals experience the effects of surface tension and Brownian motion much differently than we do, and so on. Projecting that same idea to God, why would something that seems complex to us not seem simple to him?(Due to length restrictions, the rest of this review is provided in comments.)"

Thorough and complete is an understatement.I think more recently some have come to think of Richard Dawkins as epitomizing the ""angry atheist,"" but personally, I think he's brilliant and articulate and a necessary voice, and I absolutely love his writing style. And when he talks about science, there are few people who can make you appreciate the freaking awesomeness and beauty of the universe and life as we know it the way that he can.Four stars because I don't feel as if there was any new ground covered here, but I'm not sure this book was written for me (a ""non-believer"" and happy about it). Nor do I think it was written for the devout Christian, Catholic, Muslim, Jew...insert your religion here. Instead, I think it was written for those who have outgrown their faith, but are still struggling with their evolving views. I did relate to the comparison equating ""coming out"" as an atheist to coming out as a homosexual...although, according to Dawkins, it's probably easier (at least in countries like the US) to admit to being gay than it is to being a non-believer. And you know...I have to say I've often felt that way. Not only do I feel as if I can't speak openly in my community about my atheism or non-belief for fear of being judged or offending someone, I have talked to many other non-theists who feel the same way."

I did a huge amount of highlighting throughout and plan to go back through the book again to focus on some of those points. This book will make a great reference volume and will be kept in the case near my desk.I would recommend to those who read this, whatever your belief, please approach it with an open mind. Don't become defensive or take it as an insult. I could expound on my history, my growing up indoctrinated, and my own revelations as I questioned and researched for myself simply because I was interested in knowing the facts.

Millenia of belief and philosophy out the window. Makes note to sell shares in bible printing house.There is even a poll. Yes, folks, you can go to that link and take the poll: Is Hawkings right? Well, you could, but it's closed now. 37.5% say Hawking is right, 62.6% that he is wrong and God exists, Hawking's opinion notwithstanding.Apparently the closure of The News of the World will lead to the closure of various 'proper' newspapers in the UK. I wonder, in the end, if the most serious blow to the press in this saga is yet to be seen. I don't read The Times, but it's gotta be better than The Guardian, doesn't it?--------------------------Oh dear. You all are going to hate me for this one.Last week Martin Rees won a $1M prize for his work as a physicist. He has a stellar background as a cosmologist and astrophysicist and has lately been prominent in speaking of environmental concerns, so he is politically correct. You can see details of his career at wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_ReesAt the time he won this prize he was interviewed and these are some of the questions he was asked. http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/201...Ian Sample: Congratulations on the award.Martin Rees: Thank you.IS: Were you already a millionaire?MR: Sorry?IS: Were you already a millionaire?MR: No comment.IS: Why do you think you won?MR: I was obviously rather surprised that I fitted the credentials, but as I see it, it is primarily because my work is on cosmology and astrophysics and they support work of that kind, because of its general interest. If you look at who has won it, I'm the 7th member of the Royal Society for instance. People like Freeman Dyson have won it, so I'm not out of line with the kind of people they have given it to in the past.IS: So why the surprise? You're not the first from the Royal Society, you're not the first from Cambridge.MR: Modesty I suppose. But also some of the winners have been more closely involved with philosophical issues in a more explicit way than I have.IS: And what about theological issues?MR: Well, I've got no religious beliefs at all. Of course some of the winners have, but I think not all of them.IS: What do you think the Templeton prize achieves? What is the value of it?MR: That's not for me to say to be honest.IS: You must have a view?MR: No.IS: But you think it achieves something?MR: Well, I mean as much as other prizes, certainly, but I wouldn't want to be more specific than that.IS: That's a shame. Might you at some time in the future?And so this embarrassment of an ‘interview’ – let’s say interrogation – went on. A scientist calling himself a journalist attacking a fellow scientist for winning a prize reflecting the importance of his career in looking at the big issues facing mankind. If a real journalist behaved like this, one would be ashamed of his work ethics and practices. But this is a scientist parading as a journalist – amazing how scientists think they can be anything else – while in fact abusing somebody in shameful manner.Finally, after a series of questions trying to get Rees to make admissions that Sample could then, no doubt he thought, shoot down in flames:IS: Do you want to share any thoughts on your work?MR: I am sorry you focused on science and religion rather than what I think are the interesting things I do. Which is trying to understand how structures form in the universe and the extent to which the laws of physics are universal. I'm trying to understand extreme phenomena in the cosmos and pushing back to the highest redshifts and things like that.Honestly, I’m sitting here shaking my head at the offensive nature of what Sample was doing in this interview. How anybody could read this and have any faith whatsoever in his work as a scientist is beyond me. At the same time as this interrogation/interview appeared, so too did a commentary by another scientist. Jerry Coyne penned Martin Rees and the Templeton travesty http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blo...Coyne is a science academic professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at The University of Chicago. By all means read his ranting diatribe, attacking Reese, as Sample does. This particularly made me laugh:Many of these awards show a cronyism that has always infected Templeton.Since cronyism is incredibly rife in the academic science world, completely known and accepted, this really takes the cake. Me, I’m left wondering if these are just little, little men, who wish they had bigger dicks and think if they jump up and down in a red-faced blustering way it makes them look bigger than they are. Presumably there are real scientists out there who don’t have this pathetic need to try to make people who believe in something other than science look like blaggards. Einstein once said: Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind. Oh, I can just imagine Coyne yapping around Einstein’s knees, trying to get his attention to tell him what a scientific fraud he is.I’d like to say that manners maketh the man. There are certain things that I expect academics to be. Politeness would seem to be important not just for its own sake but to keep at least a veneer of neutrality, which would once have been considered to be an important aspect of the scientist’s values. I think we can say that Dawkins has tossed that idea well out the window. Perhaps it is all for the best. Perhaps it is better if we know that Einstein and Rees are not willing to spit on the idea of God and religion, while Coyne, Sample and Dawkins will spit on the graves of those who will not spit on God.In the right corner we have the underweight Einstein and Rees, ladies and gentlemen. In the left, Coyne, Sample and Dawkins. Place your bets.------------------------------------------------The prize, by the way, was the Templeton Prize. I've been part of a group who recently put in a submission for funding. We were incredibly grateful that an organisation exists which will fund interesting projects that conventional avenues for funding wouldn't dream of. If you go to its wiki page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tem... it is obvious that it funds all sorts of fascinating projects that enrich the world and which would otherwise not exist. "

I do disagree with his view that religious people are not healthy of mind, he is not a psychologist, and generalizing like that is dangerous. I study biochemistry at university, and have always had a thirst for knowledge, and share his view on evolution and genetics, he criticizes the modern terms of creationism, such as the earth is 2000 years old, (What the hell Ham? Have you ever gone to school?) which are obvious poppycock. It seems like when it comes to thinking and knowledge, although the world of scientists has been advancing, the common knowledge of men has been taking steps back. I would recommend other non-fiction about religion over this one to my friends, mostly because of his extreme view of religious people as basically crazy, but the rest of the book is well developed, he writes well, and uses science in a cool way.

I do find it fascinating that Dawkins decries inaccuracies and inconsistencies in ' religious thinking ' and yet is fairly cavalier in seeking to tar all ' theists ' with either the brush of extremism or that of empty headed wooly thinking. Of course there are appallingly crass and vicious pronoucements by believers of all hues and shapes and sizes but the vast majority of men and women of faith do not seek to ram their ideas down others' throats. He accuses beleivers of not stepping up to the mark to answer his challenges adn although there are a good many men and women who have, perhaps part of the reason so many don't is because they grow tired of his aggressive manner. I know he is totally right that in the past the arrogance of faith, especially the dominant european Christian form was breathtaking in its repression but there has been a sea change on that score whether forced upon it by circumstance or by insight and that would seem to be unacknowledged. Having said all that i did find a good deal of what he said fascinating and thought provoking but the jar of his dismissive attitude tend to alienate me."

I was an orthodox Hindu all my childhood (I had an idol of Krishna that used to always be with me, Used to stay up all night for Shivarathri, write 1008 times ""Om Namah Shivaya"" and fast for Raam Navami s) but several rational questions in my early adult life made me an atheist. Discussing the newly discovered ideas with my parents and elders, made it a lot more clear to me that religion is NOT what most of us believe it to be. Most of the people I know, who claim they're truly religious have never read their own religion's holy books. This is really scary! Why is everyone taking religions so seriously when no one's actually bothering to be aware of anything? This book is a MUST READ to raise your consciousness about these things!"
51,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,4,"This is the most comprehensive book I have read about the current conflict between religion and science. Dawkins provides an excellent overview of the major flash points in one of our most important debates, and he writes with enough lucidity that the complex scientific and ethical questions at the heart of this debate are easily understandable.In addition to discussing the arguments both for and against the existence of God, Dawkins tackles numerous other topics including evolutionary theories about the origins of religion, the question of where humans actually get their sense of morality from, the extreme dangers of absolutist thinking, whether the benefits religion provides outweigh the suffering it has caused, and the fact that it is actually possible to have a meaningful, moral, and joyful life without religion. Many devout people have taken Dawkins to task for what they perceive as his hostility towards religion. There is no question that Dawkins is breaking the taboo against questioning religious beliefs in this book. At a time when there are many, many people in the world who seek to force their own morality onto others through violent or political means, however, I have to agree with Dawkins that breaking this taboo and applying scientific and critical thinking to matters of faith is absolutely necessary. For those with cultic experience, the book will provide a particularly valuable education in reawakening dormant critical thinking skills. The one criticism I have of Dawkins’ book is that he has absolutely zero patience for the kind of poorly reasoned arguments that are so often used by the religious to defend their beliefs. This gives parts of the book a condescending tone that I suspect will be more likely to inspire offense than open anyone’s mind. But for those who are interested in seriously questioning their own faith, or who want to know more about the current battles between science and religion, I know of no better book. "

Tone. Audience. They matter. 4 out of 12."

Some of us just go one god further.” ― Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion  I always enjoyed that line between humanist and believer. I remember when I was a Mormon missionary reading C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity. After finishing it, I immediately felt I needed to read Russell's Why I Am Not a Christian and Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects. I don't have a real problem with agnostics, atheists, humanists, etc. I think the competitive nature of belief is important. I think religion NEEDS to be able to thrive under scrutiny. It can't be comfortable. It can't be too protected. It needs to offer something if it is going to continue to be relevant. But I just can't get too excited by Dawkins, Harris, and Maher's forms of Atheism. While I like and respect their ability and desire to look at facts, adore skepticism and the scientific method, etc., their tone seems to have been lifted from Fundamentalist Christians. Perhaps it is their evangelical nature I am rejecting. But it can't be that exactly. I loved Christopher Hitchens. It wasn't like he was just soft and kind. But he came off more like a drunk rationalist than I pious prig. Perhaps that is my main beef with Dawkins. When he is in positivist mode, he is exciting. I love reading his stuff about evolution and science and the scientific method. I just don't think he is very good at criticism. He seems too smug and comfortable. Too cocky. To be fair to Dawkins, I felt the same way about overly smug members of my own belief system, or Christians who seem more interested in bashing other's beliefs than showing the benefits of their own. Don't smash Buddhists, SHOW me what you have to offer. Don't smash belief, show me what skepticism and neo-atheism has to offer."

He believes that the ""God hypothesis"" falls in the realm of science in much the same way that other matters, such as the chemical composition of stars, or the mechanics of visual perception were once considered unanswerable until clear-headed investigation proved otherwise. Similarly, he claims, if we are genuinely concerned with the universe, with what exists and what does not, we should want to use modern methods and reasoning to reach a conclusion, as we do with nearly every other practical endeavor, rather than resort to myths, atavisms and soothsayings.Because he is smart, Dawkins is careful not to state unequivocally that no omniscient deity could exist, only that the likelihood is so low that one may just as reasonably presume the existence of Zeus, Thor, or the ""flying spaghetti monster."" The case he makes for this position is exhaustive, factoring in countless examples from biology, philosophy, history, politics and human rights.As punishing as he can be, however, Dawkins is no provocateur. Indeed, his approach is neither superior and exasperated (like Hitchens and Harris), nor apologetic and kiddy-gloved (like Dennet). Not since Bertrand Russell has the balance between criticism and tolerance, between intellectual rigor and deeply felt compassion, been so masterfully struck."

""As ever when we unweave a rainbow, it will not become less wonderful.""
As I kicked off a second reading of Richard Dawkins’ 2006 chart-buster, I was reminded of a secondhand conversation to which I was privy at a (now-obsolete) home electronics store. A slick-haired, middle-aged man stands a few paces away, clearly fixated by the latest inventory of high-definition televisions. As a store clerk approaches the shopper remarks, “You ever wonder how it all works? I mean this is just…wow.”The clerk, as if being tested on his knowledge of the trade, seizes the moment with avidity, launching into a monologue on the mechanics of flat panel operation. (Paraphrasing): “Well, sir, you can direct a cold cathode light source, such as a fluorescent lamp, through a light shutter made up of pixels coated with tiny precision filters and get color images that way, as in the case of an LCD monitor, or you can discharge electricity through pixels filled with a rare gas mixture and watch as color phosphors are stimulated to produce visible light. We call the second type a plasma displ-.”The glassy-eyed patron, with all the disinterest he can muster, interrupts, “Oh I’d rather not know. Takes some of the magic out of it.”Mystery, of course, allows the imagination to run wild. Absent a mechanistic explanation for a video monitor, a shooting star, an earthquake or, say, the appearance and evolution of life on earth, our minds latch onto those ideas we find most intuitive or comfortable, be it magic, mysticism or other notions of our own devising. Before we located better answers, we were quite content attributing weather, disaster, war, famine, constellations and star movements, migratory patterns and the rest to divine agency. For much of our early history “God” was the placeholder for human ignorance.Fast forward to present day, and we see that the lineaments reaped by modern society (like the HDTV) were borne out of a firm unwillingness to accept these default, untested answers and an insatiate thirst for deeper understanding. It was this aggrandizing spirit of discovery through which science was born. The process of replacing supernatural causality with natural causality is one that continues to this day. As God has been pushed further and further into obscurity by the never-stagnant march of science, does that, by extension, make God a delusion? Has our wealth of knowledge elbowed God out of the cosmic arena? Richard Dawkins believes so.To borrow his own phrase, Dawkins has been a “consciousness-raiser” for all things science, and is among the most distinguished practitioners living today. His work in gene-centric approaches to evolution and original ideas on memetic theory have spawned fresh avenues of research. Like many scientists, Dawkins’ quest to deconstruct reality has not diminished the grandeur of the cosmos but rushed in a deeper intimacy and awe. And in doing so, he believes science has drawn the curtain back far enough to declare God a giant fallacy wrapped in a cocoon of faith and religions mere vestiges of earlier ignorance.Gods and GoddessesIn his 2006 meisterwerk The God Delusion, based on his earlier documentary The Root of All Evil?, Dawkins assumes a two-pronged approach: he seeks to demonstrate first the untruth of revealed religion and secondly its detriment to society. In consonance with other atheist literature, his thesis is that supernatural gods almost certainly do not exist and that society would be better off without the religions that have congealed around them.Of all the “New” Atheists, Dawkins tends to attract the most flack, both from the theist camp as well as from some of his co-thinkers (Frans de Waal comes to mind). This may be connected to the fact that he is the most publicly visible, or it might simply be due to his expressing views particularly controversial to American ears. Whatever the case may be, his scientific prowess and nigh immortal ability to convey scientific concepts through rhythmic prose cannot be denied.Those put off by his public persona may find themselves wooed into acquiescence, lost in his literary gait. However cantankerous Dawkins may seem while perched on a stage, his writing reflects a decidedly more even-handed, sometimes even glancingly humorous scientist trying sincerely to get at the truth. Sure, some of the adjectives he throws around in reference to religion may be a bit undiplomatic, but that is only to be expected given the bottomless rabbit hole of religious ruminations. Overall, I found his approach equitable and well thought out, as will be customary to anyone familiar with Dawkins’ craft.He makes clear at the starting gate the conception of God he is challenging in this book: “a superhuman, supernatural intelligence who deliberately designed and created the universe and everything in it, including us.” (p. 31) This subsumes not only theistic ideas of God but deistic versions as well. As the chapters unfold, he frequently narrows in on the Abrahamic triumvirate of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.While Dawkins may not be blind to the psychological utility of religion or its merit as a moral motivator, he is above all concerned with whether or not it is true. And it is in this vein that the first half of the book positions itself. Dawkins engages many of the popular arguments in favor of God’s existence (while satirizing a few of the spectacularly weak ones), laying each of them to rest or at least exposing their glaring flaws.As a specialist in biology, he reserves the greatest expositional force for dismantling the argument from design. With characteristic lucidity he explains how Darwin’s bold idea completely upended the design argument once and for all. Exercising Daniel Dennett's analogical idea of cranes and skyhooks, Dawkins remarks, “Natural selection is the champion crane of all time.” (p. 73) Unlike the top-down, skyhook hypothesis of a designer, evolution by natural selection is a gradated, bottom-up process where genetic configurations can only be understood post hoc. Dawkins stresses repeatedly that natural selection is not driven by chance but by fitness. He then concludes that while natural selection and design are alternatives, only the former is actually an explanation (since the latter merely regresses it) and more importantly, is the only one of the two buttressed by evidence. With descent by modification, one could hardly ask for an idea which more handily routs the chronic refrain of religious creation myths.In response to the cosmological version of the design argument, that of a finely tuned universe, Dawkins brandishes the familiar one-two stroke of the anthropic principle and Rees’ multiverse hypothesis. Whether a non-natural agency existing outside of space and time or swarms of buzzing universes is a more satisfactory explanation of the facts may largely be a subjective verdict, especially considering that both currently occupy the same threshold of evidence: zero. At any rate, given what once was ascribed to God and later dislodged by science, Dawkins asks what possible reason could we have for thinking “God did it” will win out here?Prayer and NOMAConsidering how many prayers are pitched to the skies each day as devotees inveigle their deity of choice to accomplish some change in the world, we might expect to find observable results validating these efforts. To date there have been several well-controlled, double-blind studies on the efficacy of prayer. In each of these studies, the null hypothesis was confirmed (i.e., prayer was shown to have no effect on patient condition). As Dawkins points out, one of the largest and most significant of these studies was funded by the Templeton Foundation, which of course was trying to prove the opposite. Templeton solicited Christian petitioners across America and provided them with the first name and last initial of 1,802 patients to pray for. The whole unctuous charade lasted for months, and the results were published in the American Heart Journal in April 2006. No relationship observed.Faced with a vacuum of evidence, many religionists take a different approach. Rather than aimlessly looking for something concrete, they resort to the notion of NOMA (non-overlapping magisteria). Popularized by Gould and swiftly picked up by apologists everywhere, it is the idea that science and religion occupy entirely separate domains of reality. Essentially, science operates in the facts sphere, while religion functions in the realm of values, and never the twain shall meet. This conceptual apparatus conveniently renders God immune to the scientific method. But as Dawkins illustrates with the multi-million dollar Templeton study, religion is quick to embrace science when there is but a slight chance the evidence may fall in its favor. This clearly indicates that “NOMA is only popular because there is no evidence to favour the God Hypothesis.” (p. 59)On several occasions he lends an ear to more sophisticated theologians, though he does not tread around them lightly. He gestures toward more rigorous ripostes to his arguments, but ultimately decries them as fantastical. According to Dawkins, the (Christian) theologian’s appetency to allegorize the more troublesome and contradictory bits of the Bible and insert dreamed up concepts in their stead amounts to nothing more than arbitrary speculation. One could discern the zealous fans of Harry Potter and other fan fiction who dispute every minute detail of their revered lore as being not too distinct from the theologians of today, whose armchair musings fall on the deaf ears of the congregations of America. In the end, Dawkins says the constructions of modern theology are “just shamelessly invented.” (p. 35)The Roots of ReligionFollowing his competent disassembly of the God hypothesis, he moves on to probing more underlying questions: Where did religious beliefs come from; if patently false, why are they still around? I found this section of secondary interest and feel he devoted a bit too much space to what essentially was a lot of speculation. He attempts to weave his pet memetic theory into a quasi-evolutionary explanation for the survival of religion into modernity, with moderate success. I think the psychological and emotional utility of religious beliefs are sufficient to explain their lasting power on human culture. That’s not to say Dawkins’ exploration here isn't worthwhile or interesting.Do We Need God to Be Good?Easily my favorite section of the book is ""The Roots of Morality"", where Dawkins deciphers the riddle of ethics and morality. While he harbors no illusions that science can help us discern right from wrong (contra-Sam Harris), he argues that our capacity for doing so indeed has a scientific explanation. First, the pillars of empathy and reciprocal altruism are traits readily observable across the animal kingdom. This governing sociality, moreover, is most predominant in the higher primates, just as we would predict. Under an evolutionary view of life, then, it is no stretch to say that such cooperative attributes were biologically and later culturally selected for as an avenue towards greater fitness. If true, this would mean that basic decency codes and what we today call moral behavior long anticipated religion.Even if one doesn’t find a Darwinian ontology compelling, Dawkins argues that the religious alternatives have no merit whatsoever. A Celestial Watchman and binary afterlife are typically heralded as motivators for good and, inversely, repressors for evil. In response, Dawkins has this to say, in what might be the single most poignant passage in the book:“If there is no god, why be good?“As Einstein said, ‘If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed.’ Michael Shermer, in The Science of Good and Evil, calls it a debate stopper. If you agree that, in the absence of God, you would ‘commit robbery, rape, and murder,’ you reveal yourself as an immoral person, ‘and we would be well advised to steer a wide course around you.’ If, on the other hand, you admit that you would continue to be a good person even when not under divine surveillance, you have fatally undermined your claim that God is necessary for us to be good. I suspect that quite a lot of religious people do think religion is what motivates them to be good, especially if they belong to one of those faiths that systematically exploits personal guilt.It seems to me to require quite a low self-regard to think that, should belief in God suddenly vanish from the world, we would all become callous and selfish hedonists, with no kindness, no charity, no generosity, nothing that would deserve the name of goodness.”  (pp. 226-227) In short, a conscience is not so easily discarded. The humanistic view, rather, is the view that people are fully capable of knowing right from wrong and do not need childish incentives to act ethically toward our fellow brothers and sisters. Human solidarity, empathy and the lessons derived from social experience account well enough for moral behavior. This Dawkins regards as the more adult moral psychology. In contrast, an ethic that even in implication is dependent upon eternal punishment as a demotivator for bad behavior seems to me to be the deficient one.Of equal importance to our justification for goodness (why be moral) is the epistemological (what is moral). Christians often wonder, ‘For people who don’t regard the Bible as the Word of God, from where do they get their morals?’ Dawkins showcases with great effectiveness the ethical flimsiness of the Abrahamic holy books, visiting a sampling of the Bible’s problematic narratives and itemizing the divine prescripts that not even the most ardent men and women of faith follow. We all separate the virtuous bits from the primitive barbarism. How do we do this, Dawkins asks? By filtering them through our own ethical intuitions. The very fact that each of us passively edits these texts tells us that wherever our moral sense comes from, we are all tapping into the same source. And it’s most certainly not holy books.For even better, book-length treatments of this topic, look out for de Waal’s recent exposé The Bonobo and the Atheist, Hinde’s Why Good is God, Buckman’s Can We Be Good Without God? and Hauser’s Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong.Dawkins concludes with a more abstract section on how ethics have progressed across the ages. He calls this the shifting moral zeitgeist, and I found the insights here quite compelling. As we catalog history, on issues like the abolition of slavery or emancipation of women we see a broad, cross-cultural convergence, perhaps reinforced by social feedback loops or ""a complex interplay of disparate forces."" (p. 272) It seems to follow ineludibly that morality is not something handed down from above, but is to be found within ourselves. It is not eternal, nor is it absolute, but is constantly being refined and improved.The closing sections of the book Dawkins devotes to the dangers of dogmatic religious faith, which is really a dispraisal of fundamentalism in all its forms. While there is definitely great harm done under the banner of religion, the vast majority of Christians, Muslims, etc. worldwide do conform to the shifting moral zeitgeist, are persuaded by scientific evidence, and are dismissive of static, unflinchingly literal interpretations of ancient literature. The alarms he sounds, while attention-grabbing and unspeakable, describe more localized problems rather than endemic ones. I did, however, find his consciousness-raising on the doctrinal labeling of children very poignant. “… Isn't it always a form of child abuse to label children as possessors of beliefs they are too young to have thought about? I think we should all wince when we hear a small child being labelled as belonging to one particular religion or another. A child is not a Christian child, not a Muslim child, but a child of Christian parents or a child of Muslim parents.” (pp. 315, 338, 339) Closing ThoughtsStow overhead everything you've heard about Dawkins, and check your epistemic commitments below deck. The arguments laid out in The God Delusion are thought-provoking, eloquently made and deserve a fair hearing from seekers on both sides of the aisle. One cannot be said to have properly surveyed these conversations before having read and engaged both halves. And given its international penetration and status as a modern cultural icon, Dawkins' treatise is a great place to start. While I found some of his challenges less than airtight (the ""who designed the designer"" argument has never hit home for me), and perhaps there were some missed opportunities for delivering a truly comprehensive counterstroke to theism—for my money, the problems of evil and (un)intelligent design and the arguments from divine hiddenness and inconsistent revelations carry more heft in undermining religion—this is nevertheless a compelling presentation of why 1 billion people and counting don't believe. Dawkins has penned a manifesto to sit alongside Hume’s 
Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion
, Baron d’Holbach’s 
The System of Nature
, Bertrand Russell’s essay 
Why I Am Not a Christian
 and Percy Bysshe Shelley’s 
The Necessity of Atheism
. Irrespective of one’s persuasion, with The God Delusion Dawkins has shown, as several others before him, just how rational a position atheism is, despite its historical unpopularity.Note: This review is republished from my official website. Click through for additional footnotes and imagery."

The only fault I found with Selfish Gene was that he jumped to the conclusion that because natural selection is true....there is no God. He failed to go into detail as to why he thought so in that book and strives (rather poorly) to do so in ""The God Delusion"". If you're like me, you would read this expecting something like ""A=B and B=C, therefore A=C"". You won't find anything like that in this book. Instead, you'll find ""A=B.....therefore B=C"". Dawkins simply fails to link modern scientific discovery/truths with atheism. Dawkins also targets Christianity specifically. In so doing he uses the absolute worst examples he could in order to help make Christianity/religion look all the more ridiculous. He uses the Ontological Argument and the Bayesian Argument (in addition to several other arguments I've never heard and found embarrassing). It didn't surprise me at all that he swept Pascal's Wager under the rug in just a few short paragraphs (it is perhaps the best rational argument in Christianity's defense). His cowardice in dealing with it head-on is unimpressive (though to have done so would have put an end to his bitching). He also uses examples such as Jerry Falwell against Christianity. If extra-terrestrials, when deciding to exterminate human life from Earth or share their technology with us, used Adolf Hitler as their mascot for humanity (the way Dawkins focuses on the worst examples of Christianity) we'd all be dead.The bottom line is that science will never prove that God does not exist (nor will it ever prove that He does exist). What science can do (and has done) is prove that silly and ancient imaginings like creationism, the Earth being only 5000 yrs old, Lucifer planting fake dinosaur bones in the earth to deceive the masses, that are solely rooted in ignorant human attempts to explain what was then unexplainable) false! While some might take the creation of Adam and Eve literally, I do not. Nor do I think any Christian should. For those who do, a reading of Chapter 4 in Genesis should be eye-opening (let alone uncomfortable). Jews, in real life and in the Old-Testament, are very....up-tight when it comes to lineages. We read in that chapter that Cain kills Abel. As a result, Cain is banished. Cain pleads with God saying, ""all who see me will try to kill me!"" (All!?!?! Who would that be?!?!? Adam and Eve?) God confirms saying that seven times Cain's punishment would go to anyone who tried to do so and put a mark on Cain's head to warn all others. In verse 17 we read that Cain's wife gave birth to a son! (Wife!?!?! Did he whip out the wand he got from Hogwart's Academy and cast himself one?) Then, just when you think that perhaps Adam and Eve did have other kids but they weren't worth mentioning Chapter 4 leaves us with the birth of Adam and Eve's third child, Seth. What is more, the Bible describes the creation of Adam as God dipping his finger into the dust of the earth, forming his body, and then breathing life into it. If you ask me, there was no better way to explain evolution to a bunch of Hebrew slaves 3,500 years ago who knew nothing more than how to make bricks out of mud and straw! The only way to approach religion/Christianity rationally is by way of Pascal's Wager (which is why so called ""(pseudo)intellectuals"" stay away from dealing with it. I'm running short on characters, so I'll stick to Atheism. If there is no God/no after-life, then the atheist and the Christian both amount to maggot food. If the Christian God is true then the Christian goes to heaven and the atheist to hell. That's what we call a ""no-brainer"" in the land of common-sense. If I were an atheist, I'd strive for enough humility to fall to my knees and pray for genuine faith in whatever is true. Jesus says, ""I stand at the door and knock..."" "
57,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"""Think, ask, discover for yourself, change opinion if evidence is presented, never assume, never believe blindly, never accept irrational arguments on the part of religion (or anything) as the absolute truth. Everything is an approximation, strive to make it as close and as plausible as you can."" As I see it, this is how you can sum up the entire book. Great writing, very literate, very clear and honestly pretty poetic for a scientist. He is still no Hitchens, but no one will ever be, and Dawkins is in the possession of a brilliant mind and a beautiful talent of expression. "
58,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56458845-faye,4,"A multi-book review:A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson (5/5 stars), Small Gods by Terry Pratchett (5/5 stars), The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins (4/5 stars).I found myself reading all three of this novels at roughly the same time, and as I feel that they all complement each other, I will use this review for all three books. (So apologies in advance both for the length of this review, and for the fact it is for three books not just this one.) Small Gods is one of Pratchett's more serious Discworld novels; he deals with religion on a totally different level to say - Dawkins. Dawkins is writing from the perspective of our real, non-fictional world and The God Delusion stems from his belief that there is no god and if all world religions vanished tomorrow, the world would be a better place. Pratchett writes from the fantasy fiction perspective that gods (plural) are absolutely real, but that fanatics of any religion can twist and distort even the smallest of these gods (in this case; the god Om trapped in a tortoise's body) to create a brutal doctrine that only pays lip service to those gods they claim to serve. ""Belief shifts. People start out believing in the god and end up believing in the structure."" (SG; pg190) Pratchett has filled the book with some memorable characters; from Om himself, to Brutha the earnest novice/prophet, to the evil Vorbis (who I am inclined to think is in some way related to Vetinari of Ankh Morpork; only more sociopathic.)Bryson on the other hand, does not discuss religion at all and in A Short History of Nearly Everything focuses on pure history, maths and science; humanity's quest to understand our place in the universe and to quantify the world we all inhabit. ""We live in a universe whose age we can't quite compute, surrounded by stars whose distances from us and each other we don't altogether know, filled with matter we can't identify, operating in conformance with physical laws whose properties we don't truly understand."" (ASHoNE: pg 219)There is no doubt that belief in god/gods can be a huge force for good and for evil. Dawkins does acknowledge some of these good things. ""It [religion] gives consolation and comfort. It fosters togetherness in groups. It satisfies our yearning to understand why we exist"" (TGD: 40%). I would argue that it has also inspired many great works of art, architecture and literature. However despite this concession, Dawkins doesn't hold back, ""Thousands of people have been tortured for their loyalty to a religion, persecuted by zealots for what is in many cases a scarcely distinguishable alternative faith...devout people have died for their gods and killed for them...what is it all for?"" (TGD: 40%) Dawkins is a confrontational writer. He expects everyone to disagree with him (and to be fair seeing some of the nasty comments he gets from Christians I do understand why), and therefore spends a lot of time arguing - and justifying his arguments - to various critics. About half way through the book Dawkins really starts to shine, he proposes some fascinating theories on how and why humanity could have evolved religion as a survival instinct. My favourite quote of his is the following; ""I mean it as a compliment when I say that you could almost define a philosopher as someone who won't take common sense for an answer."" (TGD: 22%) Bryson, in simply not engaging in the topic of religion, does much more to throw doubt on the existence of a higher power watching over us. He makes it seem absolutely clear how insignificant our little planet is in the vastness of the universe. ""..in a single cracking instant we were endowed with a universe that was vast - at least a hundred billion light years across.. - and perfectly arrayed for the creation of stars galaxies and other complex systems."" (ASHoNE: pgs 33-34)He describes in detail the 'big bang' theory that led to the existence of life, and the discovery of many scientific and mathematical principles that have held sway for centuries. The amount of research Bryson must have done for this book is incredible. He writes in an engaging tone on a difficult subject and writes as simply as possible to ensure everyone who picks up this book can understand what he's talking about. He discusses some of the words most famous scientists and geologists; Mary Anning, Marie Curie and Albert Einstein, along with those unfortunate figures from history who never got their rightful place in the history books like Karl Scheele; a chemist who discovered eight of the elements now on the period table and got credit for none of them.To sum up the three books for me in a nutshell; Dawkins argues that belief in god and organised religion makes the world a worse place. Pratchett says that some people - no matter what their excuse - are always going to persecute others. Whether or not gods exist isn't even the issue; the issue is human nature itself. While Bryson says, who cares about discussing religion at all, look at all this cool stuff you didn't know about our shared history and the world we live in and look at what's going on in the universe right now.I very much enjoyed reading these three books alongside each other, and I would recommend all three books to anyone interested in the subjects of science and religion. (Small Gods is part of the larger Discworld series but it is easy to read as a stand-alone fantasy novel, and I hope that no one would be put off from reading it when they see that it is number 13 in a series.)"
59,0618680004,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1788562-rod,1,"How do you do a review of the most important atheist book ever written?Maybe the same way an atheist would do a review of the Bible: brutally honest (as far as they are capable. We all have biases and limitations - Even Dawkins admits one or two.)So is this literary effort a science manual? Hell no! (and I mean that, Dawkins must keep hell a very present concern. But there's still time.) This is the babbling of an opinionated human BULLY. From page 1 to the end he bullies and mocks and insists everyone blindly trust HIS scientific evaluation of all world religions - as well as psychology of all believers. And that is His major mistake: He hasn't properly researched religions, or people. He hates them so much (I assume a muscled-up religious guy stole his girlfriend at the beach and left him a Gospel pamphlet) and Dawkins is finally attempting to get his justice.Maybe it's just me: but when does this Dawkins guy ever get a chance to do any science? Everytime I turn around there's another book/video/documentary or atheist campus crusade where he can be applauded for his hatred of all things religious. Are his memes actually science? Or does that get lumped into the same lack of testable, repeatable, observable and useful comic science of evolution? If Dawkins is as good at that as he is researching religion then it's obvious.This book is filled with bad generalizations from the fringe elements of religious foolery. I was looking forward to Dawkins taking the Bible head on. Attacking the very heart of Christianity and leaving us with an atheistic utopia where all of our peaceful dreams come true. BAhahahaha! He's like a bulldog that snips at the shoelaces of a great Christian Emperor. Any, even slightly educated, atheist can easily put Dawkins in the doghouse for his unnecessary behavior and barkings.Lately I have been enjoying the 100's of atheists that are so sick of Dawkins smug arrogance and shoddy research that it seems there is some hope. It appears only first year college frat boys are his biggest fans - you would think that would HORRIFY him? But no, he's pretty desperate for approval.But all that ad hominem expertise aside (just beating the atheists to their trump card) it's up to each individual to read this book honestly themselves. Learn as much as you can from Dawkins ""never ending"" ramblings - Was I ever glad when I got to the last page: if you take out all the general hatred and pouty fits then this book would be 100's of pages shorter. But I'm pretty sure the larger the book the more scientific it feels for atheists to applaud it? Pretty sure!And it was definitely a relief that my Bible trusting Christianity was left well intact. He didn't even leave a scar on it. Since i'm not a Catholic, or Mormon, or Charismatic, or Muslim, or Voodoo worshiping goddess of nature type religious person - this book mostly left me alone. Dawkins assumes all religions are the same - but that is because he failed to do his homework. (how did this guy ever get to be a scientist?)I recommend every religious person read this book (and some Hitchens, Harris and Dennett) And if it halts you in your tracks - change your religion. But if by chance you do become an atheist: please, PLEASE stop borrowing from the Bible to justify your atheistic morality and ethics. Do something I seldom, if EVER?, see - live a 100% atheistic existence. That oughta make you happy for about 15 minutes - until you start complaining about fairness, equality, kindness, war, genocide, meaning, and loyalty (things that science really can’t materialistically comment on) Like I said: be HONEST, leave my Bible alone. Like God himself: many things cannot be stuffed into a box.P.S. (the comedy of atheism)And if you do embrace Dawkins atheism and religious hatred:Don't waste the few precious moments of absolutely God-Free morality and debauchery by arguing with the religious for the next few decades. Prove us all wrong by LIVING THE DREAM. Remember: Nature says nothing is fair or equal - and predators and cannibals are just miss-understood and truly following their inner desires. Preach THAT to your atheistic grandchildren."
