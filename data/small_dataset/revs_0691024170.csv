Well, it is, but that that's not what it really is. Really, it's a love letter to a dead woman. Feynman says in his introduction that his friend Alix Mautner had always wanted him to explain quantum electrodynamics to her so that she could understand it, and he'd never gotten around to doing that. Now it was too late. But, somehow, you can see that that only made him want to do it, not just well (he did everything well), but perfectly. If the book was perfect, that would make up for its appearing after Alix was no longer around to read it. It may seem like an odd formula, but it worked for Dante, and it also worked for Feynman.The rest of this review is available elsewhere (the location cannot be given for Goodreads policy reasons) "
1,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70459127-tara,5,"My reaction upon finishing this book:(Any excuse for a Breaking Bad reference.)Seriously, though, this is one of the best pop science books I’ve yet encountered. I read Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character last year, and was thoroughly impressed by Feynman’s animated personality and his passion for physics. Now I find myself even more impressed by his exceptional teaching ability. QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter is a collection of 4 lectures he gave to the general public on the subject of quantum electrodynamics. The book is intended for laypeople, is written in very accessible language, and provides “Feynman diagrams” instead of advanced mathematical formulae. A rather lengthy summary of these fascinating lectures follows. If you don’t want any spoilers, or whatever you want to call them, then skip ahead to the final paragraph.The first lecture deals with photons, and how light behaves like particles. This is discussed in detail w.r.t. the partial reflection of monochrome light by glass. There’s already some fascinating shit right here, let me tell you! See, physicists can’t predict which photons will get reflected and which will pass through the glass. All they can tell you is the overall probability that it will happen. In other words, “identical photons are always coming down in the same direction to the same piece of glass,” and this somehow winds up “producing different results” each time. Who knew that “partial reflection by a single surface” was a “deep mystery and a difficult problem”?! Bizarre.Feynman then teaches us how to calculate the probability of photons bouncing off either the front or the back surface of sheets of glass of varying thickness. The lecture concludes with a discussion of iridescence (the colors produced by the reflection of white light by two surfaces). Neat-o.In the second lecture, Feynman uses QED to explain why, when light reflects off a mirror, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. This is weirder than you might assume. (Actually, “weirder than you’d assume” sums up the entire book remarkably well!) The phenomenon discussed here is also the basis for diffraction gratings. Then he covers how light travels from air into water, and what causes mirages. Feynman goes on to explain why light appears to travel in straight lines. Incredibly, it behaves as such only when you give it enough wiggle room, so to speak. For “when you try to squeeze light [or restrict its path] too much to make sure it’s going in only a straight line, it refuses to cooperate and begins to spread out.” This is not altogether dissimilar to the behavior of surly teenagers. Perhaps we can reasonably refer to them as “little rays of sunshine” in an unironic fashion from now on! :D Bad joke, sorry. Anyway, the manner in which focusing lenses work is next revealed, and the lecture concludes with how quantum theory calculates the probability of compound events.The third lecture introduces electrons, which behave similarly to photons: somewhat like waves, somewhat like particles. (Feynman jokes about “wavicles,” a term I actually love to death, and will enthusiastically champion from now on!) We learn of the three basic actions from which all the phenomena of light and electrons arise: 1) photons rollicking about, 2) electrons rollicking about, and 3) electrons emitting or absorbing photons. As per the first item, we learn that “light doesn’t go only at the speed of light.” So yeah, that happens. It’s anarchy, I tell you! Madness! And the third action is even stranger. Hint: time travel may or may not be involved. Oh, you beautiful, depraved little positrons, you.Next, Feynman covers how electrons behave in atoms. He re-examines the partial reflection of light from glass in far greater detail than he did earlier, and we can now see why the former simplification was in fact warranted. (We previously treated light as reflecting from the “front” and ”back” surfaces of a sheet of glass, as opposed to what light actually does, which is to be scattered by the electrons inside the glass.) This scattering is also the reason light appears to move more slowly in glass or water than it does in a vacuum or in air. Also of interest is how lasers work: photons tend to go to the same point in space-time. (These lunatics are predisposed to travel in packs!) It turns out the reverse is true for electrons. Their aversion to one another is known as the “Exclusion Principle,” and helps explain chemical properties of atoms. Before finishing the lecture by discussing polarization, Feynman examines the complexity of the magnetic moments of electrons. This is fairly bananas, even considering the fact that the entire book is pretty much out to lunch. Here is what can happen: an “electron goes along for a while and suddenly emits a photon; then (horrors!) it absorbs its own photon. Perhaps there’s something ‘immoral’ about that, but the electron does it!” (You really have to love his sense of humor.) I’ve included some Feynman diagrams which depict this wanton immorality:The fourth and final lecture deals with some problems associated with quantum theory. It also looks at the relation of QED to the rest of physics, and includes a discussion of fundamental particles such as quarks and gluons, to name but a couple.Overall, this short book is packed full of mind-blowing information. I really appreciated all of the helpful diagrams that illustrate the very peculiar concepts under discussion. Also, Feynman is an excellent teacher. I just loved his occasional bursts of exuberance and humor. His enthusiasm for his subject is irresistible, his subject itself truly extraordinary."

I love this area of physics and I think it’s wonderful: it is called quantum electrodynamics, or QED for short.
I love this book and I think it’s wonderful: it is called QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter, or QED for short.  I feel as though I’ve been searching for this book for a long time, and now I’ve finally found it. In scarcely 150 pages, Feynman takes you inside the logic of this famously obscure subject. What was before unintelligible is breezy in Feynman’s hands. What had before seemed impossible and bizarre of the physical world—particles behaving like waves, going back in time, eluding measurement—is, in Feynman’s presentation, just Nature being goofy. So here’s the mystery. Newton proposed, in his Opticks, that light is corpuscular, or comes in little packets like raindrops. But it was later observed that light can interfere with itself, so it must be a wave. (For a while, English physicists were loath to admit that Newton could be wrong.) Then experimenters ran into trouble again when they discovered that if you take an extremely dim light and aim it at a detector, you don’t get one continuous signal, but a series of beeps and pauses like Morse code. So it appears that light comes in packets after all. But wait! In certain circumstances, if you shoot these particles one-by-one, you get an interference pattern like a wave. So light was both a particle and a wave? How was that possible? Feynman begins by saying that this question—How is this possible?—isn’t the right one to ask. Physics is an experimental science, so its task is to come up with a theory that will make predictions that agree with experiments, not to resolve philosophical paradoxes. In this book, that’s just what he does: he explains what physicists are doing when they are making these predictions. To do this, he must delve into the math. But he does not wish to explain how his graduate students do it (which wouldn’t be feasible in a book of this size, anyway), but to explain what is going on behind the scenes when they do these calculations. It’s like teaching children to add with pebbles rather than on paper. Feynman begins by telling us that, in quantum physics, we calculate probabilities, not certainties. That’s a bit disappointing, but that’s the way nature is. So when a physicist is calculating the probability that a photon will pass through or reflect off a pane of glass, they use “probability amplitudes,” which can sometimes reinforce and sometimes cancel one another. With this method, we can predict how many photons out of 100 will reflect, and how many will pass through. Not only that, but we can also deduce the wavelike properties of photons interacting with electrons to astounding levels of accuracy—so accurate that if you were measuring the distance from New York to Los Angeles, the uncertainty would be equivalent to the width of a hair. So as far as scientific theories go, QED is pretty dang good.  But what are “probability amplitudes” in reality? It seems a bit cheap at first, like Feynman merely found a clever way to talk about particles as waves without having to use the word “wave.” Feynman describes how to calculate the answer by picturing the particle as having a little clock hand that spins extremely fast, giving you an angle. In the end, two arrows (the amplitudes) are added up, the result is squared, and there’s your answer—a percentage. But what is really going on down there when the photon is traveling from the light source to the detector? What is happening before our measurements? Surely, there are no clock-hands attached to the particles. What's the mechanism behind all this?Of course, this is the kind of questioning that Feynman discourages. In his words:So this framework of amplitudes has no experimental doubt about it: you can have all the philosophical worries you want as to what the amplitudes mean (if, indeed, they mean anything at all), but because physics is an experimental science and the framework agrees with experiment, it’s good enough for us so far.So, really, there’s no way of knowing what’s going on before the particle is detected, since it is, in principle, undetectable. And in science, only things that can be measured are real. All of the stuff used to obtain the answer is just an intellectual apparatus, a tool for calculation. Yet it’s hard to be as content with this as Feynman. If you wanted to learn how a car works, you’d want to know what’s going on in the engine, the transmission, the steering and braking. If somebody told you, “It works by turning the key and stepping on the gas,” you’d feel like you were cheated. But this is what we must do in QED. Nature doesn’t allow us to look under the hood. We can step on the gas and the thing moves; we can come up with an equation that helps us predict how fast the car will go depending on how much we press on the pedal. But what makes it go? Who knows? As Feynman said:It is my task to convince you not to turn away because you don’t understand it. You see, my physics students don’t understand it either. That is because I don’t understand it. Nobody does."

I took this photo when I was about half way through the book. It shows a picture of a CD [click to enlarge]. It's been illuminated by an ordinary office lamp and the flashlight from my camera. I knew about this ""rainbow"" effect for a long time, but I didn't know exactly how it is created. This book gives some answers.To write a successful book like QED (short for Quantum Electro-Dynamics) two prerequisites are required: 1) The author must know a great deal about the subject matter, and 2) He must love his work. Only then it is possible to explain the theory of QED to laypersons like me. Richard Feynman obviously fulfilled both of these conditions. For one he virtually ""invented"" Quantum Electro-Dynamics (and received the Nobel Prize for physics for it in 1940) and secondly you can clearly sense his deep affection for the nature of objects and processes in the realm of the very very very small things, that is the quantum world.Instead of bothering the reader with mathematical formulas like this......Feynman developed a rather ingenious way of explaining the interaction of light particles (photons) and electrons (and later other particles too) using diagrams like this:All those little arrows are of the utmost importance because they represent what is called ""probability amplitudes"" for an event. The longer the arrow the more likely the event. In fact all we have to do–in theory–is to draw all possible little arrows on a piece of paper to explain almost any phenomenon concerning light that we can observe in nature. Don't ask me why that is. In fact even Richard Feynman couldn't answer the ""why"", only the ""how"". That's the charming thing about quantum theory. It has to be pointed out that this way of dealing with quantum effects is not a deviation from the truth (as far as anyone knows the truth). Other popular science books make things too easy and thereby achieve simplicity only for the price of a somewhat distorted truth. Not so here!But don't think that this drawing of arrows (and then later in the book what is called the ""Feynman diagrams"") is very simple. There are quite some things to consider, and the text is pretty dense. Anthony Zee, a Chinese American physicist, wrote in his introduction to QED:[...] you must mull over each sentence carefully and try hard to understand what Feynman is saying before moving on. Otherwise, I guarantee that you will be hopelessly lost. It is the physics that is bizarre, not the presentation.I have to agree to that. Whenever I came to a point where Feynman lost me I skipped back a few pages and read it again....and again, until I made sense of it (as much sense as was possible for me). I think I understood the majority of this book, I just haven't internalized it. Not yet anyway. Maybe I have to read the whole book again after a couple of weeks. Until then I keep a quantum of solace that we (the humankind) are by now advanced enough to understand what make these cool ""rainbow things"" on CDs.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the very foundation of what makes the world work the way it does.

I put on Cosmos while I clean the house, snatch up Michio Kaku's books like they won't be there tomorrow, know all the words to every Symphony of Science song ever, and follow Neil deGrasse Tyson on Twitter--but that doesn't mean I know the first thing about real science. I couldn't solve a linear algebraic equation even if the world depended on it (sorry, world). Instead, I revere famous physicists from afar while most women my age drool over movie stars like What's-His-Face. You know the one. That really hott one.Anyway. Richard Feynman is definitely in the top five on my list of favorite physicists. (Yep, I have a list. Expect nothing less from a girl who named her cat Sagan.) I love Feynman's sense of humor and his whimsical world-view. He may be gone, but he's not forgotten. So when I had a stupid question about light, I figured it was high time I read his book on the subject. My stupid question goes like this: Why is it that, when you turn off a light, the room immediately goes dark? Where does the light go? Why doesn't it bounce around the room for a bit before dispersing? If light is everywhere, why is the universe so dark?Well, this book didn't really help me answer those questions. If Feynman taught me anything here, it's that light is the honey badger of particles: it does what it wants, and leaves tiny arrows in its wake. Or something. I'm not sure. "
5,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44824883-paul-e-morph,5,"Richard Feynman's friend Alix had asked him to explain Quantum Electrodynamics (the titular QED) to her in a way a layman could understand many times. Heartbreakingly, it wasn't until her death that he actually found the time to write a series of four lectures that would do just that. This book is a (slightly edited) transcript of those four lectures.Feynman writes for the layman without ever being condescending and his famous sense of humour shines through. He makes this subject both approachable and fascinating. I've studied much of the content before in physics classes and other books but Feynman has made me look at it in a different way. In fact, I can safely say that this book has significantly changed the way I think about reality.If that's not worth five stars, nothing is. If you've not read this book before, do yourself a favour and give it a bash."
6,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12933866-edward,5,"QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter is an outstanding book on a subject that is often overlooked or glossed-over in many popular physics books. Feynman does a deep dive on Quantum Electrodynamics: a theory that deals not only with the various interactions between light and matter, but which can be applied to every area of physics with the exception of gravitation and nuclear physics.The theory of QED is fascinating, both in its explanatory power and its elegance. Using only a handful of conceptual tools, and working with just two fundamental particles - the photon and electron - it can describe phenomena as varied as reflection and refraction of light, changes in the speed of light through different mediums, quantum interference, lenses (I found the application of QED to this seemingly mundane property of glass to be particularly mind-blowing), and even suggests how all the diverse properties of the elements arise from only three basic actions performed by these two fundamental particles. To say that this book changed the way I see the world is only a slight overstatement - it has certainly opened my eyes. QED is an absolute must-read for anyone with an interest in physics. Feynman takes great pains to present the theory in a clear and logical way, and while the subject is challenging, it is utterly comprehensible from cover to cover. This is by far the best popular science book I've read in a long time - I cannot recommend it highly enough. "
7,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47021487-jose-moa,5,"Wonderful,Feynman is a genius of popularization,without a mathematical expression has achieved the goal of give the rigurous quantum electrodinamics fundaments of geometric and physical optics,is to say,refraction,refraction index,reflexion, difraction ,converging lenses,classic Fermats principle of minimun time in path light and so on.He uses arrows to represent complex numbers in complex plane,with its modules and phases and uses sums and products of histories in the propagation of the photon as sums and products of this arrows to obtain the final amplitude.Also he explains the bizarre and incomprehensible behavior of the photon as it explores all ways each one with it own phase and in the sum the major contribution is of similar to classical path of mínimum time.Also the strange property of a photon or electron that in the doublé slit experiment is able of have interference with itself.In the next chapter,explains his diagrams,how to calculate each piece,the propagation piece and the vertex piece,also the radiative serie of corrections,succesful in explanation of the magnetic moment of the electron and also with a diagram explains very well as a positrón can be viewed as a electron going backwards in time.In the last chapter explains the only ugly aspect of the theory,the problem of the infinities and the renormalization solution,ends with a brief account of the standard model.He also makes a deep reflection in the sense that the complex amplitudes has no physical meaning and that the deep work of the theory is incomprehensible,the idea is that we dont know the true working of reality,only knows the model we make,the reality has a behavior as the model predicts but no more,our model is a simulation of reality and we only can know that simulation.A masterpiece of science popularization,strongly recomended to those that want to have a taste of the deep conceps and strangeness of the quantum world reality"
8,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7552897-sebastian,5,"Throughout the years of reading both popular and less-popular science, I’ve kind of steered clear of Richard Feynman. The main reason is that what others describe as a “larger than life persona” I tend to describe as really bloody annoying, what with his bongos and womanizing and oh-so-clever quips where he always gets the upper hand with the old and rusty physics establishment. Having now fought my way through QED, I can see that this may have been a mistake. My annoyance with his autobiographical works has kept me away from some truly gorgeous scientific writing.The thing is, I’m not sure if it is even possible to explain quantum mechanics properly without all the higher math, but if it is possible, this is likely the only proper way – with a lot of “this is how it is, and don’t ask why, because even we, physicists, do not know”, and a lot of weird and unexpected analogies, such as his substitution of “little clock hands” for the harmonic oscillator that pops up every which way in QM. The only problem I had was that knowing the “proper” theory it took me a while to fully intuitively accept and adopt his “tiny clocks running” description and match it with the complex numbers/oscillators he is describing in this roundabout fashion. However, once that clicked into place, his descriptions of simple everyday phenomena, such as reflection and diffraction, the two-slit experiment, and later on the interaction of electrons and photons, really popped off of the page and sort of “broadened the groove” wherein all the counter-intuitiveness of QM is trying to get a foothold in my brain."
9,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,I remember reading this book as a physics undergrad and not quite getting it. I get more of it and have a better understanding of why parts of it are hard to get. Feynman does a great job with his deceptively simple book on something that defies our common sense. Having learned more and read more since then I understand more but there are still some deeply weird things about Quantum Electrodynamics. Recommended because Feynman is a great expositor as well as a hugely important physicist of the 20th century.
10,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9310150-quiver,5,"That's my position: I'm going to explain to you what the physicists are doing when they are predicting how Nature will behave, but I'm not going to teach you any tricks so you can do it efficiently.Starting from the idea of photons as particles of light, Feynman develops a nontechnical, easily understandable theory of basic quantum electrodynamics, or QED. He uses it to give modern explanations of everyday phenomena such as reflection and refraction, before delving into the basic of electron-photon interactions (the so-called Feynman diagrams) which underly all phenomena except gravity and nuclear physics. No maths is involved, though he uses pictures creatively. In the final lecture, he talks about the experimental aspects and the cutting-edge developments of his time (gluons, quarks, chromodynamics etc).If all sciences were so well explained in so few words with so much good will and humour, the ideas and intuition behind humanity's greatest achievements would be accessible to a much wider audience."

Physics is not a subject I have a terribly good grasp on mainly because my eyes glaze over at the sight of advanced mathematical equations, however Feynman is a pretty great at making the complex subjects of particle physics and quantum mechanics intelligible to the layest of laypersons. Fortunately I also read this with able-minded people who translated the math into clearer ideas which of course opened things up to broader philosophical speculation--something I am pretty good with. The introduction to the book is also worth reading by itself at the very least.""I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.""-Richard FeynmanHe was also a very funny and clever man who left behind a whole host of aphoristic gems, for instance: ""A poet once said, 'The whole universe is in a glass of wine.' We will probably never know in what sense he meant it, for poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe. There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depending on the wind and weather, the reflection in the glass; and our imagination adds atoms. The glass is a distillation of the earth's rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe's age, and the evolution of stars. What strange array of chemicals are in the wine? How did they come to be? There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products. There in wine is found the great generalization; all life is fermentation. Nobody can discover the chemistry of wine without discovering, as did Louis Pasteur, the cause of much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it! If our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this universe, into parts -- physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on -- remember that nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it give us one more final pleasure; drink it and forget it all!"""
12,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22614612-caroline,4,"I've never seen something like this before! It explains the way quantum electrodynamics actually works (not just analogies), but without assuming any physics or math background. I would have been skeptical if the author were anyone other than Richard Feynman, but it's super well done. With my limited physics background, I found the explanations super clear, at least in the beginning.Some of my favorite parts: I learned that light doesn't always travel in a straight line or at the speed of light, but I also learned why paths where it doesn't won't be observed at macroscopic scales. I learned why puddles of oil make rainbows and what a diffraction grating is. And I learned why when light reflects off or travels through a piece of glass, we can treat it as only interacting with the two surfaces of the glass, even though actually it interacts with all the electrons inside.Towards the end, the explanations became less complete and didn't make as much sense to me. For example, Feynman says that in a hydrogen atom, ""by exchanging photons, the proton keeps the electron nearby"", but he didn't explain how exchanging photons would make it more likely that the electron stays near. Overall, though, this was well worth reading."

Feynman targets this book to, well, everyone. He holds your hand and shows how things work. Its a slow step by step process and if you invest some time, its highly rewarding and quite refreshing to be taught physics by a man who is long dead but doesn't really feel so when you read his words. You get transposed to his classroom as he explains basic concepts and the paradox surrounding the most natural thing in this world: light.Its a re-read which I enjoyed and will get on to re-reading some of his other famous lectures.

15,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"In this series of short lectures, Feynman reduces (except for gravity and radioactivity) the whole of the universe to quantum electrodynamics or QED.* QED involves the relationship between photons (light) and electrons (matter), or quantum phenomena, the interaction of which (electrons emit/give up and absorb/get photons/particles of light) creates all of the atoms and elements in the universe. Feynman uses light’s refraction to illustrate the relationship between electrons and photons. To understand light, one has to lose “common sense,” he says. Light does strange things. We understand light not as specifically identified photon movement but in terms of probability. “I am not going to explain how the photons actually ‘decide’ whether to bounce back or go through [an opening]; that is not known,” he writes, and then adds, “(Probably the question has no meaning.)” Light seeks the fastest (shortest) route in its movement from A to B, but it borrows or uses paths that are adjacent. When light moves through a small opening, it also spreads out. In this regard, he writes that “light doesn’t really travel only in a straight line; it ‘smells’ the neighboring paths around it and uses a small core of nearby space.”Electron movement is strange as well. Electrons jump from one path to another and positive electrons (positrons) go backward in time. The book quickly gets technical. It is filled with Feynman diagrams and I can’t say I grasped much. Feynman is describing quantum phenomena but describing is different than understanding. “While I am describing to you how Nature works,” he writes, “you won’t understand why Nature works that way.” “My physics students don’t understand it….That is because I don’t understand it. Nobody does.” This makes his quote above, “Probably the question has no meaning,” particularly interesting as Feynman seems to be saying that, in the end, we can only describe how nature works, but not why it works the way it does. By extension, is Feynman saying that there are no ultimate explanations (e.g., God, Deist design) for the cosmos and how it operates, and that Nature just Is?*“The theory describes all the phenomena of the physical world except the gravitational effect, the thing that holds you in your seats,..and radioactive phenomena.” QED is “a horrible name,” Feynman concedes. The theory also describes what goes on inside the nucleus itself, which are the quarks and gluons, and involve some 400 (and counting) subparticles."
16,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4369018-lee,4,"This weekend just passed my flatmate's boyfriend was visiting. Being the inquisitive sort, at one point he asked me if I could explain the main results of my PhD thesis to him in terms he would understand. To my eternal shame my knee-jerk response was ""No."" But a few moments later I was to be found scrawling on a napkin, explaining rational points on curves, density arguments, counting functions, and concluding by using the word ""generalise"" far more times in one sentence than I was comfortable with.He seemed to follow my haphazard ramblings which is always enough to leave one chuffed. It's no secret to the science community that its biggest failing is an inability to communicate with and engage the public. The more esoteric the science, the trickier it is to convey it in terms that are both accurate and interesting. And, outside of pure mathematics, it doesn't get a great deal more esoteric than quantum mecahnics. So Richard Feynman's QED is laudable for, if nothing else, being about as understandable as is possible with this subject. There were times that the text lost me, but after giving it some thought I realised in each case that it was because I was expecting the quantum world to make sense, and to paraphrase my old Physics teacher: if quantum mechanics starts making sense, then you've stopped understanding it.Feynman's abilities as a scientific orator are pretty well known—one of my favourite videos on Youtube is a two-and-a-half minute video of Feynman sitting in a chair explaining how a train stays on the tracks. Seriously. Feynman's writing skills are apparently just as good, but I've not read any of his other books and this one is actually the edited transcriptions of four of his lectures, so his speaking prowess proves more useful here. And as if being fascinating, self-deprecating, and witty wasn't enough, he also manages to be quite touching. The lectures were the inaugural set in a series dedicated to Alix Mautner, an English major and long time friend of Feynman to whom the physicist had promised to explain quantum electrodynamics in terms she could understand. Sadly she died before he managed to do so, but the lectures here are, as he says, the ones he prepared for Alex, but that he could no longer give just to her."
17,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030419-fraser-kinnear,5,"I think this is my favorite science book. This was in large part due to having Feynman's real voice in my head, as I've heard him often in recorded lectures and documentaries.The book is transcription of a few lectures Feynman gave on Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), a branch of quantum theory he and Dirac developed. Feynman introduces a few simple rules on how electrons and photons behave (which appear to be easy-to-digest analogs for vector calculus) and then off he goes, explaining the theory and how it describes an enormous amount of phenomena, such as the uncertainty principle, the how lenses and mirages physically work, how light scattering creates particles that travel backwards in time (via an antiparticle), why electrons stay in their orbits, lasers (exclusion principle). The only concept which I felt didn't come across quite so clearly was his discussion of spin. Once he is satisfied with the level of detail he gave to explaining QED, Feynman quickly runs through the rest of the menagerie of sub atomic particles, doing little more than listing them and noting that the toolkit from QED is useful in describing the interaction of quarks and gluons."
18,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30541335-jimmy-ele,5,"The particle view of physics and how Richard Feynman was able to explain all of the weird ways that light behaves was a thoroughly engrossing read. The intellectual feat that was performed by this man in creating a workable mathematics for the physics behind the way that light travels, and reflects is truly amazing. Using the simple concepts of rotation, spin, frequency, and depicting it all with some simple calculations involving arrows and simple algebra gave me a sense of awe at the simplicity of such a seemingly complicated subject. Even though I currently side with the field theory of Julian Schwinger, I must say that I can not blame anyone for using Q.E.D. as the model for their calculations. Overall, I had to place this on my foundation list, seeing as it gives me inspiration for explaining the seemingly complicated in very simple terms that can be easily understood by many. "
19,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8044071-dean-hamp,5,"I visited my brother a long time ago, when he was working on his Ph.D. in Physics. He tossed a small, innocuous-looking book to me and said, ""Read this - its a complete brain-f**k. I've been hooked ever since. QED is, by far, the best piece of non-fiction I have ever read. It takes a long time for me to work though the concepts, and, as Feynman points out, nobody (including me) (especially me) truly understands Quantum Electrodynamics. But to begin with adding 'damned little arrows' and take that to an all-encompassing description of atomic theory, accurate to ten decimal places, in about 120 pages, so the likes of me can follow along, is the purest of genius. Bravo!"

Alas, that's the nature of science popularization. If you omit math, the heart is gone, and you have to make do with the leftover shell. Feynman does the best job of leaving behind some substance that I've ever seen in such a book.Excellent pedagogy, and some great quotes."
21,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43451865-bishnu-bhatta-buttowski,5,"Seriously, I don't know how to write this review. I'd promise myself and you that I'll be updating this review as I begin to evolve my thought regarding this book and 'Theory of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)'.Physics has become full of Mess, these recent days, since the discovery of quantum mechanics and perhaps you'd claim that Physics is Ugly.Well I couldn't agree with you more, but on the other hand, Physicist and the whole of the physics community have done the great job of correlating these mess into a beautiful picture like 'Theory of Quantum electrodynamics'. Since, this is my first encounter with quantum electrodynamics or typo of these advanced topic, so this review is purely based upon my reading this book.If this is your first time reading a book by Richard Feynman, assuming that you do have some good school or high school physics, I wouldn't recommend you to read 'Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! ', the reason being that I don't want you to have a picture of Feynman being animated personality and top class physicist. Rather, I want you to have this picture by understanding his way of explaining things and his excellent teaching style by reading this book. You'd be amazed how Feynman explains the interference and other several phenomena by simply the work of geometry-some arrows, their length and a stopwatch, whose revolving hand's speed can be changed :DLectures are really insightful. The main purpose of reading this book wouldn't be only to show off to someone that you've read 'QED' and know one or two things about this field, but to gain insightful way of carving wit out of complex topics like QED. I never would have thought about why we take a principle-reflecting of light on mirror-'the angle of reflection is equal to angle of incidence.'-the way it is. And like other cases that electron or photon doesn't travel only in straight lines to some destination but travel through every possible path, there is more to this principle that happens in real life. You'd ask why?And this is the reason why I want you to read this book.Feynman starts off the these lectures as these were intended for laymen, with simple ideas and tools, only to evolve these tools as the lectures progress so he could explain difficult topics like in the chapter 3 of this book: 'Electrons and their interactions'.Only thing that was difficult to grasp was chapter 4: 'Loose ends' that discusses the theory of strong interactions that discusses about the quarks (particles that make up electrons protons, etc), gluons (particles that are exchanged between quarks). I believe chapter 4 needs re-reading and referring to other books if one is interested in it.And last but not the least, I can't and shouldn't end this review not including at least a Feynman diagram, so here it goes."
22,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,5,"How can you not love Richard Feynman? This is as easy a lesson in quantum electrodynamics as you'll find, I think. Which is not to say ""easy,"" but painless to read and absorbable with enough concentration and/or re-reading of the harder parts. No more math than you are already familiar with, just kind of hard to wrap your mind around. I have often complained that I didn't ""believe in"" quantum theory because it doesn't make sense. It turns out that nobody understands WHY it works, but Dr. Feynman does explain HOW it works and the experimental evidence that PROVES it works. At the time of the writing, they were still working on it and as far as I know, they are still. It is vexing and puzzling but like it or not, it's life.There are 4 lectures on QED on Youtube with the infamous Dr. Feynman. If you don't even like math or science you will still love the good humored, enthusiastic and irresistibly adorable Nobel prize winner. Here's the link to the first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLQ2a...Watch the lectures and read the book and you'll understand QED .... somewhat. Very fun, believe it or not."

The explanation is good, you can understand, you are able to imagine things and if you are really interested I believe you can make suppositions. But I am not. I read the book because it sounded interesting and I thought that after reading it I would be more able to understand things. I am not. What I knew, I know. Lots of formules - actually, I know something new: the way to calculate and that the result of an action is done by an arrow (which is the sum of tiny arrows, all the possible ways of an action). I think that this book would be very interesting for people really into the subject. "
24,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22476125-maanasa,5,"When I first heard of the two recent quantum physics mega-events--the discovery of the Higgs-Boson particle and the confirmation of the Inflation theory--I knew that these were events of massive import but I was woefully ill-equipped to understand the ""why"" of it. What began as a wikipedia binge of particle physics terms and definitions, became an attempt to understand the four fundamental forces, which then led me to Richard Feynman's QED. This book attempts to explain to the layperson one of the fundamental forces of nature--electromagnetism--and to give us a glimpse into the ways that light and matter interact to give rise to a host of derivative (in the non-science/math sense of the term) phenomena like optics, heat transfer, electricity, magnetism, etc.While the book doesn't have the ability to make theoretical physicists out of us all, it does help the reader see the outline of the bigger picture (or should I say the infinitesimally tiny picture). I think one of Feynman's biggest successes as a translator come through his ability to 1) find the right metaphors, and 2) state clearly which ideas he is simplifying and which ones he is ignoring in order to make the material digestible. Feynman's tone is humorous and his language pithy. The diagrams used to illustrate concepts are extremely helpful. I, for one, am very glad to have gotten a glimpse into this fundamental concept that governs the world that we live in through this well-presented and fun book.For those of you only interested in my view on the book, you can stop reading here. From this point on, I digress a little.I have often heard people brandish the line ""a little knowledge is a dangerous thing."" The origin of this line can be traced back to Alexander Pope's poem, ""Essay on Criticism,"" and is often spouted to support the proposition that one must abstain from learning unless they mean to go all the way. However, I have always found this to be an incredibly superficial (totally ironic, I know) reading of the line given the context in which it appears. The poem states: ""A little learning is a dang'rous thing; Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring (spring of inspiration and knowledge - from Greek mythology): There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, And drinking largely sobers us again.""Within this context, it's clear that Pope isn't trying to tell us that spotting the tip of an iceberg itself is dangerous, but that spotting the tip without realizing that there is more to the iceberg than its tip is what is dangerous. I strongly believe that as long as a person is aware of how incomplete or superficial his/her learning is, s/he can steer clear of said ""danger"". It is not only OK, but recommended that we try to broaden the scope of our intellectual pursuits even if we do not have the necessary resources to deepen them. And this book perfectly furthers that goal."
25,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5526063-mary-jean-harris,5,"This book hits all the marks for a great novel. Yes, it's a science book, but it's probably one of the best ones I've read so far. Feynman has a fun style of writing and makes these topics very easy to understand. He really captures the wonder and excitement that new things in physics can offer. Even though I knew many of the things in the book already, I had never seen them presented in this way before, as in, explaining common phenomena like reflection and diffraction with the little ""arrows"" (which are actually imaginary numbers represented in the complex plane. I wouldn't have figured that out if the person who wrote the intro hadn't pointed it out though). I often thought ""oh! so that's what's going on!"" and ""why on Earth didn't they teach it this way in school?"" Though it does seem deceptively simple when you read it, and I know that there is much more going on ""behind the curtain"" that only the physicists know about.The first 2 chapters are on QED (quantum electrodynamics): the first on photons, the second on electrons, and the third chapter is on quantum chromodynamics (ie. the strong force with quarks and co.). The theory of QED is one of the few (the only?) theory that's pretty much completely known in physics with regards to experiment aligning with theory. We see in the last chapter just how much of a ""mess"" particle physics is in general, though I found this last part really interesting. I think we have figured out more things to sort out the mess since this book has been written, but there are certainly still challenges to overcome.The diagrams in the book were simple and illustrative, and made me glad that I got the print copy as opposed to the audiobook (they were lectures, but I assume there must have been slides too, because you really need to see the diagrams).I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in science and especially physics. I wouldn't say it is a book for the ""general public"", since some parts might be a bit too complicated, but anyone with at least high school physics should have no problem (though I'm biased, since I'm doing physics at university, so I might be wrong about that). Although this was written (or rather, the lectures were given) many decades ago, it still forms the basis of our understanding of QED, and Feynman diagrams and the little arrows are still used in physics all the time.The only downside of the book is that since these were 3 lectures, they are split into 3 humungous chapters, and it would have been better to have smaller chapters. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this book and at the same time I could laugh out loud as well as learn lots as I read it."
26,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7031841-martin,4,"The guy that wrote the forward for the book seems to dislike Feynman from his personal experience and reputation. For example, he labels Feynman as a philanderer - which was a surprise to me as I was expecting a book more about physics than the physicist.Feynman is confident and flamboyant in his style, which is easy and enjoyable to read. He also seems exceptionally able to put himself into the mind of a non-expert and explain things appropriately.The book is based on 4 lectures explaining some 'strange' things about how photons and electrons interact. To compare its difficulty, I found it a lot easier than A Brief History of Time. I also found the first 3 lectures most enjoyable because Feynman slowly works through what he is explaining. The explanations for his figures are really helpful because they reiterate the main text explanations, which gives more opportunity to understand some of the crucial points.It was only in lecture 4 where he starts to try and cover the remaining 1% of physics that requires 20 times as many particles (I think that is how he expresses his aim for lecture 4), that the book becomes more like reading a physics exam guide with a little humour.Overall, Feynman has a very readable style and an amazing ability to explain complicated physics."
27,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1926890-shawn,3,"My biggest mistake here was reading this in small bursts. It was helpful to have things framed in layman's terms, but I still found myself not ""getting it"" at times, and I think that was probably because I was only reading it in short bursts and then not taking time to make sure I went back and really understood before forging onward. I did gain new insights and understanding into many details that were unknown to me about quantum electrodynamics, including some exposure to things like gluons, mesons, quarks, and such which I've heard of, but never really had much understanding of before. I think the reviews are high for this because the people likely to read this are physics majors and technical types--I think a broader sampling of non-technical readers would likely result in lower reviews because many people would still find it incomprehensible, despite Feynman's talent for making complex stuff understandable. If you are on the fence about reading this, consider browsing the Wikipedia entry on quantum electrodynamics which has a short section on ""Feynman's view of quantum electrodynamics."" It gives a short idea of what one will find in the book."
28,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8755528-siina,5,"I first read Ottaviani's biographical comic of Richard P. Feynman and that is how I got interested in quantum electrodynamics. I'm not really good when it comes to physics (I do love math), but light and lenses I have understood and enjoyed always. Thus getting my hands on this book was wonderful!Feynman explains quantum electrodynamics very clearly with a humorous twist. The book is logical and very well written altogether. The last chapter is the only somewhat hard part, since in that one Feynman tries to explain other fields of physics and how they interact with quantum electrodynamics. What makes it hard is that the chapter is short and just a peek. Feynman makes me believe that quantum electrodynamics is easy, but it tells more about Feynman's marvelousness than me. As a whole the book was amazing and I'm happy to have understood almost all - and let's face it, it's physics! "

And, of course, it's always a delight to spend time in the company of Richard Feynman, even if only as a reader. Judged against the many exceptional popular science books that have been published since, however, this one suffers in comparison. The subject matter is fascinating, the explication only so successful. The book is well worth reading, though, a) because its author was such a talented scientist and such a cool dude, b) because the author was himself a major contributor to the branch of physics it describes, and c) because the tack he takes is an unusual one for popular science treatments (and quite interesting).

I know that because I read the book very slowly and later on I even skipped some parts of the book. Nature is simple and very perplexing at the same time; And as Feynman said ""You see my physics students don't understand it... That is because I don't understand it"". LOL"

Instead, I read it primarily as a study in style and the clear expression of ideas, and on this front I wasn't disappointed. Widely praised for the clarity of his style, it felt effortless and welcoming, even to those — like me — who only have a vague knowledge of the outline of the theory. I came away thinking: ""why isn't writing in the humanities like this?""I confess that I began to get a bit hazy on the theory half-way through the second of the four lectures, and I found the specifics of the third lecture challenging. What I enjoyed about the book, though, was the sense that if I wanted to, I could re-read those sections, think about it, and I would be able to get a good handle of the complexities. I didn't feel that those sections were out of my reach, only that I needed to invest more time in grasping them. "

40,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18029970-bram-van-der-heijde,5,Actually this book should be ranked six stars or more. I have never read anything as inspiring and interesting as QED before. 
41,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40481325-bernardo,5,"In the beginning of QED, Richard Feynman says that people are always asking physicists about the new findings of a grand unified theory. He feels they should also be asked about known and confirmed theories instead of undercooked and partially analyzed ones. So he decides to speak about the “well dissected and marvelous” theory of QED. The theory describes the interactions between photos and electrons, space-time and probabilities, among others.The book is based on four conferences given by Richard Feynman in the 1980s. These were done in memory of a friend of his who had passed away, Alix Mautner. She had a career in english literature but was curious about physics and often asked him about quantum mechanics. He never had the chance to explain her the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED), for which he was awarded a Nobel prize (alongside Schwinger and Tomonoga), and which he described as “the jewel of physics”.It’s remarkable how much content there is in this book, having only 150 pages or so. The explanations are easy, illustrated with a great amount of examples and figures, and may seem too simple at times, until Feynman shows the grand picture and demonstrates how brilliant physics is. He had the ability to make topics which could be seen as too complex become accessible.I was delighted to read this book, as there aren’t many books for non-physicists that mention QED. Feynman’s mix of humour and humility just improves the experience.This is a wonderful book and one couldn’t ask for a better teacher than Feynman. He reminds us that physics can be fun and inspiring."
42,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18521921-r-strange,5,"When I look at the political landscape in my country today, it just seems as though complexity is simply too much for human beings to even deal. But somehow, we have been able to survive, a few more generations anyway, with this wedge of complexity inserted into the good old pie of life as usual. That increase in complexity comes down to getting to know nature Herself. Nature is a She when the extraordinary science explainer Richard Feynman writes. He gives you the sense that She cannot be easily not fully understood by the likes of any mortal, even if you are one of us who has spent many years studying some part of her. He makes it clear, that it's perfectly alright to get lost in the details. But he is also convincing, and rightly, that if we could grasp even a small part of it through our efforts, it would blow our minds. QED is a slim book, limited to four lectures, designed for those of us who did not study a subject that can really only be understood if you study it. He chose the topics carefully, late in his life, to just open a single manageable can of worms and try to show the wonder, and how far from intuition the truth really can be. I am one of those readers that is ready to dive in a little more. Like someone that knows a few words of Spanish and can understand it ok, but has never seriously sat down to study exactly how these people are saying the same exact things we are but in a way that doesn't make sense. And an appropriate analogy, many of us make huge assumptions about how different someone who speaks another language is, simply because our intuition is not able to pierce the format of the information we are presented with. I have watched all the science shows on TV, and as I get older, I am trying to set aside some time to actually sit down with some scratch paper, and maybe just pick up a few of these wonders I've heard about, and really try to grasp the evidence, that they say is there for anyone that looks, but is so far from easy! I know the rules of nature are there, and the outcomes of them are detected by my senses everyday, but the rules just never make the front page of... well, our shared reality as human beings. These things they are finding make our reality, but about which we are more or less clueless, have really changed what it means to understand. There's understand, as in repeating what someone else is saying, which is more like being a parrot in terms of understanding. And there's understand, as grasping the proofs that convince all serious scientists completely no matter their country or language, because they are... proof! The most harmful politicians today argue about whether or not proven science is real, maybe just to protect some fossil fuel lawyers from liability they fudge the most basic statistics regarding global tempurature, or maybe just to get an angry mob going. So someone with that thick a head is not going to be interested in how we as humanity have taken certain mysteries about how Nature actually works, from three decimal places in accuracy, to six or seven, in one lifetime. But it is a big deal, and Feynman manages to lightly let on about that as perhaps more wondrous, than why glass only reflects one to four percent of light back, and never more no matter how much you change the thickness! This is actually a more astounding discovery by newton, in my opinion, than gravity, it's so weird! And so not clarifying, or reassuring... it just is. It is simply truth. Starting as a fresh graduate in Los Alamos serving during wartime, he's one of the good ones that turned beatnik, and generously devoted some of himself to the daunting task of trying to relate to the public that the real basics about our universe... are so complicated and not tidy, that it takes years just to be ready to talk about light.So, knowing all this, all I wanted was to have a few big Aha! moments, a few things to remind me that the nature of reality is itself mysterious, and big, and not at all as simple as my senses and my brain make it out to be. Maybe I needed this service, because I felt like I was losing some of my grip in terms of being up to speed with where we really are - no matter how many people want to yell and shout and send us back in time when the class quiz was easier... we really are uncovering astounding things and that sense of mystery makes life more tolerable somehow. He did not disappoint. Have you ever heard that nothing can go faster than the speed of light? It's not true - light can go faster or slower than the speed of light. And when it does... it turns in a particular direction! Indeed, particles and electrons and all that tiny stuff that makes up everything liquid, solid and airy, most of it has a habit of turning this way or that whenever it interacts, and swelling and shrinking a bit is also not uncommon, like a super tiny infinitely complex pinball machine that makes up... everything! So when a 'beam' of light moves through the atoms that make up the invisible air... it is really hitting electrons which will just absorb it, and then possibly, spit out a new photon heading in the same direction! And so something as simple as a little beam of light travelling a tiny distance, could be doing it in a million different possible ways with no way to predict it, because it is so beyond complicated! We really do occupy this priveleged perspective, where things seem mechanical, and clunky and solid, water pours, stone is heavy, air is transparent... but the truth, the Truth as in Natural truth... is simply beyond even the smartest brain's ability to estimate, and a computer can only estimate probability. One rock, seemingly dead and lifeless, is actually jam packed with spinning, turning, absorbing, light emitting electrons! It is heavy, because it is so packed with moving energy!And I really need this right now, when people are so committed to making us confused, and stuck, making us miss this miraculous realities we are translating into our limited languages, just so we will obey their lust for concentrating our attention into short term power, turning us all into rocks they can throw. I got four... four WOWs from this book. I can't promise I understood even a quarter of it perfectly, clearly, the way a student of physics can. But it's not a gloss, it's not cheap or just a tourist brochure, he really did try to be plain, and clear, about how complicated just one little piece of the rules of the universe - that of light - really is. It's wonderful, it grounds my sense of reality - that there is such a thing as Truth, and pretty much anything we think or feel or sense, especially anything that can be said in only one sentence... is more like whistling a little tune (or passing wind) than making even a flake of the reality of Nature better known, as it has come down to us today, clearer than it has ever been in history, but with so far still to go.Science is the main reason why going back is just ridiculous and willfully ignorant. It's like saying you'd like to go back to when you didn't know that touching a hot burner on the stove would hurt. Who would want to know the world less, to have our experts be less knowledgeable less skilled, to be more in the dark, when we have so many things to get right still, and so many problems yet to resolve?"
43,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6079835-juno,5,"Renowned physicist Richard Feynman had promised for years to explain quantum electrodynamics to Alix Mautner, whose degree was in English literature. When she died, he finally sat down and put together this sequence of four lectures — and he did it, somewhat miraculously — without any of the mind-bogglingly complex equations that are so intimidating even to the most math-hardened of graduate students. Indeed, Feynman explains quantum electrodynamics purely conceptually, making me wonder why we don't teach it to children in junior high.My one wish is that someone had made me read this book before I took quantum back in college, because for the first time I truly felt like I understood the calculations my professor tried to teach me.Do not be deceived: this is not a book ""merely for an English major to understand science."" Feynman is explicit about when he is leaving out information, and he doesn't misrepresent anything. I read this book because I thought it would help me with my own research, and it has. The miracle of QED is that it would serve practically anyone else just as well, scientist or not.The first three chapters are mainly about light and quantum theory — and explicitly neglect discussions of polarization. The fourth chapter ties quantum electrodynamics into particle physics, introducing quarks and discussing polarization somewhat briefly.Three complaints come to mind with this book. Firstly, I wish Feynman had included information about polarization — perhaps in footnotes. Secondly, the figure captions are sometimes redundant, and one has to flip back and forth between text and appropriate figures (this objection may concern only the specific edition I read). Thirdly, I want more.I rarely dispense five-star ratings, but QED has earned it. All hail Feynman."
44,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8537537-scott-weeks,5,"Richard Feynman famously had an artist friend who took him, and all scientists, to task, for removing the beauty from nature by reducing things to mere physical processes and thereby making them dull. Feynmann thinks this is kind of nutty, viewing the complicated actions inside as having an intrinsic beauty all their own, arguing that scientific knowledge only adds to the excitement, mystery, and awe of nature. In QED, Feynman ably supports his thesis in a series of four lectures on quantum electrodynamics, or the interaction of light and electrons. Written for and delivered to a non-scientific audience, Feynman leads the thoughtful reader on a tour of how light works. Starting with the introduction, we learn about reflection and refraction, then in the next lecture we move on to why light reflects and refracts. Chapter three is about electrons and their interactions (electrons and photons behave identically, so by studying electrons we can understand photons, which are particles of light) including the famous two-hole experiment, which counterintuitively shows that light can be either a particle or a wave, depending on what observation you make with it. The book ends with an exploration of subatomic particles and their interactions with each other-quarks, gluons, particle spin, etc- for me personally, the most interesting chapter in a very interesting book.Read this book, think about the concepts explained, and see if you don't start to find excitement, mystery, and awe in something as simple as turning on a light switch. The beauty is in the details."
45,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47610637-sean-yuan,4,"QED, by Richard Feynman, a distinguished theoretical physicist, introduces the quantum world to the layman gently but effectively and accurately. Within his first lecture, he briefly introduces key concepts of QED, such as taking the square of an amplitude to find a probability, or the way that photons behave in the presence of electrons. This acts as a fairly succinct chapter introducing a mindset necessary for the comprehension of more advanced materials, which follow, in the later lectures. In his second and third lectures, he applies the previously demonstrated concepts to an example, the reflection of light from a pane of glass, as well as introducing new concepts, such as Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, as well as constructive and destructive interference. In his final lecture, titled “Loose Ends”, he connects quantum electrodynamics to the rest of physics, tying in concepts such as the strong and weak forces, as well as discussing the meaning of quantum electrodynamics, and some of its problems, I enjoyed this book thoroughly, as it was written in a simple manner, while still being able to explain complex concepts. I would recommend it to anyone curious about the subject matter, as it serves as an excellent introduction to the quantum world, giving the reader a good idea of what to expect if they should further pursue the subject, while still being appropriate for an introduction to quantum physics."

Those of you who have heard the other two lectures will also find this lecture incomprehensible, but you know that that's alright: as I explained in the first lecture, the way we have to describe Nature is generally incomprehensible to us."""
47,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49167160-joseph-mirabelli,5,"I haven't written my rating for a book in a time, but my experience in QED this week was interesting enough to discuss publicly. As the young graduate physicist, the most fun challenge of the book ended up moving metaphoric language onto things that (to a young graduate physicist) are conceptually simple while describing mathematics that (still to a young graduate physicist - gonna get down on that renormalization this fall) are mostly foreign. I knew enough to get paused by the actual mechanics of ""clockworks"" in the ""arrows"" defining amplitudes, but in general haven't treated sums of probability amplitudes in a way that makes them as intuitive as they so clearly were for Feynman - I was definitely not the intended audience for QED, which initially obscured what some of the metaphors were doing. Regardless, this was a beautifully and concisely presented set of lectures on an incredible topic, and after a bit of mediation, still holds as a great way to introduce any quantum field theory or solidify it for _any learner._ The final chapter was as brilliant an explanation as it was a solid history. Non-fiction rarely makes one smile and laugh, especially on something so esoteric. Friends, sorry to fill my feed with only physics books this summer; I've got the qualifying exam and triple research duty this summer, so I'm only reading physics, the pretty and the gritty. "
48,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8701392-jo-o-melo,5,"This is hands down the most simple (and accurate!) explanation I've ever seen of Quantum Electrodynamics. This is a very complicated topic (usually at a level of a master's degree in physics) but Feynman finds a very clever way to simplify it down so that anyone can understand. It's not a very light reading since the arguments can be somewhat involved (but it is quite short) but the consequence is that someone who has none or very little mathematical background can completely follow the discussion, and even more importantly that discussion is precise. I am myself a physicist and can tell you that the concepts he introduced are exactly how we think about this stuff, we just use a more efficient language.The only downside of this book is the final lecture. It is quite outdated since it was written in the 80's. We now have a full understanding of the ""hocus pocus"" of renormalisation. And also we have completed the picture of the Standard Model with the finding of the Higgs boson. However, it is in no sense misleading. What he says is absolutely correct, he even mentions that physicist at that time were confused about it. It's just that now have a better understanding of most of what he talked about in the last lecture (although there's is still plenty of stuff that confuses modern physicists)."
49,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23893690-duncan,5,"QED is a book about quantum electrodynamics, which may sound complex, but with Richard Feynman teaching, its much easier to learn. This book covers basically what quantum electrodynamics is--the interaction of light with charged particles. However instead of advanced mathematics and complex words, Feynman uses the famous Feynman diagrams and other visualizations to explain things. This is a great read for anyone interested in physics, and if you fall into that category, you should read other Feynman books and lectures.If Feynman taught every physics class in the world it would be considered as easy as addition and subtraction. He manages to explain things that sometimes can take a whole semester of a college class in one short 175 page book. Anything from quantum electrodynamics and photons to basic physics equations is simple to learn with him teaching. Not to say its all easy, it does require some serious foreknowledge of the subject matter to read this book. The most amazing thing of all is this book doesn't even contain one equation, because Feynman explains everything so well it is unnecessary for the reader."

All nice, those arrows and amplitudes, but I'm left unknowing of how to exactly interpret that amplitude. What is its meaning? All that follows is interesting and mind-blowing even: Light does not *per se* move in a straight line! Light is reflected of a mirror in *all* directions!Light can go slower or faster than, well, the speed of light (Einstein's still right tho)And consequently, stuff is moving backwards in time all the time.But a full understanding thereof? No.Maybe the fact that this is a lecture transcript rather than a book has something to do with it. I'd undoubtedly go to a Feynman Seminar if I had the chance - once I figure out how to do that antimatter trick of moving backwards in time."

This is where Feynman is the clearest about the mysterious nature of the how 98% of the universe works: through the interaction of photons and electrons. Feynman walks us through the experiments and calculations that show how to use quantum mechanics. It was so exciting and led to many hushed and hurried conversations with coworkers. If encourage anyone to read the first two chapters to have their minds blown and the last couple chapters to know what it's like to sit in an advanced physics course you don't understand! Lol.

This is an easy to read and understand book on a very difficult subject. Feynman is excellent at describing how light and matter interact without talking down to the reader. The humor is great. The concepts are clearly explained and one can easily look them up to get a better understanding. I loved his explanation of ""renormalization"" and description of ""magic numbers"" like 137.03597. Feynman does a good job explaining the Standard Model's success with providing experimental predictions and still explains some of the limitations. This was a joy to read and rediscover some physics along the way. "

Even if you're not terribly interested in physics I might suggest it just to get a better understanding of how to explain difficult ideas without the jargon and get to the heart of the matter.

68,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"Quantum ElectroDynamics (QED).The book is supposed to be good for lay readers, those who plan to study physics (you don't have to unlearn anything), and those who have already studied physics.Many books distort science by simplifying it, this is supposed to not do that.The book is based on four lectures that were given by Feynman in 1983.It is about the part of science that we know really well and not half baked theories.History of unification in physics. Motion, sound and heat. Electricity, magnetism, light and optics. Birth of QM in 1926. QED is really a unification of QM and EM, it is a quantum theory of the interactions of light and matter. Faced infinities in 1929 (infinite probabilities - nonsense).Paul Dirac relativistic theory of the electron led to infinities too. It was fixed by Feynman, Tomonaga ans Schwinger in 1948.QED tested for over 50 years. Theory matches experiment for up to 10 digits!QED is ""the jewel of physics - our proudest possession"".Geeting clear with terms etc to avoid confusion (e.g. work in physics means something different).""The theory of quantum electrodynamics describes nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And it agrees fully with experiment. So I hope you can accept Nature as she is - absurd.""QED is usually taught (in Feynman days at least) to 3rd year graduate students, that 7 years into college (4 undergraduate then 3 graduate).No body knows why Nature behaves in its ways (laws of nature), there are no good theories to explain that.The story of Light. Newton. Red light can actually be further split using polarization, but that would not be covered here. EM spectrum. Newton thought light was made of particles which he called corpuscles - now they're known as photons.Five to six photons can trigger the eye nerve cells [In The Fabric of Reality, Deutch mentions that frogs' eyes only need 1 photon to activate their nerve cells].Light is truely made out of particles and not waves. The wave-particle duality was due to some confusion (some say we're still confused about that).Reflection of light. Light actually interacts with the whole of glass thickness and not merely its surfaces, but this simplification is accurate.How we explain partial reflection if light is a particle. We cannot predict the result of a single photon, only the probability.""Nature permits us to calculate only probabilities.""Single and double surface partial reflection thought experiments. Lead to strange results in the double surface one. Reflection depends on the thickness of the glass, in a strange and not linear way (single is 4%, double is not 8% - it is a rsnge from 0 to 16), it is cyclical, just like waves, sometimes contructive interference (16% reflection), and sometimes destructive interference (0% reflection), and mostly in between. Wave-particle duality confusion came out of such results, and author will tell us how this problem was resolved.In QED we only get probabilities.Explains technical stuff about arrows and how to add them. [This approach -sum over all paths- really do make sense, I think this interpretation of QM is probably the true one.]Photon reflection and imaginary stoo watch single arrow direction. Combine arrows and then square the final arrow to get the probability of reflection.*Probability Amplitude: The arrow whose square representd the probability of something happening.These cycles from 0 to 16% are different for different colors (e.g. red and blue), because the light with higher frequency has shorter wave lengths (by definition high frequency = faster cycles).*Iridescence: The phenomenon of colors produced by the partial reflection of white light by two surfaces. Hummingbirds and Peecocks use this.Lecture 2: Photons - Particles of light.There is no good model for how probability happens [does this mean he doesn't think his sum over all paths is a good one? does this include the many worlds interpretation?]How does his sum over all paths translates to the simple properties of light such the equivalence of the angle of incidence and reflection, light bending in water etc?Draw all paths. Arrows pointing at some direction have similar speed. When we sum all arrows, we get the typical reflection. The sum over all paths is true and holds, especially in diffraction grating mirrors which are scratched to be biased toward one side. This shows we can't ignore the parts of mirror which cancel out in normal mirrors (i. e. all paths should be taken into consideration).Applies to bending of light in the same manner too. Explains how sum over all paths shows light as goong in straight lines. Explains double slit experiment and interference with the sum over all paths. He says if you just add the arrows, there is no need for an uncertainty principle! [big claim].Shows how sum over all paths explain how a focusing lens work.Multiplying arrows. You add when it can be done in alternative ways and multiply the complex numbers when there is a succession of steps.You also multiply for an event that consists of a number of things happening concomitantly- independently and possibly simultaneously.Lecture 3: Electrons and their interactionsReminder about previous lecture. The double slit strangeness [look: particles, don't look: waves]. Explains this by saying we should look at ""the complete event"" when we have different final coditions or states. Then we should add the probabilities of each event (probability and not amplitude).Having half reliable detectors leads to a mixure result. With interference it's 0 to 4%, with perfect detectors it's 2%, but with half reliable detectors it's 1 to 3% (mixture), with more reliable detectors it's 1.5 to 2.5% and so on, essentially interference is reduced.Electrons behave like photons too. Electrons and the atom.3 basic actions, 1. photons move from place to place. 2. Electrons move from place to place. 3. Electrons emit and absorb photons.Over short distances light can sometimes travel faster or slower than the speed of light! This taken with the previous assertion that light doesn't always travel in straight lines are astonishing!The first of Feynman diagrams begin with electron photon interactions. A photon going back in time - a virtual photon.Scattering of light. An electron going back in time is a positron. Diagram for electron in an atom; really complicated.Partial reflection is truly light scattering by the electrons in atoms of material. Explains the details of this and why the front surface, back surface simplification is correct.Simulated emission and how LASERs work. Electrons, unlike photons cannot occupy the samw space, this is called the ""exclusion principle"".This is why electrons have orbits which can get full 2-8-8 etc. The further electrons interact weaker (exchange less photons) with the protons and are easier to lose.The magnatic moment of an electron. Diagrams get wild as more complexity is introduced.So from just three basic actions we get all the laws of physics. J, E(A to B) and P(A to B).Polarization, in 4 directions (X, Y, Z and T). Photons polarization remains the same when moving from a point to point, while that of electrons can change between 4 states (1, 2, 3, 4), therefore there are in total 16 possible combinations.Polarizations are like spin 0, spin 1/2, spin 1, spin 3/2, spin 2 and so on. Electrons are spin 1/2 and photons are spin 1, each has 4 components. Spin 2 particles have 10 components.Lecture 4: Loose Ends.[Here Feynman leans towards instrumentalism and says the meaning of QED is not important and only matching experiment result is important.]The values of j and n. The ability to calculate with QED without infinities (renormalization).Questions on the source of the coupling constant of the electron and ts mystery.The nuclear forces. Their discovery. Over 400 particles discovered with high energy experiments. Quarks and Quantum Chromo-Dynamics. Baryons = 3 quarks, Mesons = quark and anti-quark pair.[The fundamental particles table he presents is incomplete; this was probably before the birth of the standard model.] [He mentiones the remaining particles later].Charge is the coupling constant -j. Quarks do exchange photons, as they have a charge, but gluons are what keep them together. Gluons and Photons are spin 1 particles. The coupling constant of quarks is g and it is much larger than j.Feynman diagrams for quarks and gluons are very similar to those for electrons and photons. The polarization of quarcks is known as ""color"": R, G or B. In total they are eight types. They can change when emitting or absorbing a gluon. A ""red anti-green gluon"" can be emitted by a red quark which will change its color to green and the other green quark color to red.Gluons can interact with each other too.Unlike QED, QCD has a huge margin of error 10% (QED is 1 in 10 Billion).Baryons and Mesons are color neutral.Beta Decay, a nuetron decays into a proton, an electron and anti-neutrino. This means that ine down quark changes into and up quark. (neutrinos are 1/2 spin particles). The down quark emits a W+ intermediate boson. W+ is a spin 1 particle, it has a charge of -1, is very heavy (80GeV) and can couple with neutrinos which are otherwise massless and chargeless.There is a W+ and a W- which is its anti-particle. Z0 particle. These can couple with up and down quarks on one hand, and with photons and neutrinos on the other. Weinberg and Abdus Salam worked on the weak interaction theory.Feynman doesn't think that QCD and the Weak interaction theories are complete or smooth in the same manner QED is.Mentiones the heavier partices such as Muons (heavy electron) and mu-neutrinos. Strange and Charm quarks can interact with W (-1) in the same manner as up and down quarks do.Tau and tau-neutrino. [Apparently the Bottom quark was at first known as Beauty.] He hints at yet another quark to be found [it was found in ~1995, the Top quark.]What causes this repitition of spin 1/2 particles (i.e. fermions) is ""a complete mystery"".Up can change to charm, and down can change to strange. W ""screws things up"" and allows this to happen.[The only 2 particles not mentioned yet are the Higgs boson and the graviton.]Despite all of this mess, it is much less than before. Science moves towards more and more unification.Reflection on the need of a new grand unification and the state of his day theories. Speculates that scientists are either narrow minded and want everything to fit the QED model, or that Nature just repeats itself or that there is an underlying reality for all of the theories we have (which requires a grand theory).Why gravitation force is different. Only attractive [what about repulsive gravity such as Dark Energy or Cosmological constant?]. No theories of Quantum gravity and no experiments to test them.In QED masses of the particles remain a mystery. This is the most unsatisfactory feature in it.The author is not afraid to go into some technical details, which I like very much since I read too many popular science books and was planning to start reading the Feynman Lectures on Physics when I saw this book mentioned in the intro - I think this is one of the few Feynman books which I still didn't finish already.He explains stuff really clearly and uses examples and thought experiments. He makes stuff easier to understand without dumping down the scientific content or distorting it.في بعض الكتب العلمية كانوا يذكرون طريقة فاينمان في ""جمع كل الطرق الممكنة"" The sum over all possible paths لتفسير الظواهر الغريبة في ميكانيكا الكم، بس في هذا الكتاب أول مرة أفهمها. أحس هذا التفسير أضبط من تفسير كوبنهاجن أو الأكوان المتعددةWinderful book. Deepened my understanding of Quantum Theory. Next is Feynman Lectures on Physics."
69,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103928336-aneesh-s,4,"That which was to be demonstrated⋯to anyone with a basic knowledge of physics.In his book, QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter (1985), Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize-winning Physicist, takes on the challenging task of explaining the relatively new theory of Quantum Electro Dynamics (QED) to ""newbies."" He aims to accomplish his task using non-technical language and without using mathematical calculations. He explains the theory of Quantum Electrodynamics through a series of four lectures. In the first lecture, Feynman introduces the concept of light composed of particles and the experimental set up for measuring light using a detector that makes clicks when light hits it. He then proceeds to explain the phenomenon of partial reflection of light using QED. In the second lecture, he continues to explain phenomena of light, such as refraction and reflection of light. The third lecture explains how photons interact with subatomic particles. The fourth lecture and final lecture Feynman explains how QED applies to the different branches of physics except for gravity and nuclear physics.Feynman uses a 1st person point of view and a friendly and casual conversational tone to put ""newbies"" at ease. He sticks to his promise of using non-technical terms to describe the concepts of Quantum Electro Dynamics. His deliberate word choice is evident right from the title. The double meaning of the abbreviation QED, as an abbreviation of the Latin expression ""quod erat demonstrandum,"" which means ""that which was to be demonstrated"" and also the acronym of Quantum Electro Dynamics, which he proves as the go-to theory by his demonstration of natural phenomena. Through an ingenious use of the stopwatch needle to explain vector direction, he illustrates the concept of vector addition. He uses simple figures and diagrams to illustrate the concepts and his explanations of the phenomenon. Feynman's approach is effective, and one can understand natural phenomena such as the rainbow you see when you put a CD under light. However, at the midway point, as the complexity of the concepts increases exponentially, Feynman's resolve to keep things simple seems to weaken.To spare the novice physicists, he tells the readers to make several assumptions without offering any explanations at the cost of making the readers not truly understand QED. Readers beware! This book is for people who are interested in science and physics and are willing to make an effort to process the information. This book is not a 'page-turner.' However, at four chapters and 150 pages, reading it can be accomplished slowly and steadily by the motivated. The book is a daring attempt at explaining the complex theory of Quantum Electrodynamics to people who may not have any background knowledge in Physics. That is a stretch. However, in the first two chapters, Feynman succeeds in explaining the concepts to people who have a basic understanding of physics. The last two chapters of the book would only be apparent to someone above an intermediate level of expertise. In spite of a beginner not easily comprehending the last two sections of the book, the author succeeds in evoking curiosity and a desire to learn more. Therefore, I strongly recommend this book to science lovers. "
70,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46832462-puneet-gautam,4,"This book is a good introduction to anyone who wants to learn how some of the basic things in Quantum Mechanics, specifically Quantum Electro Dynamics, work. It helps that the book is a series of lectures given by the pioneer of the field - Dr. Richard Feynman. The first lectures takes the reflection of light as the basis for explaining how probabilities work at the tiniest level of Universe. He explains why the photons, which theoretically have all possible ways to go from point A to B, follow the path that we actually observe. It was a great delight to read these explanations. While reading about QM and QED, I always wondered what the probabilities and amplitudes meant. Some of the things did get clarified.The explanations do become more complex from there on. I understood probably 20% of what the author was explaining, and I'd definitely revisit the contents of the book regularly in future. I didn't understand much about the underlying principles that govern QED, mostly because even the physicists who are working in this field don't understand much about the underlying principles governing QED. We have very accurate experimental proof subatomic behaviour- like their mass and spin, but there is still no theory that can accurately explain all the observed phenomenon.Dr. Feynman has himself called out this limitation multiple times in the book. He goes on the explain the Standard Model of Elementary Particles, but even this model is riddled with holes and is far from providing a complete picture of microscopic world. However, it was worthwhile to know what fundamental particles are currently part of the Standard Model and how they fit into experiments and observations.A good book and recommended only for people who want to dig just a little deeper into knowing what Quantum Electo Dynamics actually stands for in the eyes of a physicist."
71,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22925176-jeroen-bos-mulder,5,"This book is about quantum electrodynamics, the theory which describes how light and matter interact on the smallest scales.As can be expected from any book by Richard Feynman, this book is a joy to read. Feynman manages to explain in clear layman's terms why it seems that light travels by straight lines, how light reflects from surfaces, why it behaves wave-like and how light-particles interact with electrons. In the final part of the book he concludes with an appetizer on the so-called quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is the theory of the (strong) interaction between even more exotic particles.Feynman takes the reader by the hand starting with simple examples and step-by-step advance on those examples pointing out the strangeness of the theory when scales or distances get very, very small. It would not make sense to summarise here what is so perfectly described in his book, best is to read it yourself.However I want to mention the main take-out for me, which is that the principle of least (or better stationary) action in fact is just a mere estimation of a more advanced approach, which is really mind blowing. That is that for a particle travelling from A to B, it is not enough to consider only shortest path taken by the particle, but one has to consider all possible paths between A and B. For each of those paths, one has to compute some complex-valued contribution, the so-called probability amplitude. Then one has to add all these amplitudes, Feynman’s little arrows, together resulting in an overall probability amplitude. And finally square the absolute value of this probability amplitude to obtain the probability that a particle shows up at B. The mind-blowing part is that the particle seems to be not at one spot only, but ""is there"" all over the place. In case paths are very close and similar to each other they will reinforce each other, which leads as approximation to the principle of stationary action.It looks complicated, it is complicated, but has some beautiful applications explaining the strange behaviour of both light and matter.As I said, read it yourself."
72,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94715583-stargazer,5,"What a wonderful world.Do you enjoy wondering about the world around you? About why rainbow patterns appear on a wet road? How mirrors really work? Why the sky is blue? It is all related to light. And as it turns out, it can all be explained by tiny arrows. Yes, really. In QED Feynman talks about the interactions between light and matter. These interactions form a central core, when it comes to explaining the world around us. And this core of the (light and) matter is truly more weird and wonderful that most people would have imagined.The book provides a remarkably good understanding of the probability calculations used in quantum electrodynamics given that no mathematics is used. The arrows framework is illustrated by using a simplified example and gradually adding more factors, which need to go into the probability calculations. This is a pedagogical way of building up the understanding of the reader. Feynman’s knowledge, enthusiasm for his subject and his wicked sense of humour bounces off the pages, which makes the book, if not an easy then at least a pleasurable read. But whereas the ‘how’ is covered well, we are still left in the dark when it comes to ‘why’ and ‘what does it all mean’. Quantum physics literally spits in the eye of common sense (to quote Peter Grant from Whispers Under Ground) and most people would lift an eyebrow or two before accepting observations such as: -	Light does not always travel in straight lines, nor does it always travel with the speed of light-	Electrons can time travel!-	When we try to control light, it goes crazy-	Particles act so weird, we can’t even interpret what goes on, but whenever we try to narrow down the mystery and measure the particles the weird behaviour disappears Equally puzzling is the fact that Feynman’s arrows / amplitudes framework works to perfection, but we have no clue how it relates to reality.  But as Feynman says: ‘You can have all the philosophical worries you want as to what amplitudes mean (if, indeed they mean anything at all), but because physics is an experimental science and the framework agrees with experiment, it’s good enough for us so far’. Q.E.D."
73,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3902172-rachel,4,"Feynman is a brilliant teacher. I understand some physics concepts in a way I’ve never understood them before. Especially the stuff from the first lecture. I started to lose focus a bit half way through, but I blame that on my internet semi-addiction. (When the wifi is gone, I’m often able to focus on reading stuff like this quite a bit better.)Anyway, here’s a couple parts I liked:—How he says the history we learn is all wrong (pg 6), and really just a myth-story we tell ourselves. Very true, and more people would do well to remember this.—I remember doing calculations with arrows like this. It was boring at the time. It would have been so much more interesting with all this background to it.—Apparently there is no need for the uncertainty principle when you go at things the right way (pg 55-6). I had no idea, and found this fascinating. (Although also a bit sad, because I loved how cool and mysterious the uncertainty principle was.)—The wave-particle duality stuff is not just for light but for ALL particles. (Pg 85)—Light can actually travel faster than the speed of light! (Pg 89)—Particles travel backwards in time!!! What?!?!!! (Pg 98)He also says that the question of why a photon “decides” to do one thing vs another probably has no meaning. I don’t understand that. Does he mean he thinks it’s impossible to ever know? Or ... what?Anyway, great book. If I have a smart kid, I’ll recommend it to them in high school when they’re learning about this stuff the boring way."

It explains almost everything that we notice in our day-to-day lives - ranging from why you see your image in a mirror, to more esoteric effects such as predicting which particles arise during extremely high-energy collisions (such as in the Large Hadron Collider).It is a marvel to witness a genius at work. Without any Math whatsoever, Feynman explains the theory while not leaving out any detail - where it works, where it doesn't work, and how our understanding of Physics is still pitiful, because every answer that we find brings a whole lot of questions to the fore.The fourth chapter is on our understanding of Physics so far, and where QED fits in - it is a tonal mess, especially when compared to the succinct previous chapters, and it is the only time I felt disgruntled when reading the book.TL;DR - an amazing read to reinvigorate interest in Physics/science, or to ignite the spark of interest that was never there in the first place. Either way, it is a must-read for the inquisitive mind."
75,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25040726-brian,5,"After reading this book, I was (and still am) utterly amazed by the theory of QED. Dr. Feynman presents the book in a very lucid and humble way, considering the complexities that are embedded within his text.I use QED rather often when working with light-matter interactions, yet I am still baffled at how much there is that I don't understand about the subject (something that I always have to deal with in physics). In fact, I am surprised I haven't read this book sooner (probably because of the predisposition in my mind that ""popular science"" books don't provide much insight and depth for those working in the field). Regardless, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has the slightest interest in the nature of light and its interaction with matter. This is definitely a challenging book if one wants to fully grasp the subtleties, but regardless is still enjoyable to those who are interested.Just a note: In one of the pages near the end, Feynman states that a neutrino has no mass. This has been experimentally shown to be false; it just has a really small mass!"
76,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7616493-guilherme,5,"A miracle. In 150 breezy pages or so, Feynman presents one of the most amazing physical theories without sacrificing any rigor. I mean that. The physics is all here, as far as I can tell. What is missing are the tools necessary to calculate these problems.Feynman was smart, yes, but more importantly, he truly loved and respected his fellows humans (or as he would say, yoomans). He recognized that understanding something was hard, but deeply rewarding. More importantly, he believed that anyone could grasp this stuff, if they were willing to sit down and put some effort into it. As a working physicist, I can tell you that this has become an exceedingly rare opinion amongst us.With the exception of some of Albert Einstein's works and Geroch's wonderful (but drier) General Relativity from A to B, I know of no other ""popular"" physics text that treats its audience with so much respect."
77,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/120208210-lauren-dill,5,"During the coronavirus lockdown during summer, I had a lot of spare time on my hands to read. I knew that I wanted to read a scientific book, but the problem was that I didn't quite want to read another pop-science book, and I certainly wasn't in the mood for a textbook. So, I chose a book that is a perfect combination of both pop-science and educational science literature: QED by Richard Feynman. One of my favorite scientific theories of all time is probably Quantum Electrodynamics, and while I knew the equations for the theory, I didn't really have a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms this theory held. QED helped fill those gaps in my understanding by brilliantly explaining the connections made by Richard Feynman to create his theory of quantum electrodynamics. This book is perfect for someone that is more advanced in science than the average pop-science reader, but not quite at the college or textbook level of quantum mechanics yet. This book is can be useful for those just curious about the quantum nature of light and matter, and those who study it professionally. Overall, one of my favorite books by one of my favorite physicists."
78,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62674548-lee-kranefuss,5,"Unbelievably good book that explains an enormously complex and unintuitive theoryFeynman had a rare ability to explain things. I worked in nuclear physics research (but am an electrical engineer) and various people tried to give me a gloss of QED. Why they didn’t just give me this book is a mystery. Feynman explains how to do all the phase and related calculations using geometry (little arrows). I can’t say if that is enough if you don’t have some clue what is really happening. If you have a math/engineering background, it’s pretty easy to see this is just complex addition and multiplication on objects of the form exp(it) where i is the square root of -1. The way he explains this is itself as fascinating as the actual content.If you are impressed with Feyman’s approach, you might like Lakoff’s book “Where Mathematics Comes From”. He makes an amazing argument that essentially all math is just a clever series of imagination tricks using our ability to count, measure, and imagine rotating things in our heads. "
79,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38729994-john-dee,4,"Am not a physics student, but am interested in anything to do with the quantum world. Feynman is very good at simplifying scientific concepts so that laymen like me can understand. The book itself is neatly set and edited, here and there I could see how science was nudging close to philosophy now and then or that's how it felt for me personally at certain instances. The only bewildering aspect of the book is, the theoretical physicists ignored or altered certain behavioural aspects (like spin or charge) of the electrons and other such subatomic particles to suit a particular result that they worked out on paper. These theories that are proved experimentally might turn out to be varying with the supposed theoretical calculation if they changed the environment or include all the behaviours of the subatomic particles. I doubt if the theory and calculations can hold to the test of time and doubt completely the way experiments where done to obtain certain results."
80,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21158516-ron-joniak,3,"This book is read as a four lecture series given to the reader by the great Richard Feynman.The first two lectures focus on a conceptual system of arrows and stop watches used to measure the probability that a photon ends up in certain areas of space and time. While this conceptual technique is useful and perhaps even beautiful, I didn't learn too much as I learn more from deep mathematics.The third lecture introduces electrons into the picture and how they emit and absorb photons. This was similar to the first two lectures and continued the process here.The fourth lecture was the best one for me as it showcased the problems QED faces and also introduced a basic model of particles. I learned quite a bit from this fourth lecture.Overall it was worth my time and I enjoyed Feynman's teaching style. I just wish there was a little bit more 'there' in the first two lectures. Perhaps it went over my head. "
81,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64575113-charles-remington,5,"A brilliantly presented work on a complex subject by a consummate communicator. I found the information accessible and for a layman explained in such a clear way as to be astounding. Feynman resists the temptation to boggle his audience with complex equations and oblique metaphors concentrating instead on honesty and clarity. When science is unable to answer a particular conundrum he simply states that the answer is not known. My favourite passage in the whole book and to me what made reading QED worthwhile was this: I have pointed out these things because the more you see how strangely Nature behaves, the harder it is to make a model that explains how even the simplest phenomena actually work. So theoretical physics has given up on that.I found this short statement strangely comforting."
82,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9498305-william-adams,3,"I have read this classic little book twice and I still don't understand it, not completely. I understand Feynman's descriptions, but I have fundamental questions that prevent me from feeling that his explanations are adequate. For example, how does light reflect from a mirror? We say that light ""bounces"" from the mirror, but that cannot be literally correct since photons have no mass. Something that has no mass cannot bounce. This in turn raises the question of why everything in our experience is not transparent. Actually, if everything were transparent, we would have no visual experience anyway. I'm sure these questions are ""stupid,"" a product of my inadequate education in quantum physics, but the book is touted as a guide for beginners. I am apparently not even at the level of a beginner."

There is also a deeper analysis of the actual coupling interactions that are occuring to allow these macroscopic properties to be observed. It involves simply accepting the strange wave-particle behaviour of photons and electrons, and understanding that light doesn't necessarily travel in straight lines!Furthemore the necessity of 'renormalisation', a mathematical trick, is explained, and there is also discussion of the other fundamental forces; the strong and weak forces, as well as quarks and bosons other than the photon.Feynman's articulate style certainly makes this book enjoying to read, and this style is complemented by his good humour!"
84,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61270308-vincent-ho,5,"Easy read on the topic of QED! Instead of portraying daunting equations, Feynman uses an analogy of a spinning arrow and stopwatch to explain abstraction such as complex number and wave function. I find myself breezing through this book quite quickly as I already know a little about particle interaction and duality nature of light. After finish reading it, I have become more confident with those topic and have learnt some new things as well. One thing that I don't really like about this book is the lack of scientific terminology. As Feynman attempts to simplify the ideas, he often misses the topic of the subject out, leaving readers with little clues to cling on if they want to dig deeper on that topic. But other than that, his explanations are top-notch, there is nothing more delightful than reading a book by a Nobel prize winner that is written with such clarity!"
85,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10377815-christian,5,"A tour de force from start to finish as Richard Feynman delivers a masterful and delightful explanation of quantum electrodynamics (QED), starting with a more classical understanding of the interaction of light with matter and gradually introducing quantum electrodynamics. The Feynman diagrams are very well explained and make sense, which is great! Also, there's a little about quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the last chapter (fourth lecture) of this book, which shows the analogous approach between how QED and QCD were both developed, albeit with certain differences. I learned a great deal from this book and look forward to buying it as I had borrowed this book from the local public library. "
86,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67310315-max,4,"Feynman's unique voice makes this exposition a joy to read - but not necessarily easy to understand. He skirts around complex numbers in a funny way, such that if you understand complex numbers (especially what's meant by the phase of a complex number), you'll know what he's talking about. If you don't know anything about complex numbers, but do know about ordinary vectors, you still might get what he means in some very approximated way. If you don't know about that stuff either, then you're probably screwed - you won't understand what any of the countless diagrams of connected arrows have to do with anything. But Feynman was a genius, and this book lets you get a priceless glimpse of his intelligence."
87,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38529781-mike-kohn,3,"My rating has nothing to do with the quality of the book. Feynman is such an important figure in physics and he writes very technical content in a surprisingly easy to digest way. I did fade out a little near the end, mostly because it became more and more theoretical and abstract.My rating has a lot to do with the flashbacks I got of my modern physics and experimental physics courses in college. You know, the classes that made me drop physics as a major. The introduction by Anthony Zee describes it really well as a not-quite-a-popular-science book and a not-quite-a-textbook book. At this point my life, 15 years beyond my brief physics “career,” I think I’m looking for more of a whizz-bangy hand-wavey popsci book with some fun tidbits I can use to impress my friends at a party."
88,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58735477-andrew,4,"This book was very very close to making sense. Quantum electrodynamics is not an easy theory for anyone to understand, but Feynman does a great job of providing lots of examples, and of course there is his general flair for speaking and explaining big ideas. I had a lot of fun reading the book even though the concept felt a bit out of reach. That in itself isn't a huge problem, since even though scientists can accurately predict results with this theory, a lot of the essential mechanisms aren't understood. More than anything it was refreshing that such a well-respected physicist was openly discussing how confusing particle physics can be, and that even he struggles with QED. "
89,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91315385-jo-o-pires,4,"This book is the four conferences about Light and Matter given by Feynman. The book is very well written and easy to understand in the first two conferences. It's important to say that I was taking the course about quantum mechanics at the same time. This was another prespective, without the mathematics and to try to understand the quantum theories. These theories are not really understand why the nature works in this way, but it's help us to preview what will happen. It's a very good prespective about the quantum world without mathematics, but for the have the hunger to understand the world, the maths behind the quantum phenomena are really fun!"

It presents in an approachable, mostly non-mathematical way using rotating “arrows” as a stand-in for complex numbers and integration, Feynman’s famous “path integral” formulation of the modern quantum field theory of photons and electrons.The book works nicely as a supplement to both the canonical formalism and more modern methods learned in QFT physics classes today. Recommended highly to anyone interested in physics at any level, especially those looking toward college physics, and those wanting to experience the genius of Richard Feynman directly. "

It's Feynman, so you get lots of personality, and it's as clear as I think quantum electrodynamics can be. Did I understand it? Nope. But as Feynman says again and again, you're not really supposed to. So: one day I'll try again. For now, at least, I think I have a clearer understanding of where quantum physics was at in the 80s, and the thoughts I don't understand are percolating. Curious and curiouser ---"

The quantum world is certainly weird though it is the true state of our universe. Thank goodness Newton’s physics- while wrong- is close enough for our everyday lives; I had a hard enough with that in school.

This book isn't to make you understand light but to tell you about the tools used to help understand it and still be totally confused. I read this to get an idea about the theory of QED and learn some things about light that I didn't know. It helped with that. I didn't read this to try and copy the diagrams in order to follow along with all the add on pieces to each lecture as if it were a textbook and I had an exam coming up.

So, actually I didn't understand much of the book. But I read the whole thing and was able to get a general gist out of it. The reason I read it in the first place was because I am such a fan of Richard Feynman and because I like learning things. The book was more technical than I had anticipated.

I was a physics major in uni and I took some quantum mechanics but never QED. It's a very difficult counterintuitive subject and Feynman's approach is accessible with no math required. I can't say I understand QED but this book did give me a better feel for it.

Still, the bulk of the book is a clear explanation of how physicists approach their understanding of photons and electrons, and thus was informative and useful. "

The first chapter with simple examples for light was a breeze, the second chapter began to discuss more complicated examples, and I need read back at least once to make sure I can still follow the idea. In chapter 3 I then decided that as long as I didn't feel totally lost and have some sort of grasp of the 'main plot' of this obviously none-fiction book, I should keep reading, and should not obsessed about the details. Still chapter 3 feel to be the longest and the hardest chapter for me.

182,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27907870-marcha-fox,4,"This book is the edited transcription of a lecture series given by renowned physicist, Richard P. Feynman, at UCLA in 1983. These lectures were designed for an audience of intelligent individuals who are interested in physics but only the good stuff, not the dirty work of slogging through all the math. That said, unless you are a physicist, masochist or perhaps need something to put you to sleep at night this book is not for you.Feynman in my opinion is one of the greatest physicists of all times, mostly because of his ability to explain just about anything at a level lay people, or at least those like myself with a lowly bachelor's degree in physics, could understand. When I was in college pursuing such I relied heavily on my three volume set of ""Feynman's Lectures on Physics"" to help me understand certain theories where my college texts failed to explain them sufficiently. Thus, when I obtained this book I expected it to provide a better understanding of quantum electrodynamics than I had previously, which of course was essentially null so it could only increase. That did, indeed, happen, but not to the level I'd hoped for.Feynman warns his readers right up front in the Introduction on page 9 when he says, ""It is my task to convince you not to turn away because you don't understand it. You see, my physics students don't understand it either. That is because I don't understand it. Nobody does.""Great. It was considerate to point out right up front that I would feel either lost or stupid throughout, which certainly proved to be the case. For me even the various diagrams he uses to explain these phenomena (which ultimately became known as Feynman diagrams) were more confusing than not. He did note that it took his graduate student three years to grasp them which was somewhat comforting. Nonetheless, toward the end they reminded me more of Abbott and Costello's famous skit we know as ""Who's on first?"" then the interaction of fundamental particles. However, Feynman's humor and witty style kept me reading for such jewels as ""I have delighted in showing you that the price of gaining such an accurate theory has been the erosion of our common sense."" Nonetheless, as I lay this book to rest on my shelf I will admit that it does contain numerous dog-eared pages and lots of highlighting. I'm fascinated by the fact that some particles at the quantum level go backward in time. I mean, seriously, how cool is that? I now understand that QED is about the mysterious interaction between photons and electrons, which of course makes sense with a title of ""quantum electrodynamics."" Duh. I now also understand more fully what a Feynman diagram comprises. Thus, even though he was correct in assuming that I wouldn't understand it, I do know more than I did when I started reading so the experience was not a total loss.One thing to bear in mind if you should decide to take on this book is that since 1983 when these lectures were delivered (and just happens to be the year I started college) much more has been discovered in the field of particle physics. This is explained beautifully by the proofreading notes at the end of this book, the first dated November 1984 which states, ""Since these lectures were given, suspicious events observed in experiments made it appear possible that some other particle or phenomenon, new and unexpected (and therefore not mentioned in these lectures), may soon be discovered."" The second proofreading note dated April 1985 stated, ""At this moment the ""suspicious events"" mentioned above appear to be a false alarm. The situation no doubt will have changed again by the time you read this book. Things change faster in physics than in the book publishing business.""Probably the biggest news in this field to come in the past few years was the discovery of the ""God particle"" or Higgs boson. This book certainly prepares you for the existence of new particles and provides some understanding of what is involved in that process and why it's not an easy matter. It you really want to get into this stuff this book is a good primer.In conclusion, it's worth noting that ""Q.E.D."" is a term also used in mathematics at the end of a proof as an abbreviation for the Latin saying ""quod erat demonstrandum,"" i.e., ""which was to be demonstrated."" If nothing else, Feynman truly demonstrated that this stuff really is beyond human understanding even for those who can do the math. In other words, they may be able to determine what is going on but certainly not the why, which lies in another realm. Thus, it is my sincerest hope that since this great man now resides in that very place that he can at last fully understand it. I sure don't."
183,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94225994-jason-judd,5,"I'm not even going to talk about Dr. Feynman. Everyone loves to argue against his theories, but he was right. It's a great read and he will always be essential, regardless of the fight. Thank you, Dr. Feynman, wherever you are. Thank you for putting up the fight."
184,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43810705-neo-dinh,5,"When Stephen Hawking wrote a book trying to explain things simply, he leaned on the principle that every equations will halve the value of the book, so by leaving them out he made it look like everyone can be a physicist. While it's a good thing to have aspiration, this book throws that idea out the window, and gives out respect instead.I can say that I feel even more aspired by Feynman, and a bigger respect towards the genius that brings physics to the layman."
185,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67420779-laurel-doyle,4,"A really great reading experience! Thank you, Richard Feynman! I am interested in physics, and I found the content of this book very informative. I really do feel I have learned about quantum electrodynamics. However, the only reason for my four stars is that I did lose Feynman a bit during some of the more complex parts of the lecture. I believe this is almost certainly due to my lack of physics knowledge in general rather than the lecturer's capabilities. When I have a better grounding in the science, perhaps I will give the book another try and the five stars it likely deserves."
186,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59072886-ryan-shea,5,Feynman is a legend for not just his seminal work in quantum mechanics but also for his unparalleled ability to simplify complex concepts.He explains the basic building blocks of reality & how nature works - all without formulas: only everyday language.
187,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1442431-chad-bearden,4,"""QED"" brings together two of my favorite things: Richard Feynman and Quantum Electrodynamics. I've read several books and articals that lay out layman-friendly explanations of this quirkly little sub-genre of physics, and I've read several books by Richard Feynman, but amazingly, never a book about physics by Feynman.[Sidenote: even if you don't give a whit about science, you owe it to yourself to read Feynman's two non-fiction personal essay collections, ""Surely You Must Be Joking, Mr. Feynman"" and ""What Do You Care What Other People Think"".]Having read several of Mr. Feynman's writings about his life and the plethora of random topics he seems to stumble into becoming obsessively interested in, I feel like I've had the chance to get to know the man. If you haven't read his books, he's basically the Kurt Vonnegut of the Physics world: a rather smart fellow with a sometimes eccentric yet always bluntly straight-forward view of things.His personality shines out brightly in the opening moments of ""QED"", which is essentially a book-version of a lecture series he delivered in 1979. The lectures were designed to explain the rather complicated and counter-intuitive science of quantum electrodynamics to a lay audience. The trade-off, he explains, is that at the end of his lectures, you'll have a general grasp on several concepts that help explain the interactions of electrons and photons, but you'll have no idea why those concepts work or where they came from. To understand that, you have to go graduate school for eight years.There are four chapters (one for each of the lectures), and as a whole, they do a fair job of getting some pretty complicated points across. I found the first two chapters the easiest to grasp, possibly because I was able to read each of those lectures in a sitting apiece. When you can concentrate and focus on his step-by-step roadmap and see it through to the end, rather complicated ideas (such as the amplitude of partial reflection of a photon by a pane of glass) actually begin to make sense. I actually had a Eureka moment when Feynman made me understand that photons could apparently travel backwards in time.I had more trouble with chapter three, when my rehearsal schedule didn't really grant me the twenty minutes or so of downtime necessary to read the chapter through in one go. Even so, I still did come away with far better understanding of the 'Feynman Diagrams' that have baffled me to no end when described by other science writers.Like the first two lectures, I was able to read lecture four all at once, and this, combined with its interesting topic allowed to to finish the book with some of my pride still intact. (When I finished ""Paradox Lost"" a few years ago, I felt like I should turn in my college diplomas). It was this fourth chapter that touched on what it is I love about theoretical physics in particular, and all science writing in general: Feynman blatantly states that scientists have no idea what the heck is going on half of the time! You can observe something, and measure it and record it and double-check it, but finding out why things things like quarks and baryons and pions and mesons are the way they are sometimes seems beyond human capabilities.Trying to pry deeper into the odd world of subatomic particles is like having your computer flash the number ""87"" on its screen, but never ever being able to figure out why! You can play with the number ""87"" and divide it and multiply it and square it and anything else you can think of, but why the number ""87""?!Who knows? Nobody does. But that never stopped men like Richard Feynman from trying to figure it out anyway. And possibly more impressively, it didn't stop him from trying to share his field's rather esoteric ideas with people like me."
188,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) made easyThe author is one of the greatest physicists of 20th century, and highly regarded as one of the best instructors of physics, but the reader must have some knowledge of science and strong interest in physics, and appreciate optical phenomenon; reflection of light, refraction, etc. Reading this book at first may be boring, but reading for second or third time gives you a good idea about the theory and help you understand the elegance with which the author has conveyed the material. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a fundamental theory of light (photon) - matter (particle) interaction or electric field and charge interaction. The author explains how we can calculate this interaction. There are only three basic actions associated with light and electron interaction. First, a photon goes from place to place; second, an electron goes from place to place; and third, an electron emits or absorbs a photon. Each of this has amplitude - an arrow (vector) that can be calculated according to certain rules. There is no mathematics in the book but the logic, and assumptions are explained which may be difficult to assimilate unless you like to understand QED. When an electron travels from one point to another in spacetime, it uses multiple paths before arriving at its destination according to quantum physics. It can also absorb or emit light multiple times during its path. Therefore one needs to calculate the probability of its most likely path and also the number of times it absorbs or emits radiation. Emission of light could occur when an electron interacts with positrons (antiparticle) that results in their annihilation. QED incorporates corrections to one or more photons being emitted and absorbed in its path and also all other possible paths the electron may take. All these are considered to calculate the mist likely path for its travel. The second factor to be included in the calculation is that light has amplitude to go faster or slower than the conventional speed of light. Therefore the emission and absorption of light between two electrons could occur with three possibilities. One, the emission occurs before absorption, second, emission occurs at the same time as absorption, and third, emission occurs after absorption. The last possibility looks puzzling since light is required to go backwards in time. This is possible in mathematical calculations, and photons are said to be exchanged and the locations are used in spacetime in the formula. Additional possibilities to consider are; two and more photon exchange could occur. If we consider the effect polarization, the coupling factor j for backward moving electron is positive, hence the charge is positive and the electron is referred to as positron. The formula calculates two numbers known as n (mass for a fake electron) and j (coupling parameter; charge of a fake electron). For a real electron, n = mass experimentally determined, and j = charge experimentally determined. The author explains the complexities in the calculation of these two numbers which are used in the formula that calculates the amplitude of electron - photon interactions. For an atom which contains a nucleus at the center and electron in the orbit; nucleus is heavy and hence considered stationary and the electron moves in spacetime with respect to nucleus in the QED analysis. The dynamics include; electrons and nucleus exchange photons, and the photons from outside is scattered by the electron of the atom. The total amplitude of all electron scattering depends on the arrangement of electrons in the atom and they are variously called s, p, d and f orbitals that accounts for the entire chemistry and chemical reactions of elements.

189,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48932657-simon,5,"Where to start!Perhaps first off, the theory of Quantum Electrodynamics - QED, is the most mathematically precise and successful theory in the entire field of Physics, and is surely one of the very great human achievements, explaining with stunning precision how the world around us *really* behaves. So perhaps we owe it to ourselves to learn a little bit about this most fundamental nature of our existence, just as we do well to expand our minds through the great works of Shakespeare, Dante, Darwin, or Beethoven.One can consider this book in two ways. First, for the elegance of the theory of QED itself that it sets out to describe, or secondly, for how it conveys that theory to the reader. By either measure, it is breathtaking.I had the benefit (and delight) of watching the ropey old 1979 University of Aukland recordings of Feynmans four public lecture on Quantum Electrodynamics, on Youtube. Despite the horrendous audio/visual quality, I strongly urge anyone interested in learning how Nature *really* behaves to watch these first. Having done so myself led me to discover this book, which when I bought it I did not realise that it is essentially a transcription of the lectures themselves (albeit tweaked). This is no bad thing! It was a delight (and very helpful when the going gets tough) to ""hear"" Feynman's unmistakable voice as I read, his style of delivery, the fact that he was so evidently fascinated by his subject.These lectures and this book are aimed at the ""interested public"" - i.e. a lay-audience who is curious and willing to work a little. There is no dense maths - most of the discussion centres around Feynman's breathtakingly elegant and powerful pictorial approach to everyday phenomena - reflection, refraction, light traveling in straight lines (hint - it's doesn't!) - from a quantum perspective. Nevertheless it is only fair to say that it may be a stretch for someone who really has no ""technical instinct"" at all. But as a member of that target audience - who admittedly found things a getting a touch hairy in chapters three and four (of four) - the theory is so elegant, and so compellingly conveyed, that I feel like I can now see The Matrix! Ok I don't understand QED (but neither did Feynman, as he is quick to point out) - but now I look at the world around me in a different way - before QED and after QED. Before, darkness, then light.If this book / lecture series had one 'mic drop' moment for me, when it all came together in sublime simplicity, it was the description of how a glass lens *really* works (hint: it's NOT what you were told at school!) In fact one of the recurring senses I had was one of having been cheated by the physics I was taught during school and college - entire courses on ""Wave-particle duality"", which Feynman states very clearly at the beginning was a ""confusion"" dating from a century ago. ""Light is particles, and I'm going to tell you how it works"". This is perhaps Feynman's greatest quality. He seemed to be pathologically incapable of cheating you with a false description ""just to make it easier"" (""I'm not going to tell you it's like balls on springs, because it isn't!""). Instead he had a wonderful gift for telling you ""how it really is"", yet in the most down-to-earth and engaging terms.A masterpiece, on many levels. "
190,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23015731-casey,5,"In a similar vein to A Brief History of Time, this is a book which is simultaneously brilliant, and which I suspect many people like to pretend they understand for the sake of not looking dumb at cocktail parties.A. Zee's introduction to this book is delightful in and of itself. He provides the perfect analogy for what this book is: if a Mayan priest is trying to teach you multiplication (i.e. 564 x 253), Feynman is the smartass who comes along and says ""psh, you can ignore all that carrying business and all those tricks on the paper - all you have to do is find 253 jars, put 564 pebbles into each, dump them all out into a big pile, and count them! Easy."" And that is what he does - gives you a very clear, non-mathematical explanation of QED, while concisely delivering the very intuitive core of the idea.Chapters 1 and 2 are absolutely brilliant. Feynman gives an incredible, mind-blowing, and simple explanation of his path-integral (or sum-over-histories) approach to explaining photon behaviour. This is an explanation which is simple enough that you could give it to an intelligent 12 year old, and yet leaves out enough technical detail to inspire those who are so inclined to actually put in the 4 years of graduate school to actually understand how to do this stuff. Even better, he proves it to you! None of this is science fiction bunk! Butterfly wings, mirrors, pieces of glass, oil spills in puddles, focusing lenses - every single one of these intuitive, every day items can be explained by QED, and Feynman does a marvelous job.By the time we get to chapter 3, however, things started falling apart for me. By the time he got to spin and quarks and gluons I was completely lost. If I had a better foundation in particle physics I may have been able to follow along better here, but without an intuitive background knowledge of what spin or anti-particle really means (and I don't mean some bs one sentence answer that you regurgitate onto a high school science test: I mean a real, in-your-bones kind of intuition, like you know that objects fall down), it was very hard for me to be as impressed by chapter 3 as I was by chapters 1 and 2.Overall, still an excellent book worth tackling, that will open your eyes to a remarkable theory which does a perfect job explaining many commonplace phenomena of light. Perhaps if I had more time to research every piece of background knowledge that Feynman assumes, I'll one day be able to obtain the same wonder and enjoyment out of the latter half of this book as well.Feynman also writes with his classic sense of humour, and the book itself is quite delightful. Good fun, if you can really hunker down and get into it."
191,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32553593-elliott-bignell,5,"This review refers to the German translation.I read this book 25 years ago in English, making it both a review of material already covered and a useful exercise in German reading. Once again, it no way disappoints. Feynmann must surely take a place on my list of intellectual heroes, as his unique genius is not merely to have made decisive contributions to the theory of quantum electrodynamics (""QED""), but to have had the gift of explaining it in an accessible way.The world of QED is weird. There is no other word for it, and even Feynmann is open in asserting that we have no idea what it means, or what lies behind it. Nevertheless, the theory could already predict experimental results to eleven decimal places in Feynmann's day, and it explains all physical phenomena with which we are generally confronted except gravity and nuclear physics. It is a scientific tour de force, and we are privileged to have these public lectures by a key progenitor available for reference.Feynmann is the inventor of his eponymous diagrams charting quantum interactions in space-time, and there are plenty of them to illustrate thie book. One of the more intractable concepts in the theory is the notion that arrows on these diagrams represent an ""amplitude"", a complex number which is the square root of a probability! Feynmann tackles this jarring idea with grace. Worse is, however, to come: Feynmann is also credited with the concept of ""sum over histories"", where the most probable behaviour of an interaction is computed by summing all possible such probabilities for all possible behaviours. This sounds innocent enough until one considers the underlying reality, now well confirmed by experiment, that photons of light somehow explore all possible paths ahead of them and find the fastest and most probable prior to taking it. This mind-bending notion directly conflicts with Einstein, although fortunately it all cancels out at scales which we can perceive.Feynmann reserves an entire lecture for problems with the theory. This may seem odd for those not familiar with science and scientists, but our understanding of ""fundamental"" physics, while spectacularly successful, is still a work in progress and science is provisional and conservative in nature. The bongo-playing Feynmann perhaps less so. Feynmann has sadly been gone for a quarter of a century now, but his and his colleagues' theory continues to strengthen, while this series of lectures stands as public testament to a unique and beautiful mind."
192,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4154323-comrade-bazarov,5,"Richard Phillips Feynman - what more can I say about this guy that hasn't been said already through the years? Feynman was an incredibly original physicist (fellow Nobel laureate Julian Schwinger called him someone who marched to his beat) who dazzled and impressed not only his esteemed peers but also managed to carve himself a special place in the public eye. Feynman is that unique and rare breed of scientist who can successfully explain very complicated ideas in simple terms so non-scientists (or scientists not in his field) can understand. He uses his own brand of metaphors and analogies to clarify quantum mechanics, and QED is the perfect example of that. In just four lectures (delivered, incidentally, at my alma mater UCLA in the 1980's), Feynman distills the essence of Quantum Electrodynamics without assuming any prior math or physics background in his audience. He doesn't use any calculus, any abstract algebra, heck he doesn't even mention complex numbers once! Incredible! QED has been hailed as the most precise scientific theory ever constructed because its predictions have been confirmed by so many experiments throughout the last half of 20th century. It reconciles the many discrepancies between the 'classical' version of electromagnetism and quantum mechanics and successfully explains many other anomalies seen in nature. Feynman shared the Nobel in physics (with Schwinger and Tomonaga) for playing a key role in developing the theory. Using simple arrows and basic operations like 'shrinking' and 'turning' arrows, Feynman explains phenomena such as reflection by mirror, partial reflection by glass, absorption by opaque materials, the apparent slowing of light as it goes through water and other media etc. All through the lectures he maintains a light tone and makes several self-deprecating jokes about the way physicists name things (he reserves particular scorn and derision for the naming of quarks). As a medical/graduate student in neuroscience but with some math and physics background (but not enough to actually understand renormalization and gauge theories), I really appreciated Feynman's ability to explain QED so effectively without ever sounding condescending (which a lot of physicists are unfortunately too prone to do). This your chance to read one of 20th century's most influential physicist break down one of the most fundamental theories of nature with great style and elegance. "
193,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15272898-olga-trueshine,4,"A look at quantum electrodynamics from a simple, functional perspective instead of mathematical. Everything should be as simple as it can be, says Einstein, but not simpler. The world is just so and Feynman communicated the strange theory of light and matter with explicitness and humor. Perfect for curious minds without a scientific background on a journey to understand the physical world at a quantum level. Feynman is the Buddha of physics."
194,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9282968-jatan,4,"I have read my share of--what Feynman reckons--'popular science' books which were--at best--attempts at sophism by some pretty distinguished folk to make physics inclusive; though they kinda lost the plot along the way. It took me a while to realize that (most) such attempts managed to provide not only an incomplete, but (something much more alarming) a distorted view of the theories they were trying to explain. A hiatus in form of a college-level physics education was my best bet to gain perspective. Roughly 4 years later, armed with the right tools (read: a first course in QED and a plan to tackle the second) and a B.Sc. degree to boot, I sought to return to literature and re-evaluate my opinions and options. This book, fortuitously(a word only Kundera can do justice to, I digress though), was THE perfect place to start. I am not sure how I can be more emphatic about this but beyond a point most physics is a mess--probably because humans are a mess themselves--and dabbling in string theory, higgs boson, quantum gravity and their more esoteric cousins won't be fruitful unless you can grasp their raison d'etre!(Hint: Read the book.)The first 3 chapters (there are 4 in all) are an absolute treat irrespective of your physics prowess.(Warning: Definition doesn't apply to Liberal Arts students.) So, if you are looking for an ab intitio approach to understanding close to 99% of all quotidian macroscopic phenomenon, look no further; grab a copy and endure. Notes:1. I nodded off more times than I would like to admit, while reading certain sections. Whether this was due to exasperation from having to deal with Feynman's bloody 'arrows' zooming all over the place--an added abstraction that felt mildly annoying since I knew the physics at hand, analysis of experimental data is awaited. (Internship positions available for physics students with rather conveniently fickle interests!!)2. Feynman was certainly not happy with the turn that high-energy theory took after QED, and he makes no bones about his discomfort in the final chapter. 'Great inventor' Gell-Mann, lack of Greek in the lexicon being developed for the new particles, the GUT debacle--some of the 'issues' that are treated with Feynman-esque derision.3.

195,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6533512-owen,4,"The first two lectures are incredibly accessible in their presentation of the tools and mindset necessary to tackling one of the great triumphs of modern physics. However, once electrons entered the mix with the third lecture I found myself struggling to keep up with the depth of the ideas - it may be little more than 150 pages yet each single one demands a careful pace. Nevertheless Feynman's wit and enthusiasm is ceaseless, and he thankfully provided many diagrams that prove invaluable in developing an understanding of the strange behaviour of the universe' most fundamental particles. A definite re-read for the future."
196,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5197319-shish-basu-palit,5,"Once in a blue moon, a book comes along that leaves you gasping for breath, almost unable to believe that an author could achieve such a thing. This is that kind of a book.Feynman starts by promising to, in four slim chapters, derive the fundamental properties of light and matter. Not describe, but derive, starting from the basic axioms of his newly developed theory of quantum electrodynamics, the theory for which he won the Nobel in Physics, and which is a part of the Standard Model, the most accurate theory of nature known till date. He promises to do this without using any mathematics. He succeeds.The phrase tour de force was invented for this book. Quantum physics is sometimes criticized by non-physicists for being so mathematically involved that physical insight is lost. Feynman demolishes that notion by showing that complicated mathematical formalisms are a tool for calculations, the basic physics can be worked out using nothing but images of an arrow rotating in a circle. From first principles, using nothing but his graphical representation of complex numbers, he builds up a theory of how light reflects from glass slabs of differing width. Populist science authors like Stephen Hawking should take note: physics can be communicated clearly, accessibly and beautifully without dumbing down and metaphorizing it to the point of fiction.My only regret about this tiny powerhouse of a book is that Feynman does not incorporate polarization within his framework. It is needed at several points in the development, and he is repeatedly forced to invoke results that can only be derived using it, marring his otherwise logically self-contained treatment. Perhaps it would have been better to go a bit further, maybe have five chapters instead of four, and bring polarization within his scope.For anybody fascinated by the deepest workings of nature and the furthest reaches of human intellect, QED is a must-read!"
197,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49328253-mary-rice,5,"What a marvelous read. On its face, it's fantastic that while this isn't a physics textbook, Feynman doesn't underestimate the intelligence of his readers (or at the very least their willingness to grapple with complex subjects). Rather than reducing something so delightfully complicated to sugar-coated analogies, he walks his readers/listeners through the nitty gritty of quantum electrodymanics - explaining the process as thoroughly and completely as he can (which is quite) and for the most part leaving out the formulas unless necessary. Because of this, he clarifies a lot of misconceptions that arise from the popular explanations of quantum physics (uncertainty principle, the fact that the speed of light isn't technically a constant), and illuminates the tiny details which, when repeated over and over, create all the delights in the universe. A discussion of quark flavors and the different spin particles illuminates what exactly makes a proton different from a neutron (it's the difference of a u-quark) which, when you follow the implications down the road, means that every atom of every element, the structure of every molecule and every substance, i.e. the known physical universe, comes down to a 2/3 difference in charge in the three particles that make up each component of an atomic nucleus. (Simplified because really, his chapter on the intricacies of u/d/s/c/t/b quarks, muons, W, gluons and a whole zoo of other subatomic particles is really fascinating and delightful and worth the read). If you've got a background interest in physics (not necessarily a degree in higher mathematics, but this is stuff you've read about and are interested in) and are willing to re-read things (because these concepts can take a minute to make sense) and want to read what's essentially a love letter to the beautifully incomprehensible inner workings of our universe, this is the book for you.

198,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24291036-primo-flores,4,"I was one of those dudes that used to read shit like A brief history of time or String theory and then try to talk about it on parties as if discussing them made sense. If you're currently like I was you can stop now, it ain't gonna work, those theories are just that, theories, especially string theory, but both books are full of BS, some parts of Stephen Hawkins work have now been disproved making that read a worthless waste of time (like reading the star wars extended universe only to find they aren't canon anymore) so I started reading about subjects that are most completely proven, hence reading about quantum electrodynamics, and who better to teach it than Dr. Richard P. Feynman my favourite modern scientist; this guy doesn't dumb down the technical aspects of it but still manages to explain it very concisely (except for polarization), I can say that this is not a book to be read by the pretentious asshole that I was, this is not for dummies and hard to figure out if you don't have the background, and yet, its not a graduate book either, it doesn't have problems, only examples, but they are trippy as shit, you need to acknowledge that when it comes to analizing light common sense goes out the window, bending of light, managing probabilities as areas between vectors, particles faster than light and even time travel, they are all possible and replicated through experimentation, it's quite a read, this is my second read and took a month to finish so beware. Still, I gotta tell ya, not for parties, I only picked up a person using science as conversation once and that person was a dude (I ended up recommending In search for Schrodingers cat which is another great book), so good luck with your read and I hope you have a great time just as I did"
199,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69725733-nathan,4,"Feynman was a brilliant guy, and an excellent teacher, but frankly this book cannot cover the subject to any level of depth that is really useful. Of course, Feynman knew this and stated as much in his introduction. Otherwise, it is an excellent overview of the sorts of concepts that physicists use in calculations of phenomena, and makes a good attempt at connecting various aspects of physics. This just makes me hungrier for a more substantial explanation. I wish Feynman were around to give it. Also, the last lecture was, understandably, by contemporary standards incorrect on some points, but remarkably holds up in many regards."
200,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5976824-chris-via,4,"In typical Feynman fashion, this book skates on the edge of hard science and popular science, thereby presenting physicist-level experimentation and results to the widest possible audience. It is obvious that Feynman was passionate about QED (quantum electrodynamics; an unfortunate name, states Feynman). His goal is to do two things: (a) to present QED as ""our best example of a good [scientific] theory"" and (b) to describe the strange theory of ""the interaction of light and electrons"" (152, 4). Strange is an understated adjective to describe how photons and electrons interact, as is made clear through the example, chiefly, of the partial reflection problem. Over and over, Feynman sets us up for what common sense would tells us is going to happen, given a certain experiment, and then proves the contrary (or, the completed unexpected). At times, it can seem that these particles are aware of each other and...of us! Some of the major discoveries since Newton are: electrons looked like particles at first, and photons looked like waves at first; but now we find that both objects behave sometimes like waves and sometimes like particles. Further, it ""appears that all the 'particles' in Nature--quarks, gluons, nutrinos, and so forth...behave in this quantum mechanical way"" (85). The two facts that struck me most were that (a) all particles have an anti-particle; and (b) when the two collide, they annihilate each other and form other particles (98). So, if matter and anti-matter collide, annihilation occurs, and a photon is emitted. Yes, the quantum world is quite strange, and for that all the more intriguing."
201,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27619244-ant,5,A short book but a very dense one. An absolutely fabulous introduction to QED written with Feynman's trademark easy style. I'm planning my second reading already.
202,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7816047-aphelion,4,"This is the best layman's intro to quantum mechanics I've read. It is not rigorous but it does a great job of explaining the core ideas of how almost all of nature (all of chemistry and optics, electricity and magnetism for example) can be interpreted in terms of the interactions of just two particles: photons and electrons. Note: The only thing QED leaves out is gravity, which has no effect on physics at a ""small"" scale, as well as the nuclear forces within protons and neutrons, the forces responsible for radioactivity for example. Scientists don't understand gravity at the level of particle physics yet; in fact that remains one of the most significant areas of research today. So far after 20 or 30 years of work since the completion of the standard model, this goal remains elusive and little obvious progress has been made. As for nuclear forces, a theory similar to QED called QCD (quantum chromo dynamics), the theory which introduces the idea of quarks, was developed for this purpose in the 70s and 80s. QCD and QED have been combined into one great framework known as the ""standard model,"" by far the most fundamental and exact scientific theory ever produced by human beings. So far no meaningful deviation from its predictions has been produced by any of the many thousands of experiments that have been done at particle accelerators and in the study of osmic rays. In my opinion it s the crown jewel of science, for nothing else explains so much so economically."

QED explains all physical phenomena other than nuclear processes and gravity, at least in principle. In practice, processes involving huge numbers of electrons and photons are difficult to calculate only because of computational limitations. As an example of the success of the theory, Dr. Feynman (one of my heroes since my undergraduate physics days) says that a particular calculation of the theory is equivalent to measuring the distance between New York and Los Angeles with a precision of less than the width of a human hair!This book is an edited transcript of a series of four lectures given by Dr. Feynman. In my experience the first two lectures were the most interesting with the third a close second and it began to drag a bit by the fourth and last lecture. In fact, this is my second reading of the book: the first time, I actually laid it down part way through the last lecture. I'm happy I persisted this time, though, because there is some interesting material at the end of the last lecture dealing with currently unknown areas of physics."
204,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6284129-bogdan-gavriliuc,5,"So the premise of this book is that it introduces you to the theory that explains why glass is transparent, why rubber is soft, why anything has any property (almost) and Feynman explains that he will do it involving little ""tricks"" and methods that don't always involve the massive amounts of math required. From that, this gave me a better understanding of Quantum Electro Dynamics (and in the 4th chapter he delves into the rest of quantum theory), I personally wish there was more math, but the intro explains that in order for this book to sell, they have to pretty much amputate any semblance of math. So I don't hold that against them. With that said, the book made my brain hurt. Alot. He explains when he purposely omits a rule, or a condition in order to simplify the understanding. He also says that he explains what happens, not why it happens. I would have wished for more on that, but there might not be an answer yet. I will definitely need to read this again (in addition to more QED books) if I want to gain an appropriate knowledge of the topic. Having had a vague understanding beforehand, I'd say this cleared some things up. If you're into this stuff, read it. He's got some grade-A cheesy jokes in there too. "
205,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45648217-james-kearnan,5," Quite possibly the best book on physics for the general public. It introduces the properties of light and electrons in a delightful, whimsical fashion. It is clear and easy to follow, using examples we are mostly familiar with and explanations that are ingenious and not challenging at all.  The nature of the peculiar particle world goes against our common sense, and the mathematics physicists use in formulating the quantum theory can really bog the curious lay-people down in our understanding of this science. Feynman manages to deliver the message that the quantum world is strange in a pragmatic and funny way. He also manages to explain the theory of QED with minimal mathematics quite clearly. It makes physics fun: it doesn't scare you away with math, it invites with terrific thought experiments. I would recommend this book to young aspiring scientists, curious people that are not familiar with the difficult mathematics that other texts use to explain quantum theory, and even educators who could learn from Feynman how to teach science. When I read this book I understood the world much better, and was excited to learn more, it marked the starting point for my intellectual journey into physics. One of my all time favourites."

And strangely, they cause everything we see in everyday life. So it's like fairy tale land, except that it involves a lot of mathematics. But as Richard Feynman brilliantly demonstrates here, math skills are an important aspect, but an even more important one is that you need a totally creative mind that's able to imagine the unimaginable, and maybe you also need to have a few loose nuts in your head.I read these lectures, and I still don't understand quantum electrodynamics fully. Nobody does; Dr Feynman warns us of that right in the beginning. But his ambitious goal to explain this fascinating field of physics to a layman is very much achieved. I get the general picture of quantum electrodynamics and it's nothing short of amazing. This is one of the books that you read and you think ""wow, I really wish I were able to have a nice talk with this guy over a beer""."

I was so much angry with all my teachers for feeding me passed on information which was very far from being correct. In the starting, feynman says - ""i will neither try to simplify explanations so that you can understand easily, nor make it too difficult to go above your head. i will not polish facts or generalise results so that it is easier for you to comprehend them I will just present you the real physics along with the reasoning as it is."" And whole of the book goes with this theme.It made me question so many things which i accepted without any reason, like why does convex lens bend light rays in order to focus it on a single point. Why does the light reflection from a mirror occurs from only the ends and not in the middle. There are thousands of books which will fill you unnecessary details of quantum world which will ultimately confuse you. But this small book will just clear everything you ever read and provide a base which will help you if you have even a slight interest in physics."
208,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28727983-e,4,"I'm not quite sure how to review this book without going into a lecture on quantum electrodynamics, but that is the point of the book, so you might as well just read that, for Feynman is the best physics teacher alive or dead (seriously, just look up the guy on YouTube; you'll love him).Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is the study of how light interacts (and by light we mean the whole spectrum--gamma rays, UV, infrared, visible light, radio, and so on and so forth) with other photons and with electrons. What is crazy is that when two such particles interact, we CANNOT predict the result; we can only predict the probabilities. This book is a simplified but entirely accurate guide to how physicists calculate those probabilities. Feynman employs his famous diagrams to great effect here. I cannot even begin to describe his mastery of the subject and of pedagogy that allows him to make what is considered a hideously complex and obscure topic so plain and engaging. And yet he does."
209,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11092827-manmohan-dash,4,During a trip to Washington DC I had read this marvel in the year 2001/2002. In my friend's house in Frederickburg while waiting for my Visa appointment the next day my friend David handed 3 master pieces of Feynman other two for which I just wrote a review. Although I haven't read this one throughly that one night I browsed slightly through it. Those were the days when I was a young budding aspiring graduate student. In 2012 I am an accomplished experimental physicist. But this is one of those books which sets deeply into you and inspires you to take up understanding the physical universe like a Physicist. This is one of those pieces which I have always had in my mind to study one day. I give 4-star because I can also give a negative opinion to some of the ill written or hastily written books in the market. Well I don't for some reason.
210,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28355672-avik,5,"A ground-breaking book by RPF! I have had the privilege to read Feynman, Wheeler, Schwinger and Tomonaga's original papers on the subject but, honestly, those are extremely complicated to follow, even for trained specialists. Feynman's approach to QED happens to be the most elegant - think of the beautiful Feynman diagrams that have become standard in any treatise on QM. There is another facet to Feynman's fame - his outstanding pedagogic capability - which is in full view here. This book owes its birth to a series of lectures given to grad students and one can feel the teacher's genius and enthusiasm oozing out in every page. A delightful read, particularly for those with a prior education in the sciences and a mind quick enough to pick up cutting-edge ideas and ruminate on them at leisure."
211,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182022-brian,5,"While the physical properties of light and matter are fascinating in and of themselves, this is an unparalleled gateway to the idea of nature. A thoroughly empirical/Baconian discussion leads Feynman to conclude: ""this doesn't make any sense"" and ""we don't need to understand 'why' nature does these things, just that she does.""His conclusions in chapter 4: that 99% of what we observe is the relationship of electrons and photons and that we understand them well, but that the remaining 1% is such a cacophony of confusion, related so well to most dichotomous philosophies I was shocked. How well does Nietzsche's Apollonian/Dionysian or Ying/Yang seem to explain the nature of man, but we are somehow left with examples and questions that don't fit within that model. It seems that light and matter have a similar theme."
212,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28786064-kayed-al-qasimi,4,"A fantastic book to learn about quantum electrodynamics and a bit on quantum mechanics in general.I find that most popular science books really throw out a lot of the essential calculations and I am usually left a bit unfulfilled. Feynman has a knack for explaining things to the layman. He provides the calculations but does away with all the mathematics. He uses a novel shortcut where all you need to be able to do is shrink and rotate arrows. There are footnotes in the book that explain that these arrows are just complex numbers. This approach really makes it easy to understand what is going on. If you read this book you will get to understand the quirkiness of the quantum world.As a mathematics Phd student, I do wish there were more calculations so that it could act as a bridge to a physics text book. Perhaps I will read his lectures on QED."
213,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,"A fascinating look at the strange, quirky, and weird properties of the phenomenon we call light (photons). There's some wacky stuff going on with how we understand the properties of light. Feynman comes up with a view that seems to work (shrinks and turns), but there's something else going on here that we haven't quite put a finger on. Add polarization, vacuums, elector-magnetic, and gravity into the mix and light seems to want to do it's own thing.How can a particle behave differently when the only difference is that you directly observed it in one experiment and didn't in another? Weird stuff.It seems the greater our ability to examine greater depths in the microscopic world, the more we find other particles and entities. My guess is that this will continue... as long as we have the means to refine our observations, the more we will continue to find sub-particles."

The book is divided into 4 parts or lectures and as far as the first two are concerned I agree with the other reviews. However, I found the 3rd lecture pretty heavy going and only really understood a small part. I can't lay the entire blame on the book as I was reading other things I sort of left this book to one side for a few weeks and then went back to it, so maybe that is why I kind of lost the plot in lecture 3. Still I'm only giving this book 3 stars as I really did find it more of a chore than a pleasure to read and that's maybe why I left it to one side. "

QED can also mean Quot Erat Demonstratum after all.This book is actually about Quantum Electrodynamics, a Quantum Theory that was popular back in the 1980s. I don't know if any of it was succeeded by any theory, since I haven't really been on the front lines of physics. In this book, Richard Feynman describes the simple interactions of Electrons and photons. Lots of pictures are involved, including the Feynman Diagrams that the author made famous. This is actually a series of lectures that Feynman gave. It contains four of them, with three being on QED and the last one tying up some loose ends. It doesn't have a lot of math, and is quite good for an uninitiated person."

Practically all notable particle physicists of the early 20th century spent time constructing this theory, and it is renowned for its accuracy, enormous predictive power and elegant maths (using Abelian gauge theory). This does not, however, hinder any understanding of the subject, as Feynman was one of the pre-eminent teachers of the same period as well, so the book is lucid and easily read. Highly recommended for people who desire a glimpse into a dense and, often, unapproachable field."
217,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40269489-abhijeet-melkani,3,"This and all of Feynman makes me wonder: Does Feynman's style of understanding a subject only make sense once you've understood it in the usual systematic way? He tells you of a new ""genius"" p.o.v. and you feel as if you follow - you can appreciate his key insights - but you never know enough to develop key insights yourself. Lately though I have become even more critical of Feynman. He hides/obscures from the reader how science is actually done (I do not believe he thought of physics in his research the way he talks of it in his lectures.) and by doing that he is reasserting this false notion of ""genius"" that has shaped all of history into great-man history.Imma read Cedric Villani's Birth of a Theorem and then maybe let's see what I think then."
218,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1074456-ac,4,"Feynman is always an enjoyable read, but don't think you're simply getting a light-hearted exposition of physics. It takes some serious effort (and a genuine interest in quantum physics) to make it through the book and to keep up with what he's saying. Even if you don't get all of it, you can still get a good feel for how complex the problems of quantum physics are by working through the book. There are many things that Feynman makes easy and entertaining. There are plenty of aspects of quantum physics where this is just not possible, still Feynman is as good as there is at trying to make these as accessible as possible."
219,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3391424-rachael,4,"Using colorful thought experiments and deceptively simple devices Feynman manages to explain deep concepts in physics. QED, quantum electrodynamics, is the theory that describes almost all of our ordinary interactions with the world- interactions between electrons and photons. One of the best tested theories of all time, Feynman is able to sneak the reader into understanding path integration, though never mentioning it, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, and the concepts behind his famous Feynman diagrams.This short book is deceptively simple, and to be well understood will take some time to go through carefully. It is worth the effort."
220,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4714834-sarah,4,"I don't get it....no two electrons with the same polarization can be at the same point in space-time - it's called the 'exclusion principle.' This exclusion principle turns out to be the origin of the great variety of chemical properties of the atoms. One proton exchanging photons with one electron dancing around it is called a hydrogen atom. Two protons in the same nucleus exchanging photons with two electrons is called a helium atom. You see, the chemists have a complicated way of counting: instead of saying 'one, two, three, four, five protons,' they say, 'hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, boron.'"
221,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18764413-zack-field,5,"This book was recommended to me by the graduate student heading my physics discussion section, and I have to thank him. Feynman's teaching ability is unparalleled. This short book (~100 pages) built up, from first principles, and intuitive concepts, such as the reflection light off mirrors, to quantum electrodynamics (QED). QED is a remarkably daunting theory (if you don't believe me visit the Wiki page: QED Wikipedia), and Feynman did an incredible job of developing a very clear understanding of it. I would recommend this to any of my friends, physicists and non-physicists alike."
222,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23274251-atulya-ravishankar,5,"As a high school physics student, it simply astounds me that Feynman can make such an arcane area of physics so simple! I embarked upon the book not expecting to understand much, simply wanting to gain an insight into how the minds of great physicists work. I emerged with a seemingly comprehensive understanding of Quantum Electrodynamics. As someone who has read a number of book on Quantum Theory, I can safely say that Feynman is the only writer capable of explaining this in a way that the layperson can understand. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in reading about this topic!"
223,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2657367-russell-clark,5,"It is this book from which I learned of the democratic nature of the Pauli Exclusion Principle, i.e, this principle applies equally to real and virtual fermions. The opposite principle, which applies to bosons (humorously termed, the ""Pauli Inclusion Principle""), is also discussed in Feynman's lucid and concise treatment of Quantum Electrodynamics. Feynman's very intuitive treatment of QED suggested to me a likely underlying mechanism of ""induced gravity"". So yes, this work will definitely set the cogs spinning in the mind of any amateur physicist or lay person who harbors a fascination for the mysteries of physics. "

I bought it a few months ago, but due to reading other things I didn't started reading it until two days ago. It consists of four of Feynman's lectures on quantum electrodynamics, and as well as being funny in places, it was so easy to read and understand. I've heard various opinions on his 'Six Easy Pieces' and 'Six Not so Easy Pieces' and so I was apprehensive about this book, but I found the writing style perfect and the book very easy to get on with. 10/10 would recommend."
225,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13092493-luis,4,"Feynman is a genius, and his ability to explain such complex concepts are simply amazing. In just a week he explains how quantum electrodynamics work instead of 5 years of college. Although we don't go very deep on the hard mathematics behind it we get an idea about how big QED really is.Classic Physics is just an approximation of QED, a really good one. And that's great because it makes life and engineering much easier and predictable.If you are somehow interested in Physics and want to know about QED this is a great read. Having a sciences background can help you understanding some concepts but that's not necessary to the understanding of this book."

A charming and really revelatory popular science book. Richard Feynman has an amazing way of explaining things, and this book on the weird topic of quantum electrodynamics is a clear example. Reading it, you gain a new view of the world around you, as you learn about light that bends, electrons going backwards in time, and particles with ""color."" Personally, it has made me very excited to take quantum physics next year, but I would recommend to anyone with an interest in what goes on ""underneath"" the universe :)"

It's funny, insightful, and always relevant.If you don't know quantum mechanics this sounds like a very specific nerdy field but the way it's presented here will let you learn QM the 'right' way, and will learn it in a way you could explain to others.No wave/particle duality, Copenhagen interpretations on the uncertainty principle.. it's just as Feynman puts it 'drawing little arrows and connecting them'. He understands what it is to 'understand' something and how Nature never really is meant to be understood in the way some other things can be understood."
228,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32071501-samuel-slattery,4,"I found this book to have a very ""enlightening"" discussion about light. Getting a glimpse of the ideas of quantum electrodynamics really changed my perception on the way physics works. There were parts in the book where I learned a new way to understand something that I had previously understood in a different way. These kinds of moments give the reader the kind of satisfaction that comes with learning a new way to prove a mathematical theorem. If you have a science background and an interest to learn more about the strange way photons behave, then you will probably enjoy this book. It certainly sparked my interest in learning even more about physics."
229,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217313-andrew,4,"Feynman has made a very good attempt at describing this difficult and bizarre subject. According to the author himself, one can go through seven years of physics education [and, of course, the maths:] or read this book. It's not impossible to read, but one must spend considerable time going over what is actually being said. The confusing parts are not because of how they are described, nor is the author unable to make aspects of the subject clear. It is the subject itself which is complicated and difficult to fathom. This is definitely one to read slowly. I might even read it again!"
230,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1212912-elisabeth,4,"I learned quite a bit from this book. Was really excited about that. There was a lot of it however that I did not understand, but the fact that Feynman told me I wouldn't at the outset made me feel better about it. Hey, the fact that it was about quantum kinda stuff made me feel better about not understanding! This left me wanting to know more about some of this stuff, especially polarization as he barely touched on that topic and it's one of those things I've never quite understood and have just been piecing it together as I go along."

It's written in a very approachable way by one of the most prominent (and well-loved) American physicists in history. If you ever want to be blown away by how the world works, read this book! You will certainly find the world of quantum electrodynamics (which happens to be our world) to be incomprehensible… but that's OK, because as Feynman explains, everyone finds it incomprehensible, himself included."

I also watched some of the limited numberof the original QED lectures he gave in Australia, that are on YouTube.The videos are a terrific aid, though are not the book being reviewedhere. And I do not have a total grasp of the concepts. However the book is well worth reading, along with the diagrams, for graphicalexplanation."
233,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3772162-peter,3,"There were some really good bits, where Feynman started to explain the very familiar, like reflections from oil on water, in terms of the physics. But he got very involved with drawing arrows, and for me that detracted greatly. I'm quantitatively enough minded and have a sufficient physics background to have gone fairly deep with the math, so the attempt to add the arrows up was more confusing for me. It might have made sense actually in the lecture, I don't know. The particle physics bit at the end was good though."

He modestly claims that an understanding of the theory is not expected of the students, since the professor himself doesn't understand ;)Nevertheless, his descriptions definitely increase the possible understanding of the subject, without being too technical or, on the other hand, too analogy-driven.

The first 3 lectures basically explain how this one theory explain all the properties we know about light (i.e., from other theories), including the wave-particle, Hisenberg Uncertainty Principle, lenses, and mirages. That's right - this one theory explains all the others. It was explained simply by Feynman. The 4th chapter then went into the (then) known sub-atomic particles, and I found it less compelling than the first 3 chapters."

This work is a beautifully tactful and simplistic exposition of the complex and wildly counter-intuitive characteristics of quantum electrodynamics. For the novice, ""QED"" should introduce the notion of ""summing over paths"" as a way of making sense of the ludicrous tangle of quantum reality; to the expert, it should serve as a crisp example of how a difficult subject can be presented with clarity.

He presents a perspective on our universe that, which simplified, illuminates a vast collection of phenomena relevant to anyone with eyes and a brain. While a small amount of mathematical background (mostly basic probability and vectors) is required, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about how the universe works, especially if they have no idea what Quantum Electrodynamics means."

HOWEVER, should you fall into that category, Feynman's insights are, in my opinion, of the highest value to the development of modern physics. With his characteristic wit and genius yet relatable grasp of higher math, Feynman masterfully unites the life works of physicists from Newton to Heisenberg, in order bring the intrigue and wonder of scientific thought to the masses. A fantastic summation of a paradigm altering theory. "

For those who ask if it is difficult to read or not I would say that it depends. You will not learn quantum physics from this book but you will understand what Feynman is saying because he has the unique talent to explain what he has to say in the simplest words and examples. If you want to learn quantum physics it won’t be from here but if you are questioning whether or not to start learning about quantum physics this book will give you the extra push.

This is still readable without much background info but I found it extremely helpful (especially to get new insights) that I had studies the basics of light traveling through glass and how electro-magnetic radiation works earlier. So for me this was nicely concrete text and I feel I truly learned what Feynman was trying to teach."
242,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39353046-ryan-kaufman,4,Feynman does an absolutely phenomenal job of explaining insanely intricate subjects within this book. The conceptual understanding that I gained from reading QED will no doubt prove invaluable as I move through university courses. The one criticism that I would level at this book is that Feynman's conceptualizations are simply not complete. He doesn't include polarization in his explanations of Quantum Electrodynamics phenomena but yet uses conclusions that can only be derived from using polarization.

244,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1678061-alfred,4,"Feynman gives a math-free explanation of how energy and matter interact in improbable ways by summing the vectors of all possible outcomes or multiplying them when there are multiple dependent conditions. As opaque as that sounds, if you read the book, he walks you through the fundamentals of energy and mass and how all observable phenomena other than gravity and nuclear level forces can be accounted for with QED. Really useful for understanding wtf the universe is up to."

But you will enjoy what there is to understand - and even if Nature might not really work this way (and you can't deny that the theory explains experimental observation to a very high degree) it will still open your mind up to a way that it might work, and that's probably the most valuable thing it can do."

Looking back there is emotion and passion and sadness about the explanations of light and matter that allow this lecture to transcend the typical scope of scientific literature.

Even with the advance of knowledge from when this book was written, I still find this work to be one of the better examples of making science understandable to the layperson. "
255,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21066937-kevin-driskill,4,"A very good book that broaches a tough subject. This book illustrate the genus of Feynman in communicating the incomprehensible in a way that is elegant and simple. It starts out very basic and gets more complicated as it goes, but it still explains well a very deep subject. Start here on your journey through the world of quantum electrodynamics and you will travel further in these few pages than in many volumes on the same subject."
256,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3699251-fred,4,"This book is a transcript of some lectures Feynman gave about the theory of quantum electrodynamics. Thanks to his incredible talent for explaining things simply, I could actually follow most of it. Even though you won't get all of the technical details from this book, it does highlight some fascinating properties and behaviours of things like photons. If you still think (like I did) that light is both a wave and a particle, and you're interested in that kind of thing, read this book!"
257,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5955212-weston-mccarron,5,Perhaps the best presentation of quantum electrodynamics (QED) for the general public in existence.This book is apparently a transcript of a series of lectures Professor Feynman delivered at UCLA designed for the general public. If you look around you can find video recordings of those lectures online. They're a bit easier to follow than the book format because you can see his gestures and how he draws and points to the diagrams as he speaks.
258,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22302896-ben-webster,3,"This was one of those books that I saw while in college and had no idea about the topic at all. Something told me to grab it and for some reason it has stayed with me. Finally I got around to giving it a read, and didn't make it all the way through... but have picked it up time and again and read different parts. It is a composition of many different lectures, so it can be read that way..... and he obviously had a grasp of this subject... it was very entertaining.."
259,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15847575-marc-oliver,5,"Feynman is a brilliant teacher, and he makes it appear as if the interactions between light and charged particles are easy to understand, because his words are so seemingly easy to understand. Yet, he does not give you the illusion that you understand something when in fact you don’t. It’s a wonderful little book in which I read many sentences twice or thrice — either to be able to grasp their meaning, or to appreciate their beauty."
260,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4797201-rajendra-dave,5,"Compiled from a set of lectures delivered at UCLA, this is a superb book for getting introduced to modern physics, including the famous Feynman Diagrams. All it needs is enough patience to read and re-read each para to comprehend what is being said. Written in nineteen eighties, some of the material may be outdated, especially with the results from LHC. The style is classic, no-holds-barred, Feynman.Edit April 2020Re-reading certainly helped!"
261,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31556652-charles-ko,5,"As a physics student, this is pretty much one of the must-reads. Feynman explains this rather complicated theory in the best way possible. Many details are omitted, but that is understandably since it made the book accessible to many, even the people who lack any college level education in science. I would recommend this to anyone. It will be enough to provide what the modern physics tastes like to laymen."
262,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45151257-sakares-saengkaew,5,This is a very intuitive explain in some basic element in quantum physics by QED theory. The way that Richard tried to explain is using mostly simple in mathematic vector and a probabilistic way that does not require much of your knowledge in applied mathematics and concept of physics. Highly recommend to whoever interested in the Quantum Physics field and do not need much high-level abstraction knowledge to understand .
263,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108010-tina,0,"Was due back at the library so I gave up on it. To be honest, I wasn't really feeling it, and I don't know why. Subject is right up my alley, it has high ratings, just...my interest was always half-hearted. I think part of it is that Feynman isn't a terribly compelling writer/speaker. At any rate, may try this again later. "
264,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/630858-brian-mattern,5,Feynman has a way of taking complex mathematical physical theory and pulling out the core meaning behind it in a way anyone can understand (without years of training). This book gives an excellent overview of the interaction between light and matter. A must read for anyone curious about the natural world.
265,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/908017-mike-barretta,5,"Picked this up at the Green Valley Book Fair because it was $1 and was small. Amazingly, at the end, I felt I understood enough about Quantum Electrodynamics to be dangerous. The ""laymen"" language and method of descriptions in here, in my experience, are the standard to which all other scitech-books-for-all should be measured."
266,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1809206-nick-gotch,4,"This was the first book I read that really delved into the concepts of quantum electrodynamics. Although somewhat on the more technical end it introduces a lot of cool concepts, Feynman diagrams and such, that usually you don't learn about unless you're taking at least upper-level physics undergrad classes."
267,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1771738-stacey,3,"I got through the first two chapters, which I thought were interesting, and most of the third, which was over my head. It started to feel like a school assignment and I didn't want to invest the time to understand what he was talking about anymore so I didn't finish the last chapter. Not quite for your average layman."
268,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906769-d-j,3,"It is not accessible without the proper background. There is a lot made about how the book delivers popular science without fudging anything, which is great, but by the end I cam to understand why other scientists fudge things. Without doing so, things are just a bit too complicated. There's a reason why getting a doctorate takes half a decade."
269,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2085169-melissa,0,"I really only read about half of this: it's excellent, and pretty accessible, but I keep having to return it to the library, and when I check it out again I have to start over from the beginning. I may not remember much of the answer, but the question is fascinating: why *is* glass partially reflective?"
270,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3149607-voodoochilli,3," A bit over my head! Cited as an accessible venture into QED (if such a thing can exist) I didn't find this book nearly as interesting as Feynman's biographies. Although science interests me greatly, maybe the subject is just a little too complicated for me to understand properly, and that is why I have only given this book three stars."
271,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11057035-david-rubin,4,"Not for the faint of heart. A non-physicist can only gawk in wonder at these very challenging concepts presented by Richard Feynman. For us laymen, the book is worth plowing through if for no other reason than to view the mind of one of the greatest theoretical physicists of all time. Make the effort -- it is worth your while. "
272,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14290183-ian-reynir,4,"I loved this book overall because it gives a curious mind much to chew on; however, I hate that there was no mention of kinetic particle based theory, which was a pioneering approach at that time, and which has been suffering since then due to the ignorance of the so-called giants. Although Feynman was a genius, he lacked a truly open mind."
273,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18877475-rory-armstrong,5,"Really enjoyed it. It's short but difficult to understand ( which the Author states at the beginning of every chapter is the case! ). Still it's explained in a way only Feynman could, with good nature and great analogies! I'd recommend picking it up if you want a great rundown of Quantum Electrodynamics but you won't finish with the why, just the how!"
274,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18861631-mitch-allen,3,"Originally presented as a series of four lectures in which Feynman describes the fundamentals of quantum electrodynamics for a non-technical audience using simple models of light behavior. Interesting and mostly easy to follow, but leaves a lot unaddressed if you are looking for something comprehensive."
275,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019926-mason,4,Unfortunately wasn't able to focus on the book as much as I wanted to due to lack of will-power in a tumultuous time. I'll get back to it again. But as always I enjoy his amazing ability to create new ideas that help you understand more complex ideas within your own existing set of ideas. Feynman is a great writer and teacher.
276,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18651892-amanda-kavanagh,4,"This is a thin book that should be read in one sitting - something I didn't do. I kept putting it down to do menial tasks, only to be confused when I'd pick up where I'd left off. I'll going to read it again when I'm less busy, and hopefully put the chaos of information I've managed to absorb in the right order. "
277,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18940910-james-miller,5,"No doubt some of this book is out of date - no mention of Higgs etc. - but as an accessible view of how crazy the world is at the fundamental level and how the features we see (sticks look bent in water, glasses focus light etc.) derive from interactions between photons and electron according to rules that make your head hurt, it is wonderful."
278,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29015027-sarah-mansour,2,"An attempt to explain QED with no equations proved utterly useless. He could basically only nail Chapter 4 which was about strong and weak interactions.I don't see anybody who would be interested in QED benefiting anything out of this book. I hate to say this about a book written by one of my all time favorite scientists, but it's just a book review."
279,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30820535-aalok-wyckid,5,"For a subject fraught with confusion, Feynman makes things about as clear as they could be. For a subject (physics) that's usually math heavy -- math that makes you want to gouge your eyes out -- this book is math-lite, so don't be afraid. That's not to say you won't be confused. Feynman himself confesses that he and all his peers are, too. This universe is a strange and wondrous place. "
280,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3181307-tony,3,"QED is a transcript of 4 lectures on quantum electrodynamics that Feynman gave to a lay audience. He explained some QED theory, but focused on how physicists test the theory's predictions in experiments. Each chapter/lecture starts out fairly simple, but gets progressively more technical. Nevertheless, the explanations and invaluable diagrams allow the reader to follow along. "
281,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41741470-chase-lindemann,5,"Incredible book; one of the better physics books I've read. Not only does Feynman do an incredible job of explaining some of the most complicated issues within physics, he thoroughly explains the truly 'strange' theory of quantum electrodynamics. I applaud you, Mr. Feynman, for keeping my interest in physics strong and my love for learning large."
282,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21860093-zach,5,"Feynman is a rare gem. He doesn't embellish physics with promises of time travel or higher dimensions, or focus on the uncertain possibilities which get so much attention. He manages to explain the true wackiness and complexity we're already confident in without oversimplifying. For anyone wondering what fundamental physics is all about, this is the book I'd recommend."
283,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45665333-marco-bitetto,5,This is an excellently written equation free presentationof the most recent theory about Quantum Mechanics that ispresented by one of the masters of the field.

I want to blow a hole in my head and donate all organs to science.You know, I must say, it's uncommon for me to find someone so great like Richard Feynman explaining things in a clear way.  It's not possible. I wouldn't know. Okay, maybe it is. "
285,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29265436-ella-catherall,4,"I really enjoyed this book. You know those moments when you're reading a science book and everything clicks in your brain and you don't know how it's happening but you understand everything? Yeah, that was me with this book. It's complicated but the way it's explained makes it really readable. It's awesome."
286,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18749599-martin,5,Feynman explains this topic flawlessly while managing to laugh with you and not at you for scratching your head now and again. The way he describes QED is somewhat poetic as he unfolds a complex topic into something much less mysterious. It's obvious this guy loved his job. The overall writing demeanor combined with the complete clarity of explanation contends this as one of the best. 
287,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58719140-jessica-may,4,"As a physicist undergraduate, this book was interesting, and Feynman's method of teaching and way of seeing the world is undisputedly beautiful. However, this wasn't AS incredible as I was expecting it to be. A relatively short read, I read it on holiday and it took me just over a day. Worth the read and certainly not a day wasted. He does present some lovely ways to visualise vector calculus."
288,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16086797-todd-pinchevsky,4,Well I've found my limit of what I can learn in regards to quantum physics from popular books. To be fair he made it very clear this stuff is hard for his graduate students to understand. But worth the read if you have an interest. Just finally understanding (?) Feynman diagrams made it worth the read! And I kind of understand the arrows. Lots of arrows.
289,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15436-james,0,"I'm not sure I can properly review this book. It sharpened my understanding of this fascinating subject, but the likelihood that you'll enjoy this book is far outside the assumed readership. If you have an inkling, pick it up."
290,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,4,"This is a terrific treatment of QED from the beginning, which is hard to find. Filled with the cleverly named Feynman Diagrams, it makes QED completely surmountable and even really interesting. Some math required, but not much, Feynman can teach anything. I think I would marry him if he asked."
291,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/292226-brian,3,"Feynman is a clear writer, and very good at showing how quantum theory manifests itself in terms of everyday phenomena (e.g. reflections in a pane of glass or a shimmering water mirage on hot asphalt in the distance)."
292,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/374517-jeffrey,4,"This book made my head wanna a-splode. Every page of it grabbed me, and the elements of QED are mind-boggling. As a non-physicist, I can't tell you much about QED after having read this book, but I enjoyed the hell of it."

298,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3500840-maximiliano-isi,5,Absolutely remarkable book that will change the way you understand the world.

299,0691024170,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4088376-aravind-ingalalli,4,"The author primely explains the related mathematical analysis in terms of fine verbal and graphical bundle and do not concentrate on the metaphysical significance of QED. On the whole, good treatment on QED, quite easily digestable for science students :)"
