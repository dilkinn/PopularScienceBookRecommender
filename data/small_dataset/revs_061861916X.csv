0,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"On Monday, an old friend came round to lunch, and, while we were having a cup of tea in the living room, remarked on the number of Richard Dawkins books on my shelf. Somehow, I'd never heard that she'd actually had Dawkins as a supervisor for one term when she was an undergraduate at Oxford in the late 70s; it was in connection with the course she was reading on animal behaviour. I asked what he was like as a person, and she was unenthusiastic. Clearly very intelligent, but there was something about him that she found disquieting. She wouldn't go so far as to say that he'd behaved inappropriately, there was never a specific incident she could point to, but she constantly felt that he was just an inch from the line. Well... charismatic, thirty-something male supervisor, attractive young female undergraduate, animal behaviour, you can see plenty of scope for that. And she said that, even then, he'd go on about religion. After a while, she became increasingly sure that his hostile feelings were rooted in some kind of personal disappointment he'd suffered, though she had no idea what it might have been.I asked her which Dawkins she'd read, and, like most people, it was The Selfish Gene and The God Delusion. She hadn't particularly liked either one. I can sympathize with her point of view. But, as other reviewers here have said, Dawkins is a more complex person than he's generally given credit for, and if you read The Ancestor's Tale you'll see another side. I suppose one could say that he's attacking religion here too, but the strategy is completely the opposite of the blunt, in-your-face assault he uses in the The God Delusion; to my mind, it's also far more effective. Rather than tell you what's ugly and wrong about Intelligent Design, he concentrates his energies on showing you what's beautiful and right about evolution, and how, far from contradicting traditional religious beliefs, it reveals them with a clarity that previous generations have been unable to see. I kept thinking of Saint Francis of Assisi, and his love of all living creatures. ""Brother bird, sister ant""... they're beautiful poetic phrases. But what do they mean? Evidently, this finch can't literally be my brother. There is no way that my mother could have given birth to him. The conventional explanation is that we're both ""children of God"", which is fine as far as it goes; the problem is that it doesn't really shed much light on the nature of our relationship. The astonishing thing about evolution, which forms the core of this book, is that it shows how the bird and ant truly are my brother and sister. Well, not quite brother and sister - in fact, they're very distant cousins. Dawkins traces the family tree, and shows precisely how we're all related. He starts with the obvious cases (apes, monkeys), then goes back to other mammals, and then further through reptiles, birds, amphibians, insects, sponges, plants and all the way to protozoa. On the way, he tells you some extraordinary stories. Well, that shouldn't be a surprise; think what interesting stories you hear when you meet up with a friend you used to know well, but haven't seen for a decade. Here, you are in some cases meeting up with people you haven't seen for several hundred million years.At the end, I felt, as I had never felt before, how we're all one family in the plain, everyday sense of the word, and how we're linked though the genes we share, which we've inherited from our common ancestors. It's a truly incredible thought. As Dawkins says on the last page: it's not so much that he disagrees with religious people, it's more that they're saying it the wrong way. If you are yourself a religious person who wants to learn to be closer to God and His Creation, you could do worse than read this book."
1,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/224453-jen,5,"Poor Dawkins - he gets a bad reputation. People think he's mean and nasty and heartless and elitist. Okay, I might have to grant people the ""elitist"" bit, because, well, I'm a bit of an elitist myself. But I dare you all to read this book and then tell me that Dawkins isn't a total squishy. Let's just say this - he stops in the middle of the book to talk about how much he misses Douglas Adams, who was a dear friend of his. He waxes poetic about evolution and how much he wishes he could meet our ancestors. He refers to Olivia Judson's ""Doctor Tatiana's Sex Guide for All Creation,"" makes a brief homage to it, and then sweetly states that he could never do the style justice (making clear along the way that he's read the darned thing, which delights me for reasons that can only be understood by someone else who's read the book, because it's Just That Fabulous). And he puts his wife in the index, even though the references to her are miniscule (and, in fact, much less frequent than in any other book). He credits his research assistant as his co-author. In general, he's a sweetheart.I will stop fangirling the man, now, and simply tell you that the science in this book? Is brilliant, wondrous, and awe-inspiring in its breadth. Fantastic book. "
2,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,4,"There are some facts the simple knowing of which seems to me to be a supreme achievement of our species. The fact that we are all made of stardust. The fact that 99.9999999999999 percent of all matter is empty. The fact that mass and energy can be expressed in terms of each other. Stuff like that.Pre-eminent among these to me, for sheer mind-expanding awe, is the fact that life on this planet has developed precisely once, as far as we know, and everything on earth has evolved from it. That means that when you go outside and lie down in the garden, everything you can see and hear – people walking nearby, their pet dogs, the squirrel darting past, the birds you can hear tweeting, the insects and tiny bugs crawling around underneath you, the trees the birds are standing on, the grass you're lying on, the bacteria in your guts – all of them are your cousins: you're quite literally related to them in the real, genealogical sense.If you go far enough back in time, in other words, you will eventually find a creature whose descendants evolved into both squirrels (say) and people. Indeed, the rules of heredity being what they are, you could even find a single individual who was a common ancestor to every squirrel and human alive. And indeed such an animal really did exist, around 75 million years ago in the Upper Cretaceous. It probably looked sort of mousey, and Dawkins estimates that he or she was our ‘15-million-greats-grandparent’. Squirrels are not ‘closer’ to this creature than humans are: we and they are equally related, having been evolving independently for the same amount of time.The Ancestor's Tale takes exactly this approach to exploring evolution. It starts with humans and works backwards – looking first at the common ancestor between humans and chimpanzees, and continuing until we reach the common ancestor of all life on earth. Dawkins's word for a common ancestor of more than one species is ‘concestor’, and there are only about 40 of them (!) between us and the origin of life more than three billion years ago. The Cretaceous mammal I mentioned above, which evolved into us and squirrels (along with all the other rodents, lagomorphs and primates), is Concestor 10 according to this schema.I think there's a lot of traps you can fall into when you start thinking about evolution. It's easy to feel, instinctively, that evolution is somehow teleological: that it's been working towards – if not us, then at least creatures that are increasingly complex and increasingly intelligent. But that of course is not the case. Things survive that reproduce themselves well, and there are plenty of single-celled organisms still with us that have seen no need to get any more complicated for millions of years. Bacterial life is in fact astonishingly varied and rich, whole phyla of creatures that branched off before multicellular life even came about; indeed, chemically speaking,we are more similar to some bacteria than some bacteria are to other bacteria.Just think about that for a second.Before Dawkins got distracted by religious idiocy, he was well known as being one of the scientists most able to explain complicated ideas in a fresh and accessible way. All his skills are on display in this work. It's not just the zoology and the evolutionary biology, where you'd expect him to be strong; there's also a fantastically lucid explanation of the biochemistry within a cell, and even one of the best explanations of the physics of radioactivity that I've come across. He is calm and careful; he repeats himself where necessary; he shares several teacherly witticisms; and he does all this without ever condescending to the reader. He allows paragraphs of complex material to sit, so that you can read and re-read them a few times before he carries on. Occasionally he cannot stop himself breaking out in exclamations of wonder or poetic meditation – as when he discusses the fossilised footprints of three early hominids from some three-and-a-half million years ago:Who does not wonder what these individuals were to each other, whether they held hands or even talked, and what forgotten errand they shared in a Pliocene dawn?His enthusiasm is infectious. The whole book is a fantastic exploration of this most beautiful piece of modern human understanding. It's full of astonishing anecdotes and scientific details about the natural world, but it also all ties together into a conception of life that's more awe-inspiring and more moving than any supernatural system could ever be."
3,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is the 2016, revised edition of this fabulous book. In this edition, Richard Dawkins is a co-author with Yan Wong. This is a very hefty tome, just under 800 pages. It is a marvelously inventive, masterful look at evolution, as seen from the point of view of homo sapiens travelling backwards in time, back to the dawn of life. Each time the route of evolution reaches a branch point with another species, it is called a Rendezvous; there are 40 rendezvous altogether. The book is extremely interesting and informative. Below I summarize some of the interesting facts I learned.Some creationists point to the so-called gaps in the fossil record as proof that the scientific theory of evolution is not sufficient to explain the development of species. But Dawkins argues that even without any fossils, the evidence for evolution would still be immense. The distributions of species on continents and islands, the patterns of resemblance, an genetic sequences are sufficient to prove evolution. Fossils are a welcome bonus. The gaps in the fossil records are not all that important.The agricultural revolution helped to support a larger population, but did nothing to increase people's health or happiness; in fact it did just the opposite.There is a very interesting discussion about our most recent common ancestor. That is to say, the human who is the common ancestor to all people alive on Earth today. It is very surprising, that the most recent common ancestor lived around 10,000 years ago.Silver foxes bred in captivity by D.K. Belyaev for twenty years were bred for tameness. After twenty years, the foxes behaved like border collies! They became friendly, sought human company, and wagged their tails when approached. They even looked like border collies!We were told when we were young that eating carrots help us see better in the dark. But this was a rumor started by WWII strategists to avoid revealing the secret of radar.The best analogy for genes is not that they serve as a blueprint, but rather that they serve as a toolbox of routines. So, while a large percentage of our genes is in common with those of other animals, our main difference from other animals is not the toolbox of DNA routines, but is instead the pattern of choosing genetic routines from the available toolbox. This is called the science of epigenetics, which has been around since Conrad Weddington coined the term in 1942.In 1866, Ernst Haeckel announced that the hippo is a close relative to the whale. This has since been proven through DNA; the hippo's closest living relative actually is the whale!The duck-billed platypus closes its eyes shut when hunting for food. Its duck bill is a very sensitive organ with 60,000 mechanical and 40,000 electrical sensors. The platypus swivels its bill back and forth, feeling for impulses from potential prey. It probably gets a detailed 3D image of electrical disturbances in its vicinity. It probably is doing some sophisticated beamforming to increase its sensitivity.Dawkins remarks about a lot of interesting speculations why humans are bipedal. He gives a number of arguments both why bipedal walking is helpful, but others why it is not.In 1954, the British Colonial Administration destroyed the ecosystem of Lake Victoria. Against the advice of biologists, the Nile perch was introduced to the lake, which destroyed fifty species of cichlids, and critically endangered another 130 species. This newly introduced predator had caused devastation to the local economies around the lake. This is the reason why bureaucrats should not try to play God, and play around with ecosystems.This raises the question, how did so many species evolve in the lake, in the first place? Dawkins makes some interesting speculations about how various species could be physically isolated in the lake, in order to allow the species to branch out due to evolution.Dawkins makes a strong effort to avoid repeating stories that he told in other books. Instead of repeating them, he makes references to his many other books, for the reader to see additional examples. This is so different from that of many other authors, who often repeat themselves from one book to the next.A variety of human inventions were anticipated in the animal kingdom. Some examples: echo-ranging (bats), electro-location (duckbill platypus), dam (beaver), parabolic reflector (limpet), infrared sensor (snakes), hypodermic syringe (wasp, snake, scorpion), harpoon (cnidarian), jet propulsion (squid). The wheel and axle was also anticipated; the rhizobium has a true axle and a freely rotating hub, driven by a tiny molecular motor. Such a wheel could not evolve in a large organism, which would involve twisting blood vessels.I personally loved the renaming of the concept of Intelligent Designers from ""Argument from Irreducible Complexity"" to ""Argument from Personal Incredulity."" The argument ""says less about nature than about the poverty of your imagination.""Dawkins speculates about what would happen if the ""tape of evolution"" were to be re-run in the forward direction, starting from pre-Cambrian times? What would happen if it were re-run a statistical number of times? Or starting from an earlier or later time? This experiment has, in a sense, been done to a limited extent in isolated locations like Australia, New Zealand, Madagascar and South America. Also, evolution in has turned out very similarly when allowed to run twice. Eyes have evolved independently 40-60 times, using nine independent optical principles!Echolocation has evolved at least four times in four animals; toothed whales, oilbirds, cave swiftlets and bats. The venomous sting has evolved at least ten times independently. True flapping flight has evolved four times. Parachuting and gliding has evolved maybe hundreds of times.These notes above represent only a tiny fraction of the thought-provoking concepts in this book. This is a challenging book to read, not only because it is so long, but because of the many complex concepts that are described. The authors even warn the reader at one point that certain pages can be skipped if desired. But the entire book is fascinating. With each species rendezvous, a fractal diagram portrays the branching, along with dates and contour lines; what a fabulous visual portrayal of the concept of evolution!"
4,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani,4,"The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution, Richard DawkinsThe Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life is a science book by Richard Dawkins and Yan Wong on the subject of evolution, which follows the path of humans backwards through evolutionary history, describing some of humanity's cousins as they converge on their common ancestors. It was first published in 2004, and substantially updated in 2016.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز چهارم ماه ژانویه سال 2018 میلادیعنوان: داستان نیاکان: سفری به آغاز حیات؛ نویسنده: ریچارد داوکینز؛داستان نیاکان با زیرعنوان «سفری به آغاز حیات» کتاب علمی عمومی نوشتهٔ ریچارد داوکینز در سال 2004 میلادی است؛ که با همکاری دستیار پژوهشی داوکینز، یان ونگ نوشته شده‌ است. این کتاب مسیر انسان در تاریخ تکاملی را از امروز تا گذشته تصویر می‌کند؛ و سفر را از انسان شروع کرده، به سوی پسرخاله‌ های قدیمی او در درخت زندگی می‌رود. در این مسیر به مرور با پسرخاله‌ های قبلی‌تر انسان، به عنوان «نیای مشترک» همگرا می‌شود. کتاب در سال 2005 نامزد جایزهٔ بهترین کتاب علمی اونتیز شد. چکیده: داستان به صورت یک سفر زیارتی روایت شده‌ است، که در آن مسیر همهٔ جانداران مدرن، به سوی منشا حیات پی گرفته می‌شود. انسان‌ها پسرخاله‌ های تکاملی خود را در پاتوق‌های میان راه ملاقات می‌کنند. در این نقاط تبارها منشعب می‌شوند. داوکینز در هرکدام از این نقاط تلاش می‌کند تا با استفاده از شواهد مولکولی و فسیلی، محتمل‌ترین نوع نزدیک‌ترین نیای مشترک را توضیح دهد؛ و در میان مسیر، جانداران مدرنی که در گذشته با انسان هم‌سفر بوده‌ اند را توصیف کند. سفر کلاً از چهل «میعادگاه» تشکیل شده که از «میعادگاه صفر» آغاز می‌شود و به سوی نزدیک‌ترین نیای مشترک انسان تا میعادگاه سی و نهم که باکتری است پیش می‌رود. با این وجود که داوکینز به‌ طور کل از درخت زندگی توصیف شده اطمینان دارد، در برخی از شاخه‌ ها هشدار داده که در زمان نوشتن، از وزنه ی سنگینی از مدارک بهره نداشته‌ است. داوکینز در هر نقطه ی ملاقات در میان سفر، داستان جالبی در مورد جانداران پسرخاله حکایت می‌کند. هر نوع تازه‌ ای اعم از گونه، سرده، و خانواده داستان منحصر بفردی را برای سرگرمی خوانشگر دربردارد. این ویژگی‌های عجیب به وسیلهٔ روش‌های تازهٔ زیست‌شناسی تکاملی شناسایی شده‌ اند، و با دقت در داستان قرار گرفته‌ اند تا نشان دهند چگونه نظریه تکامل داروینی قادر به توضیح همهٔ تنوع حیات بر روی کرهٔ زمین است. در این کتاب داستان‌های شخصی داوکینز در مورد موضوعات نیز به چشم می‌خورد؛ که در آن‌ها داستان‌هایی از دوران کودکی و دانشگاه خود نیز نقل کرده‌ است. برای مثال، او شگفتی خود را از فهمیدن اینکه اسب‌های آبی نزدیک‌ترین خویشاوندان نهنگها هستند را توصیف کرده‌ است. با اینکه کتاب به ترتیب زمانی نوشته شده‌ است، می‌توان هر بخش را به صورت جداگانه هم مطالعه کرد. به‌ طور کلی می‌توان داستان نیاکان را دانشنامه ای دربارهٔ موضوعات اصلی تکامل دانست. ایشان کتاب را به دوست و استاد اسبق داوکینز، جان مینارد اسمیت تقدیم کرده‌ است. ا. شربیانی"
5,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1148633-brian-hodges,5,"This book blew my mind so many times in so many ways. It is quite simply the most fascinating thing I have ever read about life on this planet. Dawkins traces our evolution from the present day back through the very first organisms on earth. He uses various ""rendezvouses"" to show the points where we connected with other species and phyla and what those connections say about us, about our biology and about life in general. By tracing our lineage back through these various “concestors” Dawkins makes you realize just how unique and amazing your own body is… amazing in ways you probably always took for granted. From the way we gestate to the fact that we have a spinal column to the way that our own cells even work. It was never a guarantee that we would have ANY of these things. It seriously makes you wonder how everything might have turned out had different evolutionary pressures been exerted millions, or even billions of years ago. For instance, had a meteorite not wiped out the dinosaurs, “we” would probably still be little more than tiny rodents scavenging for scraps at night while the REAL rulers of the planet slept.Dawkins touches on this latter aspect in the final chapter, with a series of thought experiments about how things might go down if evolution were to “rerun” from the beginning. Which aspects of life would be likely to sprout up again? Which aspects were far-fetched happy accidents? Perhaps one of the most mind blowing statements Dawkins makes is in reference to eukaryotic cells, which comprise every form of life on this planet except for bacteria. The formation of these special and absolutely “necessary” cells was such a long shot evolutionarily speaking that Dawkins doubts it likely to have happened twice. In fact he goes so far as to say he thinks that the formation of eukaryotic cells was probably MORE unfathomable than the initial spark of life itself! Whoever said scientists strip all the magic and wonder out of the universe has obviously never read this book.Dawkins' prose, as always, is fresh, illuminating, and often humorous, explaining heavy concepts so they make perfect sense to a layman. Seriously, if you're interested in this stuff at all, add this one to the very top of your list."
6,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5431286-david,5,"6-stars[NOTE: I like to provide a 6-star rating to a book when it has been able to keep me in a state of amazement almost continuously for at least 80% of its content.]A terrific book on evolution from the vast spectrum of creatures on this planet. Truly, a lot of information has been provided. Can be a bit heavy to people who may not be from a scientific academic background. Almost every topic that I read in the book kept me in a state of awe while I learnt new things. The book is a must-read for anyone who wishes to get mesmerized by stuff that exists on Planet Earth itself! :)HEAVILY RECOMMENDED!!"
7,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,4,"Wow. I like Richard Dawkins. I like what he has to say in The God Delusion and I like his tweets for the same reason. Lots of people don't like his confrontational stand on religion, but don't let that put you off here. First and foremost, he is an amazing scientist. This book is so comprehensive, it is daunting just thinking about it. When I collected it from the library and saw the size, I outwardly groaned, wondering how I would tackle it. I needn't have worried. Dawkins takes us on a 'backwards' pilgrimage through time, showing how we humans joined up with all other living creatures along the way. After getting through half the book and discovering that we'd already passed mammals, birds and fish, I wondered how interested I'd actually be in cnidarians, ctenophores or choanoflagellates, but they proved to be equally as fascinating. Dawkins breaks the information into short chapters, or rendezvous points, relating things back to animals we've already encountered along the way. Yet he doesn't stop there. He shows how we link with fungi, plants and bacteria, before finally considering how the first life forms began and whether or not this could be recreated. What I particularly liked was how Dawkins doesn't make guesswork for periods that we just don't know about. Where dates are so far away that we don't have the full picture (500 million years and counting) Dawkins relates what is known, then tells us the current theories. The gaps still to be filled are not a disappointment, but an exciting prospect of things yet to learn. I don't have a scientific background at all, though I was able to understand most of what I read. I did get confused with some terms and with trying to keep track of the different classifications (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species) or timescales (eon, era, period, epoch, age) plus all the subdivisions within these. Luckily the book was comprehensive enough that I was able to flip back to an earlier section, or refer to a chart to refamiliarise myself before moving on to the next tale. I was left feeling a little overwhelmed by the end and so I'll finish with a quote from Dawkins that encapsulates things - ""It is not pride in my book but reverence for life itself that encourages me to say, if you want a justification for the latter, open the former, anywhere at random. And reflect on the fact that although this book has been written from a human point of view, another book could have been written in parallel for any 10 million starting pilgrims. Not only is life on this plant amazing, and deeply satisfying, to all those whose senses have not become dulled by familiarity: the very fact that we have evolved the brain power to understand our evolutionary genesis redoubles the amazement and compounds the satisfaction."" "
8,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442308-gwc,3,"Fascinating zoology but plenty of flotsam. ""The Beaver's Tale"" ""The Duckbill's Tale"" and ""The Axolotl's Tale"" are outstanding examples of modern naturalism. The classical genetics is adequate but the molecular data is explained minimally and not compelling. More details on the challenges and uncertainties inherent in genomic sequencing and cross-species comparisons would have been helpful. When Dawkins is not discussing zoology the writing is overly verbose, and suffers the professor's conceit of assuming his readers are interested in his opinions on matters beyond his expertise which are infused with the type of absolutism he criticizes elsewhere in the book. The poor, strangely moralistic mathematics and tired political rants are best left for the faculty lounge or starry-eyed students. This is a good 600-page book that could be a great 300-page book with some vigorous editing."
9,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57901-jerzy,5,"Fantastic! If I'd read this in high school I would definitely be a biologist by now.Often I agree with Dawkins' views on creationists, but usually he's an obnoxious ass about it. Thankfully, in this book he only disses them occasionally. For most of the book he sticks to his strengths, i.e., clear and exciting explanations of the beautiful yet structured diversity of the natural world.Lots of nifty thoughts about how evolution works and how mind-shatteringly cool life is. There's an interesting structure to the book, traveling backwards in time from today to the origin of life, and telling tales or lessons from each of our major ancestors along the way. It made me appreciate how much more there is to life than the small handful of mammals, fish, birds, and trees we usually think about."
10,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4788401-lee-harmon,5,"While I read different genres, I only review books with a religious content. So, if I may be excused for one of my “liberal Christian rants,” let me say this: It’s a sad day when a book about evolution earns a spot on the shelves of a religion blog. It simply astounds me that half of all Americans still do not believe in evolution. The evidence is so overwhelmingly against a young earth that if Christianity is going to survive, it must pull its head out of the sand and reinterpret the Bible’s creation story (anything but a literal interpretation!) before it alienates the coming generation, who will simply know better.This book will help. I’m not a fan of Dawkins’ anti-religion tirades, but when he sticks to his evolutionary biology, his writing is a pure delight. It’s insightful, highly intelligent, and witty. The subtitle of the book is A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution, and it’s a long journey backward in time from present-day humans to the beginnings of life four million years ago.You’ll meet Cro-Magnon man, the Neanderthals, chimpanzees and gorillas, monkeys, rodents and rabbits, reptiles, sharks, flatworms, sponges, fungi, plants, and far more, each with their own unique role and story to tell.Scientific understanding is, and ever will be, in a state of transition. As we learn, we shape our theories to fit the facts. It’s an exploration that never ends, an exciting quest for truth that Dawkins excels in sharing. He stops often along this journey back in time to introduce interesting life forms and their evolutionary sidebars, evoking wonder and appreciation for the real creation story that far exceeds any ancient tales. It’s such a treat that I’m almost envious of long-time creationists who can, by opening their minds and turning the cover of this book, open themselves up to a new world of wonder.You will see the world in a different way after reading this."
11,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"Richard Dawkins' ""the ancestor's tale"" is the story of all life on Earth told in reverse order. It starts from us ""moderns"" and goes back to our closer cousins, all the way back to the common ancestor of all life on Earth. Dawkins uses the word ""concestor"" to refer to a common ancestor. It's a fascinating tale. Even though I had to go through nearly 800 pages, I wasn't bored in one single moment. There were times, of course, when it got a little more technical, but all in all I learned so much since a wealth of information is presented in each chapter. We are all African apes. Chimpanzees are our closest cousins and we share roughly 98 percent of our genes with them. You learn that natural selection grants no possibility of foresight. In other words, evolution does not plan ahead. To Alfred Wallace and Charles Darwin, co-discoverers of natural selection, the geographical aspect of natural history gave away the fact of evolution. If species were created independently, why should a Creator choose to put 50 species of lemur on Madagascar, but nowhere else? Why should the Galapagos host a set of finches so different from species on other oceanic islands, but strikingly similar both to each other and to birds on the nearest mainland? For Darwin, peahens choose peacocks simply because, in their eyes, they are pretty (sexual selection). For Alfred Wallace, there's something more than the outward appearance. The bright feathers are a token of their underlying health and fitness. In the fruit fly tale, we learn about DNA mechanism. Textbooks of biology are wrong when they describe DNA as a blueprint. Embryos do nothing remotely like following a blueprint. DNA is not a description in any language, of what the finished body should look like. On this planet, embryos follow recipes. Creationists foolishly liken darwinian natural selection to a hurricane blowing through a junkyard and having the luck to assemble a Boeing 747. They are wrong, of course, for they completely miss the gradual, cumulative nature of natural selection."
12,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350233-casey,4,"After finishing The Selfish Gene, I rushed out to the store to buy another of Dawkins' books. While the size of this tome was quite intimidating, I found the premise utterly fascinating. The narrative traces humans' evolutionary ancestry, from primates to ""concestor zero,"" or the beginning of life on Earth.Dawkins' knowledge of zoology shines as he gives examples of the fascinating animals that share some of our genes. Readers will undoubtedly learn about plants and animals they had never heard of before, from Australian marsupials to the strange creatures that inhabit Madagascar. The book reads like a novel, and after finishing it I feel more connected, not just to my own species, but to all the creatures around me that share in this crazy thing called life."
13,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81791013-michael-kress,4,"Dawkins was the author who made me realize how fascinating evolutionary biology is. I had read a few of his books before I started this one, but they were all around 300 to 400 pages. This one is 614 pages. It goes back in time, starting in the present moment until we finally reach the dawn of evolution. What an interesting way to write a book! It tells the stories of many species and the common ancestors that we share with them. As the book progresses, our cousins get more and more distant. Eve's Tale explains how the Y chromosome was passed down from mother to daughter through all generations and can be traced back to a hypothetical “Eve.” The Peacock's Tale explains how male peacocks evolved colorful, flashy looking feathers to attract a mate. The Dodo's Tale is a sad story about extinction. Dodos never had to deal with predators, so they never evolved any ways of escaping from them. When humans arrived on their island, they were so slow and easy to kill that they went extinct in a short period of time. There are many more stories like these in the book. The ending of the book is well written and comes around full circle in a cool way. If you've never read anything by Dawkins, I would recommend The Selfish Gene or River Out of Eden. But if you have already read a few of his books, this is a good one that goes a little more in depth."
14,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"Richard Dawkins has done an astounding job producing this book. If it were not for his other great works, The Selfish Gene and The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene, The Ancestor's Tale would be his best work in evolutionary science. It matters not one bit that it's a summary and synthesis of others' primary work: great scientists have always been able to look out across their field of expertise and write a defining work of value for both scientists and the educated public.My only, slight, quibble with the book is that in the decade since it was published there has been significant change in many parts of the ""tree of life."" More species have been discovered, more fossils found. Most importantly, molecular analysis across species of shared genetic haplotypes and DNA from mitochondria has unleashed a tidal wave of new information allowing a more precise determination of our common ancestors, especially the most distant. Dawkins used the earlier results of this same research when writing this book in 2003, but he notes in the book itself that it would have to be revised soon with new information. That, of course, is the way of science and what makes it exciting.Thus, I'm happy to find that the second, updated, edition will be published in early 2016 (see here: The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life) with the latest scientific developments and additional evolution-relevant species ""tales."" I hope that one of these is ""told"" by a member of the fascinating Fungi—one of the three great multicellular kingdoms—with which we share an unidentified common ancestor roughly 1.1 billion years ago. The original edition naturally includes this rendezvous along with background information, but omits the tale.Should you wait for the new edition? No, unless your a critic of fine detail. The deep time and awesome diversity of evolution will not change. Our place as a species relative to the rest of life will not shift. And Dawkins' inspiring prose will remain."
15,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"What an interesting way to look at evolution, from the present back into the past in the format of & a homage to Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. He chose 40 major stops along the journey & told some great tales. Thankfully, these were usually from his perspective so there wasn't any foolishness, but he was entertaining.I found the backward format a really good way of cementing various relationships into my mind better. There was a lot of new (to me) & fascinating material about how evolution works. He came up with great examples & occasionally wandered into other interesting areas such as human races.“Natural selection is a beguiling counterfeiter of deliberate purpose.”“Evolution, or its driving engine natural selection, has no foresight. In every generation within every species, the individuals best equipped to survive and reproduce contribute more than their fair share of genes to the next generation. The consequence, blind as it is, is the nearest approach to foresight that nature permits."" I've read several other books on evolution by Dawkins, so there was some repetition, but he cut down on much of that himself by referencing where he originally went into detail. As an audiobook read by him & Ward, it was fantastic, as always. Highly recommended."
16,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Dawkins presents evolutionary biology in a Chaucerian format. As with the pilgrims in The Canterbury Tales, each of Dawkins tales is about pilgrims on their way to a common destination, in this case the beginning of life. Each group of species marches back in time rendezvousing where they share their most recent common ancestor, what Dawkins calls a “Concester”. The first rendezvous is six million years ago (6 Ma) where we, our Homo and Australopithecine ancestors share a Concestor with the chimpanzees, bonobos and their ancestors. Dawkins describes 40 rendezvous such as the apes meet the monkeys at 25 Ma, the primates meet the rodents and rabbits at 75 Ma, the chordates meet the echinoderms at 550 Ma and ending with bacteria. Working backwards helps eliminate hindsight, assuming that a creature evolved in a certain way because in the future it would be important. Each tale not only describes some life form but some aspect of science associated with it. For example we learn how scientists use the fossil record and genetic techniques as evaluation tools. He shows how dates and evolutionary branches are derived from genetics using mitochondrial DNA, the Y chromosome and triangulation of DNA sequences. He explains how dates are determined using dendrochronology (tree rings), paleomagnetism, and radioactive decay. As we follow the path of evolution in reverse, we learn the science behind it.I read the updated 2016 version coauthored with Yan Wang. It reflects recent discoveries such as those of the Denisovans, whose story takes the place of the Neanderthals in the earlier version. Improvements in DNA extraction and sequencing enabled scientists in 2009 to derive the entire genome of a Denisovian from a 40,000 year old fingertip. There are many other revisions and corrections to the first edition published in 2006. In another update convergent replaces related development to explain the origin of many flightless birds such as the Dodo. Genetic studies now show they are descended from pigeons that became isolated on remote islands where they thrived growing big and losing their wings. Our understanding of the tree of life is always changing. Below are other samples of Dawkins’ discussions that caught my attention.Dawkins presents evolution as a flow of groups of individuals. Species arise when intermediate creatures become extinct. But as evolution occurs there are no distinct lines. A variety of archaic Homo sapiens blurred the dividing line between Homo erectus and modern Homo sapiens. Classification can be arbitrary and is often contested. New genes work their way through the group and if the group is isolated from other groups eventually it becomes distinct. This all takes time. If closely related groups come in contact with each other there is hybridization. Modern humans apparently interbred with Neanderthals 45000 years ago even though the two lines had separated 500,000 years before that. Similarly modern humans interbred with Denisovans. Dawkins offers perspective citing the ring species. He points to California salamanders in mountains that form a circle around the Central Valley. At the southern end two distinct populations won’t interbreed, but each population interbreeds with its neighbors in the other direction. This interbreeding continues uninterrupted all around the mountains coming back to the neighbors that won’t interbreed. There is an unbroken chain between the two. Are they separate species? Similarly gulls that won’t interbreed in Britain interbreed with their neighbors to the east and west forming a continuous chain around the world ending with each other. Like the salamanders, the gulls are connected to each other through the unbroken chain until at the ends the differences seem to have become too great. Dawkins uses the ring species as an example of what happens with all species through time. There is a similar uninterrupted chain from us to our australopithecine ancestors and to the beginning of life. Only the demise of intermediaries lets us define species. Was the most recent common ancestor, Concester, of humans and chimpanzees bipedal? Some scientists believe this is the case. The chimpanzee may have reverted to knuckle walking. What drove bipedalism in the first place? Ability to see over tall grass, ability to carry food back to a mate, ability to squat feed for long periods when snails and worms were more abundant than fruit, or as Dawkins thinks, sexual selection? Even back then females may have liked their mates to stand tall. They and/or their males may also have preferred less body hair. No other ape lost its hair so sexual selection as opposed to natural selection seems reasonable. In most animals females select their mates, but Darwin thought that men selected women for less body hair. Whichever way, both sexes would be affected. A mate with a bigger brain may also have curried favor.Dawson educates us on plate tectonics and its evolutionary effects. The formation and breakup of Pangea into Laurasia and Gondwana had significant implications for the diversity of life. Subsequent breakups isolating Madagascar and Australia explain their unique animals. We get the Platypus Tale. Is the platypus primitive? It had as much time to evolve as we have. It lays eggs and has a bill but what a bill – supersensitive to movement and electric field disturbances. What other mammal can locate its prey without listening, seeing or touching it? Dawkins explores the nerve connections between bill and brain and speculates that the platypus visualizes the feedback from its bill just as we do the feedback from our eyes.Dawkins’ tale of the sea squirt shows the tongue and cheek that is sprinkled through his writing. This amazing creature starts out with a notochord and nervous system making it a chordate, a member of our phylum. It looks like a tadpole as a juvenile swimming around then in its adult stage, it lands head first on a rock and permanently attaches itself. It digests its nerve system, notochord and other parts and turns into a big bag that filters the plankton from seawater. Dawkins digresses ”A second Aldous Huxley might project fictional human longevity to the point where some super-Methuselah finally settles down on his head and metamorphoses into a giant sea squirt, fastened permanently to the sofa in front of a television.” Perhaps today we should substitute tablet or phone for TV. In either case, once settled, Dawkins notes that it “eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.” We are entertained by the stories of many other bizarre creatures, behaviors and relationships. Who would, aside from a zoologist, think of the echinoderm (starfish, sea cucumber, etc.) as sharing the most recent common ancestor we have with another phylum? The starfish’s radial design means it has no front or back, left or right. It may lead with any of its five legs. Its nerve cord forms a circle. Its anus is on top and mouth on bottom. Yet the molecular biologists say its genes show it evolved from a bilateral animal just like us.What about the bdelloid rotifers? All of these tiny aquatic animals are female. There is no need for males, no shared gene pool. Each rotifer reproduces a new organism with two sets of chromosomes as do animals that reproduce sexually. Thus over the millennia as mutations accumulate the genes will become even more diverse than those in a shared pool. Millions of years of asexual reproduction have resulted in more than 450 species of these unique creatures. Then there are the animals that keep their males in place – literally. Some trigger fish females carry their diminutive males on their sides for use when and as needed. Some scale insect females carry their males as mere specs on their legs.Dawkins explores the beginning of life. He looks at RNA World theory which holds that life started with RNA as both a replicator and an enzyme, in essence a self-replicating catalyst. He points to experiments that show segments of RNA taken from viruses can replicate and evolve in water. He discusses the idea of life forming in rocks, going even further afield than theories about life starting around hydrothermal vents. He point out that cracks in rocks are teeming with bacteria that live off of chemical processes without benefit of the sun. Finally he ponders the different ways life could have evolved. If we went back to the beginning and started all over again what would life be like today? What aspects have been convergent and which contingent. Many features evolved more than once, for example eyes, echolocation, and flight. Others such as our big brains and use of language evolved only once. Perhaps most significant is the incorporation of bacteria into archaea forming mitochondria which made life for us eukaryotes possible. Nick Lane argues in his book Power, Sex, Suicide that this event would be unlikely to ever be repeated.The Ancestor’s Tale is a tour de force, a comprehensive view of evolutionary biology full of fascinating details about diverse life forms. It is packed with the latest scientific theories. Above all it demonstrates the interconnectedness of all life. This clearly is heartfelt by Dawkins. His awe and enthusiasm for his subject is infectious. Reading it was an experience. After 700 pages, I was sorry it was over. For those with a serious interest I can’t recommend it highly enough."
17,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I love this book. It's not the kind of thing I usually read, because I prefer fiction to non-fiction by far, at least when I have a choice about it. And I really, really loathe Dawkins' The God Delusion, largely because of the tone he takes toward people who are religious believers. But The Ancestor's Tale is mostly just science, and it's written in an accessible, almost conversational way. It actually has literary ancestors (ha), in the form of The Canterbury Tales, which Dawkins chose as his format to tell the tale of a pilgrimage through history to find our ancestors. He does slip in some references to his own beliefs, but here they aren't too offensive or intrusive.When I say 'accessible', I don't mean 'dumbed down'. The science and maths and the theory and the sheer detail is here. I read a couple of reviews that people found it boring once it got to a certain point because there's 'too much detail' about things like bacteria. Which I think is more of a 'your mileage may vary' attitude than anything -- I think Dawkins gave the space to the bacteria that they deserve, all things considered.There's a lot of speculation in here, too -- but so much of science is speculation. Dawkins is fairly clear about when he can and can't 'prove' things, and explains the methods by which they can be proved if they can. You don't have to have a huge knowledge of science or maths to understand -- some, and an interest in it, I suppose, but not so very very much."

The first rendezvous is six million years ago (6 Ma) where we, our Homo and Australopithecine ancestors share a Concestor with the chimpanzees, bonobos and their ancestors. There are so many thought-provoking concepts in this book, but this is a challenging book to read, not only because it is so long, but because of the many complex concepts that are described. But the entire book is fascinating. With each species rendezvous, a fractal diagram portrays the branching, along with dates and contour lines; what a fabulous visual portrayal of the concept of evolution! I am continually amazed the genius of Dawkins...this book is so comprehensive, it is daunting just thinking about it, let alone researching and writing it!"
19,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/270879-robin,5,"This is my favorite book in the whole world. Someday it may be eclipsed by something else but for now it's this. What I love most about this book is the number of times I found myself thinking, ""Wow, I had no idea"". It makes perfect sense when you think it out, but the entire premise of the book, that every living thing on earth, from human being to plant to bacteria, shares a common ancestor, that actually existed at a point sufficiently far enough in the past. The book consists of a ""pilgrimage"" to that ancestor modeled loosely after ""The Canterbury Tales"". "
20,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44504-brian,5,"I've been a fan of Dawkins for a while solely based on interviews, but this is the first of his books I've actually read. It works its way backwards through the evolutionary tree, detailing how all living things are related - how a stranger on the street, your dog, your house plant, bacteria and you are all distant cousins. It's a fascinating read, technical enough if you're interested, but not so much so that it's threatening to the non-science minded. It's broken into various ""tales"" - ""The Howler Monkey's Tale"", ""The Hippo's Tale"", ""The Blind Cave Fish's Tale"" - a la Chaucer - which makes the size of the book a bit less daunting. Best of all, it's excellent ammunition for the next time you find yourself in a debate with someone arguing for ""intelligent design."""

Witty, brilliant and engaging, you will learn a great deal about evolutionary biology, and a million fun and intriguing facts. Whether you agree to disagree with the facts establishing evolution as a law of science, this book is worth your time.

Yep."
23,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,4,"Hefty Tome That Explains Evolution in Great DetailIf you have a hardcopy of this book, you know just how thick it is, and how dense the content is. Each chapter is another essay on the incredible mechanisms by which selective mutation, adaptation, and reproduction over millions of generations have led to the plethora of life on Earth, and how the process is not directed by a divine being waving life into existence, but rather an unfathomable number of successes and failures among individual creatures, with the only measure of success being reproduction, can lead to such a mind-boggling diversity of species.Dawkin's recurring theme as he delves further and further back to our more distant common ancestors is that evolution, while not directed from above, can often lead to convergence at similar outcomes, such as the independent development of eyes (truly a miracle of gradual evolution), sonar, poison, and various survival mechanisms in different locations and eras over hundreds of millions of years. While I think many readers, no matter how educated or knowledgeable they may be about evolutionary biology, may still struggle to accept that all this complexity and diversity is not a result of ""intelligent design"", I think Dawkins makes the case repeatedly and in great logical detail, and in the end it is we ourselves, as conscious and thinking intelligent beings, that can recognize and understand that we would not exist if it weren't for these incredible mechanisms over vast ages that have produced ourselves and all other life from microscopic life billions of years ago, our common ancestor."
24,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11331153-andy,5,"Your 30-million-greats-grandparent was a shrew. Your 270-million-greats-grandparent from over half a billion years ago looked like this worm. Did I mention that its mouth doubled as its anus? This book is filled with ways ways of making you feel very small. This is the type of book that doesn't let you ever see the world the same again, and proves that religion doesn't have a lock on the feelings of awe and the sublime.In an article from 2009 ""Growing Up in Ethology"" Dawkins describes this book as ""the largest and most demanding of my career"" noting that he almost gave up on it several times. It's understandable, apart from the contents, this book is audacious in its scope and detail. I got so deep into it that I was having recurrent dreams about its concepts and creatures.There's a lot of fascinating stories here -- too many to mention but I can't help going through many of them. When reading this I wanted to tell people how amazing this is, but I don't know too many people that are interested in science, so pardon me, this is my outlet. These are some that stuck me as particularly noteworthy.>>The Axolotl's Tale is about ""pedomorphosis"" which is where the juvenile of a species can become sexually mature without fully developing into an adult, and so it and its offspring never do. The axolotl does look like a larval-salamander hybrid which remains in the water. Many species carry within them the ""instructions"" to metamorphize through various stages (tadpoles into frogs for example), so strictly in theory, they could go backward too. This happens in newts which start as a larva, then emerge on land for some years, then return to water and regain some larval characteristics. It's speculated many species we see could be ""between stages"" like ostriches. As big as they are, they're actually juvenile chickens with their stubby wings. Some have speculated we are juvenile chimps and Dawkins doesn't entirely discount this idea.>>The Hippo's Tale was an amazing explanation of their close genetic relationship to whales, and how certain land animals returned to the water and became ""fish,"" evolving quickly because water-living took away their struggle with gravity. Likely there was a common ancestor which split into camels (and others) on one side, and hippo's/whales on the other, but we shouldn't imagine the ancestor necessarily looked like either. I also didn't know that camels originally evolved in what would have been considered North America, during a period when the position of the continents looked much different.>>The Howler Monkey's Tale explained how mammals lost their color vision due to becoming nocturnal shrew-like creatures during the age of the dinosaurs when they had to hide underground and only emerge at night. After the dinosaurs died off they re-emerged and re-gained the ability to see color which they'd retained in their genes, but this ability has been ""re-enabled"" in many independent ways.>>The Lungfish's Tale explains how we likely emerged from the water for the first time, and explores various fish today that ""walk"" on land for short periods. It is likely that our ancestor developed the ability to walk because it was attempting to get BACK into water from tide pools that left it stranded away from food sources.>>The Galapagos Finch's Tale showed in a powerful way how quickly evolution can occur due to certain ""bottlenecks"" or die-offs.>>The Fruit Fly's Tale's explanation of Hox genes and how they control the development of an embryo. This chapter takes a fairly complex concept and makes it understandable.>>The Lamprey's Tale tells about how different their haemoglobin genes (for carrying oxygen in the blood) are from ours. We split off from a common ancestor long, long ago and duplicated our genes for globin several times while lamprey's are from a very ancient ancestor, they predate this split and use much older globin genes. They independently evolved a system for oxygen carrying, as birds and bats independently evolved flight.And ""independent"" or ""convergent"" evolution is another big theme here. There are a couple of chapters that touch on how geographic distance evolves specialized species, some of which take up similar niches and roles that are found in other continents. Australia for example has evolved its version of the dog, the flying squirrel, the mole, etc. Dawkins sees the kangaroo as a sort of hopping version of the gazelle, and makes a good case for it.>>The Brine Shrimp's Tale explains how vertebrates are likely descended from worms that learned to swim on their backs, and adapted their internal organs for such. The Brine Shrimp's organs have similarly adapted so that it is no longer technically swimming ""upside down."" Some catfish today swim upside down and have started to adapt a camouflage system that is essentially the opposite of those who swim normally, i.e. their bellies are darker than their backs.>>The Rotifer's Tale explores asexual reproduction, how originally pairs of chromosomes became independent from one another by gradual mutations, whereas our pairs are copies of one another. Dawkins engages in an interesting discussion about whether sex is really necessary, and the natural selection pressure benefits it creates.>>In the Salamander's Tale Dawkins explores ""ring species."" The Central Valley of California has a section of mountains which form a ring around a valley. Salamanders live in the mountains around the valley, but do not venture into the valley itself. Those on the east side appear quite different from the western one, but in fact they are the same species and form a vast ring of gradual differentiation in coloring, those on the opposite sides are just too far from one another to interbreed. This is seen in a species of gull that forms a ring species that encircles the whole Earth! Dawkins makes the point that we humans could be a ""ring species"" too if the intermediates between us and the chimpanzees had not died off. When viewed this way it totally blurs the lines when thinking of separate species to begin with.>>The lengthy penultimate chapter ""Canterbury"" was the best thing I've read and better than any documentaries I've seen on how life theoretically began. Dawkins is honest about the many challenges, and lists a variety of scientific experiments which show how these can be overcome, at least in theory. He goes into detail about enzymes, mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes and makes it all understandable. Some textbook diagrams would have been appreciated, but the descriptions are still well-handled.There's many more examples of course. This book in the updated 2016 edition is over 700 pages and although this is the only book on evolution I've read, I imagine I'd be hard-pressed to find another that goes into this level of detail while still being this reader-friendly. Dawkins strikes a good balance.It's worth mentioning that this is a challenging read at times, primarily in the early chapters. (The chapter on Gibbon monkeys particularly so, but don't get discouraged!) At times there was more focus on methods than I probably wanted. For example, I don't need two pages of explanation of logarithmic graphing, I'll take your word for it that the graph is accurate.This book fits well with my overall ""Ligottian"" cosmic perspective on life. At one point in ""The Beaver's Tale"" Dawkins remarks, ""Do you protest that there aren’t ‘really’ any genes for behaviour; only genes for the nerves and muscles that make the behaviour? You are still wrecked among heathen dreams."" He doesn't exactly call us puppets of biology, he's subtler than that, but he makes a compelling argument. He uses the phrase ""clockwork mechanism,"" and a bit later in the same chapter he discusses how beavers held in a bare room will attempt to make dams when there's nothing at all there. That really put things in perspective.Dawkins very rarely speaks on religion or creationism in this book, he assumes the reader believes evolution is true -- which it is. But he does leave us with this, with which I wholeheartedly agree:""My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world. They represent a narrowing-down from reality, an impoverishment of what the real world has to offer.""I've thought something like this for years, and reading this book can only open eyes to how amazing the real world is."

In order to better explain evolutionary science, Dawkins metaphorically borrows Chaucer's journey to Canterbury to travel back in time. We start in the present day, and then examine our common ancestors from mammals, to birds, reptiles, etc... all the way back to bacteria and how life itself may have come to be. It's a compelling argument.The book is full of ideas to contemplate. For example, in ""The Peacock's Tale"" chapter, he addresses human bare skin and why. ""Humans don't just have bare skin on their rumps like monkeys. They have bare skin all over, except on the top of the head, under the arms and in the pubic region. When we get ectoparasites such as lice, they are often confined to these very regions. Lice need hair, and Pagel and Bodmer's first suggestion is that the benefit of losing our body hair was that it reduced the real estate available to lice. Two questions arise. Why, if losing hair is such a good idea, have other mammals who also suffer from ectoparasites kept theirs?"" (And why is it still retained on our heads, etc...?)I won't give away the answers, but the analysis is thoughtful and persuasive. This is not a beach read. It demands your attention and concentration in order to consider the themes presented. I thought the time invested in the book was time well spent. 5 stars."

He starts the journey working backwards, beginning with Homo Sapiens and then the earliest bipedal apes like Homo Habilis, then ending with the earliest replicating life, the one that would've started it all billions of years ago. Unfortunately, it didn't leave any fossils behind (soft-body creatures tend not to sadly but it has happened at a site in China) but if we work the molecular clock backwards we can deduce that somewhere in the 'primordial soup' a molecule began to copy itself, and it was really good at it.As we meet the different pilgrims Dawkins explains how evolution shaped life in the most exciting and unusual ways. Some creatures on our planet function in the most ridiculous ways. I don't wish to spoil these parts but it is awe-inspiring for sure.This was a fun and truly educating read for me. I learned so much about the different kinds of life that inhabit our planet. Human beings are just one tiny branch in the grand tree of life.

I hold Dawkins as very skillful at this - he always manages to use varied sources to unify his arguments and, moreover, this makes any text of his captivating and complete. Also, he does not shy away from making fluid ventures into social and political commentaries for example on racism, sexism or (expectedly) creationism. I mostly found these to be succinct and well connected.As a person who has read a few books about molecular biology, genetics and evolution, and studied an undergraduate degree in Ecology for one year, many ideas did not feel very fresh to me, hence the book only summarised what I have already learnt. Consequently, it felt like another TV documentary about animals for general public with the same commonplace topics and arguments - yet of course, the book was deeper indeed, this is just how it felt a bit to me. I found this to be especially true of the second half of the book, since the first dealt with humans, apes and chimpanzees, so its anthropological outlook was more novel to me. This by no means is a criticism of the book, it should only serve as a warning to prospective readers who have either studied a STEM degree (escpecially biology-related) or read many (pop) science books. This book is indeed about evolution and animals which is Dawkins' expertise, yet all the other science and theories he explains like the central dogma of molecular biology or the evolution of eucaryotic cells should already be pretty familar to such readers.Last warning: Especially in the second half of the book I found his ideas and writing to be lengthy - the length of the book no longer feflt justified. This is just a thing to keep in mind.Recommended to readers who are interested in the evolution of biodiversity and who have not read many other pop-science books about evolution, molecular biology, Earth history and archaelogy.

31,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,3,"Non-Fiction. 4 billion years of evolution, practically in real time. To avoid any ""human-centrism,"" Dawkins -- famous for his outspoken stance against creationism -- does this backwards and models the journey on Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Scared yet? Well, it's not in rhyme or Old English, but Dawkins does tend toward lofty language and wild, rambling digressions. It bugged me at first, but over the course of this SIX HUNDRED PAGE BOOK, I got used to it and even grew to appreciate Dawkins and his sly humor. He actually made me laugh out loud a couple times.The pilgrimage conceit holds up: we travel backwards in time to meet a series of common ancestors, starting with concestor 1 (for ""common ancestor""), where mankind splits from the chimpanzees, and ending with concestor 39, the first life on Earth. At each stop he describes what that ancestor may have looked like, where it lived, and how long ago.The Chaucer conceit never got off the ground. Most tales, like ""The Armadillo's Tale,"" don't tell you anything about the animal the tale's dedicated to. There are a few exceptions to this, though, like ""The Beaver's Tale"" or ""The Brine Shrimp's Tale."" Those actually address the qualities of the animal in question, and were some of my favorites because of it.One of the best things about this book is that Dawkins freely admits -- early and often -- that a lot of what he's talking about is based on limited data and/or guesswork and may be wrong. He goes out of his way to offer alternate theories and differing opinions, though he always singles out the position he finds most likely. I love it when scientists admit they don't know things, and Dawkins has no problem with that. He can sound arrogant and in love with his own voice (the number of times he quotes himself and his previous books!!!), but at heart I think he really loves the subject and wants to share it with people. It's a long, and sometimes difficult, book to read. It gets into genetics, math, biology, taxonomy, chemistry, pretty much everything, and at times the explanations get messy or too technical. I liked the biology parts best -- the different ways organisms evolve and why, and there was plenty of that to keep me interested. It's a lot of information, though still a very basic look at the diversity of life. I started out reading it like homework -- 10-20 pages a day -- but after I got the hang of it, I was reading 30 and 40 pages without breaking a sweat. Did I enjoy it? I think so? I definitely know a little bit about a LOT of things now, and it made me want to read more about evolution.Three stars for the book and the information it provides, and FIVE stars for me for making it through."
32,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10781757-otherwyrld,4,"I approached a book of this size and scope with some trepidation (seriously, you could kill someone if you hit them over the head with the hardback edition), how could this possibly cover the whole history of life on Earth. I also note that I have had issues in the past with the authors writing style, which can run to the overly verbose to my taste, as well as the huge hype over his anti religion stand that tends to get a lot more publicity than his actual books do.So, on the whole this monumental work succeeds admirably, notwithstanding my above mentioned misgivings. This book takes us on a journey from our most recent ancestors backwards to meet shared ancestors (or concestors as the author describes them) along the way, a la The Canterbury Tales, with the ultimate goal being the beginnings of life itself. Along the way the author tells numerous tales in the same way as Geoffrey Chaucer did to illustrate various points. In some ways these are both the best and the worst parts of the book, as this is where the authors writing style flourishes the most. The more straightforward descriptions of the species/genus (etc) that we encounter are easier to read though often quite dry and highly technical.There is a large prologue which looks at the history of hominids before it heads to the first rendezvous with Chimpanzees, then Gorillas, Orangutan and the rest of the primates in turn. This section alone takes up a third of the book, and mammals as a whole takes up half. This leaves little room for the rest of the species, with only insects taking up a large section in the rest of the book. Plants are particularly sidelined, which is a shame because it makes the book rather lopsided though I can understand racing through some sections because there really is very little to say about them. It did make the latter third of the book drag a little bit though and I slogged through to the end. The author wisely keeps his religious digs to a minimum, though he can't resist it the whole time. I can't really talk about the co-author as his voice doesn't really come through that much. The book has some nice colour plates to illustrate some of the species discussed, but the line illustrations leave a bit to be desired. mostly because they were shrunk too much to fit into the paperback edition. The overall idea of a fractal design for the various rendezvous' was a nice touch, and there is an extensive bibliography if you want to explore further. "
33,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,4,"Here's an ambitious bet: to tell the story of life on Earth as an odyssey, a pilgrimage backward in time. The approach is indeed original as, reading this book is like boarding a time machine where at each chapter we meet one of our ancestors -that Dawkins describes, showing in which ways its anatomy or way of life can serve a better understanding of why we are what we are. 40 ancestors are thus passing us by, from primates to mammals in general, vertebrates, invertebrates and, all the way until the unicellular organisms.Each encounter is also the occasion for a digression (a 'tale') on topics ranging from fossils conversation and datation, bipedalism, sex, the notion of 'race' or, again, the shaping of some organs. He even dares to defend (although not dogmatically) the 'primeval soup' hypothesis! (well...)A big book, those qualities are strangely enough also the bad points. The topic is indeed so vast that, some chapters are obviously more captivating than others, making it an hard and challenging read during the passages dealing with those ancestors that don't interest you that much. Yet, always a great populariser Dawkins delivers here one of the most thoughtful and complete story of life on Earth. Huge! "
34,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,5,"Richard Dawkins is the best writer on the topic of evolution that I have encountered. He is able to explain concepts in such a way as to make them easily understandable. All of the books that I have read by Dawkins have been very informative and entertaining as well. The Ancestor's Tale is a cleverly structured book in which Dawkins takes the reader on a journey chronologically back in time through our evolutionary history. Each successive chapter is the next branch of our evolutionary tree where Homo sapiens merges with our next most recent kin. The book cleverly mimics Chaucer's Canterbury Tales wherein each new member of the group tells a story. In The Ancestor's Tale, each of these ""tales"" is told by one of the species that we are joining with in the current branch. The story is always about some aspect of evolution that is pertinent in some way to the species telling the tale.  The Ancestor's Tale is the best book that I have read on evolution up to this point and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this subject."

He is at his best when focussing on evolutionary biology as much as possible, and on religion the least amount possible. The Ancestor's Tale consists almost exclusively of evolution and biology related content, and Dawkins does an amazing job of taking his reader on an epic journey.While I was fascinated by the concept of a journey backwards through time, meeting fellow lifeforms on the major forks of evolution, the execution could have failed in numerous ways. Fortunately, Dawkins delivers a captivating story from the very first chapter, and unfailingly continues to amaze until the last page. Not only does the author explain important branch-offs on the evolutionary tree; he describes the modern day features of our distant cousins in a way that creates a new found appreciation for the almost magical power of natural selection. The Ancestor's Tale is incredibly original, brilliantly written and covers a huge amount of terrority while providing enough depth to continually amaze."

A must, must read for everyone- especially those with a passion for nature and life sciences. "

49,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy,4,"This doorstopper of a book was a lot more fun than you might think, considering the subject matter. Richard Dawkins has a certain way of telling stories that makes them palatable even when, like me, you aren't exactly learned in the subject. I wouldn't say I'm ignorant about the topic at hand, and I have certainly known better since middle school than to perceive evolution as if it's ""humans evolved from modern apes,"" but I learned a heck of a lot of stuff here. In between all the little stories about creatures I'd often never heard of and occasional anecdotes about Dawkins's personal experiences and relationships with other scientists, there were tales of discovery, of archaeological and biological history, and of how nature works. Even though it did feel a tad long and drawn out for me, now at the end of the road I think I appreciated that it took its time, with a leisurely feel that made every encounter with another ""concestor"" feel important enough to give time to.I would like to share some specific individual thoughts and quotes on the book here.I liked Dawkins's discussion of evolution not being a concept of other beings on their way to becoming us. They weren't unfinished when they were alive, just like modern animals today aren't unfinished because they're not us and none of us are unfinished because one day our descendants will be different from us.I enjoyed the explanation of why we all have one ancestor, as impossible as that sounds, because of DNA's existence. If there were other types of creatures before DNA's ""birth"" that replicated a different way, they left no descendants because every creature alive today has DNA, and if there were later ones coming into existence, they'd immediately be eaten by bacteria.DNA is compared to telegrams and I liked that analogy very much. It's because they have to use the same letters that make up meaningful words to also indicate pauses, like STOP, and DNA has that situation too how its codes are run end to end, with some junk here and there. A cool factoid: If you find a population that's been isolated for X years, then you know the common ancestor WE have with them can't be younger than that. An alien looking at human and gibbon genitals would think the males are more related to each other than they are to the females of their own species. If we interpret based only on physical factors that look similar, we may be making the same mistake.There's some cool info about color vision and how some old-world monkeys are primarily color blind but some females have color vision. It was all explained really neatly.Richard Dawkins had a pet bushbaby as a kid and sometimes it would pee on him from above. Just throwing that out there.I like how he discusses the uncertainty of his branches, how recently evidence he's using was developed and how accepted it is, and the fact that new evidence may change where certain creatures join the ancestor pilgrimage.There was a good discussion of the meaning of ""primitive"" with regard to whether a species is primitive in one way and therefore primitive in another (""primitive"" means ""resembling the ancestor""). A good quote that sums it up: ""There is no substance called Essence of Antiquity that pervades the blood and soaks into the bones.""There's a really good metaphor about a bobbing cork as an explanation of overall trends in evolution. If you tracked it over time and saw that it was going toward the east, you know that looking back, but if you just analyzed its movements as it bobs up and down and gets tossed around in the ocean, you couldn't necessarily say where it will end up based on such small movements.Sometimes Dawkins would just throw out a comparison that would come out of nowhere and be funny. Case in point: ""Capable of swallowing a medium-sized lawyer whole.""There's a really well-explained section on how evolution is continuous and the categories between species are pretty artificial. No parent was a different species from their child, and a time machine taking people back a thousand years at a time should result in arriving at a population each could interbreed with. Overall of course, they're evolving, but there's no distinct time where you can say ""the parent was X; the child is Y."" Kind of like when you're warming up your bath water, there's not really a specific degree where you'd say the water is no longer warm but hot. A quote: ""More than once I have seen a reference to the larval sea squirt which, when the time comes, settles down to a sedentary life and 'eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.'""Starfish, by the way, are really weird. Eeuuuwww.The Grasshopper's Tale discussed human ""races"" in association with how grasshoppers kinda have races based on what their song sounds like, and how they tend not to mate with different races, but will if you do something to make their song different. I was kinda irritated with how he digressed into some oversimplified or flat-out misleading representations of how race works. First off, he claimed people are asked to check one of 5 race boxes on forms, and offered ""Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, Native American, and Other"" as the choices. If I see boxes like these, they invariably include Asian and/or Pacific Islanders. Which is weird because he mentions Asians in the same topic. But then he goes on to say that mixed-race doesn't have its own name, offering ""Blue has a name. Green has a name. Blue-green does not."" Yes it does? Lots of blue-green mixtures have names, like turquoise. He goes on to say Affirmative Action isn't FAIR because it assumes an individual is being repaid for wrongs done to his ancestors. This seems a crass oversimplification and sadly pretty typical of privileged white dudes, especially since he probably should be well aware enough of social factors to realize that the legacy of slavery and other terrible events and trends affecting people of color are still resulting in those populations experiencing prejudice and poverty on a much higher level than whites do. Affirmative Action acknowledges that to get the same opportunities, disadvantaged populations have to come a longer distance from farther away (overall, as a population; obviously there are individual white people who are more disadvantaged on some axes than individual people of color, but this deals with an overall phenomenon, not with exceptions to the trend). Affirmative Action was not invented specifically as a reparations measure. It acknowledges CURRENT disadvantages that come from living in poverty and almost definitely having decisions about your life being made by racists who don't know they're racist but make racist decisions. Those racist decisions may sound less like ""his dark skin is ugly to me, so I'm not giving him a job"" but more like ""he speaks like a typical black person, which to my white ears has become synonymous with uneducated and rough; therefore I perceive him as not being as professional, or perhaps assume my customers will conclude that and therefore I will hire a person who speaks like me."" We'll pretend it's not about race but about readiness and deservingness of the job, but if someone's natural hair or accent or style of dress automatically makes us think less of them or makes us expect them to separate themselves from norms of their community to be acceptable to ours, those are racist perspectives. Those are the kinds of things Affirmative Action is attempting to counteract. Though for the record that program helps more white women than anyone, and we women contend with prejudices surrounding our competence, our ability to do certain types of work, and our likelihood of abandoning the career to make or care for babies. Anyway.Richard Dawkins demonstrated he does not know what Affirmative Action is for. Next.A quote: ""The third school of thought is, in my opinion, bonkers. Or, to use more parliamentary language, wildly and irresponsibly unrealistic."" Haha.He made a Philip Pullman reference and that made me happy. I was thinking about mufela from The Amber Spyglass when Dawkins started discussing microscopic creatures that evolved the only known natural wheel, and then he mentioned it too.I thought it was pretty awesome that toward the end of the book Dawkins went into detail about how evolution itself can evolve--that creatures who are better at evolving may have a better chance of survival, so therefore evolution's processes themselves can be improved through evolution.A final quote to close out my review: ""This pilgrimage has been a trip, not just in the literal sense, but in the countercultural sense I met when a young man in California in the 1960s. The most potent hallucinogen on sale in Haight or Ashbury or telegraph Avenue would be tame by comparison. If it's amazement you want, the real world has it all."""
50,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4568480-giuseppe-d,5,"Not even sure where to start on this one, it was a very exciting backwards journey from our species to the very origin of life, which probably looked nothing like what we call alive nowadays but rather just a self replicating organic molecule, nothing more than that.But this book is just as much about evolution as it is about other fields in biology such as zoology, comparative anatomy, genetics, phylogenetics, embryology, neuroscience.For instance, how are new genes introduced into a genome? Well, it turns out that 'new genes aren't added to the genome out of thin air. They originate as duplicates of older genes. Then, over evolutionary time, they go to their separate ways by mutation, selection and drift.'Or other interesting facts, like that the closest living relatives of hippos are whales!Or how we sometimes forget that our way of perceiving the world is not the only one. Playtpuses, for example, 'have about 40000 electrical sensors distributed [...] over both surfaces of the bill.' They use these electrical sensors to perceive the weak electric fields generated by their prey (while the prey use its muscles to move around).We also discover how many times gliding and flight have separately evolved as examples of convergent evolution. And how places like Australia and New Zeland, due to their historic isolation, provide cases for explaining how the evolution of species there is quite analogous to what happened in other parts of the world with each one occupying their own niche.I want to end this review with a citation that sums up why you should read this book: 'not only is life on this planet amazing, and deeply satisfying to all whose senes have not become dulled by familiarity: the very fact that we have evolved the brain power to understand our evolutionary genesis redoubles this amazement and compounds the satisfaction.' "
51,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4551268-sara-g,5,"This beautiful book was really captivating. I like Dawkins a lot, but I know he comes off as really abrasive to many people. In this book, though, rather than constantly being on the attack, he's describing the beauties and wonders of the natural world. I like his softer side.It's written in the form of a pilgrimage (like the Canterbury Tales), back to our most distant ancestors. It's human-centric for no reason other than relatability. Dawkins takes pains to mention that a similar pilgrimage could be focused on any living species today. He pauses at key moments in our evolutionary history to discuss our relationship with what he calls ""concestors"" - shared ancestors with other species on Earth. It's fascinating stuff, but very dense in places. My favorite part was the discussion about how life may have arisen on Earth and the ""RNA World"" origin theory, which I was previously unfamiliar with. This is why I read good popular science. The science I learned in school is painfully outdated. I've added quite a few books to my TBR based on Dawkins's recommendations and references here. This book isn't for everyone, but for someone with a decent scientific background, I think you could gain a lot.End note - I keep going back to the description of a Douglas Adams Doctor Who script mentioned in this book, where a time traveler keeps going back in time to weep for the dodos before they became extinct. I love this imagery."
52,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/362402-snehal-bhagat,5,"Political economy basics are often explained with the help of an analogy: we imagine a beach in summer with people sun-bathing; for the sake of simplicity, we assume that the beach is one-dimensional- a straight line running from left to right- and that the people are distributed approximately equidistant from each other. An enterprising ice-cream vendor comes along with his cart and sets up shop - where should he position himself if he desires to maximize his sales?Clearly, anywhere; for as long as he has a monopoly, people will walk from all over the beach to buy his product. For purposes of illustration, we imagine him settling somewhere near the extreme right of the beach. Now, should a second vendor selling ice-cream come onto the scene, and discover that people will buy ice-cream from the vendor closest to them, where must she position herself? Obviously she should set shop adjacent to the first vendor, but slightly to his left; she can then maximize her sales by cornering the bulk of the market. The loss of sales then forces the first vendor to move his cart to the left of vendor two and the jostling continues; it is straightforward to see that in a few iterations, both vendors end up next to each other close to the center of the beach in their bid to maximize their sales. The fictitious beach, of course represents a political issue, the bathers are the voters and the vendors the political parties; the goal is to maximize votes instead of sales (1). The first case represents a dictatorship, the second the two-party democracy; in the latter, over time, both parties grow to resemble each other as they take up near-identical stances on most issues, often differing only in semantics. Unless, that is, the two parties vary in their assessment of how voter preferences are distributed on an issue - if one party believes they are clumped more to the left, while the other believes the majority leans to the right, sharp divisions can occur, as is the case here in Australia where our (effectively) two-party system in federal politics is now polarized over a proposed carbon ETS.Exit political economy, enter evolutionary biology; for this is where the analogy ends. Whereas ice-cream vendors and political parties are prepared to move to maximize sales and votes on the basis of their assumptions about the distribution of bodies and voters, creationists and evolutionists are camped firmly on either end of the belief scale; both sides preach only to their respective choirs, and it is not clear why. The distribution of people with regards to their belief varies, but it is safe to say that most are either mildly agnostic or mild believers; and yet, it is the strong views that color the debate and polarize opinions - for the creationists the evolutionists shall join Darwin in hell and pay for their lack of faith, and for the evolutionists, creationism is good for a laugh, or two, but for little else. Dawkins appears to be at the forefront of the rather acrimonious debate and draws more than his fair share of the creationists' ire (2). Which is a shame, really, for just as Chomsky's political writings have the unfortunate consequence of discounting - or at least distracting from - his brilliant work as a linguist, so too do Dawkins' views on God and religion prevent many from acknowledging his stellar contribution to our understanding of nature, and of our place in it. It may seem surprising that there even is a debate, in light of all the evidence, but the problem is that in a game-theoretic sense, religion 'plays' first, during the early formative years of children and thus enjoys a distinctive first-mover advantage, because science, to which the child is exposed only in school, plays a late second; nor do the oft-dull and dreary textbook treatments of science help advance its cause. This is precisely where leading scientific intellectuals such as Dawkins have so much to offer, and which he does admirably here, as always.To the premise of the book then: we may not all have descendants, but we all have an unbroken line of ancestors - each of whom survived long enough to reach child-bearing age and pass on their genes - fighting off predators, battling disease and natural disasters in the process; which is a fascinating thought, made even more so to consider that all that adventure does not lie merely in the human part of our evolutionary history. The journey Dawkins undertakes in this book then, is to track our shared ancestry - not merely that of every human being, but that of every single living creature - all the way back to four billion years to build a family tree that extends over hundreds of millions of great-grandparents. And yet by no means is this a Handbuch of sorts on speciation, rather, it is a delightful elucidation on the workings of evolution, a 'Who do you think you are?' on a scale that has absolutely no parallel: This is the book of life.(1) Establishing themselves close to the median of the voter preferences on just one axis does not of itself translate into votes- for that the voter preference on each issue and the weight of importance attached to it by the voter needs to be aggregated. (2) This polarization manifests itself in unexpected ways; in a recent ABC interview of Dawkins by Andrew Denton, for instance. Mindful, perhaps, of the consequences of appearing empathetic to his subject's views and alienating the conservatives among his viewers, the otherwise immensely capable Denton was unable to set a consistent tone for the program by committing himself to either a friendly or hostile line of questioning, which made for some extremely uneasy viewing. "
53,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"A tour de force by a great teacherThe conceit here is to imagine that we can go backward in time to when our linage split off from some other branch, say to when the evolutionary line that has led to Homo sapiens split off from the line that has led to chimpanzees. That would be Dawkins's Rendezvous point #1 on page 100 which took place about six million years ago.Like the characters in Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales,"" we are pilgrims traveling toward a spot, not in geography, but in time; and along the way we meet up with other pilgrims, eventually with all of life's creatures until we are gathered together in Rendezvous #39 where we meet our most distant relatives, the eubacteria. At each rendezvous point there is a ""concestor,"" the common ancestor of all the lines of creatures that are now joined. Thus Concestor 1 was the ""250,000-greats-grandparent"" of both humans and chimpanzees. What Dawkins does at each point is to imagine what the concestor might have been like. Thus Concestor 1 would be an ape probably more like a chimpanzee than a human, a hairy ape that probably didn't walk upright, etc.Prior to Rendezvous 1 there is Rendezvous 0 in which all of humankind meets together with the humans that went out of Africa 30,000(?) years ago.At each of the rendezvous points there are tales, as in Chaucer's work. There is ""The Tasmanian's Tale"" in which it is related how the Tasmanian people were slaughtered. There is ""Eve's Tale"" in which we learn about mitochondrial DNA which is passed exclusively from mother to daughter. And later there are tales from the duckbilled platypus, the lungfish, the grasshopper, the redwood tree, etc. In each of these tales Dawkins, in his inimitable manner, focuses on some aspect of evolutionary biology and illuminates it for the reader. Some of the tales are difficult, but most are easy to read and fascinating to follow.One of the strengths of this book is in the clear and engaging way that Dawkins presents the material and his forthright expression, and his honest way of separating what is his informed opinion from that of a scientific consensus. One thing I have always admired about Dawkins is his ability to be candid about what he knows and what he doesn't, and his courage in expressing unpopular opinions.The question is, should the general reader buy this book and invest the time and effort in following Dawkins's pilgrimage? For those familiar with the great evolutionary biologist's work, this question answers itself. A new book by Richard Dawkins is an event to be celebrated. For others who want to learn something about evolution from one of its foremost experts (and celebrities, by the way) this book is highly recommended. The sheer expanse of Mr. Dawkins's knowledge and his infectious enthusiasm will inform and delight the reader. I suspect that most readers will learn more about how evolution works from this single book than from almost any other that I have read, and that includes works by such illuminati as Stephen Jay Gould, Ernst Mayr, and Edward O. Wilson. Incidentally, I believe that The Ancestor's Tale is a better read for most people than Gould's monumental The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002) if only because it is more accessible and less technical--not to mention about 750 pages shorter!Some quibbles: I think Dawkins overrates sexual selection in bringing about evolutionary change in some cases, e.g., in bipedalism, and in the growth of the human brain (cf. Geoffrey Miller in The Mating Mind (2000)). It seems to me that natural selection had to be the driving force in something so felicitous as freeing our arms to carry and to work, and in the development of something so expensive and radical as a greatly oversized brain.I also think that his idea to identify the lake, for example, created by the beaver, as part of the extended phenotype of the beaver is going a bit too far. I prefer to think of the lake as part of the beaver's ""culture,"" and the behavior that created the lake as part of the phenotype of the beaver. Our airplanes and computers are part of our culture. Our ability to make them is part of our phenotype. (For Dawkins's full expression on this topic see The Extended Phenotype (1982).)Here are a couple of examples of Dawkins's entertaining and elegant style: Referring to the fall of the dinosaurs, he facetiously imagines that Shelley's celebrated poem, ""Ozymandias,"" which mocked the vainglorious works of kings, was entitled ""Ode to a Dinosaur."" Indeed, how the mighty have fallen. (p. 255) Talking about a sea squirt larva which gives up its mobile life to become sedentary (with attendant changes in neurological form), Dawkins remarks, ""...when the time comes, [it] settles down to a sedentary life and 'eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.'"" (p. 370) One of the best parts of the book, not to be missed, is the concluding chapter, ""The Host's Return"" in which Dawkins talks about re-running evolution. He speculates on which adaptations might and might not be returned. Certainly flight, which has evolved independently some 40 to 50 times would be seen again. But would the ""swollen"" human brain and the development of syntactic language evolve again?Although Dawkins has addressed the so-called argument from design many times, I don't think he has ever demonstrated its paucity more eloquently and succinctly than he does beginning on page 549 where he calls it the ""Argument from Personal Incredulity."" His point is that to say something must have been designed because it is so complex really says ""less about nature than about the poverty...[of the speaker's] imagination."" On page 602 he adds, ""Ultimately design cannot explain anything because there is an inevitable regression to the problem of the origin of the designer.""And finally I have a question for Professor Dawkins: why are there no viruses among the pilgrims? --Dennis Littrell, author of “Understanding Evolution and Ourselves”"

Additionally, I was fascinated, engaged, and in a few cases blown away. With apologies to Richard Dawkins (and Geoffrey Chaucer), I didn't much enjoy the format, but this is a minor complaint. It just felt forced and artificial the way Dawkins attempted to squeeze his story into the series of ""tales"" as an homage to The Canterbury Tales. Otherwise, the entire book was enjoyable.Beginning at the present, renowned scientist Dawkins takes the reader on a reverse journey through time, tracing humanity's evolutionary past through a series of ""rendezvous"" with other animal species (and larger groups). For the most part ignoring extinct species, the tale looks for branching-off points (speciation events); for example, the most recent about 6 million years ago when we last shared an ancestor with chimpanzees. Each rendezvous is accompanied by a helpful graphic showing how far back the story has gone, which animal groups are ""joining"" us on our ""pilgrimage"", and which geological eras/epochs are involved.The Selfish Gene remains my favorite Dawkins book, but this one is powerful in its own right."

Dawkins mirrors the Canterbury Tales framework*, with us as a species going on a pilgrimage back in time to meet the common ancestors we share with each of the other species on earth, all the way back to the first life form that came out of some kind of primordial soup. Along the way, each pilgrim we meet tells a story that elucidates the process, theories, and methods of study behind evolution. It was a dense and aggressive read, but also one that brims with Dawkins' fascination and love for his subject. His ability to communicate his wonder for the world and the scientific process through which we understand it is full of self-reflection, candor, and optimism. I feel better about humanity knowing he is in it. I try to read one ambitious book a year, and this is it***Christ (haha) he is such a genius **Or a carry over from last year.... because I suck at reading hard things right now."

Wilson (to name a few) will revel in the way that Dawkins journeys from the tip of the branch (modern man) to the trunk of the tree at the beginning of all life on earth. Each waypoint in the journey is a junction at which another branch of life rejoins ours on the way to the trunk at life's earliest moment, and is an opportunity for Dawkins to explore nearly every aspect of the way science has categorized, discovered, studied and theorized upon the vast diversity of beings that do and have inhabited our planet. It's an amazing contrast to The Sixth Extinction that I finished just prior."

While I was reading the book my mouth was open with surprise and fascination. The book hit a point which must be on when one reads ""web""/""online"" articles about some scientific discovery... it underlines respect and awareness what a science means!I read about the author (and his colleague) that he is a modern pit-bull of Darwin ideas, and I can understand why. This is not meant in a pejorative way, rather as his way of approaching and interpreting (biological) evolution. His skills have amazed me, I learnt and understood a lot. He did not only describe processes but he also offered and presented methodologies how scientists look for/check (possible) answers, so it is an insight into their work - to remind the ones who might say: ""what they know/how they can know it!?"" - so now, I know. The mere size of a book (around 700 pages) tells you that this is not for ""fastfood"" thinkers, that it requires your attention and dedication to know, however its content is magnificent as well. How can I know it? I got to R. Dawkins through various sources and channels which prize him pretty much. Plus, I am aware that when he touches uncharted areas it is his challenge how to try to answer difficult questions - however not based on ""emotional"" and ""opinion"" ground but on facts and data (this comment is more for people who know a bit how science/scientists work)... So, if you want to challenge your imagination, if you want to learn and know something fabulous and fascinating about life, open this book and read it thoroughly!

68,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"" is a beguiling literary trek through the taxonomy and history of life on Planet Earth; one that's led with ample eloquence by eminent evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. In this vast tome Dawkins has crafted what is indeed the popular scientific equivalent of Chaucer's ""The Canterbury Tales"", taking us along a long journey back to the dawn of life itself, approximately 4 billion years ago, via a molecular phylogeny designed by his former undergraduate student Yan Wong. But it's a long, long trek that's quite unlikely to be viewed as tedious by the reader. Here, Dawkins is truly at his most expansive, using this taxonomy to discuss the compelling issues of contemporary evolutionary theory and history, in which he covers everything from genetics, speciation, convergent evolution and mass extinctions to microevolution, sexual selection, biogeography, and the relevance of plate tectonics to past and current biogeographic distributions of organisms. Relying on Wong's intricate molecular phylogeny, Dawkins takes us along to forty branching points - previous geological moments - in that phylogeny, where we meet the ""concestor"" - the last common ancestor - of all organisms at that very point. It is a quite compelling, often insightful, narrative that Dawkins admits does owe much to Chaucer's legendary ""The Canterbury Tales"". Dawkins doesn't hesitate to interrupt the relentless ebb and flow of his narrative in a series of individual ""tales"", that are designed illustrate some unique trait of a given species, and then, by mere extension, serve as the jumping off point(s) for riveting discussions on some aspect(s) of modern evolutionary biology. A classic example is the section that he devotes to the sauropsids, which consists of lizard-like and dinosaur-like (archosaurs, including birds) reptiles in the chapter entitled ""Rendezvous 16"". In the first of these tales, ""The Galapagos Finch's Tale"", Dawkins recounts the decades-long fieldwork of ecologists Peter and Rosemary Grant who have been studying microevolution in the Galapagos Finches. He focuses upon the aftermath of a severe drought in 1977 that led inevitably to sharp declines in the populations of several species, observing that those individuals in the dominant species, Geospiza fortis, who were only 5 percent larger than their peers, were the ones who survived; a classic example of ""a small episode of natural selection in action, during a single year."" Within the same species, the Grants and their coworkers observed selection pressures resulting not only in larger body size, but also in larger beak size too. In the chapter's next tale, ""The Peacock's Tale"", Dawkins emphasizes the importance of sexual selection, arguing persuasively that it may have had a role in shaping the course of human evolution, perhaps via preferential selection of females for ""smarter"" males. That is followed, in turn, by ""The Dodo's Tale"", in which Dawkins discusses not only the Dodo's extinction, but also the tendency towards flightlessness in bird species inhabiting remote oceanic islands. While Dawkins has crafted a most compelling narrative in this vast book, ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"", is far from perfect, especially in its depiction of the fossil record. Much to my amazement, he doesn't discuss the existence of long-term stasis in the fossil record, predicted by the theory of punctuated equilibria, which has been substantiated by decades of extensive fieldwork by paleobiologists, ever since the publication of the classic 1972 paper coauthored by noted American paleobiologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould (This is a rather peculiar omission since Dawkins has been a staunch critic of punctuated equilibria.). Nor does he discuss, except only in passing, the diverse, radical differences in the compositions of marine faunas during, respectively, the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, which have been noted for decades due to excellent fieldwork, and more recently, by excellent statistical modeling done by paleontologist Jack Sepkoski and his colleagues at the University of Chicago. And he also misses the important history of predator-prey interactions that form much of coevolution, which has been discussed admirably elsewehere by noted marine ecologist Geerat Vermeij. But, in retrospect, my criticisms of Dawkins' omissions are relatively minor, simply because he has accomplished successfully, the arduous task of making both the taxonomy and history of life a most beguiling tale. Without question, ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"", should be regarded for a long time as one of the classics of popular evolutionary biology literature.

69,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28305884-maryann-glotzer,3,"I've always been interested in evolution and thought it would be interesting to read a book that could catch me up on all the new information since my last Anthro class 50 years ago. This book actually did a good job of that. Unfortunately, the author does use footnotes but he also has to tell you how he knows the scientist. The discovered was the author's student, professor, mentor, fishing buddy! There is lots of information if you can handle the pretentious tone."
70,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45815668-jordan-penney,2,"Dawkins does a good job of summarizing basic college Biology and the concept of natural selection. He generally oversteps his bounds in critiquing religion, and he also adheres to plenty of beliefs that could easily be used to give credit to religion, obviously something he was not trying to do. In general, I would say that Dawkins' attempt at Logos was often very rocky, but it is easy to see his love of Darwin, whom he so desperately clings to as his main source of Ethos legitimacy. The whole thing was only slightly more entertaining than a textbook, and I fell asleep many times trying to finish it. I won't be reading it again, that's for certain, I want to keep my sanity."
71,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100956678-jon-golan,5,"A visionary title - I wrote many essays on its various subjects. The premise is clever and executed flawlessly. A great introduction to zoology and bio as a whole (if you know bio, you may skip some parts)."
72,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9199325-stefan-matei,5,"Geneticists tell us that every single person on Earth is at the least 50th cousins with every other person on Earth. On a broader scale two closely related species can be considered cousins; and it is this broad sense of the word ""cousin"" I'd like to make use of below.Throughout his tales Dawkins exposes the attempts to coexist between cousins in an ever changing habitat. As it turns out, these involuntary attempts sometimes succeed, resulting in complex symbiotic relationships, and sometimes they end up taking whole species out of existence. But they are always an evolutionary arms race for survival. As our pilgrimage advances back in time, we meet more and more cousins converging at each rendezvous point. I call it ""our"" pilgrimage although, as Dawkins puts it, this journey could have started from the point of view of any other existing species. At Rendezvous Point 1 we, human pilgrims, join our evolutionary cousins, chimpanzees and bonobos. We shall later meet other mammals, followed by the other vertebrates, invertebrates, all the way back to meeting our chlorophyll dependent cousins, the plants. Although the journey back in time will have many stops with unfamiliar Latin sounding names, Dawkins does a great job of always keeping you updated and clear about where you are along the pilgrimage -- you know... just in case you don't have a doctorate in zoology. At each rendezvous point, the author recounts interesting tales concerning the cousin animals which are about to join the band of pilgrims. Every newly recruited species, genus or family has its own peculiar features, often ones that are relevant to our human anatomy or otherwise interesting for humans.After a total of 40 Rendezvous Points our pilgrimage culminates with the eubacteria, the ancestor of all surviving organisms. ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life"" is a history of life, a history of life going backwards in the form of an epic pilgrimage. Along the way, any of our cousin pilgrims can tell a tale. And it's those tales that form the main substance of the book. "
73,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4803593-alisia,5,"Finally!!I think I spent more time with this book than any other in recent years...a solid six weeks. That's not to say it was boring or hard to get through, quite the opposite. I enjoyed slowly savoring the massive amount of information up for offer in this tome. Richard Dawkins' is a prolific author, and it took me a while to decide which of his books to read first. This one has been sitting on my shelf for about a year, and I finally picked it up to read concurrently with a Genetics and Evolution class that I am taking via Coursera. It was a splendid idea.Dawkins tends to go on and on about the craziness of religion, but thankfully that was mostly absent in this book. I like to focus on the topic at hand, without the jests and jeers at those with a different view. And the topic at hand in The Ancestor's Tale is an over-arching tale of evolution on this planet, going backwards in time (from a human perspective), all the way back to the origin of life. More than anything, Dawkin's vast knowledge of zoology shines, and I learned more than I ever thought I could in one month about the variety of life on this planet, and how they have evolved to be so darn interesting. His modeling of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales lends itself very well to the subject, and was a great method of (non-fiction) storytelling.As it was written ten years previously, one thought must accompany the reader. Evolutionary biology, genetics, molecular studies....these fields are constantly changing, with on-going innovations and new developments. Therefore, you must read a book like this with an eye to the present, and new research. For example, since Ancestor's Tale was published, a complete Neandertal genome was sequenced, and a few of Dawkins' statements are somewhat out-dated and not supported by recent findings. The same holds true for the molecular clock, and calculating the rendezvous points with various ancestors. I would love to see an updated edition of The Ancestor's Tale published at some point."
74,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3277375-charles-bond,5,"Great History of evolution! My favorite of Dawkins' books, because it processes every little peice of information, leaving no rock unturned. Being 700 or so pages it took me a while to finish it, but my hours were not wasted. It goes through every known evolutionary split from us now, to billions of years ago with some of the first life on earth. It covers the full spread of biological diversity and the different inventions of nature, like how a Platypus uses electromagnetic waves to detect small animals, or how much brain power the nose of a mole uses, with it's powerful sense of smell and touch. It covers sensitive concepts like race, gender, religion, and politics. Not claiming that science has power over all those things, but stating that there are biological advantages and disadvantages to things like sexual dimorphism,race, arms races, and religion. For those who turn down this book due to a motivation from their religion, I will let you know now this is not a religion bashing book. If your looking for that kind of thing this isn't it, it simply states the long history of life as we know it, while in the sidelines having small lessons about carbon dating, DNA, and sexual and asexual reproduction. This is a must read for anyone who pursues knowledge in the field of biology and who has ever pondered on the order in which life has diversified, although being so incredibly long I will suggest that you don't start reading until you have a lot of spare time, as it is best not to space out your reads as I did, so that you can retain more of the information."
75,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11678700-johan,4,"While parts of this book boil down to the long list of older and older latin ancestor names and some of their traits that is the premise of the book, some of its little forays into random tangents still make it a pretty inspiring read.An interesting factoid that never occurred to me, for instance: if we'd ever manage to burn all the fossil fuels and other biomass that did not get fully decomposed and recycled, we would no longer have an oxygen atmosphere, but revert to the reducing carbon-dioxide atmosphere we had prior to the advent of cyanobacteria.It's kind of fascinating that every breath of oxygen you or anyone else ever took has been manufactured from other materials by a plant somewhere, not just once, but once for each time it was ever burned in the metabolism of whatever animal breathed it in. Like pretty much all of Dawkins books, these little parentheticals pop up every now and then. Also, which may be the main draw of his books, he helps you think and reason about science and facts, pursue thought experiments, highlight thought traps and dead-ends, slips and over-simplifications, rather than just serve you fully packaged and pre-digested data."

I find him extremely tedious, arrogant, pretentious and the fact that when pressed on the question of creation he'll negate the concept of God but will embrace some weird ""Alien genetic intervention"" just rubs me the wrong way. Great poster boy for atheism and anti-theism, scientifically speaking he's got the lingo down and at times he can be mildly amusing, but much like Charles Darwin before him, too quick to dismiss the spiritual aggressively and that pretty much makes his works indigestible for the most part. This book, so far, being the one exception to the usual reaction I have had with his books which was to bin them as soon as I finished reading them! How books like ""The God Delusion"" and ""The Blind Watchmaker"" get the publicity and acclaim they do get, I'll never really understand! "

The book highlights a number of interesting confluences in the evolutionary record which tell the tale of how human beings came to be the way we are today, biologically speaking. In this book the long-dead evolutionary progenitors of our species are given a voice. Over the course of this book, I found myself constantly surprised at the many creatures, big and small, who contributed in meaningful ways to my very existence. I feel this whole journey can be summed up with one quotation from the brine shrimp's tale: ""We are modified worms swimming on our backs, descended from an early equivalent of a brine shrimp which, for some long-forgotten reason, turned over."""
78,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,5,"In the ""Ancestor's Tale"" Richard Dawkins takes a unique approach to the evolutionary pathway which ultimately resulted in humans. Given that evolution does not proceed linearly and the fact that 'humans' were never an inevitable outcome of the evolutionary process, Dawkins begins his story with homo sapiens then runs the tape in reverse to discuss each branching of the evolutionary tree going back in time to our earliest ancestors. At each junction (for example the divergent branch that led to apes and humans) he discusses the common ancestors of each branch (which he terms 'comcestors'). With a clear writing style, the use of thoughtful metaphors and unique insights, Dawkins demonstrates why he is one of the very best writers of popular science today."

Dawkins' use of the frame story style of ""The Canterbury Tales"" made for a very entertaining and enlightening read for a layman like me. My mind was really blown by the paradox of why asexual reproduction is not the norm for evolution. I love how weird life and how strange evolution makes us and other creatures. I also love how in biology like many other scientific areas it seems every rule/law has an exception and in nature there are many exceptions to the taxonomy and other boxes we like to impose on the world. It's amazing how much we know about our common ancestors and ancient life and it's equally amazing how little we know about all kinds of other things at the same time."

Ancestor’s Tale, which is the story of evolution told in the format of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, makes for an accessable, occasionally pleasant read (which, in my experience, is rare with science books). Different animals are shuffled out to tell “tales” throughout the book (their evolutionary traits are explained), and the book is extremely informative without being too terribly academic and dry. Just beyond halfway through I did lose interest, however. While the sections on hominids and continental drift had been fascinating, going back more than 100 million years got ...maybe a bit alien for me. Clearly there's no accounting for taste."

86,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3040195-robin,5,"This book is a detailed list of how mankind evolved, from the very first instance of life. The author tells us when humans ""broke away"" from the lineage of our closest cousins, the chimpanzee, then he proceeds to tell us when we ""broke away"" from each cousin previously, all the way back. Each step of the way, his writing is filled with fascinating facts. The book is so dense with information, that I found it difficult to read too many pages at a time, since I needed to breathe and think between thoughts."
87,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3746195-nick,5,What a trip! It made me want to become a zoologist. Don't let Dawkins' abrasive atheism discourage you from checking this out. It is first and foremost a science book. The format of the book is that of a pilgrimage back in time starting from Humanity and ending with the common ancestor of all earthly life. The concepts (and organisms!) discussed are utterly fascinating.I got my mind blown on every page. Read it.
88,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7195934-anne-middle,4,"This is a refreshing antidote to all of Dawkins's usual rants (I have sympathy for his anti-religious views, but not for his constant, and sometimes illogical, rants). On the contrary, in this book you see the positive side of Dawkins, as he explains his fascination with biology. It's enough to make you want to become a biologist (shock horror!). A beautifully written book, and an excellent read. Totally recommended."
89,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19387683-menno,3,"This is not Dawkins's best one. The book's structure is original, and the message, as usual, highly relevant, but the repetitiveness that results from the coalescences gets annoying. Also, Dawkins has not gone to great lengths to make the book accessible. The level of the text is rather uneven. Some chapters are splendid science writing, while others are humdrum, dense, or even impossible to wade through. "

As always, Dawkins is amusing, informative, provocative, and master of the factual evidence."

They represent a narrowing-down from reality, an impoverishment of what the real world has to offer. I suspect that many who call themselves religious would find themselves agreeing with me. To them I would only quote a favourite remark that I overheard at a scientific conference. A distinguished elder statesman of my subject was having a long argument with a colleague. As the altercation came to an end, he twinkled and said, 'You know, we really do agree. It's just that you say it wrong!' I feel I have returned from a true pilgrimage.'And so I have been through my own pilgrimage. I am a solid supporter of evolution because it is based on facts and is more beautiful than anyone can imagine. Dawkins has outdone himself in this book, each chapter was an adventure, a mix of recalling my own knowledge and learning more. Some facts shook the very foundations of what I understood and others cemented what I knew but every single chapter was exciting and food for thought. I cannot think of a time where I did not close the book and spend time thinking about what I had learned. At times this book was full of too much information and I felt like a glass that was overflowing with water (knowledge) but I did not hesitate to keep reading. To learn and strive to understand the fascinating nuances of evolution and life. This book traces human evolution, from man to the smallest microbe, and along the way we met our 'cousins', and my what a strange family we have. But surely none of us would ever change it. From the biggest mammals to the smallest microbe, we are blessed with such a vast and amazing family. And at the very end of it all we learn one important thing. We are simply hosts, intricate and beautifully made, but simply tools to carry DNA. Although in truth even this explanation is too simple. Dawkins says it much better than I and certainly knows more than I can ever claim to know. But what I can say is simply this, for those willing to learn and embrace what Dawkins has to say, you will not be disappointed by the sheer amount evolution encompasses. But more importantly Dawkins has humbled me. The concept of ‘primitive’ life living today is an insult to the creatures we call primitive. They may have retained what we consider to be ‘primitive’ body shapes but as Dawkins explains, our cousins would not have kept these ‘primitive’ shapes and natures if they weren’t useful and actually ‘advanced’. An example is sharks, these creatures have barely changed their shapes for millions of years and yet they are not ‘primitive’ at all but clearly physiologically advanced killing machines. Although this is an insult too, sharks kill to eat, men kill more men than a shark kills. So, I will certainly make an effort to call any lifeform living today ‘primitive’. The one thing the book has left me with is a fascination for microbial life. To think bacteria may have invented a ‘wheel’ billions of years before us and yet we consider ourselves more advanced. We, ourselves, are nothing more than a collection of microbes and bacterium. Was order made from chaos as we believe or were microbes and bacteria similar to us before we built New York City, the Pyramids, the leaning tower of Pisa and other grand structures. Are we simply a landmark of microbial engineering? A tribute to the ingenuity of nature and the product of small lifeforms making grand marks on the world? These thoughts are both fascinating and humbling. I am certain there are some who see my wandering thoughts as silly or take them to think I have not truly absorbed the content of this book. But I have learned much, this book has much to teach should one choose to open the cover and read its pages. I will certainly not look at the world the same way again. 5/5. Would definitely recommend this book!"
110,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66376950-alyssa-tidwell,5," This book, The Ancestor’s Tale, takes a meandering stroll backward through our ancestry, from our current position in evolution to “concestor 0”, the common ancestor of all living things. Many factors were included in the text that help to explain the reasons that certain evolutionary theories exist, describe the evidence supporting them, and methods and experiments used to draw conclusions. The way in which this information was presented helps the reader to dive in and get into a scientific mindset.  Dawkins attentively wrote from a broad, philosophical perspective that I think is critical for understanding and paying due respect to evolution. One example of this that comes immediately to mind is the thought that evolution is not teleological; humans are not the apex of an evolution that has been striving towards humanity as a goal. We are not necessarily more complex and more evolved than any other creature. Different ways of living aren’t necessarily “primitive” because an organism's individual functions may be more or less complex than our own.  Later in the book, Dawkins also writes on the likelihood of physical characteristics evolving independently, and speculates on whether those traits would re-occur if we were to hit the reset button. This repeats the overarching theme that we are not special- our eyes, our ears, and our intelligence would evolve again. We can’t be so vain to think we’re special in comparison.Dawkins makes it all too clear that we organisms are all related, and presents myriad evidence for that stance- not only by tracking the ancestral lineage, but through evidence such as eukaryotic cellularity being so unlikely to happen, that it probably only happened once. In fact, he claims that it was more unlikely than the first spark of life itself. Another broad and encompassing idea that I feel was helpful in visualizing the larger scale of evolution is that similar species are connected by “rings” of intermediates. Gulls and salamanders are ideal examples of “ring species” in the spatial dimension, one phenotypic trait fading into the other over a given area, with the two extremes at either end so dissimilar that they are considered different species, even though intermediates between them are interbreeding. This is speculated to have occurred in all species throughout history, and is the way in which evolution occurs. I understood the swirled “map” through the concestor history as a visual representation of this interconnectedness; the spiraling branches cleverly representing the mathematical infinitude of genetic variation in a mandala-like fashion.  This book came jam-packed with little surprises and relatable stories. Some of these surprises included descriptions of how certain traits evolved, and how the animal with that trait lives or, like in the case of pterosaurs potentially using echolocation, lived. I enjoyed these little visits to the different animals, learning things like how the Platypus and the Star-Nosed Mole may perceive the world by mapping their spaces as we do visually, but using alternative sensory input. Relatable stories like how a fish expert reacted to a not-so-extinct coelacanth made the experiences human, making the stories memorable and relatable.  As a fan of the Hitchhiker’s Guide series, I was also surprised (and happy) to see Douglas Adams mentioned, and to learn new things about him. After learning that he and Dawkins were friends, I had to read Lament for Douglas. This was a wholly terrible idea as I became absurdly emotional while reading it. D’awwkins! Then again, I should have noticed his pithy writing style. I should have noticed the thought, appreciation, and respect that he afforded each creature throughout this book. This eloquent attention definitely showed his squishy side. I will be reading this again, and already sent a copy to my mom."
111,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,5,"This book is definitely unlike all other Dawkins' book, or i should said maybe we can see very rarely a book so fully of information in a very well structured way. I would consider it as a book close to encyclopedia. A tool book that you could come back and forth to consult the chapters that interest you.So many to learn but the brain can not absorb all at once. I read in Chinese version, which many other readers complain about the translation not quite smooth, I got same feeling but it after all pretty academic book.39 rendez-vous( tales) with branch shape structure, here is the greatest show on earth. I enjoy a lot and will read it over and over. “Evolution, or its driving engine natural selection, has no foresight. In every generation within every species, the individuals best equipped to survive and reproduce contribute more than their fair share of genes to the next generation. The consequence, blind as it is, is the nearest approach to foresight that nature permits. [...] That’s the kind of thing natural selection does all the time. It is always tinkering: here shrinking a bit, there expanding a bit, constantly adjusting, putting on and taking off, optimising immediate reproductive success. Survival in future centuries doesn’t enter into the calculation, for the good reason that it isn’t really a calculation at all. It all happens automatically, as some genes survive in the gene pool and others don’t.” "
112,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57518342-krish-sanghvi,5,"So I will start by saying that this is the best natural history book I've ever read. It starts with Dawkins describing lee smolin's hypothesis of cosmic Darwinism, in which he explains how the universe itself could be formed by evolution through natural selection. This book is not only an ode to evolution and ecology, but also to human history, and explains various concepts in theses subjects wonderfully. Dawkins has taken the diversity of life that exists today, and through them, explained some excellent natural history theories, like sexual selection, molecular clocks, behaviour, drift, evolution of multicellularity, domestication, speciation, paedomorphosis, selfish genes etc. This book derives its style from chaucer's the Canterbury tales, which he has stated explicitly, multiple times. He treats each organism as a character, which has some story to tell us about itself, and about life in general. Most of these organisms have some weird and wonderful story to tell about their own life history, anatomy, or behaviour. He uses these stories to extrapolate what the common ancestor of these organisms and ourselves would be like, in what sort of world would that organism have lived, and what would cause it to evolve in such a way. I especially loved this style of writing, of using time as a theme, on scales of a couple billion years, and gradually describing time itself, by explaining events that happened then. Dawkins takes two approaches to describe this journey of ancestry- the gene's view and the individual's view, showing us how these two journeys can be extremely different and equally fascinating, and re-emphasising the point we often see him make: that we are just machines of our selfish genes, phenotypes for our genes to multiply, and we shouldn't look at it with contempt, but with wonder. In the end, he also talks about how one can differentiate between intelligent design and evolution via self assembly, natural selection, and heredity, and shows how it's impossible that an omnipotent creator exists, coz that poses the question of who created the creator (till ad infinitum). I loved how this form of reductionism under special phenomenon has been explained. This book is an amalgamation of ecology, geology, biology, palaeontology, biochemistry, genetics, and even cosmology and particle physics, showing how all these subjects eventually come together to create the world we live in today! And it showcases the rarely seen romanticist side of Dawkins.It's a really fun read, and a thorough review of biodiversity in general (for those interested in a slightly more academic reading).Dawkins also describes some major geological events in great detail, like the K-Pg extinction, oxygenation, and Cambrian explosion, providing alternative hypotheses to some mainstream theories. The book is very well researched, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in natural sciences, or wants to cherish, understand, and be fascinated by, the diversity of life on Earth and its origins. P.S.- for whoever has read Dawkins before and has been fascinated by his works, but thinks that he is a condescending intellectual asshole (I was one of them), this book is a must read and will change your views about him. He always talk about how humbling nature can be, and how insignificant we are, but at the same time, we have the ability to question, understand and be fascinated by nature. It is really difficult to even imagine writing a book which has such depth, and covers such a vast spatial and temporal scale (from the beginning of life, to the vastness of the cosmos), and it's such a commendable effort on the writers part, to have given the readers this incredibly rich, profound, and accessible source of knowledge, even truth, if I may say, and I really hope that people will appreciate the profundity that this book is.P.P.S.- I especially liked the parts when Dawkins has spoken about some core concepts in ecology and evolution, and some times even metaphysics (meaning of life, definition of life and all that jazz) from organisms we see [usually ignore] around us. I also loved the last few rendezvous, and Canterbury and the host's return, in which he shows how complex and fascinating bacteria and archaea can be, and how they have invented everything before us, using their chemical prowess, hence showing us the beauty of biochemistry, and molecular evolution, and making us question how such beautiful and complex things could arise, and making us think about our origins and that of everything else. I also enjoyed the early primordial earth part, in which he talks about oxygenation, replicators and life existing at a very biochemical level, and the conditions that were required for this primordial life to evolve into what we see today. He also speaks about the course of evolution, providing alternate hypothesis to discuss whether evolution has preferences, which will always cause life to converge upon something similar to that on earth, or whether evolution is truly random, and requires some major events (formation of cells, extinctions etc.) to converge. He also talks about a concept which was completely new to me: evolvability, which is the ability of evolution itself to evolve to allow 'better' evolution. P.P.P.S.- this book took me about 6 months to complete and is a really long undertaking, which requires lots of commitment and thinking on the readers part. It also bombards you with tons of information, and non biologists may find unfamiliar terms and concepts quite intimidating, and I'll suggest one reads other books on evolution (the greatest show on earth would be a great start), before they start with this one.Also, in this book, Dawkins has cited a great number of people and books, who have produced many of the fundamental theories we use today, and it has really helped me expand my bookshelves and wish list""My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely because they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world"" - the ancestor's tale; it's been such a wonderful journey.!I've always been amazed by the fact that the universe, and all life in it, is a product of something so beautiful, elegant, and simple. There really IS grandeur In this view of life."
113,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17460041-hal-sitt,4,"This is my 2nd Dawkins book after Selfish Gene. Selfish Gene was fantastic in its dizzying array of super cool examples from nature. I really finished that book with a renewed appreciation of how much evolutionary biology was at work in the world around me.Ancestor's Tale is an equally illuminating book but differs from Selfish Gene in its scope and depth. It has a much wider scope but also definitely has less depth. In Ancestor's Dawkins takes us from modern humans to the ancestors of all living things and along the way he uses the ""pilgrims"" on this journey to teach us about things like gene duplication, geographical isolation, tectonic shifts, convergent evolution, etc. Since he sets out on such a long journey, he cannot without adding pages to this already 700 page tome, stop for too long at any one stop. The result is that he sometimes has to sacrifice depth for scope. By no means is this a bad thing. It is simply the nature of a book of large scope. My favorite examples of this are the duplication history of the hemoglobin genes and the effect of plate tectonics on evolution. I wanted to hear more about these but had to move on. Ancestor's really gives an excellent big picture and opened my eyes to so many areas that I want to read more about. I think this is always a sign of a great book"
114,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24009998-julie-decker,4,"Richard Dawkins, whose work in biology is among the most famous of contemporary scientists, pens a tale here loosely based on the format of the Canterbury Tales, taking us back in time through branches of evolution to show us our ancestors. Beginning with humans and rewinding, we take a journey to ""meet"" creatures with whom we share a common ancestor, with explanations of when our timelines ""join"" and what we have in common, along with various trivia and anecdotes about what makes each one special. Much like evolution itself, the small stories create a big picture to help us understand how the evolutionary process works. It's long-winded and thick to get through, but the spots of information were often delightfully interesting and lightheartedly told, and to be fair I'm not exactly the perfect audience for the book. I can follow what's happening like any textbook in a subject I don't specialize in, but as a layperson the terminology and experimental methodology sometimes went over my head. I enjoyed both the content and the telling, even though it took me over a month of bus-ride reads to finally get to the end."
115,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64464797-heather,3,"This book certainly contains an abundance of incredibly interesting information. The whole structure of his ""pilgrimage"" is very engaging, and he seems (mostly) capable of synthesizing complicated information for a less scientifically-literate audience. These qualities are what saves this book from the otherwise poisonously obnoxious attitude of Dawkins that tends to waft from the pages. I really wanted to like all of this book, but WAY too much of Richard Dawkins came through. Actually, what let me to even go for this book was the dual authorship. I mean, Dawkins is a smart guy, but all this anti-God stuff just seems too basic for him. Bashing religion is cheap, low-hanging fruit and it's obvious to anyone as smart as Dawkins that the whole set-up of the atheism/theism debate makes it fundamentally unsettle-able.You'll have pages of WAY too much detail (almost an arrogant level of detail, in places) followed by a casual swipe directly at creationists, as if they are reading this book. Really. Dawkins is a really smart guy, with brilliant knowledge and imaginative ideas (I think he would enthusiastically agree with this), but he just can't help himself."
116,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,4,"Loads of lovely examples and vivid analogies. The sidebar on races is surprisingly careful and illuminating - that portion of the phenomenon that's genetic is more straightforward than I’d thought, in my Arts student way. (Though his placid definitiveness about the social interpretation is obvs controversial as hell. He’s a strict philosophical eliminativist, implying that the harm resulting from reifying race totally outweighs all gains from positive discrimination. This is unclear to say the least.) I hadn’t heard of the ‘two-fold cost’ of sex before, super-interesting. Not as snarky as you’d expect, and full of alternative perspectives so long as they’re other evolutionists’ perspectives. "
117,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36297846-wing,4,"Reading this updated edition ten years after reading the first is a true delight. Most of the updates are based on interval advancements in molecular genetics. This tome debunks misunderstandings of how evolution actually works and demonstrates why concepts that have been simplified can be misleading. It demands abstract reasoning from the reader and allows the beauty of the underpinning mathematics to shine out elegantly. As promised, it de-anthropocentrises our ill-conceived “preeminence” by tracing the history of the Tree of Life backwards. Even though “individuals are temporary meeting points on the crisscrossing routes that gene takes through history”, the whole story actually very subtly suggests, I believe, that sentience is an evolutionary convergence. A sense of serendipity and inevitability permeates the whole account. Interspersed by the authors' quips, musings, and dry humour, the book comprehensively clarifies the science of evolution through a plethora of insights and a pastiche of intellectual exercises. After reading it, it is hard not to end up being awed by the elegant complexity that colours Life on Earth. Four stars."
118,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81221576-diogenescfg,5,"Five stars seems unfair for a book so well written as The Ancestors Tale.Richard Dawkins takes us in a trip thousands or millions of years into the past, were we meet the common ancestors of current species, which he calls concestors. Starting with the humans, our closest relatives are chimpanzees and bonobos (concestor 1), followed by the common concestor between humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, who join in at concestor two.so on, several concestors meet our journey, from placental mammals, to marsupials, all the way down to starfish, molluscs, jellyfish, eubacteria and, finally, the first life form on earth.Sure, we can only speculate what this concestors could have looked like, based on the fossil record (when available), and triangulation techniques. However, much is said as to why we diverged from the rest of the populatoonat each concestor's rendez vouz, how natural selection pressure might have taken species in different directions, and what that tells us about ourselves as humans (hlmo sapiens).Be prepared for a long book, but full with interesting information that blows your mind at every page turn (if, like me, you are no biologist, nor anything close)"
119,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1190645-andrew-walter,5,"In classic 90's UK comedy programme Bottom there is a great moment when perspiring, lank haired comedy genius Rik Mayall, in the character of perspiring, lank haired pervy virgin Richie postulates:""I could have been a chess champion you know. If I'd spent my whole life learning how to play chess better than anyone else in the world I could have been a chess champion. And I look a bit slavic, don't you think?""Slavic countenances aside, this touches on how a reading of Dawkins' monumental work  The Ancestor's Tale made me feel. Yes, it is a tracing from all of the flora and fauna of the present day back into the origin of life on this planet, and so is at least a little daunting to those that don't make their living in the biological sciences. However Dawkins presents it to us in such a way as to ensure it is understood by the lay reader, and does so in such a way that you really feel as if you get it. Another reviewer on this site wonders if reading this book when they were at school would have turned them on to a career in biology, and I know exactly what they mean. You are a staggered by the awesome diversity of life throughout time but also by the awesomely succinct and economical nature of it all. I could have been an evolutionary biologist, you know.This is my first experience with the man's work, and as a sort of ""wannabe snob"", not to mention an athiest who is given to rolling his eyes in what he thinks is a droll manner every time the media seize on topics of ""hot debate"", I was fairly sick of hearing about The God Delusion, which I will probably read in about two decades if I ever do at all. Blithering dunderhead that I am, I actually didn't realise that he had written so many books about the science of life, but I'll lazily use the media as a scapegoat to explain how I'd pigeonholed him as a waffling antagonist endlessly stating what I consider to be the obvious (that creationism is nonsense). A brief conversation with my flat-mate about evolution and extremely intelligent men doing their reputations no favours, and a brief flick through of this book was enough to make me interested-I was sold on the idea alone.As other reviews on the site will no doubt make clear, the idea is at least in theory a reverse pilgrimage in the style of The Canterbury Tales, with different life forms used for ""tales"" demonstrating evolutionary theory in all of its glory. Many have remarked that this theme is somewhat clumsily applied, and that the ""tales"" diverge into areas not concerning the titular animal at all-I would remind these readers that it is at base book about EVOLUTION rather than anything else, so in depth discussions of the way that particular creatures live is only used to bolster certain points. Chapter headings aside, the Canterbury Tales metaphor is really used as nothing more than a framework throughout, with even the author poking fun at the potentially slightly twee nature of the ""pilgrimage"".There is nothing here I couldn't understand on a couple of re-readings, even with the atrophied knowledge furnished by a distant D grade in A-level biology (I blame sex in various guises for this, meeting a a girlfriend in my class on the one hand, and my Biology teacher getting my English Language teacher pregnant on the other) The writing is extremely informative, infectiously enthusiastic and at all times, careful not to patronise. A brief run through on the extreme basics of the structure of atoms and atomic decay in order to explain carbon dating is just one example; I know I needed reminding. The great level of detail presented does, admittedly, mean that it may not all stick at once, and you may find yourself turning back to refresh yourself on some points, but on the whole it is as much of a ""page-turner"" as a scientific work will ever be.It did take me a good six weeks to read, and a large part of this was I was anxious not to skim anything. I'll admit that this is a bad habit of mine if I am not fully engaged with a subject-mainly due to the inherent laziness of my mind, but here it wasn't even an issue, nothing felt slow or a drag. It is an incredibly rich piece of popular science writing (which I suppose you could say is sort of inevitable given the subject matter of ""every living thing on the face of the planet and where they sprung from"") , and is not afraid to present concepts that will make you stretch slightly to understand them, as well as the odd quirky aside ( eg: Anteaters utilise the fomic acid present in the ants they eat rather than bother to produce their own stomach acids ) that manage to be relevant as well as fully primed for use in awkward moments at parties.My one criticism here is that some of the demonstrations of how various methods of research are undertaken are left until right near the end of the book. We are given a brief summing up of ways in which prehistoric flora and fauna can be categorised and dated before the ""pilgrimage"" begins, but I was itching to know just how carbon dating and the dating of tree rings worked, and in particular how the ""molecular clock"" is calibrated and used. Findings using these methods are presented in every chapter of the book, but you don't have a really precise idea of HOW they work until you have read The Gibbon's Tale, The Redwood's Tale, and the Epilogue to the Velvet Worm's Tale. This was probably done to avoid overwhelming the reader, as these three chapters are definitely the heaviest in the book, but I did find it mildly frustrating to have to wait that long. Some readers may want to read these chapters first.In all though, it's an incredible read, and truly mind expanding for anyone that has questions about just how it all (or at least a hell of a lot of it) fits together. This is the work of a man who loves life and living forms with every eukaryotic organelle in his body, who is feverishly anxious to impart some of this passion to an interested lay audience. Sublime."

Dawkins in this book makes a narrative out of it, with a Canterbury Tales-like frame story, in which a representative of each family steps forward to tell a unique tale, often about one of the more interesting aspects of evolution (altruism, divergent evolution, micro vs. macro). Very little polemic - it's a fun, imaginative, well-executed piece of pop science."

I can think of no other word that captures the beauty, knowledge, and variety packed into Richard Dawkins romp backwards from humanity to our ultimate evolutionary ancestor. I arrived at this book with no special knowledge of the evolutionary process or science generally (beyond what one would remember from grade school or the occasional college Biology lecture). However, Dawkins walks the reader through all of the fascinating twists and turns of evolutionary theory, explaining everything from fossils to RNA in a way that illuminates, more than confuses, the average reader.This is not an ""easy"" book, by any stretch of the imagination. The benefits of reading it, though, are tremendous. Dawkins succeeds in the vast majority of cases in explaining evolutionary biology, chemistry, archaeology, paleontology, and other fields in clear, relate-able, down-to-earth ways. There is no better introduction than Dawkins' to the true majesty and variety of our world than this book. Read it, and marvel at the brilliance of life."

Human being is the most capable of creature of truly realizing the arrow of time-this direction from past to present to future. The word evolution we all have heard of, but most among have clearly very confusing ideas of what it truly means. We come into existence in this world, first experience our parents and then gradually we start learning about all the existing species in the world. Everytime you have gone to a zoo or saw something on the Discovery channel, your jaw might have dropped with the amazing beauty of the nature, dynamics of the animal world, existence of cruelty and survival power in the wild. But everything had to evolve to reach its present place in the ecology and this book takes you to the journey in the tree of evolution throughout the history of our planet earth. I greatly enjoyed reading how a tale was told by the author and I am amazed to recognize my ancestors."

You have two options: stop your life and plan on reading it all the way through in one sitting, or schedule it around days where you don't have to think about much else with lots of time to pause and process. It was completely delightful and entirely absorbing. Dawkins blends in forgotten studies, history, physics, and as usual he pulls from all sorts of cultures within science. The structure of each topic is formed into ""pilgrims"" through the paths of history and development through time and the whole book is modeled after The Canterbury Tales, each topic an individual story that weaves together. I'm crazy impressed with how approachable he's made some of these topics for lay people. I'm looking forward to sharing this, using it as a resource in my own writing, and at some point reading it again. I can see how this would be a book you continue to get more out of as knowledge of the different topics grows; it's definitely written in a way that can help the reader see connections!"
124,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,4,"This book reminded me that despite all his controversial statements regarding religion Richard Dawkins is really an outstanding communicator of the amazing discoveries of biological evolution. In this book, Dawkins further illustrates what evolution is and is not. He emphatically explains how evolution is not a progression to a goal and that humans are no “more evolved” than the coelacanth that has not changed in millions of years. By tracing humanity’s lineage back through all the ancestors that we share with fellow animals, plants and bacteria, Dawkins is able to highlight the oneness of life while dispelling various myths about evolution, such as the “unusual” biological diversity of the Cambrian. Dawkins also seeks to explain the different challenges that evolution sought to solve at each crossroads. This really is a great book for all those that seek to further understand the mind-blowing nature of life in this planet. "
125,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26826242-julia,4,"Imagine traveling back in time to observe the last shared ancestor of humans, bonobos and chimpanzees. What might that individual have looked like? What was its lifestyle? And what if we ventured further back, to when those three species shared an ancestor with gorillas? How long would it take before we met up with the ancestors of all mammals, birds, lizards, sharks or insects? This book is a reverse journey of human ancestry, each stop a convergence with an extant group in the tree of life.There's nothing I love more than a thick, detailed book of natural history, and I quite enjoyed it, though I have to admit that sometime during the final quarter my eyes started to glaze over when the subject matter turned heavily to cell biology and genetics -- no fault of the author, it's not my wheelhouse.

Teeming with awe-inspiring facts about modern world animals, as well as accessible explanations of complicated phenomena; it is hard no to end with a new found respect for life and its evolution on this planet.Dawkins is at his best when he is focused on talking about biology/evolution. Some passages felt a bit out of place, i.e. his ramblings about race and sporadic attacks on religions, and overall felt just like clutter in an already large book "

There are parts of this book that you feel like you’re watching a full HD engaging documentary, while reading them. It was facinating that you feel the theme of the book, “all these creatures are our distant cousins”, even through pages explaining how bacteria evolved. Prof. Dawkins paints a word picture of the actual tree of life in a poetic manner that you can’t help but to envy his storytelling skills; and yet he’s not a novel writer. I recommend this book to anyone with a very basic understanding of biology who wishes to be captivated by the astonishing power of natural selection in creating life forms ranging from bacteria populating the cracks in rocks miles deep in earth to bipedal apes who managed to walk on the moon..."

The idea of a book that told of all the evolutionary steps it took to get from the beginning to human is quite a feat, but Dawkins does it justice. The difficulty about a book like this is that our knowledge of the subject is constantly changing and updating and the further back you go the less and less information we have about it. Dawkins does a good job of explaining each ""rendevous"" points with our common ancestors and about when these events could have taken place. Each chapter also has different stories from different organisms and how certain traits evolved and could have evolved. A lot of it was over my head, but the whole book is dense with amazing information on evolution. This book isn't for a light read, but it's worth checking out."

I borrowed this book from a friend's bookshelf with fairly low expectations but I was quickly enthralled. The complexity of the topic doesn't take anything away from the book, and I looked forward to learning the next evolutionary step every time I picked it up. The various studies which he cites are immensely interesting, both in the context of the story and outside of it. I would recommend it to anyone, both those who enjoy non-fiction and those less familiar with it. After finishing the book, I spent the next six months working my way through various BBC wildlife documentaries, and the insights from this book made for a highly enjoyable half-year. "

He has a bad reputation undeservedly because people don't know Dawkins as the great scientist he is. He has a talent to turn complicated facts into elegant, easy-to-understand science. The pilgrimage back in time and the rendezvous with our concestors is just a beautiful way to shed light on evolution through natural selection. Sometimes it gets very technical and the non-biologists, like myself, can find it tedious. But this is a must read for those interested in evolution, and also for those who think that Dawkins is a fraud. "

It can be read cover to cover (but who could possibly hold all the information it contains in their head from beginning to end?) but the way it's structured you can read any section of it and learn something new. Basically it's an introduction to our collective biological family tree, one key stage at a time, starting with modern humans and working backwards in time through proto-humans, apes, monkeys, mammals, mammal-like reptiles, amphibians, fish, worms... all the way back past common ancestors with fungi, plants and bacteria. Not for Creationists, I guess. Their loss."

It is truly comprehensive, and Dawkins truly does take you from the primordial soup all the way through to humans (in the reverse order). There are a thousand lessons to be learned along the way, but most important is a very clear picture of the path, all the branches, and the STORY it tells. Dawkins even includes little diagrams at the beginning of each chapter to remind you where you are along the journey - my favorite part. I've read this book twice, and I think any thinking person should at least move through it. "

I had the haunting urge to stop what I am doing and pursue a career in zoology/ evolutionary science.. well not a career per se, but an urge to satisfy my thirst to this type of knowledge. It's astounding, the book is so entertaining, which is unusual for a book of this type! but Richard Dawkins had always delivered. I was lost a bit on the math side but math is not my forte. I highly recommend this book. but I also highly recommend reading other books which propose other theories to how we ended up where we are ( and by that I don't mean creationist books, that would be counterintuitive to the scientific proposal that Dawkins presented)"

Not an easy read, but stuff full of interesting details and key points of evolution to understand.One thing I appreciate about Dawkins as a popular science writer is that while he simplifies, you always get a sense as to what the true lines of reasoning are behind the state-of-the-art science that he discusses. Too often, other writers slur over the details, or abstract them out altogether, and all you're left with is a set of facts on the surface, with no idea of what lies below.It's written with Dawkins' usual verve, honesty, and sense of humor.Fun quote: ""A guide at the Natural History Museum stated confidently that a particular dinosaur was 70,000,008 years old. When asked how he could be so precise he replied, ‘Well it was 70 million when I started this job, and that was eight years ago.’"""

It is written with a narrative style that makes it far more interesting than the standard text book. It did take me a while to read it because it still becomes somewhat less than exciting when describing the various types of earlier forms of life, but the periodic interesting life forms with fascinating aspects kept me from just skipping over those sections.

137,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,5,Brilliant! The sublime pleasure of reading this book was only enhanced by having parallelly read Stephen Jay Gould's book - Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin. Dawkins also alludes to Gould here and his views on topics like (among other things) group selection (natural selection not only working at the genetic level but also at the group level) and evolutionary contingency (the question whether the current species would re-evolve exactly as they are if evolution was restarted from the origin of life). Having read the views of both these great scientists was an excellent experience and brought to light the strong reasoning behind their different opinions with regards to aspects of the theory of evolution and the great debates that that has engendered.

It explains how humans look so humany. I would recommend this to someone who is a freshman in High School just dipping into biology to keep them, in reality, to help explain why science (our past) is important in every aspect of our being. All the little stories about the animals and how they lived is short and sweet so you could read a little at a time without getting burnt out.

Nobody writes about the magic of the animal kingdom better. Some of the scientific sections were a bit technical for me but I would definitely go back to reread them to understand.

It starts in the present and goes back to the origin of life on Earth, and it includes all living creatures. It's really hard to top that. It's probably not the most action-packed or suspenseful. It is not the kind of story that's popcorn-friendly. But it is one of the most interesting. Mr. Dawkins is a hell of a story-teller. And did I mention it is based on a true story? "

Dawkins takes you to the dawn of life (more specifically to the dawn of replicators), from humans, through the rest of the great apes, primates, mammals, birds & reptiles, lobe-finned fish, etc. all the way through invertebrates, archaea, fungi, plants and bacteria. The 'tales' tell us of interesting anecdotes that relate to organisms meeting us at particular 'randevous'. These tales range from life lessons, to phylogenetic analyses, and are (mostly) fascinating and do not feel out of place. The book really feels like a journey, and although it drops off a little at the end for me personally, it was a really rewarding and fascinating book.I can't even begin to imagine how difficult this was to put together, but everything from the artwork to the vintage Dawkins writing style was incredible.For anyone who wants an in depth, but also incredibly interesting account of evolution, and for anyone who wants to get to know the relationships between the different kinds of life on our planet, this is the book for you."

218,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115991-immen,0,"I liked this book, also Richard Dawkins can be an jackass and a mediocre writer, but sometimes he isn't, and the happiness-enlightenment-infuriation balance works out well given that it's a popular exposition of biology.~~~~It's hard to say when I'm done with a nonfiction book like this, since I don't read it linearly, but I've been at this one for a while and have some remarks to make.The book is built around the conceit that we're on a pilgrimage, a la Chaucer, and along the way our concestors tell stories, more (like when the platypus discusses its bill) or less (like when the grasshopper talks about black people) about themselves. It's cute, and Dawkins is a breezy author who likes to talk about himself and his political views, most of which are good times. I like his phrase ""the discontinuous mind"", and I like that he's not afraid to make his point about discontinuity re: classification of distinct species, and then rant about discontinuity re: classification of intelligence in British young adults, even when I dislike his tone, or don't quite agree.Dawkins was saying something like, if you bar graph some one-dimensional measure of intelligence, current understanding is that you'll approximate a nice continuous bell curve, so it's very bad to arbitrarily cut up the distribution into three parts and assign people 1st/2nd/3rd class degrees (this is some British thing; there are other British-isms sprinkled around in the book). I'm disputing the continuity assumption -- is this blasphemous?One problem I see is the idea that the actual numerical values mean something, like a person rated in the 69th percentile is actually better than a person in the 68th percentile -- the margin of error is way fuzzier. It make more sense to me to convert the number into one of three values -- less than 2 bits of data, which to me better represents the information you're getting. Social overemphasis on these bits is outside my scope. And it has been my experience that you do get modes in grading; the class divides itself into, say, the people who understand basic proof concepts like reductio ad absurdum, the people who can apply them in familiar situations, and that elusive 1st class, the ""creative"", who can apply them in unfamiliar situations -- and there is a discontinuity; you either get it or you don't.This is a segue into how Dawkins actually falls below the third class.The concestor concept is pretty cool: the idea is that if you pick any two living creatures and crawl parent nodes up the not-a-tree-actually-some-more-general-directed-graph of life, you will eventually reach a common ancestor. This seems plausible. A heuristic argument a la moi: if the tree of life were actually a tree, if each person has two parents, that if you go far back enough in time, your ancestors constitute the entire population of the earth. In particular, you share all of them in common with all other humans alive now. But it's also easy to see that exponential growth backwards makes no sense, because you end up with too many people. So much for my heuristic.Dawkins' approach is something nonsensical in the other direction. Go back 100 million years; given that every living thing must have a parent, I have an ancestor at this time. His name is Henry. Assume for contradiction Henry is not your ancestor. However, by the same argument you also had an ancestor 100 million years ago. ""Your lineage and mine would have to have marched, side by side yet never touching, through 100 million years of evolution to the present, never interbreeding yet ending up at the same evolutionary destination -- so alike that your relatives are still capable of interbreeding with mine. This reductio is clearly absurd."" \proofboxI am appalled. I've read this a couple dozen times now, over the course of maybe a month? I'm still appalled. It pisses me off that he dressed up this non-proof with cutesie Henry and misappropriated ""reductio ad absurdum"" like a meaningless buzzword -- there's no point to wording it as a reductio proof! All he says is, assume that if two populations do not interbreed for 100 million years, their descendants cannot interbreed -- then we have a common ancestor. What is this appalling fuckery. I am very disappointed, Dawkins. Drop the course now, you have no hope of passing.I sulked for a week, flipping through the book looking for a passage which did not deeply irritate me. I was finally placated by a marginal note in the chapter on newts, where Dawkins references ""A. Fink-Nottle, in litt."" I don't even like Wodehouse that much, I think it's just that things that remind me of Hugh Laurie make me happy. So I smiled about this note for a while, and the book stopped irritating me on principle, just in certain paragraphs, like the other place he uses the word ""reductio"".It's really a very nice book. I recommend it."
219,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69489105-robert-frecer,5,"Dawkins writes in a sublimely clear, witty and friendly style, making him the perennial popular scientist. Like genes, he organizes the concepts in this book into building blocks that are combined and re-applied, allowing ordinary readers like me to grasp them, and to be a full member on this journey, not just a spectator. Dawkins is ready to admit mistakes, gives credit where credit is due, considers partial merits of many theories, and is not afraid to go out on a limb, uncover his weak points, he is enthusiastic yet sane. His reputation is well deserved. If all of human knowledge were to be represented by a building, this book would be one of the cornerstones. It's full of fascinating thoughts and scenarios about life, behavior, chemistry, physiology, any ""why?"" possible. An amazing 700 pages through and through. Don't fret about spending 9 months reading this, as I did - it was well worth it."
220,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2787762-amir,3," We were dealing with the unusually high level of genetic uniformity in the human species, despite superficial appearances. If you take blood and compare protein molecules, or if you sequence genes themselves, you will find that there is less difference between any two humans living anywhere in the world than there is between two African chimpanzees. We can explain this human uniformity by guessing that our ancestors, but not the chimpanzees, passed through a genetic bottleneck not very long ago. The population was reduced to a small number, came close to going extinct, but just pulled through. There is evidence of a fierce bottleneck – perhaps down to a population of 15,000 some 70,000 years ago, caused by a six-year ‘volcanic winter’ followed by a thousand-year ice age. Like the children of Noah in the myth, we are all descended from this small population, and that is why we are so genetically uniform. “The Ancestor’s Tale” by Richard Dawkins is a comprehensive description of human evolution from the beginning of life on this planet. The narrative structured as a pilgrimage of human being backward in time toward the common ancestor of whole life, in which other cousins join in according to their evolutionary distance with us. The author described 40 rendezvous point during this journey in time, in each some important evolutionary steps happened to differentiate us from other living groups. In each of these rendezvous one of our close or distant life cousins telling their stories filled with really amazing scientific facts which provide opportunity for the author to go deeper and discuss the relation between us and other living groups and how we have been evolved from very simple life forms to be this complicated. It could be argued that an important reason behind many of environmental and social problems that people are struggling with around the world is rooted in our traditional, unscientific and ignorant concept of how we are related to other living species and to the whole planet. As an instance most cultures and religion doctrines considered human as a different species superior to other species, but science shows us that this is a wrong and destructive point of view and in reality we are just another species recently evolved with a massive brain and marvelous mental ability, but we could also be very fragile compare to other life forms. Another example is the racism, which still is one of the reasons behind many human conflicts. Although people from different races have many phenotypical differences but compare to other animals we are genetically almost similar and therefore racism has no scientific ground and is just fueled by ignorance. This book is another example that science is not only the best way to over come problems but also provide a far more reasonable and even more spiritual point of view about life or as Dawkins said in this book: “Not only is life on this planet amazing, and deeply satisfying, to all whose senses have not become dulled by familiarity: the very fact that we have evolved the brain power to understand our evolutionary genesis redoubles the amazement and compounds the satisfaction”.   We tend not to describe people as of mixed race. Instead, we plump for one race or the other. Some American citizens are of pure African descent and some are of pure European descent (leaving aside the fact that, in the longer term, we are all of African descent). Maybe it is convenient for some purposes to call them black and white respectively, and I am not proposing any principled objection to these names. But many people – probably more than most of us realize – have both black and white ancestors. If we are going to use color terminology, many of us are presumably somewhere in between. Yet society insists on calling us one or the other. It is an example of the ‘tyranny of the discontinuous mind’, which was the subject of the Salamander’s Tale. Americans are regularly asked to fill in forms in which they have to tick one of five boxes: Caucasian (whatever that might mean – it certainly doesn’t mean from the Caucasus), African-American, Hispanic (whatever that might mean – it certainly does not mean, as the word seems to suggest, Spanish), Native American or Other. There are no boxes labeled half and half. But the very idea of ticking boxes is incompatible with the truth, which is that many, if not most, people are a complicated mixture of the offered categories and others. My inclination is irritably to refuse to tick any boxes, or to add my own box labeled ‘human’. Especially when the rubric uses the mealy-mouthed euphemism ‘Ethnicity’."

227,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77105282-noah-abraham,4,"Dawkins does it again. He creates an entrancing work that provides an evolutionary timescale of the origin of Homo Sapiens and all of our common ancestors. Dawkins adds his own spin to the narrative, beginning the journey with Homo Sapiens and working his way backwards. In doing such, Dawkins ensures that the pedestal we as humans place ourselves on is removed. I advocate this book to anyone who is interested in organic evolution, macro/microevolution or for those who want an exhaustive and comprehensive list our ancestors. "
228,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4761355-andy-wixon,4,"Richard Dawkins is not the kind of person you want as an enemy - but then not many people seem that keen to be his friend, either. He's a difficult person to like - clearly hugely intelligent and knowledgeable in his field, and a brilliant communicator, but at the same time obviously a terrible old fusspot (even unto the point of pedantry), prone to smugness and elitism bordering on outright snobbishness, and utterly unable to acknowledge that there anything might exist beyond the realm of the empirical.Luckily in this book Dawkins largely restricts himself to a subject he can talk about with authority, namely the origins and development of life on Earth, with particular attention paid to that branch leading to the human race. For stylistic and philosophical reasons Dawkins presents this as a pilgrimage to the past, loosely modelled on The Canterbury Tales with himself as Chaucer (sort of).The main thread of the book consists of a series of 'rendezvous' between our ancestors and those of other animal groups (first chimps, then gorillas, etc, back to our common ancestors with fish, insects, fungi, and so on). More often than not Dawkins uses these as hooks on which to hang illuminating digressions on evolutionary biology and other related sciences - so the Redwood's Tale explains dendrochronology (which is fairly straightforward) while the Gibbon's Tale gets into moderately advanced cladistics (for want of a more accurate word: suffice to say it's fairly heavy-going).The nature of the book makes it a bit of a curate's egg and the closing stages are a bit... well, Dawkins himself comes clean and admits we don't know when our ancestral line diverged from that of bacteria, and the reader's heart does sink a bit when turning the page and finding yet another chapter on microscopic lifeforms in the offing. Dawkins is unmistakably Dawkins throughout - rigorously, painfully meticulous about making it clear evolution is not a teleological process one minute, moved almost to tears by memories of Douglas Adams or fantasies about sharing modern research with Darwin the next, and then bringing the whole thing to a grinding halt in a third for a rather laboured P.G. Wodehouse in-joke.Despite all this it is, largely, a fascinating and challenging read, and if nothing else it drives home repeatedly the logical corollary to the truth of evolution: the fact that all life we currently know of comprises a single immensely extended family, of which the human race is a tiny element. Dawkins' awe and reverence for the world around us is constant throughout and makes up for whatever other flaws he may display in the course of the book. He is a great communicator and communicates his passion for nature (and evolutionary biology) with great enthusiasm and force throughout the book. "
229,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4275337-igor-korousic,5,"It's interesting to me that Dawkins hasn't been nominated the Nobel prize in genetics/evolution as his Selfish gene view on evolution I certainly find revolutionary enough for an award of this sort.But what puzzles me most is how much emotional stir he causes. People either worship him or hate him or dismiss him as a fundamentalist ateist. And as he rightly pointed out in God Delusion, fundamentalists are just belivers who do their job thoroughly. I have thought about this man very often ever since i've read him the first time and i've read all of his books except the Extended phenotype which was too difficult for me. But only when i read the Ancestor's tale it clicked to me what he's really fighting against. To my opinion he finds the discontinuous mind the real handicap in people and not so much wheather or not they are believers. Of course he looses patience with Creationists and i can understand that especially having the bulk of knowledge about the world that he has. But Dawkins believes in so many cuckoo things that lack scientific evidence (his inspiring meme theory, his views on origin of morality etc) that it would be hard not to call him a beliver. But he's the kind of fundamentalist beliver that i'd love to have for the neighbour. Sceptical, curious, knowledgeable, ready to admit fallacies and wrong theories, inquisitive, in harmony and in love with nature and beauty, bright and not dark and scary. In this book he convincingly presented the consequences of discontinuous mind and how it shapes and rules our behaviour and understanding of the world. Life on Earth is hard and wrong to classify in drawers and yet because of the way human brain works we must classify our knowledge. That causes troubles and that divides people and that is the reason for all the shit in this world. The more knowledgeable and thinking people are the more detailed is the content of their drawers and the less harm they cause. On the other hand, the opposition operates with just a few drawers, black and white. You're either ours or theirs, that's either good or bad, people are either good or evil, that is either acceptable or not.There are other morals in this book. There are many analogies offered in a very subtle way. I would expect most readers changing their attitude to nature after reading this book. So what if he's squashy sometimes. And so what if he sometimes gets lost in subjects that at first glance divert from the main subject. The reading is that much more challenging for a holistic mind.I wish there were more pictures and illustrations of animals described in the pilgrimage, yet Googling their names while reading solves this problem and offers opportunities for more study."

Imagine a peaceful picnic lunch with your extremely “extended” family, including the ant on your tablecloth, the yeast that was used to make your sandwich bread rise, the watermelon in your fruit salad, the bacteria in your yogurt, the squirrel in the park and the shady oak tree on which he climbs. You and all other humans share a common, if ancient, ancestor with each of these earthly organisms. While humanity’s common ancestor with the squirrel lived much more recently than that with the ant or the watermelon, there was a time hundreds of millions of years ago when a common ancestor of all of these organisms crawled (or squirmed) the surface of the earth. Richard Dawkins’ book The Ancestor’s Tale tells the stories of all of these common ancestors (he coins the term “concestor” as a shorter synonym), striving to shed light on all the different evolutionary wrinkles wrought by natural selection. Dawkins tells this historical saga in an unconventional manner, traveling backward in time from the present day to the very beginning of life itself, greater than one billion years ago. For practical (and admittedly anthropocentric) reasons he starts the tale with Homo sapiens. Each step back in time encounters a new and more ancient common ancestor with an assortment of related groups and species. He describes this as a pilgrimage where the mass of humanity (made up of modern humans, as well as Neanderthals, Australopithecines and other hominids) meets up first with the chimpanzees at Rendezvous #1 (about 6 million years ago). The chimps had already met with their closest living relative, the bonobos, about 4 million years earlier. After Rendezvous #1, the pilgrimage includes the humans, the chimps and bonobos all traveling back another million years to Rendezvous #2 with the gorillas. Subsequent meetings include Rendezvous #6 with the New World monkeys, Rendezvous #10 with the rodents and rabbits and continues with the marsupials (R #14), the reptiles and birds (R #16), the bony fish (R #20), the insects (accompanying the crustaceans, arachnids and molluscs at Rendezvous #26) and eventually all the plants at Rendezvous #36. By the end of the book the reader has encountered approximately 40 rendezvous with 40 different concestors that account for the full width and breadth of life on earth. You can read the rest of my review at The Ancestor's Tale."

It is never unfinished or, in another sense, it is always unfinished. So, presumably, are we.""This was a great book. I always notice overlaps with other books that I'm reading, or have read recently. Here Dawkins mentioned the Penfield Homunculus (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical...), a sort of brain map used to indicate parts of the brain allocated to different senses. I’m also reading Connectome by Seung where he talks about the Penfield Homunculus. In this book Dawkins describes the “Platymunculus” while talking about the sensory organ that is the platypus bill. The bill is very sensitive and used in hunting. A platypus can sense weak electric fields generated by the movement of its prey! An interesting part of the book dealt with human races. There are more differences between individuals within a given race than there are between the races. Yet differences in the appearance between races are very large when you consider there is absolutely no speciation observed. Humans evolved the ability to observe these differences and/or these differences evolved without affecting the nature of the species, because....? Need to review this chapter.The different 'tales' in the book, modeled after The Canterbury Tales illustrate fascinating cases of evolution. For example, discussed are species of lizard in California that live in a certain range of altitude around the periphery of a valley. Neighboring lizards all around the valley can all interbreed - same species - but at the end of the valley where the population from either side meets back up, these lizards do not interbreed, at least in the wild, and are therefore defined as different species! Dawkins states that this is an example in the physical environment of what evolution normally does in the temporal dimension: evolutional changes ‘happen’ in infinitesimal steps so there’s never a case where parents are a different species than their offspring.Also Dawkins mentions several species ‘beloved’ by creationists as examples where evolution couldn’t have produced such an animal…and debunks the flawed logic. For example, the bombardier beetle is often pointed at as impossible to evolve since all the predecessors would have exploded! But Dawkins points out that the active chemicals don’t react spontaneously even when mixed together directly; they need a catalyst to react. The level of catalyst is a feature that could have been affected by natural selection."
232,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/152668-peter,5,"A big reading commitment, and a heavy travel companion, but absolutely worth it.Is it rare to say of a non-fiction text that I couldn't put it down?This book is a fantastic tour of nature's clever wonders. To the layperson, i.e. those of us who did not study biology at the university level, this book is like sitting in at a master class in evolutionary biology. For example, the fox breeding experiment and the characteristics of the male & female chromosomes are told simply and clearly enough to be contemplated and retold (to anyone who'll listen), thereby practicing the right way to think about living systems and evolution. As hinted by its title, this book tackles the scope of time which is a very difficult aspect of evolution to understand. The book is brimming with intriguing facts that tickle you with amazement at nature. As for the idea of traversing our ancestry from beginning to end, that makes for an arduous plotline but a good scaffolding for the many interesting departures and I am not sure which was ultimately in service of the other. (As Richard Feynman is known to have said, if you think you understand quantum mechanical behavior, you don't. Perhaps the same might apply to evolution.)But I think Dawkins has an inspired ability to put forth interesting facts in the context of a lesson like a great teacher, and really this book is an extended series of those punctuated lessons. Getting down to the nitty gritty details, I had a few specific critiques and questions from the book which I will try to post later once I have access to my notes.However, my general critique is that Dawkins' enthusiasm gets ahead of his pure logic here and there. He does prominently declare every weak point and missing evidence of his proposed historical ancestral connections, and we must give him a lot of credit for rigorously treading through this massive subject with a disciplined, Bayesian reasoning.But surely Dawkins would appreciate to be compared with THE other D, Charles Darwin -- and I would say in comparison that Darwin's Origin of Species still has the most poise and harnesses more truth through facts than this nonetheless masterful book. This is my first reading of Dr. Dawkins and he definitely earned my admiration for this tremendously enjoyable, challenging and rewarding text."

There certainly was some interesting information that would be maybe better explained in the book but there were also some not so interesting passages, especially at the end.I am currently reading The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution and so far I'm enjoying it much more. My recommendation would be to start with The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution and read this book if you want more of the stories."

Only by diving deep into the intracacies of the biological world can one get a sense of the true depth and breadth of it's beauty. The book is a bit dense for newcomers to the field and one has to often pause and reflect on certain sections."
235,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"When people use the word ""synthesis"" to describe a massive, multidisciplinary treatise, drawing from all areas of human knowledge to make a singularly visionary point, they should be thinking of The Ancestor's Tale as the archetype for all others. There are a few other books out there that approach its scope (Douglas Hofstadter's 
Gödel Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid
 and Steven Pinker's book 
The Blank Slate
 get pretty close to the Grail) but none with so original a narrative. Dawkins borrows, with some modifications, the frame narrative used in Geoffrey Chaucer's 
The Canterbury Tales
. If you're a classics fan, then, this is your best bet for a science book you can sink your teeth into. In The Canterbury Tales, Chaucer (the character) joins a band of pilgrims on their way to Canterbury, and each tells a tale. Dawkins, here, is Chaucer, and his Canterbury is the earliest human ancestor. As he moves his way back through time, the other pilgrims, being chimpanzees, rats, whales, starfish, salamanders, dinosaurs, bacteria, and many other creatures great and small, tell tales, each of which reveals something poignant and remarkable about the nature of life on earth. The book is densely philosophical, but, at the same time, completely approachable, even to an evolutionary newbie.This CD version is highly abridged (about half the text), but it's worth it to pick up both versions. Dawkins and his wife, Lalla Ward, make the book come to life. The reading is exceptionally spirited and conveys the ideas even better than the text version, I think."
236,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39797-rose,4,"Should I give this book a 4 or a 5? I can't decide... It's SO GOOD. As you can probably tell from other reviews, it's written in the style of walking backwards on the road of Time. As we walk into the past, we join up with our cousins, the apes, monkeys, remaining mammals, remaining animals, fungi, plants, and bacteria along the way. I think I'd appreciate it even more if I had red Canterbury Tales - I hear that's what it's modeled after. This book has some of the most interesting scientific explanations of life on earth that I've ever heard. The only thing keeping this book from five stars is that I skimmed a few places where I lost interest in understanding the minutiae of an individual ""tale"" and just wanted to get to the next Concestor.Some of the best stories are about why we have ventral hearts, why we have sex (rather than asex), why we have blood types (this fascinated me!), and why we have less hair than most apes. It really is like a novel, and I appreciate that from a non-fiction book.I couldn't recommend it enough! It's a wonderful book on how related we are to everything on the planet. What're a few hundred million great grandparents among species?Below are some of my favorite quotes, because I don't want to foget them:On irreducible complexity: ""An arch is irreducible in the sense that if you remove part of it, the whole collapses. Yet it is possible to build it gradually by means of scaffolding. Yet the subsequent removal of the scaffolding, so that it no longer appears in the visible picture, does not entitle us to a mystified and obscurantist attribution of supernatural powers to the masons.""This was just so wild, I have to quote it... Dawkins was writing about the resiliance of the small rodent community on earth, and their likelihood of outliving us when our time's up: ""Given enough time, will a species of intelligent, cultivated rats emerge? Will rodent historians and scientists eventually organise careful archaeological digs (gnaws?) through the strata of our long-compacted cities, and reconstruct the peculiar and temporarily tragic circumstances that gave ratkind its big break?"" - Props to anyone who can coin the term ""ratkind""."
237,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17609571-peter-ellwood,5,"What a pleasant surprise this book was. For some years I’ve felt that Dawkins was going ‘stale’ on me – or me on him - not least because he’d long since written the masterpiece of the Selfish Gene, and has been faffing about with atheism in recent times. In fact I’d had the Ancestor’s Tale on my shelves for quite a while, but couldn’t quite summon up the enthusiasm to read it.How wrong I was. Using the latest insights into what the tree of life looks like as his basic narrative structure (as he makes clear, it’s quite difficult to be sure what happened, genetically speaking, millions of years ago, and new discoveries are constantly updating and refining the picture), Dawkins interweaves a fascinating introduction to the amazing complexities of evolutionary biology, as he traces our lineage back through the various branches of the genetic tree, to that point where a couple of atoms first twitched and started the entire process of evolution off. In the process, he manages to give a casual training class in the basics of evolution, and of biology, plus some of his own ideas on life, the universe and everything. (for example, his views on race. One might ask how this fits in, but then again, the job of tracing the lineage of everything alive really does embrace life the universe and everything, so he’s bang on track)And he does it all at his chatty and lucid best. It’s a pleasure to read his prose almost regardless of what he’s writing about (but preferably not God), and this is a heady brew. He rattles on with his customary bounce – in fact, as I read I was continually haunted by an image of Dawkins as a kind of “Just William” character, dressed as a schoolboy, cheerfully prattling on about his subject with unbounded enthusiasm. I mean that as a compliment – it’s really no mean feat to make evolutionary biology sound that way. Despite the book’s 600 page length I found myself thinking “oh what a shame” on many occasions, as he concluded a chapter on this or that stage of the story – before I was ready to see it finished. Great read – entertaining and deeply thought provoking, all at the same time."
238,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6057240-roberto,5,"This is a superb book. The basic premise is simple. Starting with Homo Sapiens, Dawkins goes to every point of divergence in the evolution -from the human standpoint of view- and then he tells several 'stories' about the phylogenetic classification that is around that point. This construction emulates the structure of Chaucer's Tales of Canterbury, hence the name of the book.The stories are basically small essays on the natural history of representatives of those phylogenetic groups. The divergence points start with Homo Sapiens, Chimpanzees, Gorillas, Old World Monkeys and it goes on and on, passing through Lemurs, Marsupials, Monotremes, Amphibians, etc, etc, down to an extremely interesting section on the origin of any life: self replicating molecules. One cautionary point: The representatives of the groups I mentioned as an example are not the same representatives of the time when the divergence occurred, but they serve as a good example of the main traits on those groups.The Ancestor's Tale meets the expectation that every good book about evolution must meet: every chapter is a great excercise in reasoning and wondering what rules of probability and success determine one specific trait. This, joined with the wide zoology background that the author can claim, makes every essay extremely interesting, full of fascinating facts on natural history, sometimes obscure, but always appealing.The richness of the essays as a matter of fact, delayed my conclusion of this book. They were so interesting that I always ended looking for more information on incredible creatures as the duckbil, the dodo or those fascinating fresh water African fishes, the cichlids. Two of the most interesting stories where about microscopic organisms: how rhizobium developed a real wheel and the Mixotrich's tale, where the most incredible association between different organisms takes place.Read this book, and you will be delighted on the beauty of the evolution theory, the most simple and efficient theory the mind has produced. "
239,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893735-joseph-sverker,0,"Dawkins is really ingeneous when it comes to finding new ways and perspectives to explore the evolution. He is very pedagogical in this book and it is easy to follow his line of argument. He has really made me understand what the evolution is all about. I know that there is debate about the specifics, but really Dawkins must be heralded as one of the great conveyors of biology to the popular adience. He takes jabs against creationists and all theists as usual, but it is somewhat less venomous in this book, which is nice for a change. When it comes to the question of God I don't see why Dawkins should be an authority (one should really read Alister McGrath's books on the subject and also John Lennox before one makes up one's mind). But when it comes to understanding biology Dawkins is a great place to start. Yet, speaking about God this book made me think of some questions. It appears that the evolution is open for manipulation and as such I don't understand why atheists get so upset when theists argue that God can control the evolution, if humans can, why couldn't God? Furthermore, I wonder if God had done such a thing is it possible to detect that by the theory of evolution? Dawkins asks what marchians would do if they come and explores the earth after the humans are gone and find the gene manipulated crops and so one. Would they be able to infere that humans once lived there if there were no fossils? If the objection is that there is no need for a creator in the evolution, then it is simply an argument from Ockham's razor. But Ockham's razor is simply a pragmatic starting point and cannot be justified rationally in itself. And furthermore, a theist belief in God is often grounded on something else than reason, yet many theists don't see reason as contrary to their beliefs and in that light i don't see why the theory of evolution would have to be an atheistic theory?"
240,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5982358-derek-bridge,3,"I should say first that I am a great fan of Richard Dawkins. Looking back many years to my first reading of The Selfish Gene, I can say honestly that it changed my life. I've read all his other books and was eager to read this one.But for the first time I am a little disappointed. It may be churlish to criticize a book of such ambition but this really isn't vintage Dawkins.The book makes a brave attempt to trace one chain back in time through ancestors common to Homo sapiens and our cousins, the other forms of life now found on Earth. On the plus side, this is a monumental task and, despite its flaws, still a magnificent achievement. It remains worth dipping into on a regular basis: every section is populated with natural wonders that should elicit awe and the intellectual joy that comes from understanding the scientific (never supernatural) explanation of these wonders. The hardback edition that I have in my possession is lavishly illustrated with diagrams, sketches and photos that add to the pleasure.And yet, and yet...Too many sections are badly written: many are repetitive (especially those with multiple authors); they lack the usual Dawkins finesse.There seem to be none of those tours de force for which Dawkins is justifiably renowned, in which he leads the reader through an exquisite exposition of some abstruse scientific theory, replete with striking metaphors, where the reader comes away enlightened and feeling smarter than s/he really is. All too often here, I felt bludgeoned, not educated.The political asides irritate, even if you agree with them, suggesting too great a sense of celebrity self, inappropriate to a scientific work, even one for laypersons.And as for the references to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, these were heavy-handed and ultimately unsuccessful.Oh dear. I so want to love this book. And I will treasure it. But I'll be recommending Dawkins's other works ahead of this one."
241,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889855-grace-tjan,4,"What I learned from this book (in no particular order):1.	We are essentially naked apes, albeit an extremely sophisticated ones, who are descended from other, more ‘primitive’ apes. But everyone has known this for a fact since the 19th century, don’t they? Unless you are home-schooled by strict Creationist parents, that is.2.	Creationists (and those who believe in Intelligent Design Theory) base their position on Argument from Personal Incredulity.3.	Way back before apes, naked or otherwise, our ancestors were rodent-like mammals (ever wonder why some people are described as looking ‘ratty’?), and before that they were lizard-like reptiles (hence the ‘reptilian gaze’ of certain human psychopaths). 4.	Even before that, they were lobed-finned fish. Our arms and legs are modified lobed fins. You CAN’T eat fish and call yourself a vegan.5.	Creationists are DUMB.6.	Douglas Adams is COOL.7.	But ultimately, we are nothing but highly evolved BACTERIA.8.	THE BACTERIAL MANIFESTO. Yes, you bipedal apes, you stump-tailed tree shrews, you desiccated lobe-fins, you vertebrated worms, you Hoxed-up sponges, you newcomers on the block, you eukaryotes, you barely distinguishable congregations of monotonously narrow parish, you are little more than fancy froth on the surface of bacterial life. Why the very cells that build you are themselves colonies of bacteria, replaying the same old tricks we bacteria discovered a billion years ago. We were here before you arrived, and we shall be here after you are gone.9.	Think about THAT, you bacteria fodder.10.	We are the only species who invented the tax (and also the welfare state). Actually the fact that we invented the welfare state and other charitable institutions presents a challenge to Darwinism, but this book is not the place to go into that."
242,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4767667-matt-ryall,5,"Outstanding book. Dawkins is at his best in The Ancestor's Tale, taking us on an epic journey from humans back through our common ancestors with every other living thing. I came away from this book with a much deeper understanding of so many things:- how much we share with other life: that the gene for human eye colour is shared with chimpanzees, that we have genes like those for haemoglobin whose beginnings go back hundreds of millions of years- how evolutionary biologists scientifically determine the relationships between species, and when the most recent common ancestor lived- how common parallel evolution is, from gliding animals to echolocation to segmented bodies- what the ancient world looked like, and how this affected the development of our ancestors- how a small geographic separation or even slight sexual preference change can lead to speciation - a point where two species separate- how species is the only clearly defined taxonomic division, and even that is not useful for organisms like bacteria which don't reproduce sexually- why fish are darker at the bottom than the top and how they sometimes flip upside down- how life begins: the process by which an embryo becomes segmented and cells become specialised, and how sometimes this can go wrong- how a new kind of organism might evolve by gradually truncating the life cycle of another, like an axolotl- what the origins of life involved: that eukaryotic cells formed by a bunch of bacteria getting friendly with each other, how hot springs might have provided that meeting place- how life might have evolved differently if it were to start over again, on Earth or elsewhere.My life is much richer for having read this book. I don't say that about many books at all.  "
243,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4560826-jared,5,"Dawkins has written a masterpiece. In this book he manages to bring three big things together and explain them in clear language accessible to anyone. First, he instructs clearly upon principles of evolution. Long has he been a proponent of evolution, in this book he takes us on a journey backwards in time and shows us what we know about our evolutionary transitions from humans back to the origin of life. He covers many of the major issues taught in a regular evolutionary biology class but also touches upon many intriguing aspects of evolution not often discussed. He dwells not just on principles, but helps explain the theory and research behind it in a very plain way. Second, he does all this while introducing the reader to the vast biological diversity on Earth. This book is rich in natural history and anyone who loves learning about biology in general will find treasures on every page. Third, he also touches upon many philosophical issues that are rooted in biology or can be addressed from a different biological perspective. To say this book is well-written is an understatement. Dawkins presents a vast array of examples and research. Isaac Asimov wrote a book similar to this called ""Beginnings"", yet Dawkins makes that book look likes a kindergarten reader. His explanations are clear, his examples are concise and up to date (at least for a book). Furthermore, Dawkins uses his wit and humor in unexpected places, never have I laughed so much in reading a science book. Moreover, he is direct and does not miss any chance to take a jab at creationists throughout this exposition. I look forward to reading more of his books. "
244,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4777812-lucie,5,"Wow. Wow, wow, wow, wow. I'm absolutely mesmerized. Even though it took me more than a year to finish this book, the cause definitely wasn't my lack of interest in it. You have to take into account that it has 800 pages and it is filled with some ""serious science stuff"" that isn't always all that easy to process - even though it's put in a popular kind of way to broaden amount of people who could understand its message. Dawkins takes us for a journey, one hell of a journey might I add. Starting point: today, ending point: beggining of a life hundreds millions years ago. He explains step by step (but seen backwards) how evolution (probably) went and how everything (probably) evolved. He tries and without no doubt succeeds in picturing the almost unbelievable variety of life and doesn't fail to amaze the reader with tons of examples and info on how it works in animal kingdom. With every chapter I found out something I didn't know before, I got to understand relationships and parallels that I never thought of before and - to be true - Dawkins made me fall in love with nature and science more than ever. I'm sorry I didn't read this book earlier, because with this passion the book ignited in me, I think I might have gone in very different direction with my studies. But let's stop with the praise for a moment. Some parts of the book were really hard to process, especially all the genetics that were just totally lost on me. However, mostly Dawkins handled the complexity of those issues very well and was able to explain it in fairly simple language with lots of helping examples. This really is one of the best books I've ever read and I know I'll get back to it one day."
245,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4394019-robin,5,"A fascinating tale written with wit and passion. Dawkins leads readers on a whistle-stop tour of life (mostly vertebrate animal life, but hey) that goes as deeply into some topics (statistical phylogeny, nearly-neutral theory, red queen hypothesis) as an undergraduate-level university course, but with much more style. Anecdotes pepper the chapters and help lend life, and memorability, to the proceedings, and there is rarely a dull moment--until the end, which, after reaching the fabled Grand Concestor (common ancestor), squibs out and becomes dull and mushy. Apart from a lacklustre finale, this book is highly recommended to anyone remotely interested in science or biology.NB in the years since its publication, many minor details in the book have changed. For an overview of the new animal phylogeny, see the latest edition of Hickman et al.'s ""Integrated Principles of Zoology."" There have been some big shuffles in the protostomes, and Xenoturbellida has finally found a home--with the acoels! For detail on hominin phylogeny (Ancestor's Tale uses the outmoded ""hominid,"" which tells you how out of date it is), see the latest edition of ""The Human Past,"" edited by Chris Scarre. We now have a richer picture of the human past, including fascinating ""introgression"" events (gene flow from other hominin species into our own, which has happened at least three or four times with as many species) revealed by molecular research (perfect for the theme of this book!). Other than in those key areas, the information Dawkins lays out here is accurate to this day, and just as fascinating now as then."

Dawkins leaves a lot of questions unanswered, because there are admittedly many unknown factors along the way -- still , you get as thorough an overview as possible of the process as possible based on the evidence available at the time of the book's writing.There are points where the book feels unnecessarily detailed to the nonscientific mind, but Dawkins clearly felt that every detail of the journey mattered.*Spoiler alert*It's no accident that Dawkins models his journey on the pilgrimage described in ""The Canterbury Tales."" This book is his own homage to the amazing processes that have brought about the varied and ever-changing facets of life as we know it. Only in the last paragraphs of the book does he come back to one of his pet themes -- his opposition to religion.""It is not because I wish to limit or circumscribe reverence; not because I want to reduce or downgrade the true reverence with which we are moved to celebrate the universe, once we understand it properly...My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserable fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world,"" Dawkins writes in his conclusion.""The Ancestor's Tale"" is his attempt to celebrate and do justice to what he sees as the greatest force in the universe."

Well, I suppose magnum opus could work, but that has always had the ring of ""peak achievement"" to me (despite the fact that the adjective is not superlative) and I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is Dawkins' crowning achievement, though I will gladly label it my personal favorite to date. Inspired by The Canterbury Tales and written as a long pilgrimage backwards through time, this book is one of the best treatments on phylogeny that I've ever read, containing all of the information of a well-researched textbook, yet written in the lucid and engaging style that Dawkins is rightfully praised for. Much of what is covered is theoretical, especially when the topics reach the mists of pre-history, but the concepts are expertly researched and Dawkins does an excellent job of referencing the pertinent researchers and their works should the reader choose to delve deeper on any points. There are a few instances (usually used to help illustrate points, though sometimes just to get in a good jab) in which Dawkins references then-modern sociopolitical topics, which have already begun to date the work and lose their power as examples, but this doesn't occur often enough to detract from the overall work. Anyone fascinated by life and the varied roads down which evolution has driven it over the epochs should read this book."

What this amazing book reminds me is that not only am I (are you) related to millions of people dead, living and yet to be born;I (we are) am also distant cousins to every creature and plant that ever lived, lives and ever will live. If that thought doesn't blow your mind, I doubt that anything will. Given all that, I will never look at an asparagus in the usual, indifferent way again; they are me (and you). Indeed, this book adds new meaning to the notion ""Meet the relatives"".There are so many gems to be discovered in this book that I can hardly decide where to begin. Here is just one. Dawkins says that if the whole of Africa were to be wiped away from the earth, most of the human genetic differences in the world would vanish with it. But if the rest of the world should disappear, and Africa alone remained, not much would change in the human genetic pool. In other words, people living in Africa are more genetically divergent from other Africans than the rest of humanity (those living in Europe, Asia, and the Americas and so on) are from each other. Also, did you know that whales once roamed on land? Well, if you didn't, maybe you should read this book."

Expressed in a format that is a homage to Chaucer’s ‘Canterbury Tales’, there are no chapters but mini stories as we travel on our journey back through time to unite the branches of the evolutionary tree (the Neanderthal’s Tale, The Gibbon’s Tale, The Peacock’s Tale etc) until we reach the dawn of life itself.Each ‘Tale’ discusses the modern creature in depth and the features of the extinct species from the time when the evidence suggests that species split from all others. It is a sensible way of doing it, especially if he is attempting to appeal to people who know little about evolution but are curious to understand. Recommend this to your creationist friends!Love him or hate him, it cannot be denied that Dawkins is a superb popular science writer proving that academic writing need not necessarily be heavy and dull, and that a light hearted narrative with an approachable writing style need not lack substance. At over 600 pages it may seem a daunting read at first but the flow blends the Tales seamlessly, meaning that you’ve covered a hundred pages before you know it.One of Dawkins’ best, right up there with ‘Climbing Mount Improbable’See more book reviews at my blog"

I have loved everything I've read by Dawkins, and this is no exception. Over 600 pages of history of how the humans came or could have come to existence. Lots of forensic biology, tales from different animals and plants that we meet on the road backwards in finding the common ancestors between the humans and everything else. There is everything from how the current continents came to be what and where they are now to how lots of interesting features in different species developed. The human as a species is young, and it feels weird to go back a billions years in the story. This should be a required reading in the school biology, as it helps understand how everything works. "
252,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15688922-mieke,4,"Dawkins gives an engaging history of life as well as the scientists who study it. I read this in two bouts, first half and then revisited for the second half a couple years later. I think Dawkins is a great author who tells stories that are accessible but also very interesting for those of us from a science background. However, he also tends to tangent into subjects outside his expertise, such as religion and contemporary social issues like race. I think the intention is good, but often the execution is insensitive to the wider issue (such as in his discussions of race in ""The Grasshopper's Tale""). I think that these sections can be easily skipped over, but I found myself disappointed in the author's narrow view of these issues and his reliance on a purely biological and political perspective to discuss deep social issues. Dawkins has every right to hold any opinion he wants, but I wish he didn't pose himself as an expert giving and expert opinion when his opinion is obviously formed to be pointed at specific groups (ie, the devoutly religious and skeptics) or formed outside his expertise (which is biology, not sociology or psychology or anthropology). On the whole, I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in evolution and zoology. I might suggest that they selectively read chapters though, and skip many of the chapters on Dawkins' own opinions. "

But with this he has also proven to be quite the literary genius.
The Ancestor's Tale
 is the great epic of our time, but it doesn't sing of great heroes, it sings of our past, and of the past oflife itself. I cannot even begin to describe the sense of wonder that this book has evoked, so I'm not even going to try. Just know, that if you do not read it you are missing out not only on great scientific knowledge, but also on a great story.I feel like I invoke my bragging rights... there is a very good reason why I asked Richard Dawkins to sign this particular book, which he did."

While some argue that evolution has always been moving towards homo sapiens, Dawkins spends a chapter dispelling the myth, then concedes that looking at evolution as if that were true is still somewhat interesting.The Ancestor's Tale is Dawkins doing something similar, in a way consistent with his science. He takes a pilgrimage back to the very first organisms, starting at human beings and working backwards, stopping at various points to examine our common ancestors with other organisms.The book is interesting, though much less so than many of Dawkins's other books. Other books by Dawkins have made me view the natural world as majestic and amazing in a way that I never appreciated before reading his work. The Ancestor's Tale is a bit more factual, a bit more scientific than other books by Dawkins, and in a weird way lacks this property.There were definitely some eye-opening moments, in particular Dawkins's rant about the curse of a brain that cannot see in gradual differences, but for the most part the book wasn't as enthralling as his other work.I recommend it for fans of Dawkins, but I wouldn't start here."

He has presented evolution as a pilgrimage backwards in time, ala Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, and it is wonderfully done. Anyone who has ever read Darwin's On The Origin Of Species or other works about evolution and may have struggled with them (like I have!) will appreciate the illustrious prose style that Dawkins is gifted with in telling this tale. In the closing paragraphs Dawkins laments that ""I have not had occasion here to mention my impatience with traditional piety and my disdain for reverence where the object is anything supernatural. But I make no secret of them. It is not because I wish to limit or circumscribe reverence, not because I want to reduce or downgrade the true reverence with which we are moved to celebrate the universe, once we understand it properly. . . . My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world. They represent a narrowing-down from reality, an impoverishment of what the real world has to offer."" --pp. 613-614. No, he saves most of his impatience for The God Delusion!"

Also like that novel, this one shines in it's anecdotes:* Peacock tails and other sexually selected traits are just runaway instabilities.* The platypus has ultra-sensitive lightning detection in it's bill: it can sense your muscles twitching.* Some birds and turtles can see FOUR primary colors.* You have Eve's mitochondria (...and Adam's Y chromasome, duh.)* Swifts can stay aloft continuously for a year, sleeping and mating on the wing.* mammal sexual dimorphism correlates with harem size.* we have the biggest brain/body mass, barely.* Sickle-cell anemia is recessive, and confers immunity to malaria.* Howler monkeys gave us color vision, by a viral mutation....and on and on and on.Requires some judicious skimming, but worth the effort. One thing I found difficult to swallow, Dawkins' suggestion that our big brains are a result of sexual selection: a runaway evolution of an attractive accessory, rather than a survival advantage. Also there's the point, briefly glossed over, that sexual adaptations are typically dimorphic: different between men and women. THAT seems like a landmine, in the context of brains! Hahaha."

While those books each serve a more discrete purpose, this might be the best Dawkins book to pick up for the general interest reader, as Dawkins merrily weaves together strands of evolutionary theory and essential factual knowledge using the brilliant device of a reverse pilgrimage through evolutionary history.The richness of this book is impressive - even though it's thick, Dawkins, to his credit, doesn't thoroughly rehash chapters from his previous books, but rather mentions that he's written a chapter on the subject in another book, explains the main point, and moves on. Dawkins' writing is sometimes overly dense or needlessly confusing - I found The Blind Watchmaker was both of these things at times, especially with its emphasis on computer programming analogies - but here, he is on his game throughout."

Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist, works backwards in the currently known and understood evolutionary sequence from us as humans back to the dawn of life billions of years ago. I was fascinated by how the puzzle currently fits together. I say currently for science is always working to put the pieces together and each time some new piece is understood the puzzle is modified, which is what science does. The most interesting part for me was viewing the ""family tree"" illustrations in each chapter which show the estimated place in time where species diverged to create a new tree. There were a number of interesting examples of species alive today that demonstrate evolution, which I also found edifying. However, I did get a bit lost at times, had to reach for the dictionary a few times, and also skipped over some sections when I felt a bit overwhelmed. This book could be a college text book! It is that thorough. I will look for some other books that explain evolution more basically. Still, it is worth checking this out of the library and giving it a go. See how it works for you."

To begin from today then take a pilgrimage back step by step to the beginnings must have been a lovely idea in Dawkins' head, but it made me feel worried that it might be too hard to be achieved properly. Voila, it was a brilliant success.Dawkins still suffers from that syndrome where he goes on & on about metaphors & weird analogies. Sometimes he takes pages to explain rudimentary subjects. But that's understandable when you consider he's talking to the masses & not to a specific group.Of course, this book might have needed a few more illustrations. It speaks about so many beautiful things but the beauty isn't always manifest in letters. I personally had to put it down every now & then to get a hint of what picture is being described to me. But it's understandable that Dawkins chose to include less images than needed given that his original text had an enormous size of over 600 pages.But a fair warning; unless you've got some ground in biology or some love for it, you might be way in over your head. The latin names are crowded & the biological tales are endless. You'd need much to get through that forest of conundrums into the heart of the beautiful journey that this book offers."

I took this one out from the library. That's another thing! The ladies at the reference desk are evil. Why is it that the people at circulation are so gentle and nice and the people at reference are total jawbones? They don't like to give it up! So, this book was good. Probably would have been better if I could really mull over every last detail of it. I like when Dawkins' humor pops up from time to time especially in the notes. I like how he takes a whole paragraphs and slides not even gracefully in to a political commentary.I'm completely amped to get over to libabry and take out something shorter and maybe even trashy. You would like this book if you like prehistory, evolution, Bill-Brysoney type writing, animals, and prehistoric landforms and geology. Go for it.

At each rendezvous a tale (or a few) are told by the members (or cousins) of the joined species, each tale telling something about biology, genetics, geology, etc. Some tales are quite simple (explaining how log-log plots are useful), some are more complicated and interesting, e.g. describing how first self-replicating molecules could have appeared.The biggest problem of the book is that some of the points that the author tries to make are repeated (and re-explained) over and over again, which adds to the size of the book and makes some of its parts quite boring."

That was in 2011. :P That book is a little thicker, yet also written in an accessible way......At least until, say, rendez-vous/chapter 20, when it's fish time. As Menno Schilthuizen writes in his review - see http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... - ""The level of the text is rather uneven. Some chapters are splendid science writing, while others are humdrum, dense, or even impossible to wade through."" And so I skipped the rest of the chapters to read the ending, the conclusion. Yes, it all is interesting how every species is connected, how one led to the other, etc... how bacteria lead to us and other animals. From humans to apes and monkeys over amphibians, fish towards flies and worms and ending with bacteria.All in all, The Ancestor's Tale is a very good book and a must-read if you want to find out about heritage and how old species lead to new.

It is just as annoying to insist on a total absence of God as it is for creationists to insist on a total lack of science in the evolutionary process. Just present the scientific facts and let the reader draw their own theological implications (or lack of them as the case may be). I got this book as a birthday present though so I was obligated to read it and was mildly surprised at its enjoyability. I think there are a couple of reasons why this book is a little less annoying. First off, Dawkins allows a research assistant to write some of the trickier scientific passages which is good because his science is not always the strongest. Secondly, the book covers all of life and not just human evolution which plays to Dawkins' strengths as a Zoologist. Dawkins has an extensive knowledge of a wide range of evolutionarily peculiar critters that I had no idea even existed and it was a great pleasure to read about and discover them. Still I hope I don't get another Dawkins. I much prefer something by Matt Ridley or Jared Diamond (just a hint). "

Dawkins answers question I never knew to ask.I waltz with his writing. On one hand loving the way he will introduce the known science and start revealing debates in such a way that you have time to get involved - developing your own theory like you would in a good dectective novel.

We are products of this world, descended from apes. Aside from our repugnancy to the behavior of apes, there is however a general beauty to the elegance and diversity of the evolutionary plan, this is expressed by Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of Charles Darwin and is quoted from 'Darwin Among the Machines', (I particularly like the last sentence) :""The world itself might have been generated, rather than created; that is, it might have been gradually produced from very small beginnings, increasing by the activity of its inherent principles, rather than by a sudden evolution of the whole by the Almight fiat "" 1974 ...

I had no idea that mice are more closely related to us than they are to cats, for instance!I liked the narrative conceit, too, that we humans are pilgrims travelling backwards along our family tree, meeting up with the other living ""pilgrims"" at points of common ancestry. It made for an interesting structure.Another thing that I especially appreciated was how Dawkins highlighted controversies and uncertainties, and new discoveries. I came to realize that the field of evolutionary biology has been really active in the past decade or so, thanks to lots of newly-available data from DNA. Neat!The only reason I'm giving it four stars rather than five is that midway through I started to flounder in the technical names of things; I can appreciate why he needed to use them, but it did lose me a bit."

Like the children of Noah in the myth, we are all descended from this small population, and that is why we are so genetically uniform. Similar evidence, of even greater genetic uniformity, suggests that cheetahs passed through an even narrower bottleneck more recently, around the end of the last ice age.What did our human ancestors look like before and after that bottleneck?

In Moby Dick Ishmael tells us that whales are a type of fish. I scoffed at this at the time, but Dawkins has shown me that he was right – for all mammals a subset of fish-kind (and reptile-kind in turn). Why do humans look so unlike apes, but similar to infant chimps? Humans are merely Peter Pan-like chimps whole adult stage has been lopped off. It really is a fat book, told in the manner of the Canterbury Tales – a pilgrimage back through our ancestry – and it took me the rest of Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and southern Vietnam to finish it, but despite being particularly frantic and sociable back then I was always excited to pick it up.

While I agree with his views as an secularist and much as he is correct as an atheist, he is far more than the angry atheist people think he is. His talent in making others appreciate the grandeur of evolution and how poetic understanding nature with science is unparalleled. The Ancestor's Tale is probably the most unique of his science books, it is not only concerned about evolution (despite being essential in understanding anything in biology). With each step back into history down our lineage, Dawkins tells a tale of a species and the lesson studying it taught us. By far, this and 'Power, Sex, Suicide' (which got me into science) are my favourite science books. The complement of natural history with science paints a grand, and realistic picture of the powerful tool science is, and will be a joy to read for everyone inspired by the wonders of nature. "

It starts with the modern creatures most closely related to humans and proceeds to more distant relatives. In addition to the overall survey, Dawkins introduces short ""Tales"" about related topics that a particular organism exemplifies. These are filled with interesting facts about Anthropology, Zoology, and Genetics. At each stage, Dawkins talks about what common ancestors of the relatives might have been like. I got as far as the insects before I had to return it.I found The Selfish Gene more compelling because it made a very coherent argument, rather than surveying a broad territory, but there's a lot of fascinating trivia and some interesting ideas in this as well.

I commend Richard Dawkins for his restraint, making sure that this book focuses strictly on the science of evolution rather than on his own metaphysical conclusions. It is an engaging read on the history of evolution of life on earth. But what makes it unique is the way in which it is presented, as a journey back in time through the eyes of Homo sapiens. On the way, we meet our ancestors, along with a host of other fellow pilgrims who join us as we discover our shared ancestry, right up to the hazy blur where not much is currently known – the origins of life itself. After completing the book, I felt as if I had really come back from a long and fruitful pilgrimage! It is definitely my favourite book on evolution. "

Instead of looking at evolution in terms of pointing toward an end, the author outlines the convergent points going back from man to amoeba. Best explanation of how to look at evolution -- any man living today could go back a thousand years and successfully mate with a female of that period, and the offspring of that mating could go back a 1,000 years and mate successfully, etc., etc all the way back to the first form of life. And although a man from today could probably go back 10,000 years and successfully mate there would be a point where there could not successfully mate because the man and female were no longer genetically compatible. That point would an evolutionary convergence. So it's not surprising that we can't just point to a moment in evolution where a new species appears, because it's a subtle point in time. Also why the missing link isn't obvious. Interesting! "

277,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18218857-marc,4,"The back of this book is heaped with praise for Dawkins prose. Personally, I find his writing a bit uneven--wonderful at times and then downright longwinded and smitten with itself. It took me about 120 pages to really get into this, which was the point where he gets beyond our most common concestors (the apes and monkeys). His frequent asides against creationists and divine explanations for evolution seem redundant given that his scientific explanation do more than hold their own in such arguments. All that being said, it is a fascinating journey he takes the reader on going all the way back to the origins of life on this planet. He does a wonderful job of weaving in facts and anecdotes, as well as painting a vivid picture within each of the ""tales"" his ""pilgrims"" tell the reader (he uses the Canterbury Tales as a model for the telling of our evolutionary history). His passion and knowledge are infectious."
278,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11271247-jessie,3,"What's there to say? Another Biologically, historical account of the natural world. Somewhat more detailed then say The Greatest Show on Earth, however,still lacking in some areas. But then I believe he does try to cater for all manner of potential readers, and everyone is obviously able to do their own further research if so desired. I do find it unfortunate that Dawkins writings often seem to be laced with his well honed arrogant superiority, pointedly aimed at certain individuals. And there always seems to be this underlying mentality his are the only facts worth heeding. I'm sure this isn't really the case as he often expresses his admiration for a number of scientist, it does come across quite strongly though. Despite this slight irritation the rest of the content was well presented and very interesting, and there is no denying that he is both passionate and knowledgeable in his field. "
279,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"This is a great book. I have been reading on the history of evolutionary theory, but this book summarizes the current state of the theory, and the actual history of life, in a popular way. The analogy is to the Canterbury Tales, we go on a ""pilgrimage"" to the beginning of life, meeting each branching point (""Rendezvous"") from Chimpanzees at 6 million years to the common ancestor of the primates, common ancestor of mammals, of vertebrates, etc. (39 in all) to the final origin of life. At each point, one of the ""pilgrims"" we meet tells a ""tale"" explaining some aspect of evolution, genetics, or biology.The only negative is some of Dawkins' speculative digressions (always clearly identified as such) which don't seem convincing, such as his discussion of ""memes"" -- a bit of pop philosophy I don't care for; and especially his political editorializing at a few points.Nevertheless, this is a book I will probably recommend often."
280,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216258-sean,5,"a mighty read for anyone interested in biology or genetics, with discursive bits about geography, geology, physics, astronomy, with some snarky parentheticals about politics and theology.enough people have reviewed the book that a capsule summary suffices: trace evolution backward through time starting with man (though that's an arbitary starting point, as dawkins explains) and examining each point at which a new phylum or genus branched off from our ancestors, going back in time to the beginnings of life. even more succinctly: how does evolution work?dawkins does a nice job mixing hard science with meanderings about all sorts of fascinating creatures (neaderthals, tube worms, mole rats, hyperthermophylic bacteria).recommended to anyone with an interest in science generally; highly recommended for anyone with an interest in the evolution vs. creationism argle-bargle."
281,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1254107-russell-glasser,4,"Interesting book, one of the more ""sciency"" of Richard Dawkins' offerings. I just heard PZ Myers say in an interview that this is a better book than ""The God Delusion"" for responding to fundamentalist religion. Why? Because it's just really good solid science, and as such it is better for instilling doubt in rigid interpretations of natural history.Dawkins tells the history of life in reverse order, starting with mankind and working his way back to single cells and beyond. Along the way, he briefly points out interesting and unique features of each evolutionary cousin as we meet the common ancestors they share with us.I didn't really finish it. It's long. But it's a great bathroom book: broken up into smaller vignettes that tell interesting facts about biology which you can bring up at parties (if you go to those sorts of parties...)"
282,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/351989-eli,5,"So much to like about this book. What is essentially a story about all of life gets broken up neatly into stories of various organisms that shine a light back toward the whole, adding in turn nuance, cautionary tales, and a sense of awe at the grandeur of life. Dawkins also goes heavily into the scientific process of studying evolution, and if this sounds dry it's because you haven't heard the details. On top of it there's a greater continuity running through the book as it takes the reader back through time, and it creates a great dramatic tension (seriously!) as you're left speculating the details about the point at which our lineage diverged from birds and reptiles, differentiated itself from fish, developed a backbone, etc., etc. I'm left with a renewed awe and appreciation for the diversity and endless resourcefulness of life."
283,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7709596-g-na,5,"This is one of those books that everyone should read. The Ancestor's Tale traces our heritage all the way back in time down the evolutionary tree, meeting up with such groups as the rest of the primates, mammals, birds & dinosaurs, all the way back to the bacteria (some of which we carry in our cells to this day). It not only outlines the similarities and differences between different branches of the tree as they meet up with us, but also has in-depth sections describing major elements of evolution. And speaking of evolution, there is so much evidence in this book to support evolution (probably as close to ""proof"" as we're ever going to get) that you wonder why creationists persist in their beliefs.My only criticisms are that Dawkins can be a bit wordy at times, and the drawings included should really be larger and more detailed. Highly recommended. "
284,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3522435-tom,4,"Ah what an exciting adventure! You walk back through evolutionary history from Homo sapiens all the way to the first cell (and that speculative warm pool), and the stories of lots of creatures are told on the way. Particularly tasty were the cetaceans, and the cauliflower. This is what Dawkins does best, and The Ancestor's Tale is right up there with the Blind Watchmaker and the Selfish Gene.I thought Dawkins lost interest a little once life became microscopic. I guess furry-crawly things are more his thing, but there must be great stories to tell about microscopic life.His opinions on current social issues get sortof shoehorned into the text at odd places. I mostly agreed with his views, but I think a less massively famous author wouldn't be so arrogant as to dump unsolicited rants into his popular science book."
285,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7102173-chris-chinchilla,4,"In The Ancestor's Tale, Dawkins offers a masterwork: an exhilarating reverse tour through evolution, from present day humans back to the microbial beginnings of life four billions years ago. Throughout the journey Dawkins spins entertaining, insightful stories and sheds light on topics such as speciation, sexual selection, and extinction. The Ancestor's Tale is at once an essential education in evolutionary theory and a riveting read. Washington Post Book World: ""As full and clear a picture of the way life developed on our planet as you are likely to find... A splendid piece of writing."" New York Times: ""Dawkins... is an excellent guide, both a profoundly original scientific thinker and a marvelously adept explainer... This is an ambitious, important book rich with fascinating insights."""
286,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27042780-vishnu-ramasubramanian,5,"What a pilgrimage it is? In this book Dawkins takes us on a pilgrimage to the dawn of evolution and we are joined by various species' and kingdoms of organisms at several meeting points along our journey through time. What a grand treat it is to meet our concestors, varied as they are in their characteristics, and share interesting stories about our fellow travelers. It is a menagerie of life at various levels and all explained through the voice of science that evokes in us a sense of wonder and amazement that at the end of it you are left gaping for more. There is indeed grandeur in this view of the world as Darwin has said. It is such an important book for anyone interested in evolution. Hail our guide! He has done a marvelous job. And watching David Attenborough���s Life on Earth series alongside is sure to whet your appetite for knowledge and challenge your imagination."
287,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39494985-jay-r-shepard,5," I finished this book a few months ago and thought it was a really enlightening read. Dawkins uses the style of the ""Canterbury Tales"",starting from present-day Homo sapiens and then taking off on a backwards, phylogenic journey, meeting our ancestors/concestor at various rendezvouses points in the four billion+ year backward journey. During this interesting romp into the past, Dawkins writes of a number of tales such as the Beaver's tale- one of my favorites because of the way it shows how an animals innate ability enables it to create extended phenotypes such as dam building-. It, the story, takes us back to the most simple of organisms; the eukaryotes, prokaryotes and archaic bacteria, showing the tree (sprawling bush) of life that brought about Homo sapiens. A really great and interesting read. "
288,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43545746-isaac-jonas,5,"Excellent book on understanding the processes of evolution and even some mind-blowing implications. Hell, I think you could be forgiven for just skipping around to just the tales about different animals (many evolutionary rendezvous in this backwards journey through our evolutionary past has tales about animals joining us). Really, I'd pay good money to hear Attenborough read about the eyes of howler monkeys or freaky-ass barnacles.My main complaint about this book is that while Dawkins goes out of his way to source many facts in this book, he sometimes feels like he's going rouge and firing an idea from the hip. This isn't necessarily a bad thing and I'm sure he's just intending to bring you along as he explores some thoughts, but some people might take his word for gospel on some instances. And he sometimes seems to ramble, which I have no right to judge someone for."
289,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2628408-jodi,5,"Who needs science class when you can read books like this? Dr. Dawkins takes you back through time, pointing out each split in our so-called family tree. My favorite takeaways:1 - We usually learn or talk about the world of living things in terms of a morphological taxonomy. The more accurate way, however, is the molecular taxonomy. It is only at the molecular level that we can identify our closest relatives. For example, it's at the molecular level that we can determine that the hippo's closest living relatives are whales.2 - The origin of life is less important than the origin of heredity. Without replication, the original living thing wouldn't have a way to reproduce and establish its lineage.3 - It's not unlikely that our original ancestor was a bacteria that lived underground in the hot, rocky subterranean layers of earth."
290,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61943-tamara,3,"This book by an anti-George W. Bush British biologist has an interesting premise - find the true first ancestor for life on Earth.Using Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales"" as a blueprint, with ""tales"" from many different animals/plants we learn about on the way, Dawkins follows evolution backwards to the very earliest forms of life on Earth.It is interesting, but a bit dense and sciencey for someone like me with little background in biology. Definitely NOT light summer reading. And toward the end Dawkins sounds like a broken record by repeating in every chapter that we can't be certain when the next evolutionary step took place, because the information from, like, 750 million years ago just isn't clear. Duh."
291,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1464865-l,5,"Dawkins traces backwards in time to show how all life shares common ancestors. In the process of doing so he presents fascinating ideas. for ex the idea that if you go back far enough in time then an animal is either ancestor to all humans or none because evolution would not carry out the exact same path down two separate trails resulting in humans both times. Using a mathematical model they could figure out how long ago was the 1st woman who is related to all present humans and how long ago was the 1st man. (They are not a couple and the person changes as you add other human populations)Sponge cells can be separated in a sieve and will join back together to form a new animal! Complicated and intriguing and thought provoking, I had to read it twice and still could read it again."
292,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10318809-janice,5,"Some people think it lessens humanity that we can trace our genes back through plants and single-celled organisms. I think it's amazing. Dawkins writes eloquently about a history of life on earth. His prose is lofty but isn't the subject deserving?What I especially liked was that the format of the book wasn't like a textbook. Instead of saying, ""This is evolution, this is how it works,"" it's presented as a series of stories going backwards through time, starting with humans through all of our ancestors. This provides an opportunity to derive unique lessons from each species. Some stories stand alone, some require you to remember the previous third or fourth story. Taking notes is definitely helpful while reading this book."
293,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12409283-marc-towersap,5,"A long but very comprehensive and interesting book! He pretty much starts with humans, and works backward in time, describing each branchpoint where humans and other living organisms branched from each other, yet pointing out that we could have picked any current living organism and follow it back, nothing special about us humans! Dawkins does point out where there's still questions, especially as he approaches the point where all animals, plants, and fungi joined as the common ancestor. I did learn some new things, and even though the hardcover is 614 pages, and there are parts where it helps to know some mathematics (but he points them out), but those parts are rare. Highly recommended!"
294,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10797234-ravi-warrier,3,"The uniqueness of this book is not the evolutionary biological history of the world, but the manner in which Dawkins narrates its.Hopping back in a reverse chronological order, rendezvousing with the previous known ancestor, is reminiscent of the images of marches of groups of people joining forces at a junction, just to collectively go ahead and join another group at another junction.The concept of the narrative is ingenious and is made better by the narration itself. Dawkins is exemplary in the manner that he explains various biological and evolutionary concepts and phenomenon in a candid and yet simple way.The Ancestor's Tale is a book that, literally, takes you on a mental journey to meet all the ancestors of humans, right to the beginning of time."
295,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31189915-kat-sebastian,5,"I give Richard Dawkins major respect for his works on evolutionary biology such as this one. I still somewhat remembered what I learned from his book as I was about 19 years old when I read it. I remembered how much I loved that he discussed strong details on the topic; The information was amazing to me, because there were facts I did not know until I read this book, such as Hippos are closely related to whales and what are memes. I also like what he wrote on Cambrian explosion. I believe Dawkins did an excellent job of describing evolution with the evidences we have for it. I would recommend this book for those who are not sure their thoughts on evolution or they have passion for the topic and want to understand further."
296,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23396738-kenza,5,"This was a really interesting book, despite it's length. In fact, it is ode to our wonderful biosphere, from its origins to today, so how could it be short ? In order to enjoy it best, I think this book should not be rushed. Each of the ""tales"" provide lots to ponder on and always raise several pertinent questions.I enjoyed the fact that Dawkins also presented other theories besides his own even when it was only to (constantly) remind us of the falsities creationists would like us to believe. But that is surely part of what also gives him his unique style. By the end of the book, I was really excited about all the yet to be discovered mysteries of evolutionary biology and I can't wait for all the results to come. "
297,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34523-tinea,4,"Hooray for science. Delightful and massive. Dawkins spews horrible, racist, sexist public commentary, and I generally try to boycott abusive authors regardless of what they write, on principle and to turn my support towards people whose work is marginalized by such loudmouths, those who are creating the better world within and despite the oppressive confines of this old one. But sometimes I am living alone and isolated with hours of nightly tv- and internet-free downtime to kill, and a brick of a book exploring evolution and animals in chatty, occasionally ecstatic narration is exactly the right thing for the moment. Dawkins is in such awe of creation and takes such delight in the surprising coincidence and connections of evolutionary history. What a joy to read."
298,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1815668-demian-katz,5,"I don't give a lot of five-star reviews, but this is unquestionably a five-star book. Tracing the history of life, it manages to present a huge narrative clearly and engagingly while also making room for countless fascinating tangents and teaching and clarifying many important concepts along the way. It's impossible to read this without learning something interesting, and it might even improve your understanding of the world around you. If I had to level any criticism at all, it would be that Dawkins' occasional personal asides tend to be dramatically less interesting than everything else that he's talking about -- but they are few and far between and do nothing to detract from the bulk of the book. This one's well worth the investment of time!"
299,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8560897-h-grimes,5,"I'm not sure what to add that hasn't already been stated, but this is the most eloquent and satisfying book on evolution I've ever read and should be on every biology-nerd's ""books to read before you die"" bucket list. Deeply thorough and enlightening. Every page filled me with awe. I think it will end up being one of those books that stays on my bookshelf for eternity and never ends up at a used bookstore when I go through my annual decluttering phase as I'll probably end up referencing it constantly. This is my new favorite Dawkins. Don't be intimidated by the 700-page length. The book is structured in such a way where you can take your time, take breaks and read something else if you need to and come back to it later."
