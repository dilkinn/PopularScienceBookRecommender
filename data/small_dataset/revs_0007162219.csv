If you aren't interested in dull hairsplitting, scroll directly to the Infotainment Review below. But first, I'm afraid I must tediously present myScholarly review (fact-checked)I'm conflicted about this book. There's plenty to love. As far as I can tell, Singh gets all the science right, and the fact that it's stuffed with entertaining stories about the historical characters involved makes it a fun read. I finished it in a couple of days. But how accurate are these stories? I am by no means an expert on the history of the Big Bang, but I have recently become interested in it and I've read several books. Last week, I read Kragh's 
Cosmology and Controversy
. Given that Singh praises it as ""probably the single best book on the Big Bang"" and thanks Kragh for his help in writing his own book, I am puzzled to see a number of obvious inconsistencies. Kragh comes across as an extremely careful scholar and Singh as an entertainer, so it's hard to believe that Singh is the one getting it right. For example, Kragh briefly mentions the tradition according to which the Steady State theory was born after its originators watched the 1945 movie Dead of Night, but warns that this is almost certainly a legend; Singh just presents it as fact, and spends a page describing the movie in great detail. Similarly, Kragh says that most people assume Gamow coined the word ""ylem"" to refer to the primordial matter from which the Universe was created, but that the word was first used by Gamow's collaborator Alpher; Singh says it was Gamow's invention.The above are trivial matters, but then I don't know a great deal about Gamow or the Steady State group. One part of the story I do know fairly well, however, is the role played by Georges Lemaître, where I've read Lambert's two biographies, 
Un atome d'univers
 and 
L'itinéraire spirituel de Georges Lemaître
. Lambert spent years of his life researching Lemaître and seems to have talked to just about every person still alive who knew him, so I'm inclined to trust his account. I've also Luminet's 
L'invention du Big Bang
, which generally agrees with Lambert and Kragh and is also based on primary sources.Well: with regard to Lemaître, widely claimed to be one of the three most important people in the Big Bang story, there are serious divergences between Singh's version and the ones I've seen in Lambert, Kragh and Luminet. Singh confuses Lemaître's 1927 paper, where he first suggested the idea of an expanding universe and his 1931 paper, where he named the hypothesis of the ""primeval atom"", and makes them sound like the same paper. They are in fact completely different, and were not even originally written in the same language. Singh doesn't mention that Lemaître's first paper presents experimental evidence in support of the expanding universe hypothesis, and calls it a purely theoretical paper. He says, correctly, that the original version of the paper was in French, but doesn't mention that the English translation had a crucial passage removed so as not to present the experimental evidence, which meanwhile had been independently presented by Hubble. (As Kragh points out, ""Hubble's Law"" should arguably have been called ""Lemaître's Law""). Singh says that Lemaître wasn't very interested in the Cosmological Constant, whereas it was in fact crucial to all his work on cosmology and figures largely in the 1927 paper. Finally, Singh quotes Eddington as saying that he found the idea of the universe having a beginning in time as ""repugnant"", but makes it sound like this was a reaction to Lemaître's paper. Kragh and Lambert say it was the other way round: Lemaître wrote his 1931 paper as a reaction to Eddington's remark.Okay... if you want infotainment, Singh is your man. He's a lot of fun, and you'll almost certainly learn something at the same time. But if you want serious history of science, go straight to Kragh. He's also fun, and it's just an all-round better piece of work.________________________________Infotainment review (not fact-checked)Simon Singh was born in Wellington, Somerset, where his mother, reputedly a former go-go dancer, was also keenly interested in popular science. At her son's bedtime, she used sing him poems from George Gamow's Mr. Tomkins in Wonderland to tunes of her own invention. According to family legend, Simon's first word was ""neutron""! Perhaps as a result of Mrs. Singh's unorthodox choice of lullabies, he soon showed great promise in science himself. At Imperial College, he eked out his meagre student grant by writing a science column in a local paper. Singh has always denied it, but it has been claimed that he also contributed to the royal gossip column when the regular journalist, a notorious alcoholic, was too inebriated to meet his deadline. Singh's pieces became more and more far-fetched, until one day the editor, shocked at the latest installment, asked him to justify it. Singh looked at him completely straight-faced. ""Everyone says Paul Burrell's former hairdresser has an excellent parole officer,"" he replied. ""Are you calling the woman a liar?"" The editor laughed and ran the piece anyway.It was no surprise to his friends when Singh chose to combine his talents by going into science journalism, where he rapidly made a name for himself. Big Bang is a typical example of his approach, and it is natural to compare it with Cosmology and Controversy, Helge Kragh's magisterial work on the same subject. First, the figure on the opposite page contrasts the two authors' relative popularity on Goodreads. We imagine two stacks of books, with one book for each person who has read the work in question. Kragh's stack contains only two books, but Singh's has 1,911, making a pile higher than St. Paul's Cathedral (111 m)!But what about quality? Here, another analogy might be helpful. Suppose that we divide the floor area of the Albert Hall (4226 sq m) into two exactly equal halves. On the left side, we drop one empty crisp packet for every factual error in Kragh's book, and on the right side we drop one crisp packet for every mistake in Singh's. Now imagine that two janitors are given the task of collecting all the rubbish. They start simultaneously, at exactly 12 noon [continued page 94]"
1,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7733394-muhammad,5,"‘Curiosity’ is a curious thing! It’s the only quality that differentiates humans from all the other living organisms (well, at least on the surface of Earth!). Solely driven by this ‘exclusive feature’, Man has discovered the intricate design of nature and invented his way to mimic it. If one speculates enough, he will find that all our technologies are simply based on the happenings going on around us in the nature. If you are a romantic one and like to see the nature’s creation as a Grand Opera, then perhaps, it won’t be too wrong to say that our technologies represent our rendition of this opera. The key to this derivation process is just raising a simple question, “How did this happen?” and raising questions is science. Science is a direct descendent of philosophy. While philosophy asks “Why?”, science asks “How?”. There are too many ""How?"" questions. The idea is if we can gather enough answers to these questions, they will eventually lead us to the “Why”. Finding an answer to one “How?” reveals that there are lots of other “Hows” lurking in the darkness. It’s like solving a ginormous cryptic puzzle. The clues are right before our eyes but they are way too scattered. You pick one wrong clue, you are horribly led astray and this is a very frequent case. Throughout the course of civilization, humans often forgot to raise questions, picked up the wrong clues and acted upon doctrinal views. These were (and still are) the obstacles in the way of finding the answers of “How”. The point today science is standing at, is achieved by walking through such an uneven path and the history is often bloody as well. Starting from the Greek philosophers’ era to the modern times, people have been wondering about the origin of everything and the idea of a ""Big Bang"" seems to give us the answers, finally. Today Big Bang has become a very common concept and almost everyone you find on the streets can spend a few words on it. Like many other science theories, Big Bang also had to fight a tough battle to survive. It might sound a little exaggerated, but Big Bang theory is said to be human kind’s greatest achievement (accumulating all the philosophical and scientific disciplines). So, one naturally can ask now how this great idea, that explains the creation’s origin, was conceived? British science writer Simon Singh produces a weighty tome on the history of Big Bang that tells the enthralling tales of the origin of the universe. There is science and there is history, a lot of history. Singh proves himself to be a great story teller who makes the highly complicated ideas very much accessible, literally to anyone. This book proves again that one doesn't have to be a science major to learn the science. You will have a good idea how scientists are calculating the enormous distances from our planet to the stars just by reading few paragraphs. No mathematical manipulation, no tedious calculation, nothing! You will be badly hooked on this book once you start it, I can almost bet on it! The way the book is organized also allows you to keep things in mind without much stress. The tales of the mavericks, the mad scientists, based on whose contributions the Big Bang model is established, are very inspiring and fascinating. Famous astronomer Carl Sagan’s “Cosmos” inspired many to become real life astronomers. I think it won’t be surprising if Singh’s “Big Bang: The Origin of The Universe” plays a similar role. For aspiring astronomers, physicists, even science writers, this book will be a great head start. The Universe is quite old. The Big Bang model gives us an average age of 13.8 billion years, as of today. Once people asked how we were created and many centuries later we found that Big Bang is probably the answer. Now another question has already been raised. “What happened before Big Bang?” Well, this certainly will give birth to a very hot philosophical (and religious too) debate and I do not possess enough knowledge and audacity (probably the scientists do not either!) to continue this discussion. Instead, I will simply quote St. Augustine (b. 354 AD) as Singh himself did in the epilogue of the book. I am putting it here for the sheer fun of it and nothing serious! “What was God doing before He created the Universe? Before He created Heaven and Earth, God created hell to be used for people such as you who ask this kind of question”! "
2,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"This brilliant book by Simon Singh, first published in 2004, seeks to explain the theories that have existed since ancient times until the modern day concerning the structure, age and creation of the universe. Singh has an easygoing style of writing and having said what he wants to say he will often summarise the remarks he has made, thus making sure he has been fully understood and that the reader is keeping up to speed. Also, rather than just discuss the cold scientific facts, he brings the subject to life by describing the personalities involved, and the challenges they faced in their attempts to solve the mysteries of the cosmos. Each chapter also ends with a helpful two page ""handwritten"" summary covering the salient points.He starts the book by addressing the place of the earth in the big scheme of things, going through the various early theories where the earth was at the centre of everything. Interestingly, in the third century BC the ancient Greek astronomer Aristarchus had worked out that it was the earth that moved around the sun and not the other way around, but he lost out to the views of heavyweights Aristotle and Ptolemy who had both favoured a geocentric model. In fact, logic and common sense seemed to rule out the idea of the earth orbiting the sun, for reasons such as if the earth was travelling through space at great speed we would feel a tremendous wind and would be knocked off our feet as the ground moved under us. Not to mention that placing the earth at the centre of the universe was a useful way of explaining gravity in that everything was attracted to this centre point. The geocentric view prevailed for many centuries, this position also suiting the early church who stood steadfast against anyone proposing something different. But, eventually, through the determined efforts of Copernicus, Tycho Brahe and Galileo in the 16th century, science won through and the church was forced to accept the heliocentric layout of the solar system.Singh discusses the speed of light and the postulated existence, or otherwise, of the ether. I was surprised to read that it was as early as 1670 when the Danish astronomer, Ole Rømer, first recognised that light had a finite speed and he made a not unreasonable estimate of this speed based on calculations of apparent anomalies in the orbit of one of the moons of Jupiter. Of course, of critical importance in understanding light was Einstein's contribution, which led to the development of his special theory of relativity. Singh's account naturally progresses to Einstein's general theory of relativity and to his view that the universe was static, although he did need to add a cosmological constant to his general relativity theory to support this conjecture. But shortly afterwards saw the (then) unpopular, and independently developed, theories of Friedman and Lemaître which proposed an expanding universe, with Lemaître being the first to recognise that if the universe was expanding then it must once have been smaller, and once probably minute - hence he was the first to hint at a big bang theory although he called it the primaeval atom. Lemaître also had the distinction of being both a physicist and an ordained priest, so he can be thought of as having hedged his bet when it came to theories of creation.Next, Singh discusses the discovery in the early 20th century that many of the so-called nebulae that were visible through telescopes were actually far away galaxies, and not, as some thought, merely objects within our own Milky Way galaxy. Further research, notably by Hubble, showed that most of these galaxies were moving away from earth, and the further they were away, the faster they were moving. Experimental evidence had thus been found for the expansion of the universe and therefore, as a corollary, an initiation in a big bang, thus opening the way to a proper Big Bang theory.But, moving on, Singh notes that this incipient Big Bang theory had problems. For example, it couldn't account for how the heavy chemical elements had formed. George Gamow had led efforts that succeeded in explaining how the heat of the big bang would have led to the fusion of proton and neutrons, leading to the formation of helium in the proportion that it is present in the universe today. But he couldn't explain the formation of the heavier elements. Another issue was the age of the universe, because using the estimated speeds and distances of far away galaxies, it seemed that the universe was younger than the age of the earth, as calculated from radioactivity measurements. In the 1940s, Fred Hoyle, along with others, proposed an alternative to the Big Bang theory by suggesting a Steady State model in which the universe was expanding but where new matter was continually being created in the gaps between the old galaxies. The discrepancies in the age of the earth and the universe were less of a problem for this theory but it still had its own difficulties. It couldn't, for instance, account for the formation of any of the elements, not even helium. Throughout his life, Hoyle remained very critical of the Big Bang Theory and ironically it was he who coined the term ""Big Bang"", although it was intended to be derogatory. The battle between the Big Bang and Steady State theories continued but slowly the ground moved in favour of the former. Successive discoveries uncovered errors in estimates of the size of the universe, and hence its age, and it was shown that the universe was indeed older than the earth, which was a welcome boost for the Big Bangers. Then, by calculating the pressures and temperatures expected to be found in stars during their life cycles, Hoyle was successful in theorising how the heavier elements could have formed from helium. Although Hoyle was a Steady Stater, his research had helped both camps. Then radio astronomy was successful in finding younger galaxies at the far reaches of the universe - their absence in the closer parts of the universe contradicted the predictions of the Steady State model, adding further weight to the Big Bang theory. The final nail in the coffin for the Steady State argument was the accidental discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation by Penzias and Wilson. Big Bang theorists had predicted the presence of this radiation, which dates back to about 300,000 years after the initiation of the universe, and they had been proved right. In the 1990s, equipment on the COBE satellite detected minor variations in the background radiation, which are thought to reflect minor variations in the density of the early universe, which in turn provided the seeds for the growth of the galaxies. Curiously, it's only at the end of the book, in an epilogue, that Singh talks about more contentious issues, including inflation, dark matter and dark energy. I was a little puzzled as to why this wasn't incorporated into main text but this is only a minor issue and it doesn't detract from the general flow. Much of the scientific information in the book I knew already but it was still refreshing and entertaining to see it presented in its historical context, and to read of the struggles by those involved in formulating and then attempting to prove the various theories. For a simple, non-mathematical introduction to cosmology, I think this book is difficult to beat. "
3,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549698-nathan,4,"Full of fascinating historical anecdotes and character sketches, ""Big Bang"" was fun as well as informative from start to finish. I struggle with physics books because my mind often has trouble grasping concepts at different scales from our own, but Singh writes and explains so well that I was not just able to understand but was able to teach it to my kids afterward! I now look at the skies differently as a result of reading this book, and my knowledge of the history of physics is a lot richer. Strongly recommended for anyone who likes science fact and history books."
4,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42731007-shivam-chaturvedi,5,"The most incomprehensible thing about the Universe is that it is comprehensible. - Albert EinsteinThe Universe has some of the most amazing things you could ever imagine. Black Holes, Neutron Stars, Supernovas, Quasars, Galaxies, and all sorts of oddities in between. And yet the most remarkable thing is this pale blue dot, an ordinary planet orbiting an ordinary star, orbiting the core of an ordinary galaxy - one of the more than 200 billion galaxies in observable universe.Earth, from an image taken by Cassini, from underneath the rings of Saturn during its flyby of the planetBut ofcourse the earth isn't ordinary. It isn't ordinary because we, human beings, evolved on this planet. A species that has been able to contemplate its place amongst the cosmos. A species, and let this sink in, has dared to understand the origins of this universe. A species that has come so far that its truly a miracle - perhaps the only real miracle that ever happened. Its this wondrous journey that this book aims to catalogue. Now you have to be a bit of a space romantic to understand this book. The author obviously likes to throw in those condescending explanations that are supposed to explain it to the layman - but despite his best efforts, you can't really. There's a reason that Big Bang theory only came to be accepted across the scientific community around the 1970s - and that is because it is remarkably difficult to wrap your head around.First, to believe that something (and the universe is a lot of something) could emerge from nothing is a bit of a leap, to say the least. For many years the argument against this argument was that this was exactly what Religion would have you believe. And the big bang wasn't some explosion in space - rather it was the explosion of space. And that is literally the start of it. Big Bang theorists would also like you to believe that for a universe that is 13.82 billion years old, they are able to predict how things were evolving a mere 10^-43 seconds after the bang. And that is utterly mind boggling. But hey, don't let the super technical details bog you down. My suspicion always has been that the scientists who devise these theories don't understand them too well either. And that is fine. Because like everywhere else in life, it is the journey that matters. The path that has led us to this current understanding of the universe has been littered with a ensemble cast of characters, who in their own small and grand ways, have made contributions to this fascinating story. You could always go read the wikipedia article on Big Bang, and it'd tell you as much about the theory as you could ever hope to learn anyway. The part where Simon Singh succeeds, is in telling the story of this theory. About the wonder of discovery, and the sheer delight that comes with it. For anyone who has ever loved and romanticized the universe, this book is a must. For those of you who haven't, there's still a lot more to be found than just drab details. Oh, and there's a reference to pigeon shit being referred to as white dialectic material. I found that quite funny."
5,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8676317-a-man-called-ove,5,"As some1 who both loved Carl Sagan's Cosmos (book) and Neil Tyson's rebooted ""Cosmos"" on Netflix, I had to read this one. The surprise was that this one is a better book - in terms of readability, in terms of coherence, in making you understand the various steps to the Big Bang theory. It was a delightful read from start to finish.The cover says ""The most amazing and important theory of science."" I strongly disagree. Perhaps the author forgot that people of non-Abrahamic religions form half the world's population. And we have never thought that the earth was created 6000 years ago. Yes, the Big Bang theory is a fascinating theory and it unravels a lot about the creation of the universe but I doubt if only by itself it has tangible value. Overall - Dont think popular science writing gets any better. At par with Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything."
6,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"Singh explains highly complex astronomical theories entertaining, vivid and memorable.Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.A journey through the last two and a half millennia of astronomical discoveries begins in the myths and legends of various high cultures, grazes Greek astronomers and the heretical ideas of a Kepler to shift the focus ever closer to the present and the 19th and 20th centuries. The lightness and humor with which Singh leads through the chapters opened with amusing quotes, which is scientifically often quite hearty, even more, unexpected and enjoyable. It does not diminish the fun in the least that you always know in advance who will win the race of competing hypotheses. However, what models have been designed, elevated to doctrine, and overthrown would provide material for more than one book. With what arguments and conclusions the respective defenders of an idea sought to substantiate the own truth seems bizarre sometimes.However, if you look at the current state of research with black holes, dark matter, string theory, quantum foam and consorts, the old models seem almost harmless, innocent and understandable. In some cases, one can speak of the fortune of the father of the thesis that one of the unimaginable theories has proven in retrospect to be correct, without one could blame the conclusion of the respective scientist a mistake of reasoning. It was merely the luck or bad luck to be able to support the right or wrong idea with a more or less logically comprehensible thought building. Whether it collapsed afterward or disciples rallied around it was sometimes fate.Moreover, they were always dazzling and bizarre figures, the scientists then and probably today. Just this display of humanity, including private anecdotes of various greatness, loosens by reading to chuckle stimulating quirks and peculiarities on the reading and dismantled in part, the high reputation of some luminaries. One may have been scientifically ingenious, but the human was sometimes still a misanthrope. What seemed bizarre and inexplicable to the respective times of a Newton, Einstein, Hubble, Galileo, Brahe or Copernicus can be as well translated to our present-day knowledge. This is embarrassingly still in its infancy over the very nature of all the stroboscopic twinkling lights in the night sky.Just as only fragments of the sky have been considered, mapped, and interpreted in the first place, not even to speak of exploration or understanding, the glimpses of the more profound quality are even rarer and less accurate in their correctness. In many ways, either theory has developed that result from using the effects of something unknown on known phenomena, such as gravity or light, as an explanation for the same. Alternatively, random contemplations of cosmic events that contradict any physical order and must be filed under the note of inexplicability for the time. So it is amusing to know that there will always be one or the other scientist who believes he has the final formula or universal explanation theory in his hands. Be it thousands of years ago, in the present or the distant future. No matter in which era, just for the sake of entertainment and cognition, these knowledge fighters should be respected on the front lines of understanding. Also, one of them will always be right, allowing a nanometer of progress in understanding the infinite and glorious complexity around, in and about us.Singh erklärt hochkomplizierte astronomische Theorien unterhaltsam, anschaulich und einprägsam.Eine Sternenfahrt durch die letzten zweieinhalb Jahrtausende astronomischer Erkenntnisse nimmt ihren Anfang in den Mythen und Legenden verschiedener Hochkulturen, streift griechische Astronomen und die ketzerischen Gedanken eines Kepler, um das Hauptaugenmerk immer näher zur Gegenwart und dem 19. und 20. Jahrhundert hin zu verlagern. Die Leichtigkeit und der Humor, mit dem Singh durch die, mit amüsanten Zitaten eröffneten Kapitel führt, treffen einen bei wissenschaftlich oft doch recht deftiger Kost umso unerwarteter und erfreulicher. Es mindert den Spaß auch nicht im Geringsten, dass man vorab immer weiß, wer das Rennen der konkurrierenden Hypothesen gewinnen wird. Allein welch Modelle entworfen, zur Lehrmeinung erhoben und wieder gestürzt worden sind, würde Stoff für mehr als ein Buch liefern. Mit welchen Argumenten und Schlussfolgerungen die jeweiligen Verfechter einer Idee die jeweilige Wahrheit zu untermauern trachteten mutet mitunter bizarr an. Wenn man sich den momentanen Stand der Forschung mit schwarzen Löchern, dunkler Materie, Stringtheorie, Quantenschaum und Konsorten jedoch betrachtet, erscheinen sie beinahe harmlos, unschuldig und nachvollziehbar. In manchen Fällen kann man vom Glück des Vaters der These sprechen, dass sich eine der jeweils unvorstellbaren Theorien im Nachhinein als richtig erwiesen hat, ohne dass man der Schlussfolgerung des jeweiligen Wissenschaftlers einen Denkfehler anlasten könnte. Es war schlichtweg das Glück oder Pech die richtige oder falsche Idee mit einem mehr oder minder logisch nachvollziehbaren Gedankengebäude untermauern zu können. Ob es danach in sich zusammenbrach oder sich Jünger darum scharten, war mitunter Schicksal.Und schillernde und skurrile Figuren waren sie allemal, die Wissenschaftler damals und wahrscheinlich auch heute. Gerade diese Zurschaustellung der Menschlichkeit samt privater Anekdoten diverser Geistesgrößen lockert durch zum Schmunzeln anregende Macken und Eigenheiten die Lektüre auf und demontiert teilweise auch das hohe Ansehen mancher Koryphäen. Man mag wissenschaftlich genial gewesen sein, aber menschlich blieb man mitunter doch ein Misanthrop.Was zu den jeweiligen Zeiten eines Newtons, Einsteins, , Hubbles, Galileis, Brahes oder Kopernikus bizarr und unerklärlich anmutete, kann man genau so gut auch auf unsere heutige, peinlicherweise noch immer in den Kinderschuhen steckende Erkenntnis über die wirkliche Beschaffenheit all der stroboskopisch funkelnden Lichter am Nachthimmel ummünzen. So wie nur Bruchstücke des Himmels überhaupt erst betrachtet, kartographiert und interpretiert worden sind, von Erforschung oder Verständnis gar nicht erst zu sprechen, so sind die Blicke in die tiefere Beschaffenheit noch rarer und in ihrem Richtigkeitsgehalt unsicherer. In vielerlei Hinsicht werden entweder Theorien entwickelt, die daraus resultieren, dass man die Wirkung von etwas Unbekanntem auf bekannte Phänomene, wie etwa Schwerkraft oder Licht, als Erklärung für selbiges heranzieht. Oder es ergeben sich zufällige Betrachtungen von kosmischen Ereignissen, die jeglicher physikalischen Ordnung widersprechen und bis auf weiteres unter dem Vermerk der Unerklärlichkeit abgeheftet werden müssen.So ist es doch amüsant zu wissen, dass es immer den einen oder anderen Wissenschaftler geben wird, der die endgültige Allformel oder die universelle Erklärungstheorie in petto zu haben glaubt. Sei es vor Jahrtausenden, in der Gegenwart oder ferner Zukunft. Egal in welcher Epoche, allein des Unterhaltungs- und Erkenntniswertes wegen ist diesen Kämpfern an der vordersten Front des Verstehens Respekt zu zollen. Und einer von Ihnen wird immer recht haben, was einen Nanometer Fortschritt im Verständnis der unendlichen und herrlichen Komplexität um, in und über uns ermöglicht."
7,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,5,I absolutely love this book! It’s written in a very accessible way to help the scientist and non scientist alike to understand the subject matter and was a really enjoyable read. It first starts by laying the foundations of scientific theories and takes you on an adventure through the scientific journey of time to how the current model of the universe was arrived at. I find it amazing how the scientific method was developed and how we built on the work of others to arrive at the theories we have today!I also loved that the book went into detail with an introduction to the scientists involved in developing the theories and mentioned about their lives which I always find interesting. I learnt so much reading this book and really glad I took the time to read it!The end of chapter summaries were great too which I think greatly add to reinforcing what you’ve learnt throughout the chapter. There was also amazing use of many wonderful diagrams to further help cement understanding and the balance between picture and words details and outlines the concepts of Big Bang formation beautifully without the use of intense mathematics and extensive formulas! Which I think is a real testament to the author for communicating science in such a brilliant way to be understood by all. Great book!
8,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233507-s-ach,5,"My wondering thrust me to a world of infinity. Confusion reached its nadir and I gasped to know it all. Remembering 'Don't Panic', I started to organize my thoughts. I gathered the first step towards solving any of my bewilderment would be to understand the theories of how it all began - the universe, the time, the life. I turned to Stephan Hawking's widely unread bestseller 'A Brief History of Time'. Though it answered some of my questions, in turn posed many more than before. I realized that to move further I have to take a peep into Mr Einstein's mind. Since my small mind is too simple to comprehend any complexities, I rather chose ""Relativity Simply Explained"" by Martin Gardner. With vivid illustrations, the author tried to make me appreciate both the special and general theories of relativity, the concepts of space-time, the twin paradox, et al. But again, I was not thoroughly convinced about my understanding. I oscillated between 'Oh! Now, I got it' and 'You lost me again.'Desperate to get rid of the pricking confusions, I searched for a good source. In my favourite old book store, I found this book lying in one corner with ""Big Bang"" written over its cover and below it an Indian name 'Simon Singh'. Reluctantly I put it in my book-cart. And as I read through I became more and more convinced that this is by far the best book on this topic I had come across. The ease with which Singh has explained the concept of ""Time is personal"" made me a big fan of the book. It not only clarified many of my doubts, but also fed me lots of food for thoughts. In the course of explaining the theories of universe, the book with a very illustrious way takes the reader through the history of the evolution of these ideas. With humourous anecdotes related to famous scientists it amuses the reader while explaining the most complicated fundamentals.What I find the best about this book is - it doesn't try to be too technical with physics mumbo jumbo, rather it tries to explain each concept in a layman's way without discussing a single mathematical equation. Probably the author realized the essence of this Einstein saying - ""If you can't explain something to a six-year-old, you really don't understand it yourself."" The book mightn't have answered all my questions, but it did take me through Copernicus to Hoyle in a lyrical manner. Reading it, the model of big bang has come alive in my mind. It definitely opened a window to cosmos. Today's sky looks so different and intriguing than yesterday's."
9,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This translates to a short history of the cosmos. A complex theory like that of big bang builds on a lot of knowledge, so the author begins with the ancient greeks and move forward from there. The book is written with humour, insight into human nature and endless fascination about the universe. There is enthusiasm in every sentence. However, the book ends with the final proof that there really was an explosive start to the universe, which somehow feels a bit anti-climatic. ""Wasn't there more?"" Of course there's more, just not in this book. Nonetheless, a terrific read for any lay reader with a sound curiousity about the world we live in and where it came from."

George Gamow was a Ukranian born scientist. He rushed home one day from his Russian Orthodox Church to study wine and bread secreted in his cheeks. Under a microscope he discovered they were only wine and bread, not the body and blood of Christ. He later wrote: ""I think this was the experiment that made me a scientist."" He also felt the Communist ideology made it impossible to discover the truth. He and his wife tried to escape across the Black Sea to Turkey in a kayak. Not very scientific of him. They had to paddle back. They were able to go to a conference in Brussels later with no intention of ever returning. On April 14, 1948, the Washington Post had the headline ""WORLD BEGAN IN 5 MINUTES.""' The word ""serendipity"" was coined by Sir Robert Walpole in 1754. The history of science and technology is littered with serendipity. Just look up how Velcro was invented. Calvin of Calvin and Hobbes fame thinks the Big Bang should be called ""The Horrendous Space Kablooie!"" Now even the Catholic Church tolerates the Big Bang. "

Most of the ""science parts"" are not difficult to understand and you don't really need a background to appreciate this book, just the will to learn. The writing is particularly good, filled with interesting anecdotes and humor and Simon singh is actually a great storyteller! "
12,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70795728-doug-anderson,5,"love love this book. the history of science and the scientific method and the universe, in readable, understandable, engrossing form. simon singh is the bomb. sort of."
13,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88992247-ash-gawain,4,"Simon Singh: if only you had published your book five years earlier, I would have gone into physics instead of business admin.While I thought Hawking’s A brief History of Time was too condensed, I really appreciated the historical dimension of Singh’s Big Bang. A new book will have to be written when a unified theory is found to explain both quantum gravity and the general relativity. I hope Singh is still around then. "
14,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8581195-ais,5,"Simon Singh is one of my favorite authors. He quickly rose to this rank after I read The Code Book, loved it way more than I ever expected, and afterward devoured every other book of his I could find. He has the unique ability to write nonfiction in a way that is as readable and intriguing as fiction, while simultaneously providing the complete context of the topic he has set out to explore.What I think is so commendable about Simon Singh is that he starts wayyyyy at the beginning of the story in history-- generations before the thought may ever occur to anyone-- so that he can tell the entirety of the meaning of the topic. To me, that is the perfect way to learn about a subject. And the fact that he can do so on a nonfiction topic-- spanning hundreds of years in his telling, dipping in and out of cosmology, mythology and physics-- and still keep it readable goes to show how adept he is at these types of books. I'm not normally a nonfiction reader because I seem to have a short attention span for anything that comes off as too dry to me, but I was actually crushingly disappointed when I later realized I had read through all of his books available.Big Bang itself taught me a lot about a topic I thought I knew fairly well after all the times it had been mentioned in school. It turned out there was a lot that I was missing and I found it fascinating to read a more complete history. I actually brought Big Bang home with me one Christmas for ""light reading."" A 500+ page book on The Big Bang Theory and the origin of the universe truly did feel like light reading to me. Of course, it ended up sparking some interesting conversation with a family member who doesn't happen to believe that the Big Bang occurred...Finally, I also have to say that my favorite, nerdiest insult I have ever heard came from this book: ""One of the fiercest critics of the Big Bang model was the Bulgarian-born Fritz Zwicky, infamous among cosmologists for his eccentricity and recalcitrance. He had been invited to Caltech and Mount Wilson in 1925 by the Nobel Laureate Robert Millikan, and Zwicky repaid the favour by announcing on one occasion that Millikan had never had a good idea in his life. All of his colleagues were targets of his abuse and many of them were subjected to his favourite insult -- 'spherical bastard.' Just as a sphere looks the same from every direction, a spherical bastard is someone who was a bastard whatever way you looked at them.""-Big Bang by Simon Singh, Chapter 4: Mavericks of the Cosmos, page 278Come on! A book that throws in little asides like that while teaching you about history is more than worth the read. I definitely recommend this book to anyone even slightly curious about this topic."
15,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1752430-drew,4,"I really enjoyed this book, especially after reading Singh's work on the history and proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Singh is the perfect lay writer of science and science history. His prose flows quickly and he selects wonderful examples that explain more obscure topics. His books, and writers like him, should be assigned reading in high schools, and even middle schools, to expose kids to the wonders of science that often come across as boring and useless in typical science classes. These types of work would be a great boast to STEM, and even the arts (STEAM), showing the importance, beauty and value of writing, communicating, and philosophizing. I guess people would assume I'd give this five stars. If I didn't know about the Big Bang and physics, I most likely would have. My rating is more a mark of how I felt about the book. It was too beginner, even though I'm certainly not a scientist. I've read a bunch and have taken several high school & college physics and astronomy classes. So, when Singh was talking about physics, the text seemed to move too slowly. Now, if I wasn't familiar with the topic, it would have been perfect. But, to be honest, I did learn some interesting physics in the book, e.g. the actual cause of redshift is related to the stretching of spacetime rather than a doppler shift effect (p. 270), how to create carbon from helium within a star (pp. 390-396), and that lithium and boron were produced around the same time helium was being created out of hydrogen (p. 398).As for the history of science, this is where Singh excels beyond most. I loved the history, the little tidbits, the emotions and the battles behind the theories, equations and discoveries. There were so many intriguing things from the ancient world to today. I wish there had been more of these, but the book probably would have been twice as long! (The author mentions that in a Q&A appended to my edition, noting that his first draft had lots of neat items and it was about 1,000 pages long!). I'm also sad that the excitement of the public in response to these types of scientific discoveries seems to be fading, especially in the West and very especially in the US. Most people just don't seem to think science or the larger world is as exciting as spectator violence or reality TV.I hope that writers like Singh can help put excitement and interest back in peoples' minds, and more importantly, their hearts. This is what captured me as a small boy and it has carried me to today. The wonder of a small child is something to try to grasp for each day."
16,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1753018-paula-koneazny,4,"I'm a sucker for readable tomes explicating theoretical physics/ cosmology for the non-mathematically trained and feel compelled to pump up my puny understanding of the field every now and then. Singh kept me engaged almost all the way through The Big Bang(the book slacks off a bit toward the end)as he ran through the history of the science leading up to and encompassing the acceptance of The Big Bang theory as the most accurate description we now have of the origin and evolution of the universe. Most of the material here won't be new to anyone who has been paying attention or who has read such books as Brian Greene's Elegant Universe and/ or The Fabric of the Cosmos, but The Big Bang still provides a good review of the subject and an enjoyable read as well, with such anecdotes as the following to keep a reader amused: ""One tall tale explains how an astronomer driving to his observatory tried to use the Doppler effect to outwit the police. Having been caught jumping a red light, the astronomer argued that the light had appeared green to him because he was moving towards it and consequently it was blueshifted. The police officer excused him the ticket for running a red light, and instead doubled the fine and gave him a speeding ticket. To achieve such a dramatic wavelength shift, the astronomer would have had to be driving at roughly 200,000,000 km/h."" "
17,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/990373-stuart,4,"Simon Singh is a marvellously engaging non-fiction writer. Only straying from his central subject to relay a surprising or eyebrow-raising anecdote, he manages to paint a human face on the history of our perception of the universe.In telling the story of the Big Bang theory, the book takes you through miniature biographies and descriptions of the impact of the life-work of Galileo, Copernicus, Kepler, Hubble and many others who strove and discovered gems of cosmological truth through history. The anecdotes include tales of serendipitious discoveries, warring theorists, revolutionary ideas, and the barriers to understanding that plagued scientists through the ages - establishment, dogma, pesky pigeons...it's all here.The science is explained narratively, with a rare equation thrown in after the pictures and allegories have already gotten you to a point of clear understanding.All in all, Big Bang is an enjoyable run-through of the assembly of a long history of observable facts into a coherent theory of the universe, a triumph over the very human failings of ego and fanciful, groundless assertion."
18,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49537311-amirreza,5,"Another epic by Simon Singh, a talented writer, and a great story-teller. The book can be undoubtedly considered as a small encyclopedia of Cosmology. The amount of information summarized over the course of hundred years in this compact book is fascinating. Likewise his previous works, the author takes a detour between subjects to explain other topics and then links it to the main story in an extraordinary way possible. No extra knowledge, besides some basic physical understanding, is required as a prerequisite to the scientific subjects. It inspired me to look again and understand the universe more deeply than ever before. The five chapters plus an epilogue section of the book would surely be in my ever-reading list. Also, there is a great further reading list in the end of the book which is quite helpful for those who want to explore more. "

It's not just about the Big Bang theory, but about the whole history of cosmology, starting with the-earth-is-flat-and-at-the-center-of-the-universe beliefs, up until the present-day understanding of things. He pulls in lots and lots of interesting characters, both well-known (Galileo and Einstein) and less well-known, all of whom are worthy of attention. Singh has a real gift for turning science into a story, and explaining it in a way that non-scientists can understand."

You don't have to know any science nor Math in order to enjoy this book: The only prerequisite is curiosity."

Contrary to the name of the book, the author does NOT actually go into the details of big bang or even special/general theories of relativity - it was quite disheartening. The book is meant for a wide range of audience and can at best be used as an intro to big bang. Nevertheless, the content was good and it was a great read!"

This quest has led many curious scientists since ages to come up with various theories on how we reached here and where we are going now. The seemingly obvious facts like earth being round, took years of sound theory and lot of convincing to be accepted by the broader group. Obviously it is not easy to take a new idea which is counter intuitive to everything that you have seen or heard before and to make it the new acceptable explanation of our surrounding.This scientific book is no less gripping than a thriller fiction. An army of researchers from different fields of science contributed in developing this theory of The Big Bang. It is fascinating to know that this unfathomable universe began with something that was smaller than the tip of a pen and evolved to where we see it now.If you are science lover, if you are curious, if you like philosophy or even if you are very religious; you will love this book which answers many questions on how we reached to this place at this time. "
30,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/158471-suman-srivastava,5,"I'm surprised that I hadn't heard of Simon Singh earlier. He is a fantastic storyteller who makes science easy without dumbing it down. In this book he takes you through a fascinating journey from fables about how God created the universe, all the way to the Big Bang and the questions that still remain to be answered. He explains how each discovery led to questions which led to more discoveries. He also provides a peek into contemporary societal beliefs at each stage of this journey to show how heroic the scientists needed to be to defend their theories. I'm now off to read more of his books. "
31,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78228334-apoorva-ranade,5,"This book was fascinating to me, even though I did not have any interest in astronomy earlier. Simon Singh is a talented writer who managed to add anecdotes to discoveries and pointed out why each discovery and invention in the book is relevant to the full picture of Big Bang. Looking forward to reading another book by this author next!"
32,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65106552-aaron,3,"Overall, I thought Singh skillfully attempted to synthesize an extremely dense and esoteric topic of cosmology and astronomy for the masses. His inclusion of the historical background of various scientific breakthroughs and the lives of the scientists and astronomers helped to keep the story interesting and understandable. I was frustrated that it took 300+ pages for Singh to make it to the Big Bang. I felt he skimmed over the real details of the theory and only briefly mentioned ongoing research in his Epilogue. He could certainly use an amendment to detail the last 16 years of research in this area, I feel his summary is outdated at this point.Ultimately, if you're really interested in how we got to the Big Bang theory and the latest research/theories, there's probably a 15-minute YouTube video that will do the trick instead."

Living in Solon, Ohio, I know that Lake Erie is a few miles to the north (go to the end of our street and turn left). Downtown Cleveland is about 20 miles to the northwest, Chagrin Falls just east, Chicago about a 6 hour drive west, DC about 6 hours through Pennsylvania to the east.When I travel, I always look at a map, even if I’m not driving; where is the hotel in relation to the airport, where is San Diego compared to LA and Tijuana, where is the French Quarter in relation to English Turn, to Tulane University, to Lake Ponchartrain?I understand that many people don’t bother themselves with where they are, they’re here. (Many) women understand how to get somewhere by directions, left at the Burger King, right at the house with the big porch. Where they are is not important: which direction would you go to get to Chicago gets a blank look, left at Burger King?Lately men are just as bad. I asked a recent a 50-something male visitor to my home, which way did you come, Harper Road or Rt. 91? I got a blank look; I just turned where the GPS told me.I like to know how things work. I understand how an internal combustion engine works, why a refrigerator is cold inside and hot underneath, what statistics mean and what they don’t mean.I like to think I understand the basics of current scientific thought; the significance of DNA to genetic development of organisms and species, the periodic table, the movement of the planets, the Big Bang Theory.This book is for people who like to know where they are – cosmologically speaking. I thought I had a thorough lay (non-mathematical – Colin don’t laugh) understanding of the general theory of relativity. I read Hawking’s A Brief History of Time more than 20 years ago and many other popularizations since. But I always wondered, if the speed of light was a constant, how does gravitational attraction affect stars and planets instantly no matter how distant. Now I understand. Simon Singh has written a wonderfully readable, informative book about the development of mankind’s understanding about the universe. The science is comprehensible and clearly explained, the biographical sketches of people who made key contributions, particularly during the past 150 years are entertaining and in some cases inspiring.An excellent read in itself, the book is made even better by the quotations that Singh puts at the beginning of each chapter and sprinkles throughout the text.•	“I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.” Galileo Galilei•	“ Living on Earth may be expensive, but it includes an annual free trip around the Sun.” Anonymous•	“Physics is not a religion. If it were we’d have a much easier time raising money.” Leon Lederman•	“But the years of anxious searching in the dark for a truth that one feels but cannot express, the intense desire and the alternations of confidence and misgiving, and the final emergence into light – only those who have experienced it can appreciate it.” Albert Einstein•	“It is impossible to travel faster than the speed of light, and certainly not desirable, as one’s hat keeps blowing off.” Woody Allen•	“The known is finite, the unknown is infinite; intellectually we stand on an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean of inexplainability. Our business in every generation is to reclaim a little more land.” T.H. Huxley•	“Errors using inadequate data are much less than those using no data at all.” Charles Babbage•	“Theories crumble, but good observations never fade.” Harlow Shapley•	“First, get the facts, then you can distort them at your leisure.” Mark TwainThere are many more.This book is very readable but it covers demanding concepts. It may not be worth the effort to those for whom “left at Burger King” is ok. But if you like to know where you are, this book will help you know."
34,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2310818-peter,4,"This book is not so much an explanation of the Big Bang itself as a historical event - at least not directly. But the truth of the matter isn't so simple as to allow that anyway. Not all questions have yet been answered, the context isn't fully understood (it never is in science), and not everyone agrees even on the basics (Fred Hoyle, the astronomer who went to his grave as the most prominent critic of the Big Bang despite having inadvertently named it, has been dead for less than a decade). A more contextually rich understanding is called for, requiring the story of how the knowledge was obtained, and it's that which this book provides. It's a scientific history book.The narrative opens with examples of human creation myths, and goes on for 500 pages to trace how they were supplanted by scientific observation and interpretation. The story isn't strictly chronological, and at times I didn't know what century I was reading about; the author's strategy is to follow several independent threads (prescient developments in theory, the growth of telescope technology, relevant advances elsewhere in physics, etc) and keep the flow of time in each one without precise regard for overall synchrony. The result is a bit confusing, but it would probably have been even worse to mix events that aren't part of the same story.Simon Singh frequently takes pains to summarize what's just been explained. For example, each chapter (100 pages or so) ends with a two page graphical spread reminding the reader of key points. This makes comprehension easier and helps to distinguish the most important concepts and contributors from the incidental ones. There is, naturally, a good deal of science to wrestle with in this story of science, but it's always well explained, in text as well as images, and I doubt anyone with genuine interest combined with knowledge of high school science will be left behind. But science is only half of the story; the other half is the story of the rivalries and alliances that brought us the knowledge we have.The last chapter, an epilogue, helpfully recounts the major points once more before covering the notions and problems on the fringe of human cosmological understanding. This is always my favorite part of science literature. Concepts include the horizon problem (why, if different parts of the Universe are too far apart to have ever exchanged information, do they look so similar?), inflation (hey, maybe they were once close enough to exchange information but spread apart very quickly), the fine tuning of natural constants (why, when a slightly different universe wouldn't have allowed for the sort of matter we observe, is ours so precisely as it needs to be?), the anthropic argument (hey, maybe there are many universes and we shouldn't be surprised to find ourselves in the one that allows for our existence), the question of the Universe's ultimate fate (Big Crunch, or Big Rip?), and dark matter / dark energy. It leaves one with a healthy grasp of the duality between the solidity with which we have deduced what we do know vs. the wealth of knowledge we haven't yet toiled enough to enjoy.I like Simon Singh's writing. The material covered in Fermat's Enigma would have been miles over my head as described by a less capable author, and I found Big Bang captivating from beginning to end. I think I'll be seeking more of his work in the future."
35,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,4,"I had enjoyed reading Simon Singh's 'Fermat's Enigma' and 'The Code Book' immensely. So, it was no brainer to read this 532-page book on the theories relating to the origin of the Universe.This book is a history of the Big Bang model, providing at the same time an insight into what science is and how the scientific method works. It traces the history of how an idea is created, tested, verified and finally broadly accepted. The book can be summarised as follows:""Initially, all matter and energy was condensed to a point. Then there was the Big Bang. The Big Bang was not an explosion IN Space but an explosion OF Space. Similarly, it was not an explosion IN Time but OF Time. Both Time and Space were created at the moment of the Big Bang.Within a second, the super-hot universe expanded and cooled dramatically, falling from a few trillion to a few billion degrees. The universe contained mainly protons, neutrons and electrons, all bathed in a sea of light.The protons, equivalent to hydrogen nuclei, reacted with other particles in the next few minutes to form light nuclei such as helium. The ratio of hydrogen to helium in the universe was fixed largely within these first few minutes and is consistent with what we see today.The universe continued to expand and cool. It now consisted of simple nuclei, energetic electrons, vast amount of light, with everything scattering off everything else. After roughly 300,000 years, the universe had cooled sufficiently to allow the electrons to slow down, latch on to the nuclei and form fully fledged atoms. This effectively prevented further scattering of light, which ever since has been sailing through the universe largely unhindered. This light is known as the Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB)Radiation, a sort of luminous echo of the Big Bang, which was predicted by Gamow, Alpher and Herman and detected by Penzias and Wilson.Detection of CMB radiation also showed that the universe contained regions of slightly higher-than-average density when it was 300,000 years old. These regions gradually attracted more matter and grew denser so that the first stars and galaxies had formed by the time the universe was roughly a billion years old. The nuclear reactions initiated inside the stars went on to form the medium-weight elements, while the heaviest elements would be created in the intense conditions of the star's violent death throes. It is thanks to the stellar formations of elements such as carbon, oxygen, nirogen, phosphorus and potassium that it was possible ultimately for life to evolve.And here we are, approximately 15 billion years later!""The book is engagingly written in a very easily readable manner, giving the historical perspectives along the way. The author shows how the Catholic church embraced the Big Bang theory for obviously the wrong reasons as opposed to the competing 'Steady State' theory. He also shows how both the theories were unacceptable to the communist states because of their dogmatism. Though the book is 532-page long, it grabs your attention all the way and makes it a fairly easy and enjoyable read.I sure would recommend the book to anyone interested in this complex theory of cosmology presented in a very understandable way."
36,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7607345-lars,4,"Having enjoyed the author's documentary about Fermat's last theorem, I was prepared to enjoy this book. It did not disappoint.Singh's background is in particle physics, which I think comes through particularly well in this book. He has an obvious deep respect for the intellects and achievements of the scientists he profiles, probably stemming in no small part from his sophisticated understanding of the problems they had to solve. Even more spectacularly, he is able to make the scientific method into a sort of character onto itself. He celebrates the slow, messy process of discovery like only a true scientist can. If you let your average Ivy League hack loose on material like this, the result would be a mess. In Singh's hands, it is magical.The book has a great narrative structure, presenting our understanding of the cosmos as a sort of jigsaw puzzle which is gradually revised, filled in and completed by generations of astronomers. Household names like Galileo, Einstein, Lemaître and Hubble are given long treatments, but so are characters that were largely forgotten once the novelty of their discoveries passed. The end result feels fair to all involved, even those who argued in favor of theories that were later proved wrong. I was particularly intrigued with how the geocentric model, which feels so obviously wrong to us today, actually made a lot sense given what the ancients knew about the world, and was initially able to make more correct predictions about planetary motions than the early heliocentric models.Singh does stumble, if infrequently. I understand that in order to make the Big Bang cosmology understandable the reader needs to understand phenomena like Doppler shift and stellar parallax. However, in this book the analogies used to explain these things are sometimes very clumsy and non-intuitive. A sentence would often start with ""Imagine a such and such with a so and so radius sitting in a blah blah blah..."" and by the next line I would be completely lost. There are also some equations and math in the book, all of which I was able to understand easily, but whose inclusion felt unnecessarily pedantic.But these are minor quibbles. Altogether this is a fun read and a great introduction to the topic. Better, I think, than A Brief History of Time, even if the two books differ somewhat in scope. Recommended."
37,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/614940-toby,4,"In ""The Big Bang,"" Simon Singh gives us two histories.One is the history of western astronomical discovery beginning with the Greeks and ending with late-20th century debates about the Big Bang. The second is an illustration of Kuhn's paradigm shifts in action, complete with the assertion that new ideas don't gain traction until the conservative old fogeys die off or retire. It struck me as bizarre that so many brilliant scientists in the 20th century would keep hold of the idea of an ""eternal, unchanging"" universe based on, essentially, a just-so assumption. According to Singh, even Einstein was initially dismissive of the big bang (before it was called such), but as one expects he changed his mind once Hubble's observational evidence started coming in.Singh has written an approachable history of our understanding of the stars, and in it he encapsulates small biographies of the major players, promoting some of them from the dustbin of forgotten science journals (like the guy who changed the film for Hubble's observations).Singh is also constricted by scope. In the story of astronomy, one necessarily enters the realm of nuclear physics. Singh does his best to keep this relationship tangential, but in so doing he raises more questions than he can answer. Where do neutrons come from? Why do different arrangements of nuclear particles yield different atomic masses? How and why do neutrons decay into protons? We have to take his word for it -- the scope just doesn't allow that kind of detail (if this were a Penrose tome, you'd better believe you'd have answers till your head swims!), so Singh just puts it out there and moves on. It's a fair trade, and his bibliography is split out by chapter so you can easily see where you may want to explore next.This book ends with the discovery of CMB radiation (cosmic background microwave radiation, the ""fossil"" of the Big Bang) and in the epilogue hints at the next unknowns, including dark matter and dark energy, the weirdness of the quantum world. There's more to know in this story, but ""The Big Bang"" is a great first act."
38,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3320405-raj,5,"This book is Singh's attempt to explain the Big Bang theory to the layman, along with a general overview of how science works. In that regard, he succeeds in both, but moreso in the second goal than the first. Although Singh's writing is clear and lucid, I think having some background in science and being familiar with concepts in astronomy and cosmology definitely help. Although he keeps the maths to a minimum, there are a few equations in the book (although you don't have to solve them!), so having a little maths helps as well. This is especially true in the early chapters where he describes how the ancient Greeks worked out the circumference of the Earth with nothing more than observation and basic trigonometry (that's one for everybody who said learning about sines and cosines was pointless because it had no bearing on the real world!).From that, Singh then winds the clock forward to the middle ages as he continues the story of cosmology and describes how Copernicus laid the seeds for a heliocentric view of the universe, expanding our view of the universe at every step as astronomy and cosmology show us more and more of the universe we live in, before culminating in the final pieces of the puzzle that cement the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe. Singh is careful to show both the cumulative (""standing on the shoulders of giants"") and paradigm-shifting paths that science can take to move forward and how they can work in concert.As well as the science, Singh also weaves the personalities of the scientists into his story, telling anecdotes and providing biographies, but he never lets this get in the way of the science itself, something which is all too easy to do.Lucid, easy to read and very informational, I really enjoyed this book, telling the story of one of the most important theories in science and through that, explaining the methods of science itself. Highly recommended."
39,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/526331-richard,5,"Simon Singh is the kind of science writer we need. His sense of storyline and his touch for humanity bring a lot of breath to scientific thought and the wonderful reminder that scientists are human, and not just in the ""not God"" way, but as thinking creatures who re-evaluate themselves and adapt and sometimes get a little headstrong.Overall, this book is a story of the scientific process and an idea that's been centuries in the making, and is not even complete yet. While conservative yahoos may think they're being critical in trying their half-assed ways to discredit creditable theories with accurate testing under its belt, Singh shows us how science actually progresses, its flaws and revisions towards testable assertions. This book is not a diatribe but a story, and anyone who thinks that the Big Bang theory ""is just a theory"" would get a lot out of this book to find out that a theory is an idea with a lot of damn good evidence behind it, and an idea that makes accurate predictions of what can be observed. Does it explain everything? No, and Singh takes some time at the end of the book to show what the Big Bang theory has yet to make sense of. But even Copernicus had some flaws to his idea about the solar system being sun-centered rather than Earth-centered, and so this book gives us the strongest reminder of all that the search for scientific truth doesn't rely on faith in just a couple of know-it-alls, but a collective effort of investigators who challenge each other and themselves to find what makes the most sense of the evidence they have and what ultimately predicts new evidence."
40,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1415250-ed-holden,5,"This is possibly the best science book I've ever read. Far from being about the Big Bang specifically, and without asking the reader to take any of the case for this amazing theory for granted, Singh takes his usual knack for explaining complex concepts to the layperson and tunes it up to eleven, effectively building the case for the Big Bang from first principles. We start with Ptolemy and the Greeks, move into the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and so on, and along the way we put together the whole of cosmology and theoretical physics as if from a Lego kit.If there is anything you might have doubted about the Big Bang, it's covered here, and the evidence is pretty thoroughly detailed. Highly recommended.Update 2013: I read an article on rereading. Then, to show I was serious, I read that article again. I realized that (a) it's true that reading a book multiple times is more immersive and lasting than reading it and casting it aside forever, and that (b) I hadn't reread a book in a long time.Big Bang is a great candidate for a book to reread. It's chock full of scientific discovery, yet the discoveries it elucidates are linear and logically connected to a larger goal, making for a great narrative, so I found it worthwhile to remind myself of every link in the chain. In particular I'm glad to have been reminded of the contributions of Tycho Brahe, Johnannes Kepler and Edwin Hubble. My original review still expresses my enthusiasm for this book: this is probably the best book on physics for the layperson I've encountered."
41,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4809506-maurice-ruffin,4,"Cosmology and astrophysics is one of my favorite fields of inquiry. There are few areas of study where humanity has gone from knowing nearly nothing (remember the time we thought the Earth was the center of the universe?) to having insights into things like eternity and infinity. Simon Singh is a popular British scientist. Maybe think of him as the UK's Neil deGrasse Tyson. In the first half of the book, Singh zips through the great discoveries of numerous millennia: the size of the Earth, the distance to the sun, E=MC2. All the highlights. He does this in a delightful breezy fashion, conveying interesting information about the men (there are virtually no women until he hits the Victorian era) who shined light into the darkness and the sacrifices many made to expand our knowledge. Some pay the ultimate price. There are a lot of dead scientists in this book, y'all. Things slow down a little much in the later sections of the book where Singh tries too hard to explain some really complex mathematical equations, and I suspect that this was his response to his publisher asking him to make the book 80 pages longer. He could have left this, out and I wouldn't have been too upset.Still, Singh recovers nicely in the closing section of the book when he delves into the huge battle (who knew?) between 20th century scientists over whether the universe was in a ""Steady State"" or expanding. The latter group were arguing for what we now call the Big Bang. The way Singh tells the stories of these men (and women!) is compelling even though we know the outcome.If you have any interest in the topic, this book is a great place to start."
42,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8778609-jen,5,"Probably the most accessible explanation of the big bang that I have come across. It is still quite long so not the type of book you read in an evening after work but certainly worth a weekend. I started it several times then got distracted by work but am pleased I kept picking it up again. The little bits of background on the key scientists' lives are fascinating too. Who knew Newton was such a piece of work? Well worth reading if you teach high school science or are taking high school science. I will be using some of the analogies in my class room because I know that Simon Singh has some better ones than I do, and I will be pinching some of the background information on the scientists to make them more real for my students. I have never seen a better explanation of general relativity either. It is probably clear enough for most high school students to get the gist.Congratulations and thank you Mr Singh, I have been trying to make the big bang this clear for 18 years and you have shown me how.Of course there is some simplification as this is popular science not a university text book or scientific journal. If you want finer details look elsewhere. If you want to understand the evolution of the big bang theory at high school level (for yourself or to improve your ability to explain it to others), and want to pick up some random facts on the side, this book is perfect."
43,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25721-adarsh,4,"It had been a long time since I read any science book. Big Bang by Simon Singh turned out to be such a refreshing read that I recommend it to anyone who is even mildly interested in science.Simon Singh has the rare advantage of being both a scientist and a journalist. What impressed me most about this book is the simplicity of Singh's approach to explaining complicated concepts and theories. The book has a distinct historical perspective and story-telling narrative to it. You will not find obscure mathematical equations in this book. Notion, not notation.I am also most impressed by the vast amount of background information that the author provides to the reader. There were so many scientific theories and facts that I had studied in high school and then promptly forgotten. All those came rushing back to me when reading this book. Simon Singh goes all the way back to the Greeks, but it is astounding how he manages to keep the chain of logic in tact, without veering too much off-topic.The target audience of this book is the general public. Someone already familiar with the details of the Big Bang theory may not be too impressed with this book. Although a lot of historical perspective is provided, this book does not speak too much about the details of the theory itself. The ending also seems ubrupt.Nevertheless, I strongly recommend reading this book."
44,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/774453-rowland,5,"Simon Singh has become one of my favourite science authors. He takes you on a journey not only of science but of the political landscape at the time of the discoveries, of the governments of the day interference and also the battle of personalities. That is what science is about. Its about people arguing over theories and supporting those theories with conclusive evidence. Eventually one side wins.The Big Bang begins with the conflict of early scientists with the governmental/religious forces arguing over where the earth sits in the heavens. It moves to the recent theories of a Steady State Universe (an unchanging one that has existed for all time) vs the Big Bang Universe that has a definite beginning, that is even now still growing and evolving. There was much rivalry between these two groups of scientists, however the Big Bang won out although there are scientists who still believe in the Steady State Model.Like most revolutionary theories that go counter to our thinking, the Big Bang theory was derided as being wrong. Even Einstein was against it, but after the overwhelming evidence he too accepted that it best represented reality and went on to endorse it.Whether you believe it or not, it does best represent what is seen in the observable universe."
45,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4331887-steve,5,"""Gripping"" probably isn't a word you'd expect to hear used about a book on the historical development of the Big Bang theory - but trust me this book is thoroughly difficult to put down! A truly riveting journey from ancient Greece to the present day, Big Bang charts the great successes - and crushing disappointments - of key figures instrumental to the quest to learn more about the origin of the universe. Singh not only knows his science inside out, he's also a fantastic storyteller, and manages to perfectly capture the thrill of discovery. Well structured, well explained, well illustrated, well summarised (each chapter is summed up in two suprisingly helpful pages of notes) - I struggle to find anything negative to say about this book. It blends science and history seamlessly. From the scientific point of view, you'll learn precisely WHY cosmologists believe the Big Bang theory to be an accurate description of the origin of the universe (and it's not because it's written in a book). From the historical side, you'll appreciate how this theory came to emerge as the ultimate tribute to human curiosity and intellect. One of the most enjoyable books I've read - highly recommended."
46,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7977977-katie-p,5,"I loved this book because it appealed to my science nerdiness and my history nerdiness.You can actually get a decent way through this book without much mention of the Big Bang theory or even the universe as a whole as the early parts are given over to a history of human endeavour towards understanding Earth within the universe. From various creation myths to the methodolgy employed to work out that the world was round, the circumference of the planet, the distance to the moon and sun, how orbits work etc, gradually building a picture of how vast and complex the universe really is. For someone who is already well versed on physics and cosmology this may be slightly tedious but for me, someone with an avid interest in science but little background, I found it first and foremost absolutely fascinating and secondly a rather important foundation onto which I could build my understanding of modern origin of the universe theories.The book explained everything very well, not too over simplified but breaking down theories to be easy enough to understand with a little effort. In particular the diagrams were really very helpful representations."
47,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39086-justin-gerhardstein,4,"If you want to understand how the universe came into existence (is there anyone who doesn't?), read this book. Singh contextualizes the Big Bang model from the very beginning of astronomy, around 6th Century BC, and then takes us on a tour of the key discoveries, such as Einstein's special theory of relativity, that formed the basis of cosmological knowledge needed to hypothesize, and eventually solidify, the big bang model. It's a large dose of stranger-than-life non-fiction, including crazy scientists, fluke discoveries, World Wars, Ether, dying stars and of course the open minded Catholic Church. For a ""science book"", it's addicting...I mean, how can you not want to see what happens in the end of the book? It's essentially the answer to the question of existence!""If the history of the universe were represented as a timeline running between the fingertips of two outstretched arms, then a nail file could extinguish human existence within a single scrape."" -Singh""My suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we CAN suppose""-Haldane 1937 "

At first I thought i won't be able to finish it and it will be very boring but it turn out to be that I learned a lot from it. I wished I read this book whenI was in high school so I could understand more about what the teacher was saying when talking about Big Bang and evolution but I wasn't too late to read this book. I liked the way Singh wrote it and the summaries at the end of each chapter and the glossary that I'm going to use if I need to understand any words. I honestly believe that god created the universe and I will never believe in the big bang, steady state , cosmologists or any similar believe.The book was a bit shocking for me because I didn't know that much about it and I didn't know that the ''big bang'' was like that a very complex process that made many contradictions and took that long. I loved some of the stuff that informed me more about astronomy and physics even though my major isn't related that much it . But I finally understood the roots of a lot of stuff. Again thank you to Singh for this book and I'm hoping to read his other books."
49,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20528901-tiberiu,3,"This book does a good job presenting the evolution of cosmology, from ancient geocentric theories, to the most recent CMB radiation detection experiments. The author seems to be well documented not only about the historical discoveries in this field, but also about the personal lives of the famous people who contributed to the knowledge we have today about the Universe, its origins and its future.Some stuff is obsessively repeated, so there are moments when this book gets a little bit boring and superfluous. But in the end the reader has quite a detailed image of the history of the Universe.The book seems to be hurried towards the end. For example, the COBE experiment is explained in detail, but the much more accurate WMAP experiment gets barely more space than a footnote. The inflation theory could have also benefited more space, especially since it fills in a big hole in the Big Bang theory. This is a book about Big Bang, but I wish there was more about the Standard Model and quantum mechanics in it - they're quite related.Otherwise, a good, entertaining book that serves as a nice introduction to cosmology."
50,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52346722-dr-j-g,4,"Simon Singh tackles a subject all encompassing in human enquiry in this, touching everything from earth and solar system to relativity to origin of the universe and a few other huge topics besides, in a very very thrilling write up that is easy to read and makes it easy to comprehend for a non professional reader of the subjects such as physics and astronomy. Indeed, but for a couple or so pages at the beginning and similar at the end in the epilogue, where he touches on philosophical and such angles, this is one of the most intriguing, thrilling, satisfying and wonderful books to read. One of the aspects of life and community of scientists is the surprising evidence that it is not always as scientific as one might expect, and even apart from the non rational aspect of the discoveries there is the very surprising but only human aspects of scientists who do the work being ignored or sidelined and forgotten with time until someone else rediscovers and gets the credit - and the prizes too. Attempts to correct the injustice happen, but again surprisingly, on less than the prize level. "
51,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"This is my father's favourite book, I think. It is a wonderful read. Clear and fast paced, it explains such things as how we worked out how big the universe is, how we can tell how far away stars are, how we know the universe is getting bigger and many other questions you may never have wondered about at all like what is dark matter and how do we know it must be there. Many of these questions have been answered by people who in themselves would make for wonderful books - the history of physics is populated by very strange people. Some of them even have gold noses!We humans should be incredibly proud of what we have learned about the universe. Given how small we are, how thick we can sometimes be and how huge the universe is, the fact we know anything about it at all is cause for wonder. That so few people know that we do know such a lot about the universe is cause for some shame. This is a fascinating book about the fascinating universe we find ourselves in. It is well worth reading so as to know more about it."

Big Bang, written with a nod to Carl Sagan, tells the story of the origin of the universe. It's not a new story, but one well told through philosophers and scientists who, over 2,000 years, discarded, accepted, or built on each other's theories. In essence, Big Bang reveals how science works. Critics agree that Singh's conversational style elucidates complex concepts without dumbing them down__in fact, even with his many pictures, diagrams, and summaries, readers would benefit from a scientific background. Yet only a few complained about Singh's fast pace. If the first hundred pages dragged a bit, or if Singh's mad scientists took on auras of TV personalities, never mind__you'll be hard pressed to find a better book about your earthly origins.Copyright 2005 Phillips & Nelson Media, Inc.This is an excerpt from a review published in Bookmarks magazine."
53,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6963539-ala,4,"This was a pretty decent pop-sci exploration of cosmology. Having a PhD in cosmology myself, I think I am qualified to say that the science was done pretty well. And the descriptions of the history of the science was also interesting. I was a little bored in parts, but maybe that's because I already knew most of it. Pop sci books are hit or miss for me and sometimes I can't get through even the well-received ones (for instance, Brian Green's books). This one I pushed through (though partly because a friend kept bugging me about it). I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn some basic cosmology and how the field has developed. However, I felt it stopped a little short - with hardly any mention of dark energy and dark matter or modern puzzles in cosmology. And that's a shame. According to our current cosmological understanding only 3% of the universe is relatively understood -- atoms, molecules,etc. The other 97% is some exotic stuff currently unexplained by known physics! What can be more fascinating than that!?"
54,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17018778-adam-sawyer,4,"A solid overview of the current state of knowledge in cosmology. As with any field of science, Singh makes it clear that it's not so much what we know that is important, but how we know what we know. Most of the book looks at the various techniques that have been used over the last 2500 years to explore our universe, and how the flaws and foibles of those techniques have gradually been chipped away at to give us a more accurate picture of how it all began. There's an interesting assortment of characters responsible for these advancements, particularly Fred Hoyle, who seems to bounce back and forth between being a genius and a rather stubborn curmudgeon. As with any popular science book it's a bit light on the mathematics, but doesn't shy away from tackling intimidating topics like general relativity or stellar evolution. I'd highly recommend this as a starting point to learn about cosmology, but if you are a mega-nerd there's just no way to truly understand the big bang without an unhealthy dose of calculus."
55,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57606968-adam-fenn,4,"It may come as a surprise, but there is a surprisingly minimal amount of coverage on the Big Bang in this. Not even so much as a cameo from Leonard. I'm kidding, fuck that show.This is a coming-of-age tale about astronomy (not astrology, you psychos) from its exciting birth to ho-hum adulthood in present day. It really is remarkable that some dudes with only sticks and dirt were able to come within ~4000km of our planet's size and didn't just draw dicks all day. Maybe that's why I'm not an astronomer. This book is most interesting when detailing early astronomers trying to educate, learn, and collaborate with eachother and the world. Aside from no modern form of communication like ICQ, the church was straight gangster and would burn people alive for sharing discoveries like the sun being at the center of the solar system. Naturally, that type of rebuttal did not invite open discussions or theorizing. To be fair, I've been heavy into recent astronomy for the past decade so once it to modern times it was less exciting, but still good."
56,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2718601-lu-wang,5,"Few popular science books are so educational and entertaining at the same time. Simon Singh is a great story teller. The physicists and cosmologists in this book don't come across as a bunch of abstract ""great minds"", they are depicted as humans - eccentric and in some cases borderline psycho - but still humans. Few people can keep a straight face while reading Singh's portrait of Tycho Brahe. Yet Singh's ability to sort out a single thread of development that leads to the acceptance of the Big Bang Theory, from the highly convoluted, multi-dimensional context of development of physics in general, made this book a tremendously informative read. Singh only mentioned a handful of key figures in the particularly complicated turf war between the Static Universe and the Big Bang camps, but the storyline is linear and cohesive. It almost gives you the illusion that you've understood everything there is to know about the Big Bang theory."

Didn't read the whole thing twice, of course, but I was how badly I did not want the story to be over.It's amazing to me, how many times in human history, we've all been so sure of the ""truth"" of our existence, we built models to describe what was going on, only to see them replaced years later from the real, sometimes vastly more simple, truth. Ptolemy's convoluted system of planetary ""deferents"" and ""epicycles"" did accurately describe and predict the planets' motions in an Earth-centered universe. The reality is that the planets, including Earth, revolve in simple oblong orbits around the sun. Singh's engaging, ""science for dummies"" explanations of things like nuclear physics and Cosmic Microwave Background radiation set my mind ablaze with curiosity about what we might (will?) discover next..."

This is my non-fiction book for this quarter.This book discusses the scientific theories about the big bang and how the universe was created. there were charts and graphs on some pages to explain things. The author gets you caught into this book on the first page. The big bang was an accidental crash between two powerful sebetomic particles. This created an explosion so big that it was able to chemicaly react with other particles and it eventualy created the universe. This made me ask many questians like: Did that explosion destroy any previous life? What are the chances that this would happen? All these questians brought me closer to the book. This gave me more knowledge on astrology and physics and got me very interested on those sciences. The auther of this book is a grduate from Cambridge and has wrote many other books and theories. I hope to read more of his books and improve my knowledge on science.

And when one has to get into the history of Science, it might become torturous.But Simon Singh is an amazing story teller and I am extremely happy that he is a rare combination of being a scientist too. When one reads this book, one marvels on the effort that Simon has put into to create some amazing threads and sequences which make the story of one of the greatest discoveries till date nothing less than a thriller.The Heroes in this thriller are many and so are the villains. But the winner ultimately is Science. I really love the way he ends the book by pointing out the fact that probably the greatest discovery till date, the Big Bang Theory, might not be an actual fact and could be replaced by something else in future which is even more beautiful and brilliant."

The writing style is fast-paced and interesting, and not so dense that you’ll be falling asleep while hearing about every minute detail of every person he talks about. Singh seems to have the ability to give just enough information on the subjects and people in this book to give you what you need to know, but without over-explaining it and making it boring. At the same time, though, it is quite informative!This book is a great synopsis of the history of the development of The Big Bang Theory, and I would highly recommend that you pick it up if you’re curious about how history’s, and most of today’s scientists came to the conclusion of something that may, at first glance, seem preposterous."

He renders the most abstruse concepts into an intelligble form through clear writing, illuminating analogies and useful diagrams. He mixes the science with the human - theories with anecdotes form the live of the scientists. This he gives insight into science itself. Brilliant."

I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was a story of how we have developed our current view of the universe and its workings. It was really great to get some perspective after reading a lot of nonfiction books about the subject as we currently see it. Names that been alluded to in those books became clear and in context. The conversational tone of the book took you on a journey with the author.

Maybe the topic is necessarily more complex compared to something like evolution of species."
70,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8691468-diane-henry,5,This was truly thrilling. Singh is a patient & gifted explainer and this book reads like a novel. He simplifies ridiculously complex topics so that the lay reader can grasp the meaning and implications and excitement that accompanied each discovery. The only downside is that this book was published in 2004 and surely there is more to be learned about the earliest moments of space and time. I hope there is another book on this topic as accessibly written as The Big Bang was. 
71,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16752360-mujtaba-mj,5,"Amazing book with on of the best books i ever read,I recommend it for every one,no need to be since lover it enough to have big imagination. This is the first time to read a scientific book that don't contain any equation at all just the biography of the scientists and their discovers in a amazing simple way. P.S: please before u read prepare you coffee mug and something to eat because you wont nothing will stop you. "
72,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11437893-oliver-sampson,4,"Simon Singh is an excellent writer and popularizer of science and science history. He goes to great length to explain some of the more abstract concepts in an accessible manner, with success. Some of the analogies fall a little flat, or seem a little too simplified or cutesy, but the book is still very readable and enjoyable. Cutesy but cool are the handwritten notes at the end of each chapter as topic summaries. This book is well worth the read!"
73,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/570782-marissa,5,"ok...i'll admit i didn't get through this book in one go (i got half way through,read some light fiction, read the second half) nor did i understand 100% of the crazy math stuff. but it really have a me a greater understanding of the theories and scientists throughout time that contributed to our current (and ever changing) understanding of the universe. this book blew my mind!!!!"
74,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1906139-rob,5,"Very, very interesting. ""Big Bang"" gives a history of our understanding of the universe that goes back to the ancient Greeks. He guides you through the evolution of ideas (from the earth centered universe all the way to current model) and explains those ideas in a way that the average reader can understand. A great read for anyone interested in astronomy, physics, or simply the cosmos. "
75,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2000341-mary-s,5,"As is usual with Singh, a very, very readable and enjoyable science book. History, anecdotes, some math (can be skipped, but don't -- people who say ""I can't understand math"" will surprise themselves with this), lots of illuminating diagrams, elegant problem solving, and lots of science and personality make this one of my top science reads."
76,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1432297-chris,5,This book gives an excellent overview of cosmology starting with the ancient Greeks and working all the way up to turn of the 20th century physics. He explains the science incredibly well without getting bogged down in details. He also discusses the impacts of the sciences on society in a very clear and engaging way. Definitely an excellent book.
77,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2055930-jane,5,"This book opened my eyes to the beauty of our universe. Singh set forth a wonderful history of the cosmos as well as a strong and fair account of the ""big bang"" controversy.

The ""Big Bang"" theory fits the available evidence and Simon Singh takes us through the logic process, carefully explaining each concept in a readable and approachable manner."
81,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/208464-lucas,4,It's a great book once you get pas the first 1/3 of the book. The beginning chapters are dry and extremely dense for non-scientists. Push through and it becomes a well-written primer on the mysterious world of the cosmos. I would recommend it wholeheartedly with caution based on the first part of the text.
82,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6092849-david-l,5,"OK, this is the best non fiction book regarding how science has studied our cosmos. I loved this book. I learned so much. If my teachers had taught me the way this book reads I would have learned and kept way more than I did. Easy to read, simply explained the concepts and was not technical. This is one of the few books I will not give away or part with. "
83,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1074042-amanda,4,"An excellent, excellent book that explains the Big Bang in a very approachable and fun way.

I'd definitely recommend this for anyone interested at all in the origins of our universe, or armchair physicists."
84,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5996748-alison,5,"Although the book starts with the science history you've read so many times (geocentric, heliocentric, Galileo etc), Singh goes into much more depth and gives background on how the theory was developed and received. I appreciated his periodic use of tables to demonstrate how well supported the origin theories were at a particular time in history. Well written and very detailed. "

It is very lucid and free flowing. But I would strongly recommend it to first timers. Those who have read Carl Sagan, Brian Greene or Stephen Hawking will find it a repetition of what they have read. I will still recommend it to them. Overall a great book."

156,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15785230-paulo-glez-ogando,5,"I like popular science, namely mathematics. And I love Simon Singh, he is undoubtely my favourite science writer. Although this is not strictly a book on mathematics, I found it very appealing mainly by its author. And it has not disappointed me, I've enjoyed the reading very much.This book is a history of the Big Bang model, but it is also an insight into what science is and how it works. This is a very good example of the scientific method, how a scientific idea is created, tested, verified and, finally, accepted. Every scientific theory must be testable and compatible with reality, however, as Fred Hoyle said, «theories are never proved right, the best they can do is to survive». I really liked this quote.As he usually does in his books, Simon Singh expalins the Big Bang model in terms that will make sense to non-specialists, without having to water down the key concepts within the theory. He reaches a perfect balance between technical depth and the description and explanation of the key ideas. You do not need great scientific knowledge to enjoy this book, but at the same time you will achieve a fairly clear understanding about the topics discussed. The Big Bang model of the universe is arguably the most important and glorious scientific achievement of the twentieth century. The question of who invented this model is virtually imposible, for it required a number of theoretical, experimental and observational stages, and each one has its own heroes. So here is his story from the beginning several centuries ago. The book starts long before the Big Bang theory was proposed, and Singh reviews the war of Sun-centered universe vs Earth-centered universe, speed of light and Einstein's relativity, whether the Milky Way contains the entire universe or not or the foundations of atomic physics, among other topics of great interest. Of course, every one of them has its importance in the final battle between Steady Staters and Big Bangers. with the apparent triumph of the latter."
157,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98375107-h,1,"SHALLOWIt seems that he has a pack-everything-interesting-I know (as a person, not just as a cosmologist) attitude in his books. It's so extreme that this book has an addendum where he talks about crab evolution (apparently Japanse fishermen have a superstition against eating crabs with samurai images so japanese crabs have samurai images... ??? ""I tried to somehow add this to the book but I couldn't"") and some code puzzle he thought was interesting. I read this hoping to get an amateur's understanding of the Big Bang and was sorely disappointed. I got nothing out of this book--it's like the 500 pages were ultra-whipped and 90% air. He gets into detail about this really stupid thing they did where they added a scientist who didn't contribute to a paper so that the authors are listed as ""alpha, betta, gema"", and how this created a feud. I really don't care about that. It is clear that his only goal is to make a history of the Big Bang that's as comprehensive as possible.If you aren't feeling it after reading a hundred pages, don't expect that he's ever going to talk about the Big Bang and that it's a neccessary exposition, it isn't, just stop reading it.Ok, to be fair, I did learn some things about the big bang, but not in the way I expected. The facts are quite superficial and deep-physics and not things that cause philosophical introspection and allow you to try to form your own hypotheses. Basically some people thought the universe was static and always was and is all there ever will be for no reason at all, people saw stars moving away and used this observatino to disprove it. [technical details include red-shift, types of galaxies... etcetera] Look up ""what is the big bang"", find an article written by an author who doesn't seem wishy-washy and almost delusional in their inability for succinctness, and you won't miss anything, even if it isn't what you expected."
158,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13245519-meha-jadhav,5,"This book chronicles the history of cosmology and astronomy, culminating in the big bang as being the accepted theory for the formation of universe. The book starts out with the ancient Greeks and their attempts at measuring the size of the Earth and its distance from the sun and the moon. The author then goes on to describe briefly about the earth centered model, the development of telescope, Newtonian gravity, relativity and, the debate over steady state and the big bang model. One would think that a book on such a heavy topic would be a tough read. But I really enjoyed reading the whole book. It reads like a thrilling tale; I was hooked to it from the very first page and found it hard to put down. The protagonists of the story are the many scientist involved with plenty of interesting and sometimes funny anecdotes to delight the reader. The underlying science is made easier with lots of figures and cartoons. While comparing different theories, the author puts them out in tables- making the merits and demerits of both theories very clear. He also does recaps periodically to keep the reader abreast of the story. I also thought that he made a good work of explaining the theories themselves. He simplifies the science without dumbing it down and uses appropriate analogies. Through this book, the author highlights many aspects of science that lay people may not be aware of: that scientists are people with their own bias and prejudice, that good science requires a combination of theory and experiments and that science is a lot of hard work and little bit of serendipity.I had a great time reading this book and I’m sure anyone else who tries it will too. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in understanding a great achievement of humanity."

Neither can I say that I knew everything in it as in the details, but I still think that I did not learn much new by reading it. I suppose I have an above average interest in physics (on a popular level) and that I have read some books about this before. This is certainly one of the better introductions and I think Singh covers many interesting areas. He also explains Einstein well I think (even though I am not one to judge that perhaps). But since this review is strictly subjective (and since reviews are not constant relative to every observer) I think that I expected more our of this book. I will take Manny's advice and read Helge Kragh next instead."
160,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51279817-sanat-vats,4,This book is cosmically articulated and provided the full story of known universe. Simon Singh easily explained the law physics without getting into technical physics. He bring lots of unknown figure and there research that was instrumental in forming the knowledge of universe. This book is not only on the theory of universe but also bring the context under which Discovery had been made. Great debate on Galaxy and then steady state vs big bang will make you think beyond your imagination or possibly inspire you to change your field. Lots of example are there where people from different walk of life made scientific contribution to the knowledge of what we know today. In the end his each chapter ends with the summary which is kind of crash course for the book.

He has kept to his unique style he wrote ""Fermat's Enigma"" in. Explaining the various steps which lead to the main concept. I have been a big fan and a believer of The Bing Bang Theory ever since I read Hawking's A Brief History of Time. Of course Carl Sagan, Neil deGrasse Tyson fueled my interests in my earlier years. And I remember having enjoyed some articles by Prof. Jayant Narlikar when I was a student. I think they appeared in the magazine ""Science Today"". I have a question though arising from the description of the universe - where exactly is the center of the universe at its current size? And how far are we from that center?"

While reading I was surprised how,even in the scientific community ,conservatism prevails.Read it if you want to understand ‘how’ our universe came to be this way ( not 'why'.Religions are supposed to do that but they have done more damage than good ).The language was lucid and he has added lot of diagrams to make things easy for us. A ' big bang' read for sure."

Singh manages to give high-level overview of tough concepts in a clear and discernible manner -- in fact, I'm pretty confident a middle school student who has taken basic trigonometry could easily understand everything Singh writes in his first chapter! The book isn't completely cut and dry though; Singh infuses the story with humorous anecdotes about the physicists behind the Big Bang, making for a very compelling narrative."

Although the ultimate goal is to explain how scientists discovered the ""Big Bang,"" it is a compendium of almost the entire history of,physics, from Copernicus to Newton to Einstein. But it also delves into lesser known personalities like Henrietta Leavitt, who discovered how to measure cosmic distances and Penzies and Wilson, who accidentally confirmed the Big Bang while working for Bell Labs. The work is not too technical and so is readable by pretty much anyone. "

As well as the science, there is enough on the scientists featured to make them seem like more than just random names on a page but not so much that it turned into a collection of autobiographies - a hole a lot of science books covering such a wide time period fall into. Also, even though this book took me about a month to finish (I was reading over books at the time), there are enough reminders of things that if you forget things, it isn't such an issue. "

This is a terrific read to quench one's curiosity about the world we live in and where it came from. This book deals with theories about the structure, age and the creation of the universe. Simon Singh has done a good job in narrating the chronological events that have shaped our perception of the creation and the existence of the universe. The book is quite a long read but the author kept me hooked in most sections. "

After reading this book, I understood the origin of all matter, everything in the periodic table descending in order from hydrogen onwards, and everything more complex that hydrogen and helium the result of exploding stars. I had never grasped these fundamental ideas when in school. This book has helped inform my understanding of physical reality in a profound and lasting way. I think of what I learned from it often."
168,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27507999-ashish,5,"A history of how the Big Bang theory developed over the millennia. A nice mix of history and science. All told in an engaging and accessible manner. It is book aimed at beginners. If you have already read up a lot on cosmology, you will find many parts of the book that have little new to offer. This was the case for me - I knew most of the science bits. Nevertheless I enjoyed the historical bits which I wasn't fully aware of and the anecdotes which were almost always very good. The development of cosmology over time has been laid out very well and reads like a well told story. "
169,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69913957-sydney,5,"I read this in my junior year of high school for my Astrobiology class. And it was my favorite book! Although the questions I was told to complete about the book made it less interesting, the book itself was very fun and impressive! The style of writing and diagrams including the bits of humor made it very fun and educational. I found myself talking a lot about the theories outside of my classroom!"
170,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31656053-victor-davis,5,"This is right up there with my all-time favorite science book, Music of the Spheres. I wish I had read it sooner. I was only going to give it four stars because, honestly, I was a little let down to find out it was a generic run-down of the history of cosmology, from Ptolemy to COBE. I've read all about these stories many times and was hoping to read a more technical book on more recent discoveries. Alas, such a mixup was my own fault and should not count against Mr. Singh, who amazes once again with his extraordinarily clear prose and explanatory power. For anybody curious about what the (terribly named) Big Bang actually is, and how we know what we know about it, this is an excellent primer. Like many science writers, Singh does a good job, perhaps the best job of any, of pausing along the way to highlight the subtle importance of different aspects of a scientist's discovery, and how it epitomizes the scientific process and why it works so well."
171,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63650869-mishal,5,"""Big Bang: Origins Of The Universe,"" by Simon Singh, compels you to think about the unknown and forces you to ponder over the mind-boggling statistics. The book mainly focuses on the origins of the universe it displays the timeline by not only using analogies but he uses his 500 pages to showcase the depth of knowledge required to comprehend this subject. Simon Singh excellently breaks down the timeline and data/statistics shown in this book. One thing Simon Singh does really well is he uses extremely strange (but relevant) analogies. For example, on page 492, Simon Singh compares the number of grains produced every year (9,000,000,000,000,000,000) to the number of stars in our neighbouring galaxy Andromeda (16,472,392,479,370,382,374,370,568,489). These analogies, although definitely strange, these analogies are extremely helpful to process. While Simon Singh uses strange methods to teach, he uses a wide variety of quotes and famous diagrams to build off thoughts from great mathematicians, physicists, astronomers, and overall great scientists like Albert Einstein, Carl Sagan, Neil deGrasse Tyson and many more. Overall this book will appeal to everyone who loves: trivia, science, math, history, or just knowledge. As long as you are okay with long books and big words. But I guarantee everybody will love this book!"
172,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28361075-rhea,4,"Another excellent book to add to any collection of books about science and/or history. I love Simon Singh’s books mainly because they tell the (largely) complete history of anything he writes about, and Big Bang is no different. If you ever wondered about the history of astronomy, this book is a great place to start. I also enjoyed the emphasis on how scientific theories are created, proven, or destroyed, since it is a process that is not discussed often enough. "
173,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14442764-metodi-pachev,5,"Now that's a good popular science book. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It explains meticulously the development of the scientific idea of the Big Bang starting with ancient times and the universe models that were trendy (and wrong) then. This is why the idea of the Big Bang if only introduced in the second half of the book (around page 250). Despite being longish, it is very good at keeping your attention."

201,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9945170-georg,4,"I wrangled with myself if I should give this book 5 or 4 stars, but in the end it fulfills my main criteria for 5 stars: it not only fascinated me, but it motivated me, it changed something for me. The book reads like a thriller, it is at many points a true page turner and it made me devour it much faster than I hoped. So looking through it even now, just after finishing it, I see that I already forgot many details. But that is ok, this is not a textbook, it is partially made for entertainment.Singh conveys the full meaning of the Big Bang theory and its experimental confirmation: it is the answer to a question humankind hat for over 2000 years. It is one of the biggest achievements we reached and it is not a straight story, it is full of struggles, mistakes, set-backs. It is the collaborative achievement of many scientists who worked in many different fields, different times and with different intentions. And although it still bears a large number of mysteries (what was before? what's dark matter/energy? was there truly an inflation?), it is in itself complete, a clear answer that leaves no doubt.The book doesn't ask too much background knowledge from the reader, it guides friendly through the intricacies of science and mathematics and gives and excellent overview. For example, in the chapter about Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity only the basics of time dilation are explained in a brief but satisfying way - the reader then knows how mind-boggling the new theory is and therefore the other details, e.g. length contraction etc, are only mentioned but not further detailed.The focus is on the people who did the work, who were enthusiastic about their science, who fought, believed, doubted and were brave enough to think and experiment. There are so many names on the way, so many details to learn and it is a truly amazing and breathtaking journey. Yes, there are some exaggerations. Some details are most likely over-emphasized, but this is more in the eye of the beholder. And yes, sometimes it becomes painfully clear that Singh takes a great liking to the UK (his home country) and it seems that he mentions scientists from his home country more than from other countries (e.g. the whole story around Hoyle takes too much emphasize, but for dramatic reasons it was good to have it in). But those are minor points that didn't diminish the fun and awe I felt when reading the book. There are really great pictures and figures, which all come with explanatory text, so they can be looked at and understood by themselves. There is a great glossary, a very useful index and also a well-commented ""further reading"" list. Half way through the book I went and looked for more material on the Theory of Relativity from other sources. I totally got hooked and now try to learn more details about it, the mathematics, the different thought experiments, the influence it had. The book pushed my passion, it made me not only curious but also made me look further into the things it mentions. It activated me and that is a wonderful thing. "
202,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869795-steve-mitchell,5,"Simon Singh’s book covers the story of the search for the origins of the universe starting with the ancient Greeks trying to form an understanding of natural – rather than supernatural – phenomena. Taking the paradigm shift from a geocentric to a heliocentric understanding of the solar system, the understanding that the Milky Way represented the mass of stars that forms our galaxy and that the Milky Way is just one galaxy among millions of other galaxies that make up the observable universe.Taking a chance that Stephen Hawking shied away from in A Brief History of Time by including the formulae that describe how the universe works; Singh’s book is never too complicated when explaining new concepts nor is it condescending when covering familiar ground and is an example of infectious enthusiasm. This is one of the best science books that I have ever read that covers what is – arguably – the greatest scientific discovery of the twentieth century, if not of all time."
203,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5899519-jos,5,"Prior to picking up this book, I'd read Singh's Code Book (a comprehensive history of cryptography). What I love about Singh's style is that he doesn't limit himself to addressing the book's primary subject. His protagonists are three-dimensional characters in a fascinating story that began with the Greeks and continues today. Singh achieves the goal he sets, which is to weave into this story the much more important subtext of the interplay of established theory with new models and observations. He doesn't shy away from plunging the reader into the math and science required to comprehend the topic, but a PhD in astrophysics is not necessary. The layout of the book is thematic, which works so much better than the chronological approach he might have taken instead. My only disappointment is that my paperback didn't have nice, glossy pictures and illustrations of the key astronomical observations that underpin this phenomenal story."
204,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221534-brie,4,"This is a great historical look at how the Big Bang theory started. Singh does a great job at relating historical events in an interesting way, and also adding some science into the mix that is understandable. The book starts with the earliest creation myths, and takes us on a historical journey through cosmology with people such as Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, and Einstein. He also spends a great deal of time on more direct contributors to the Big Bang theory such as Lemaitre, Gamow, Alpher, amd Penzias.The books strongest point is when Singh is discussing the emerging Big Bang theory against the rival Steady State theory. The epilogue is also quite informative, giving examples of what is currently going on in cosmology, and the hurdles still remaining for the Big Bang theory. Overall, a really good read. "
205,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2917060-d-j-webber,5,"I loved this book. It was the first one I've actually finished in a while. I am a regular reader of NewScientist and have read a lot of popular science books about the cosmos but I think I learnt more from this than any other. This could be because the science is interspersed with history, which gives context to the facts. I liked the detail about how the Big Bang model slowly but surely beat off its rivals over the course of many years, although I found myself rooting for Fred Hoyle's steady state model.I was also fascinated by how recently the supremacy of the Big Bang model was ""settled"". I put the word ""settled"" in quotes because I did not find the supporting evidence (collected in the 90s) that convincing - but according to the physics community, it is settled."
206,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4724690-bob-reed,5,"This book is absolutely amazing. The authors does an incredible job of explaining the basic, scientific discoveries that underly the evidence for the Big Bang theory of the beginning of the universe. Three things are amazing: First, he has a remarkable ability to identify each of the essential steps that it took to develop the Big Bang theory. Second, he is able to describe how each of the discoveries were made in a way that can be understood by a scientific layman (unlike, for example, Stephen Hawking's A Brief Theory of Time). Finally, he has the storyteller's gift. He weaves in plenty of personal stories and background gossip to make it a great read. I have never read a better science book. I definitely want to read more from this guy!"
207,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10553508-badri,4,"This is an excellent historical narrative of the development of the Big Bang theory; one gets an overview of the science, but also of the process and personalities involved. I have read quite a few popular books on Cosmology, but this one is probably the best so far in terms of reading pleasure. Despite being nearly 500 pages long, it kept my interest throughout.This is no way a comprehensive or an in depth work though. Any book on Big Bang that mentions inflation and quantum mechanics in the Epilogue, and doesn't mention String theory at all, can't be. But for someone new to the subject, this should be an ideal first book. Even for me, who was familiar with much of the subject matter beforehand, this was worth every minute. "
208,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5969767-tony,4,"An excellent description of the scientific process as it applies to the Big Bang. It is short on mathematics and hard science but it is an extremely well-written and readable history, Singh does an nice job of explaining who the major characters were and a bit about what drove them to play the part they did. Each chapter's opening page contains a series of quotes that are excellent. My favorite is one from Isaac Asimov who said ""The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' (I have found it) but 'That's funny...'"" Highly recommended especially to counter the anti-science crowd - ""I am not a scientist but [insert anti-scientific position here}""."

His captivating style and unique wit offer a truly human account of one of the greatest scientific advancements in history: the Big Bang Theory.A book I will reread many times, it has inspired me to continually think of the world beyond our own narrow view, the universe as a whole. An incredibly powerful story, it is one that lives on with every generation, an unfinished portrait of our understanding of the space and time around us. A must read for any inquisitive person striving to know more about the ultimate question: Where did it all come from?"

I am intrigued with the way Simon Singh articulates the introduction of some of the major break throughs in the astronomy. I must admit that the way Simon Singh's presentation of Einstien's versus Newton's gravity theory was biased toward Einstien's from the begining. He may be on his way to prepare the readers for the Big Bang. But he leaves the readers like me, thinking - why is Einstien's theory so great compared to Newton's when Newton's can explain every thing that we see feel in day to day life from apple from the tree to rocket launches."

Understandable with a minimum of math is even better, and Singh pulled this off quite well. More than an explanation of the Big Bang theory, the book is more a biography of the theory, of the history of science, for that matter. It begins with the Earth-centric model of the universe and changes as science evolves from superstition through the present day. I would give it 4.5 stars if possible, as I try to be tighter with high ratings, but was pleased enough with the book and the occupation of my time with it to give it that fifth star."
212,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2718349-violetta,4,"The theory of the sudden existence of the universe as we (think) we know it. Beautiful. Singh combines a quasi-scholarly air with the accessibility of pop-science in his writing. Though he relies on metaphor in many places to get the point across, it is never to the detriment of the explanation of the scientific theory. Basically, he has his priorities straight!I'd recommend it for any curious minded person, who wouldn't mind stepping ""onto the shoulders of giants"", as it were, to gaze around in wonder at this improbable existence of ours that gets dismissed all too quickly these days. "
213,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,4,"A very accessible and well-written account of the history of the Big Bang scientific theory. I have no significant negatives to say about the book. If nit-picking I would say that in a few places I thought the wording was misleadingly imprecise. I was also a little surprised that Isaac Newton was not given more credit - perhaps the author felt that Newton had been covered so well and so many times elsewhere that it was not necessary, but it almost read as though his part in the history of cosmology was being underplayed. For example, he's not mentioned in the context of inventing the reflecting telescope. Anyway, ignore that and read the book."
214,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4348781-bouchra-rebiai,5,"The awesomeness of this book lies in the fact that it explores the Big Bang model of the universe from it's very beginnings, starting with models of the Solar System, and then onto the discoveries that verified the Big Bang model, such as the discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).There is quite a bit of scientific jargon in the book, however, it is all explained quite easily, so when a new term or idea is introduced, it usually is followed by a simple explanation. I'm no cosmologist, and my exposure to physics is only at the high school level, but I did find it quite easy to understand."
215,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33364388-brianna-navarre,3,"I bought this book on a whim. Not really expecting to comprehend much as most books on this subject utilize mathematics that, to be honest, go a bit over my head. Thus as I read through, I was pleasantly surprised by the minimal use of math to make points. Each and every subject covered in the book seemed to be described in such a way that was not too confusing but also not over simplified. Singh presents a thorough view on not only the Big Bang but the ideas and discoveries that led to it-from astronomy to relativity. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in a bit of scientific history and our universe's origin."
216,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38062308-mohita,4,"I find Simon Singh's writing on popular science topics very engaging. He puts together an account of how human understanding about the universe evolved, while throwing in interesting historical anecdotes and stories, and thus making the book an overall riveting read. From the ventures of ancient Greeks to comprehending the Milky Way and Bing Bang, Singh has a forte of putting things in a lucid way. The book doesn't go very deep into the mathematics or equations involved, and also summarizes the major facts at the end of each chapter, so even non science background audience will be able to enjoy."
217,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30147744-richard,5,"Simon Singh presents an overview on one of the most important theories in modern cosmology of all time - the Big Bang. Starting at the very beginning of Man's attempts to understand the Universe and our place in it, Singh takes us on a journey that starts with ancient Greece, through the middle ages and the enlightenment, up to the 20th century of Einstein, Hubble et al and finishes at where we are in the 21st century.Anyone who is curious to know more about a subject everyone thinks they know about (but few really do) will find this a fascinating and accessible book on modern ideas of modern cosmology and how we have come to these conclusions. "
218,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/159278-teresa,3,"I actually enjoyed this book more from a broader historical perspective than a scientific one, mainly because I found several factual errors in the book. For example, the author describes an oft-cited debate between rival scientists, emphasizing its significance by referring to Einstein's presence. However, other sources specifically refute Einstein's attendence at the conference, noting his first trip to America was months later. The inclusion of this incident, which is a popular misconception, of course casts a good deal of doubt on the research behind the rest of the book."
219,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1549839-mina-villalobos,5,"This is probably the best science book I've ever read. The narrative is really engaging, the content really approachable and clear, and the subject really interesting. It covers a lot of ground, following history and the main contributors to the birth and evolution of cosmology as a science and how the Big Bang theory came to be. At 550 pages, it looks like it might be heavy reading but it's really not, it flows very nicely and keeps you engaged -really at the edge of your seat, sometimes. Aces!"
220,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1249421-joshua-weichhand,4,"Singh's book works on a handful of levels: firstly as a historical retrospective of the enlightenment; secondly as a more generalized explanation of the various theories and breakthroughs, as well as their creators, in modern science; and finally, as a crafted hope for the future.This should be required reading for liberal arts students, theists, atheists, et al -- a brilliantly concise, accessible work of explanation regarding the finer points of astrophysics, relativity and the scientific process. "
221,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4809767-sho,4,"I love books about the history of various bits of science, rather than just baffling my pea-brain with the facts, ma'am.This one is written in an engaging chatty way, which I like, and includes just enough of the science (which I have read before and each time I come accross something I already know I get a bit of a glow and smile a lot) to keep it sciency.At the end I have to admit that my eyes did start to glaze over, but only briefly and when I got to the conclusion I was all attention again.I'm definitely going to look out Singh's book about codes, a subject close to my heart."
222,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5025062-andrew-wiley,4,"This is a good book to pick up if the documentaries on TV aren't doing it for you any more and you want more depth but dont want to dive into reference and text books.I like the way this book is set out, the narrative style is more like a story wich makes it easy to read but it is really as much history as science. Scientific explinations are usually coverd twice in two different ways so if you don't get one description the other will likely help. It also shows a more personal/peoplie aspect to a lot of the discovieries it covers.Highly reccomended!"
223,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31430322-ankit,5,"I'm in awe as to how Simon Singh can take one through a topic as complex as the Big Bang, and explain it piece by piece from observations of the sun by the Egyptians through to radio wave measurements from satellites in the 1990s. And he does all this while keeping fairly dry subjects very, very interesting to the point of even being dramatic. If you have any interest in the topic of our universe, the early days of astronomy and science, or even more modern advances in cosmology, I think you'll really enjoy this book."
224,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16791826-jared-peterson,4,"I read this in an undergrad class with the express purpose of trying to better understand science. In other words, the physics in this book was secondary to my purposes. In terms of the history of science, I really enjoyed this book. it helped me to understand how science developed and develops. It gave me a better appreciation for the follies and strengths, and how personalities can often guide us more than the studies. I would recommend reading it with this same approach. It is not my favorite book, and it bored me at times. But it did change my view of science."
225,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8770879-valerie,5,"This is a fantastic book on not just the origins of the universe, but of the origins of science itself, in particular the fields of physics and astronomy. Simon Singh patiently explains things in layman's terms so that everybody can enjoy the book. And let's not forget, while the Big Bang model seems mostly correct, it is still just a theory and not a law. As Singh said at the end, there is still much to be discovered. But that is what makes science so much fun Everybody should read this book. It should also be required reading for juniors and seniors in high school."
226,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/553352-ke,4,"Big Bang is a great overview of Cosmology written in a way that anyone can understand. It covers cosmology from the age of the flat earth to the establishing and proving of the current model of the universe. Simon Singh doesn't only focus on the science, he also tells us about the lives of the scientists making these contributions to cosmology.This book is engaging from cover to cover and gives an unprecedented view over the history of cosmology."
227,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/767304-ezra,4,"This one falls along the lines of the Elegant Universe as a history of science. Going back to Greek philosophers and moving through developments in understanding the Universe, Singh explains the findings and the contemporary reactions. And also how the world reached being ready for the next step. So it covers much of any number of physics histories but new nuances. And he uses British phrasing in places that I was not familiar. Guess I should watch more British TV."
228,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3145337-andrew,4,"I understand it's a popular science book but really, that whole prelude of geocentrism/heliocentrism was unnecessary. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I've always had trouble getting my head around General Relativity but Simon Singh breaks every phenomenon down perfectly. I especially loved the tidbits of each Physicists, their personalities and background and their contribution to Cosmology. "
229,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1653168-larry,5,A superb primer on cosmology and its history. With a simple and direct style the author leads the reader from ancient Egypt to today's science in a manner that allows the reader to understand the progression of scientific discovery and understanding.

230,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1147449-sewella,4,"I never had that much interest in astronomy until recently. I think either the magnitude freaked me out or it just didn't seem relevant. This book is a great layman's introduction to the history of scientific theories of the universe. An entertaining and engagingly written read, as well, although it's so thick and I've been so busy that it took me a while to get through it."
231,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97110-walker,5,"More of a history of science book than a scientific text, and perhaps too simple for those already well-versed in the various specialized fields related to the origin of the universe, nonetheless Singh's logical presentation and lucid prose makes this an excellent and accessible entry-level work for the uninitiated."

An overall fascinating look at how the universe began.
233,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4096389-shane-evans,5,Remarkable book. I wish I could use it as a textbook for the astronomy section of my physical science course. It is wonderfully written and explains the science and history behind the theory of the big bang. I can't recommended it high enough. This is the second book I have read written by Simon Singh. I am officially a big fan!

From toiling around for 8 years just for the perfect eclipse to some of the most famous serendipitous moments , this book as a whole frames the Big Bang theory very well. It will change your view for Big Bang as a phenomenon. This book is worth reading TWICE! "
237,0007162219,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6438326-ninadb,4,"Very good in explaining the history of astronomy and the creation of the universe. It becomes a little technical and complicated in the last 2 chapters, but that is acceptable considering the nature of the subject.
