The story of the discovery of the structure of DNA is a fascinating one and makes for a compelling must-read book. The research behind it merited a Nobel Award... But as any first year science student worth their salt can tell you it is a story mired in controversy. I was enthralled by the continuous advancement of ideas that led to the double helical model that we all are familiar with today, but what is deeply unsettling about this account of those events is the almost casual misogyny that bleeds off practically every page that features Rosalind Franklin. I don't think that one or two paragraphs in an epilogue, to attempt to paint her in a better light after defaming her character for the entirety of what has gone before it, can fully rectify the situation. This book recounts the occurrences during the early 1950s from the viewpoint of James Watson so the question could be asked, does the time period and accepted societal viewpoints excuse his narration of the events? This was a highly educated man. An intelligent man. Surely a man such as that should be held to higher standards and should have been a voice for equality and not one spreading misogynistic ideas?If Franklin had lived it also would have highlighted the quandary over whether or not she would she have been awarded a Nobel prize too? Undoubtedly her work was a key component in determining the structure of DNA. However, a Nobel Prize can only be awarded to a maximum of three people. Who would have lost out? Would perhaps the medical prize have been awarded to Watson and Crick and the chemistry prize to Franklin and Wilkins? Sadly we will never know. Rosalind Franklin died from ovarian cancer before the awarding of the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine which was jointly awarded to Francis Harry Compton Crick, James Dewey Watson and Maurice Hugh Frederick Wilkins ""for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material"". (ref. www.nobelprize.org)Has history been too kind to Rosalind Franklin and placed too much gravitas on her scientific work? Do we vilify James Watson and triumph Franklin as some sort of wronged feminist icon? Would Watson and Crick have determined DNA structure as quickly without access to Franklin's research....I know what I believe.Five stars for the science But one star for the blatant misogyny which I cannot condoneA prior knowledge of DNA structure and protein synthesis is best to enjoy this book and at the very least some basic understanding of the various principles of chemical bonding."
1,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,1,"I ended up skimming this. I really hope his more recent book DNA: The Secret of Life is considerably more interesting and considerably less sexist. It should be a fascinating story, but really it's mostly about James D. Watson bouncing around between different supervisors and making sexist comments about Rosalind Franklin -- sorry, ""Rosy"", who would've been much better in his eyes if she'd done something with her hair. [ETA: in total fairness to those who have difficulty recognising hyperbole, it's worth noting that it probably isn't mostly about these things... but it sure felt like it to me. His later book is much, much better and more to the point.]I can understand his fascination with DNA, but that's just about all I could get on board with. And his writing style was just completely flat. I do not honestly think all the details like how cold he was in Italy are at all relevant to the history of the discovery of the double helix."
2,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"“In the end, though, science is what matters; scientists not a bit.” ― Steve Jones in, James D. Watson's The Double HelixI gave it three stars last night (DNA night, thanks Riku), but that just didn't seem right. The structure wasn't stable, and I felt it probably deserved four stars (one for A, one for T, one for G, one for C; also one for Watson, one for Crick, one for Wilkins, and yes one for Franklin).Short, interesting, personal and important but also sexist, biased, & according to Crick ""a violation of friendship"". Watson's attitudes towards Rosalind Franklin today seem so maligned that Watson eventually had to clarify that these were attitudes and view at the time of the discovery and not when he wrote the book. Still, despite this major and very real issue, the book (along with Watson, Crick & Wilkins contributions) cannot be undersold. The discovery of DNA's structure changed biology and the book catapulted Watson & Crick into that pantheon of fame that is seldom reached by even Nobel-level scientists."
3,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10592271-brokentune,1,"Gossip, backstabbing, petty squabbles, arrogance, snobbishness, and misogyny take a front row seat in this personal account of how the double helix structure of DNA was discovered. I expected more from Watson's book. And then there is the question about Rosalind Franklin's contribution to the discovery.While Watson does spend some time in the epilogue to credit Franklin for her work on the subject, it seems too little, too late. He spends the entire book painting her as an uncooperative, dour, argumentative, bossy, frump with an ""acid smile"" in a career mostly reserved for unattractive women who have little chance of catching a husband. (He actually introduces her in the book in almost exactly those terms.)Oh, and there is little explanation of the structure of DNA itself. It really is more of an account of his thoughts on girls, stomach pains, and on the personal lives of people Watson encountered when working on the project. "
4,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3020662-douglas,4,"I made the mistake of reading this over a long period of time. I see now that it really needs to be read in just a few sittings. Also, a basic background in chemistry and physics (none of which I have) would be beneficial. Thank goodness for Wikipedia. This is the riveting story of the discovery of the secret of life, the helical structure of DNA. Even though the Nobel award was given to both James D. Watson and Francis Crick, the pendulum of recognition swings to Watson for this well-known account of how it all came to be. The path to discovering the structure of DNA is of course fascinating, but Watson’s charming prose and thrilling narrative adds drama to the history. Watson’s writing style has that English charm, which is unique for an American. I did, however, sense a bit of false humility in his account. He often refers to his ignorance on certain scientific principles and his physical unattractiveness to perhaps gain sympathy for appropriating other’s work. “Sometimes I daydreamed about discovering the secret of the gene, but not once did I have the faintest trace of a respectable idea.”I find that hard to believe. Now, I, Douglas Feil, could honestly say, “not once did I have the faintest trace of a respectable idea”, but not Watson. After all, he had several traces of ideas, and he strategically and sometimes underhandedly put himself in the middle of those on the verge of scientific discovery. His theories were just wrong at first. Thanks to the work of Rosalind Franklin, Linus Pauling, Maurice Wilkins, and a host of others, he used their “faintest traces” to build upon his own theory. Discovering the structure of DNA was hard work, but much of it was timing. Kudos to Watson and Crick for that, and I do believe they deserved the Nobel for their work. I was disappointed in his treatment of Rosalind Franklin. He almost unapologetically skewers Rosalind Franklin and her contributions to the discovery of DNA. I say almost because he reserves the ending epilogue for a sort of apology. “Since my initial impressions of her, both scientific and personal were often wrong, I want to say something about her achievements.” He apologizes after her death and the apology was after the prior vilification. If Watson really respected Franklin and appreciated her contributions, why not leave out the dirt? Here’s a book that more properly defends Franklin: Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA.Overall, I found this account thrilling and vital. Few scientific discoveries get a story like this. Watson's writing is sure-footed and perfect for describing his accomplishments."
5,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92723-carlos,2,"Shows how arrogant, misogynistic, and plain stupid the ""discoverers"" of DNA's double helix were. Pros: Emphasizes the importance of being able to access a free, open, creative, in some ways childish state of mind in order to allow for truly creative and ""defocalized"" states of mind that allow for scientific discovery. Tunnel vision can be a scientist's worst nightmare.Cons: Shows how childish, pretentious and socially inept the scientific establishment can be. Also shows how a great scientist who suffered in silence due to being surrounded by sexist men in positions of authority was robbed of credit for providing the critical evidence necessary for finding and verifying the structure of DNA. Rosalind Franklin, you will not be forgotten. "
6,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl,2,I had to read this book for a science class in college. I've never forgiven that teacher.
7,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48011083-steve,5,"The Double Helix is a wonderfully candid recounting of the scientific process, revealing the interplay of conditions precedent—especially technology, observation and theory—and the human condition—especially ego, competition and teamwork. I can’t help wondering that many, if not all, of the scientists revered through history are really the beneficiaries of much good fortune and coincidence. Of course, they were accomplished and driven, necessary prerequisites to greatness, yet those factors are not enough, for a large amount of their success seems due to pure serendipity."
8,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5410681-tony61,5,"James D. Watson became a controversial figure later in life, but this story recounts the seminal event in his life: the 1953 discovery of the structure of DNA for which he received the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology with his collaborator Francis Crick and another, Maurice Wilkins. Watson is an excellent storyteller, something which cannot be said of most scientists. He successfully ensnares the reader into the drama of the moment, describing the personalities involved and making the science attainable to any reader. The discovery of the double helix as the structure of DNA is perhaps the most remarkable event in biology after Darwin's grand theory of Evolution. Watson and Crick devised the structure using tinker-toy-like models and corroborating their findings with x-ray crystallographs which were surreptitiously taken from the laboratory of Rosalind Franklin. Watson was a wunderkind American who acquired his PhD in zoology at the age of 23; Crick was a 35 year-old boisterous gad-about who was struggling for direction, having earned his BS in physics and unable to get the proper motivation for a PhD. The unlikely duo hit it off and agreed that DNA biochemistry was the ticket to recognition. At this time Linus Pauling at CalTech was transitioning his emphasis from proteins to DNA, setting the stage for a race to find the secret of the genetic code.Watson spins the yarn in dramatic fashion, writing in 1968, fifteen years after the discovery and 6 years after the Nobel. He offers an apologia of sorts to Dr. Franklin, who was taken aback by the use of her xrays without permission. Watson admits that her gender had much to do with the raw treatment she received in the male-dominated world of science. Franklin did not receive a Nobel because she tragically died in 1958 from ovarian cancer at the age of 37, and the Prize is only awarded to living scientists.I cannot believe that I've never read this book before. It's relatively short and remarkably easy to read. I highly recommend this to anyone who has any interest in science, medicine or the history of the 20th century. "
9,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8320288-heidi,2,"I have no doubt that James Watson was a (pretty) competent scientist - although the way he writes it, every thing seemed to favor him up to the discovery of the double helix structure. He chose the field by a mix of chance and cunning, having eliminated other fields which would require more effort, by his own words (I suppose some people call it self-disparaging, but somehow to me it reads like a humble brag) and less likely to yield the chance to make a huge discovery. If that's not cheating science, I don't know what is. I have more respect to great men and women who did science because they really loved digging up more and more facts about something they truly love, something that they can't stop thinking about. Such as Feynmann and Einstein and Curie and yes, Rosalind Franklin, the brilliant and dedicated molecular biologist upon whose work Watson and Crick built theirs.I hate the way Watson portrays Franklin, the way he demonizes her into someone difficult to work with, when in fact he and Crick did not really respect her as an equal. In some scenes that he recollects in the book it seems as if they resented her for getting the double helix images before them, because it means they needed the results of her research.Watson's writing is friendly and easy enough to read. But the vibe of the whole book seems to be: ""Oh the Nobel prize thing? I didn't really put that much effort into it, I just happen to be a scientific genius and a visionary."""
10,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"After reading Bill Bryson’s wonderful A Short History of Nearly Everything, I’ve been effectively disabused of the notion that scientists are purely logical, rational, and reasonable folk, and that science progresses through mild-mannered and careful thinking. I bet it does, sometimes. But, like any dynamic human activity, science is populated by a diverse group of people. Some, I’m sure, are the workaday, tame people we like to imagine in white lab coats. But we also have half-deranged incorrigible bachelors who stick needles in their own eyes (Newton), adventurous world-travelers with exotic diseases (Darwin), and fun-loving, impetuous youngsters who enjoy chatting about foreign girls and wine as much as tinkering with organic chemistry (Watson). This book was great. We are all taught in school that DNA was discovered in 1953 by Watson and Crick. What we are not told about is the high school-type drama that was involved. Backstabbing, gossip, love, wine, vicious arguments, a race against time (and Linus Pauling)—after reading this, you’d be amazed that us humans ever get anything done. The elephant in the room here is, of course, Watson’s description of Rosalind Franklin. It’s very sexist. She comes across as a know-nothing bulldog. I’m sure many readers will be put off by it. Personally, I think it’s valuable to read about anyway. It’s a bird’s eye view into what institutional sexism was like. Moreover, I think that Watson’s honesty is preferable to a retrospective cover-up. I have no doubt that this was actually how Watson experienced the events he describes. Also, even Watson dedicates the last two paragraphs to an apology for his treatment of Rosalind, as well as an encomium to her scientific work. It’s a shame she died young, or she might have seen more of the credit in her lifetime. And (if you will pardon me for saying this) the sexism on display is a part of the charm of this book. Not that sexism is charming, of course, but that Watson gives us a singularly candid portrait of how scientists really operate. For The Double Helix has no pretense of objectivity or authority. It is a first-person account of one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the 20th century, with all of the peripheral thoughts, activities, interests, and proclivities that were part of Watson’s life while he struggled with the problem. So read this book, to see how a 24-year-old American with stomach pains from English food managed to uncover the secret of life by tinkering with a model in a cramped Cambridge office. And he didn't even need a lab coat."
11,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43931803-renuka,2,"I was expecting a lot from this book and it surely didn't meet my expectations. I picked this book because genetics always have been fascinating to me. When I was in college I did a course on molecular biology and DNA was really interesting and important topic. My professor mentioned this book but I couldn't find time to read it that time. Everything is wrong with this book from Watson's writing to his remarks on Rosalind Franklin. The only thing accurate here is the science which can't be overlooked. But I am also unable to digest the misogynist remarks of Watson, a well educated and renowned scientist. It felt like I was reading an article on a magazine rather than a very popular book. Two stars are just for the science!"
12,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,3,"Battle of egos, blind ambition, tensions, quarrels, conflicts of interests... Sadly or not, science goes hand in hand with the little defects of human nature. The race having led to the discovery of the structure of DNA is obviously no exception, and James Watson, the young lad (he was only 24!!) who was among whose hitting such jackpot, reminds us so here with his own version of the events.As every personal account such version is, of course, far from being objective! His arrogance is annoying. His egocentrism irritating. Some of his comments about Rosalind Franklin off the mark. He also was often accused of too much putting himself and Crick under the spotlights at the expense of other people's works. None-the-less, if the guy is a bore (gosh!) and his writing style full of difficult jargon, he delivers a fascinating testimony about, not only that great scientific triumph that was the discovery of the structure of DNA, but, also and beyond, how science is at times practiced. It is, at least, a powerfull insight no one interested in such topics should ignore."
13,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128299-shawn,5,"This book was probably ten times as fun to read as I suspected it would be. The very idea of it, and its drab wrappings, led me to believe it would be dull, full of scientific mumbo-jumbo, slow, and poorly written. It was none of these. It's one of the few books that I have had a hard time putting down. The race between team Watson and Crick vs Linus was riveting, and even though I knew how it would generally work out, I was worried and on edge until their paper was published. I was especially interested in who would make that final leap (Watson or Crick) and break the problem open. I'm also certain that the importance of the discovery played a big part in the book's ability to keep me enthralled.The book is also especially eye-opening in regard to how some science is done. It's astounding how such an important and apparently hard problem could be solved by someone with a nature as lackadaisical as Watson. I suspect this nature in some way made him a perfect compliment to the much more driven and, by Watson's own account, intelligent Crick. A perfect combination of squishy and solid. It could be argued that Watson's great talent was his ability to work with Crick, which very few people seemed capable of.I wonder how ""obvious"" the solution is these days. I never took a biology class (not even in high school) and as soon as they mentioned the fact that certain base pairs were always equally represented I somehow knew that it was because they always connect together as pairs. So I assume it's knowledge that floats out their in the ether that is hard not to pick up these days, but it was still surprising to me that that was the key point that was holding them up for such a long time, and once it was understood it practically solved the problem.Of course there was a fair amount of science in the book that was beyond me, but I don't think it got in the way of the basic understanding of the story. Plus the reader doesn't feel terrible about their own ignorance because half of the book seemed to be Watson confessing to his own ignorance in most every encounter he had with any other scientist of any significance.I think it is clear that Watson is not the most reliable narrator, which makes for an interesting non-fiction read (about science no less). I'm certain he does a very poor job of accurately describing Rosy (which is confirmed in the epilogue when he admits to as much). And I'm not certain that his modesty is feigned or not. I suppose it's easy (as in it doesn't hurt one bit) to claim yourself to be an inferior intellect when you have the discovery of the structure under your belt and uncontested. But anyway, this unreliability, if accepted as a flaw (especially the mischaracterizations) I think only makes the story more interesting, as opposed to harming the story. It makes the journey that much more human.I've been debating the four or five star. In a perfect world/website it would be 4.5. Today I shall error on the side of too many stars."
14,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,2,"""For a long time, the world believed that Rosalind Franklin had nothing to do with James Watson’s and Francis Crick’s discovery of DNA’s structure. In no small part, that’s because Watson said she didn’t, and we believed him. His 1968 autobiography Double Helix was the first full-length account of the discovery story. He refers to Franklin as “Rosy” throughout the book, and describes her physical appearance in blatantly sexist ways. He also omits the part of the story in which he and Crick used Franklin’s Photograph 51 without her permission or knowledge; Photograph 51 was the key evidence to unlocking the structure of DNA. He couldn’t completely erase Franklin, since too many people knew who she was, but he diminished her enough with a whimsical nickname and assessments of her attractiveness that her part in the story could easily be missed.""-Leila McNeilhttps://thebaffler.com/outbursts/sure...far from his only transgression....https://www.vox.com/2019/1/15/1818253..."
15,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6638317-jill,3,"I'm going to talk about this in class in a few days, and I know we're going to spend the majority of the seminar on how the Old Boys of British science treated Rosalind Franklin. With good reason: her contributions to the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA are now well-known, and they were all pretty big dicks to her. Watson's misogynist jabs are deeply frustrating to read, often detracting from the narrative itself -- which is structured as a fun academic mystery (AND Y'ALL KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE MY ACADEMIC MYSTERIEEEES). It is profoundly important that we talk about how women are treated in science, in the 50s and today.That said, here are some other things I would like to talk about:- why Watson remembers every meal he eats- what Crick's laugh really sounded like- Watson and Odile's gossip dates cause they sounded like fun- how can Watson be such an obvious asshole yet so endearing?- dry humour in the sciences and why it is so very effective- is there fan fiction about this competitive circle of DNA-seeking dudes, cause like, there's gotta be, I feel like ya could cut the tension with a knife- or maybe we could do a movie? That Turing movie went over well, MOAR SCIENCE BIOGRAPHY MOVEEZ PLS- DNA is so, so, so fucking cool- biology wtf- I love when all the sciences get along <3 physics, chemistry, and biology all had to help on this one!! beebees!- how emotional I got when Watson finally figured out the base pairs and why did I cry when reading the appendixed Nobel presentation speechHopefully we do not have time to talk about most of those as I will sound ridiculous but whatever, Goodreads friends, you signed up for the real deal here.Anyway: totally worth the read. I tend to read more physics than biology pop-science; that's maybe gonna have to change."
16,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5507161-battle-slug,5,"Just finished this book. What can i say? It is totally worth reading, but if you are not afraid of some scientific words and descriptions. For me it is one of the best books ever, and i will explain why.First of all this short book tells about how really big discoveries are being made: surprisingly the regular people are making them. But those people are keen to make something new. They don't bother about the money, or sex, or new car - the biggest passion possessing them is the science. Such books are moving the science forward because they are making the young mind to think that he can move the science himself like watson and crick and to decide to master biochemistry or physics etc.Secondly this book is real story about the collaboration and opposition between the scientists, something that is not well-known to regular people. It is really interesting to learn about. As for me - i never suspected that so hard competition existed between american and britain scientists, moreover, that the cultures are so different: conspicuous adversary between US scientists, and, in contrast, unquestionable confession of the first right to make investigations for those who decided to investigate first, in britain.Thirdly this book is making you to think: surely you always can dismiss all chemical details, but what a pleasure to get into them!I saw negative opinions about the Double Helix counting 200 words or more, but i believe that the people wrote them have to keep their fervor for the whole bunch of other junk books, but not for the stories of the greatest scientific discoveries of the modern history."
17,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein,5,"I had the great good fortune to meet Dr. James Watson, many times actually, and to have his kind assistance when I, a scientific novice, set out to save the venerable Public Health Research Institute in New York. Watson's major accomplishment, his role in determining the structure of DNA, is a fascinating tale well told in a form the lay reader can easily appreciate. For those who wonder how scientific discoveries are made, and indeed on the nature of scientific research itself, this is a great source."

19,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5197179-becky-douglas,2,"How to review The Double Helix? As a scientist who also happens to be a woman, I'm already biased against James Watson and Francis Crick, the two scientists credited with the discovery of DNA, because I'm aware of Rosalind Franklin. It's not very many pages into the book before Franklin appears and Watson's description of her makes me cross, but he's already failed to endear himself to me long before I get even that far.I'm not sure how tongue in cheek he's being, but he comes across as lazy and ruthless. He doesn't want to do the hard work; he avoids understanding x-ray crystallography, anything about biology, difficult mathematics and anything too far removed from what he already knows. He even acknowledges that during his PhD he was dangerous enough to be kept from the lab, meaning he got an easy ride on the way to collecting his degree. He avoids following the rules that are set for his fellowships and the funding that comes with them because he doesn't want to work on the difficult tasks he has been set. Even so, he wants to work with brilliant people enough to claim the prizes for their hard work. Doesn't he just sound like a joy?So when we get to Franklin and she's criticised for wanting credit for her own work and for not wearing lipstick, I'm already out of patience. Fine, so the book was first published in 1968, at time when a lot of people held ideas that now feel very backwards, but science had always tried (and almost always failed) to be a meritocracy - to so openly criticise a scientist for their appearance over their work is infuriating. No wonder Franklin didn't like them.In some later editions, including the beautiful Folio Society copy that I hold, Watson has added a note, admitting that he was unfair to Franklin and that she didn't deserve the treatment she received. This goes some way to fixing the problems, but not far enough.In terms of the science, it's fascinating. The x-ray crystallography field was still pretty new at the time and the work needed to find the structure of DNA was extensive. The importance of the results cannot be understated and, even if it's hard to like the scientists who did the work, the results are beautiful and elegant. Interestingly, this book is presented like something between a diary and a piece of pop-sci, except the science is pitched at someone who already has a decent background in chemistry. Very little is introduced at a layperson's level and someone who really wanted to understand, without a science background, would probably need to read it with a couple of Wikipedia tabs open.So it's a strange book. The science is cool, the characters are mostly awful and the pitch is all over the place. If you're going to read books about science then this is an obvious one to choose, but that doesn't have to mean that it's a good one."
20,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7216661-red,2,"So...umm. Hmm. Okay right off the bat, if you're not someone with a lot of biochem in their brain, this book is one-half to one-third wholly unfuckingcomprehensible. I say this as someone whose college sciences were Astrology and Geology. This was never meant to be the weird, scandalous, ego-driven smash hit it ended up being, is my impression. It didn't seem like Watson entirely expected the backlash and sensation of it. But there the book was, on Time Magazine's Top 100 non-fiction books, and so I wanted to read it. The bits that are good, and by good I mean bad (as in reality tv bad), are Watson repeatedly avoiding work, or deceiving grant committees, or sniping at society, his friends, his coworkers, etc. But it's so...guileless. And honest. He didn't write a PR fluff piece, he didn't write a thing that praises his GREAT MASSIVE WORTH as a human being, he didn't get a Nobel Prize and then set to pen to paper to say love me love me love me. Most memoirs of this nature are that, a big celebration of the author. But this isn't, he just says what he feels without the intent to tear anybody down. Which isn't to say he didn't say terrible, awful, unfair, inaccurate things about Rosalind Franklin. But he didn't know those things until a large group of other people told him. He lives in the same self-centered world we all do. If there's a coworker that annoys us, we don't try to find out their backstory, their struggles, their psyche. We lean back in our chairs and bitch about them, because every body wants there to be a villain to their hero. Watson has crafted here one of the most human and down-to-earth memoirs I've ever read, and he doesn't even feel like he's trying to accomplish that. He just doesn't have a filter, and I can't fault him for it. This is both an egotistical book (b/c it is purely his side of the story with no investigation into anyone else) and an ego-less book (in that he does not in any way praise himself or go on monologues about his individual worth and accomplishments as compared to others). A complicated book with a complicated history, but worthwhile if you enjoy nonfiction as a style to be investigated and are not just reading this for the story...unless you also understand biochem, in which case the story will make more sense to you. As for me, I'm going to find ways to insert ""diffraction patterns of crystallographic sculptures under X-rays"" into conversation to make me sound smart and make it sound like I read a smart book."
21,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,3,"Watson is one of those figures who's opinion of himself is so high, you can't help but be dissuaded from feeling the respect you would have been willing to give him merely on the basis of his accomplishments. Reading this book was full of cringe-worthy moments of self-aggrandizement, and times when his accounts of trying to pick up French girls at parties and things of that nature were just unwanted. Written in the late sixties about events that happened in the early fifties, I shouldn't be surprised and upset that his attitude towards women is so awful, and to his credit he gives an afterword basically apologizing for his treatment of Dr. Rosalind Franklin in life and in the text, which was a nice touch.But it was terrible reading about them trying to get her fired for wanting to be equal to the men she was educationally and career-wise actually equal to. The phrase ""our lab was no place for a feminist"" is used at one point. Maybe that afterword should have been a foreword! The science isn't well-explained at all. I think Watson likes to feel smarter than his readers, who he assumes will be along for the ride because of the importance of the finding. He makes no effort to do anything other than explain in technical terms what they were doing. No amount of educating laypeople in the science involved is attempted.Still, the finding of the double helix structure of DNA was a monumental human achievement, so this is still an interesting book.NOTE: I saw him on a recent science documentary, where he told the interviewer, unprovoked, that ""Aside from Hawking, I'm the most famous living scientist now."" Which I don't even think is true, but it is also a douchey thing to bring up for no reason."
22,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,3,"Glad I finally read this classic. It's a quick-reading sketch, two or three hours, a half day at most if you need a break. Watson's prose is obscurely ironic at times, which keeps the reader on his toes (or bores him as the case may be) along with quite a bit of humor if you are looking for it. The science, not difficult even at its original full strength, is hardly toned-down for the popular reader, which is a disctinct positive. Watson avoids confusion by simply skipping a few topics, like the mathematics of crystallography or the intimate details of chemical bonds, which are not necessary to follow the ""action"" anyway. All considered, it's a privilege to be able to share in his discovery first-hand.Now, what about the elephant in the room? Watson treated his female colleague Rosalind Franklin very badly, and he doesn't hide that from his readers. (They nearly come to blows at one point.) Apparently all the men at Cambidge looked down the same way at all women there. It's entirely unforgivable, but mitigated somewhat by what seems to be his sincere apology in the book's Epilogue. You'll make your own judgment. Certainly, Watson's recent racial shenanigans, 50+ years after his discovery, and at the end of his long life, are disgusting. None of this detracts from the brilliance of his youthful scientific accomplishment described herein.It might be argued that Linus Pauling, at Cal Tech, the beloved world's greatest chemist at the time, only a few weeks behind Watson's lead, hot on his trail, would have been a more worthy discoverer. That's not how science, and history, works, where there's usually no accounting for pleasantness."

In a review of that book, I suggested The Double Helix as a corrective; it made clear that competition, hunger for personal acclaim, and a desire to show up the famous guy (a role played here by Linus Pauling) all figure into the progress of science. The original Kirkus review of this book puts it nicely: ""What emerges here is not only a story of a scientific scrimmage as competitive as the race to the moon--but also a happy sense of surprise that anything as seemingly assiduous and systematic as pure science could be so much the result of random speculations at lunch and teatime and anything from light to 'solid fiddling' at odd hours. It all seems remarkably fresh and impulsive and adventitious.""Incidentally, this book figures into the debate over Rosalind Franklin’s work (which happens to be in the public eye as I write, thanks to a prominent London production of a play about her by Anna Ziegler), but little about that is simple. It seems clear that Watson and Crick stole a march on her, but she’s not absent from this telling of the tale—this book is where I first heard of her."

Thanks to X-ray crystallography and studies by experimentalists like Rosiland Franklin and near misses like JBS Haldane's attempts to model DNA as triple helix Watson and Crick were able to figure out the double helix and the G to C and A to T pairings of the nucleotides and provide a foundation for Genetics. Many teams at the time thought DNA was probably the molecule responsible for cell reproduction and were working on the problem but Crick and Watson unlocked the code first. What is shows through this short story is that science is a group effort and if Crick and Watson had not of solved the structure of DNA another team soon would have. Nice little short history.
25,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/882910-rob,4,"The molecular structure of DNA was determined in 1953 by James Watson and Francis Crick. That was probably the most influential discovery in all of biology and chemistry during that century. This book was written by Watson (comparatively younger and inexperienced compared to Crick, at the time) about how they did it. In great detail, he explains how they did it by essentially using Rosalind Franklin's data without her permission, how the more notorius Linus Pauling nearly beat them to it, and how their personal lives were consumed by the pursuit of it. A must read for anyone involved in scientific research."

Understanding the structure of DNA is especially important in the era of genetics, but this book also gives insight into the people behind the science, which is all too often overlooked.An aside: I literally ran into Watson when I came barreling around a corner with my arms full of books and papers. He helped me pick it all up before continuing on his way."

Even the words “scientific memoir” brings up an image of a long and boring book. There are a lot of good books written about scientists, but not by scientists. Maybe it’s because the scientists are trained to write logically, objectively and dispassionately: this approach results in good papers and science books, but not a compelling “after hours” reading.“The Double Helix” by James Watson of Watson-Crick fame is a scientific memoir with a difference. Watson describes the period before and after the famous Letter to Nature paper about a possible structure of DNA, not scrimping on the details and being quite frank. The picture that emerges from the book paints Watson as a generator of (mostly incorrect) ideas with an aversion to experimental science and an interest in au pair girls – not what I expected from one of the most famous biologists of the 20th century.And if we are to believe the book, Watson’s collaborator and cheese to his chalk Crick did what any PhD student is advised not to do – instead of concentrating on working on his PhD calculating atom positions in haemoglobin (no computers or even calculators then), solving the structure which would later bring his thesis supervisor a Nobel Prize, he put his know-how into fleshing out Watson’s ideas about DNA structure.However, “The Double Helix” is not only a story about one of the biggest discoveries of the 20th century, but also an account of one of the major scientific controversies as well. The picture of DNA diffraction pattern used in the Nature paper was obtained by Rosalind Franklin and shown to Watson and Crick by Franklin’s colleague Maurice Wilkins, who later shared the Nobel prize with Watson and Crick – Franklin was dead by then from cancer caused by X-ray exposure, and the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously. Watson’s unsympathetic description of Franklin in “The Double Helix” caused Harvard University Press, the intended publisher, to cancel its publication, and Watson later admitted that he may have misrepresented Franklin in the book.But controversies notwithstanding, “The Double Helix” remains an engaging introduction to of the golden era of molecular biology. It also has a less well-known and, in my opinion, less interesting sequel “What a Mad Pursuit”."
31,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6126081-04victorias,1,"Who on earth would want to read an entire book about genetics and DNA? I certinly wouldn't, but I did because I had to for my grade in Biology. This book was very boring and confusing. There definately was a lot of information that might interest scientist or people studying that subject. Informative books are very great resources for research though. If you are researching stuff about DNA or genetics this would be a great book for you.James D. Watson was the main character in the book. There were a lot of famous scientist in this book. For example: Rosalind Franklin, Maurice Wilkins, etc. All these people contributed to the discovery of DNA. Together they won the Nobel Prize. The discovery of DNA is a long process; they tried so many different ways and expierments. They built many models to help them undestand and check their research. Finally they somehow figured it all out and DNA was discovered and understood. They got the name of the book The Double Helix because that was the shape of DNA; which is a double spiral. If I was to recommend this book to anyone, it would be someone who enjoys to learn about DNA, a scientist studying DNA, or a student needing a book for a term project about DNA. This book is very hard to understand, but if you just read it slowly and throughly you will make sense of it. There are a lot of big words in this book so another technique to use would be to ahve a dictionary to look up the word that you do not understand.In conclusion, The Double Helix was a book that I would never choose to read, but I'm glad I did. This book helped me understand how DNA was discovered. It is a very detailed book and I encourage you to read it if you are looking for a challenge. Good luck to all you decide to read it, enjoy!"
32,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2969156-trice,4,"Upon finishing:That was an interesting and an entertaining read. Glad to put aside claims of misogyny - I was doubtful of some readers' claims re: Watson's attitude toward Rosy because it seemed he just found her obnoxious, completely independent of any gender question. The last couple chapters of the book, in addition to his brief eulogy for her at the end, seem to affirm this opinion - while he does come to view her in more positive terms, it is because of how all the science works out and the newfound respect and understanding that he and Crick both seemed to have reached with and of her, when all sides finally understood that each was all about the science and not, as previously thought, simply consumed with being lazy or obstinate. I'm wishing we could have read this in and/or around the organic chem and genetics classes from my college days - would have been the more fascinating because I might actually remember some of the details he mentions in passing. So much tickles my memory without recalling the details that would reveal. The book has a lot of subdued tension in the (in one sense) casual race scientists in 3 labs around the world were engaged in, in pursuing the structure of DNA. I would love to read about how they proceeded to discover conclusive evidence of how DNA replicates and of how this is foundational, indeed, and as suspected, to all life.Midway:we interrupt our reading updates for this take on DNA and RNA by the Amoeba Sisters"

I wasn't sure whether or not it would be hard to understand, but there was very little about the technical aspects of Watson & Crick's discovery of DNA's form. The book is a very quick read and I thought, very exciting. :) The book is written as a scientific memoir about how Watson & Crick made their Nobel Prize-winning discovery.This book would be great for people thinking of entering scientific fields who aren't sure they've got what it takes to make it. Very encouraging! Watson's self-effacing style brings a human element to the race for discovery.

When Crick and Wilkins were approached with this novel before publication, they claimed that it was ""In bad taste"" and put everyone in a bad light besides Watson. I stand by this criticism especially in regards to his character Rosy/Rosalind Franklin. Franklin was a sophisticated, beautiful, and brilliant scientist who literally had her work stolen from her and has never received due credit. She died from cancer a decade before this books publication and is unable to defend the horrible image drawn by Watson."

Watson is a product of his time in his suggestions that women are too emotional and then not emotional enough. Yet, he is hysterical. This retelling of how the structure of DNA was discovered is a rare and genuine glimpse into the entire process of science-- from the social interactions, to the hard science, and through to the politics of competition. FANTASTIC read! "

Watson's insistence that he was writing about how he felt at the time and his brief paragraph praising his colleague Rosilind Franklin in the epilogue don't make up for his portrayal of her in the book proper.

Watson left me with an open jaw.  This book is full of gossip, backstabbing, deep unappreciation, and yeah misogyny. ""It was all too clear that the presence of popsies does not inevitably lead to a scientific future."" When Watson started his book with ""Thus many of the comments may seem one-sided and unfair"" you know you are getting yourself in some kind of juicy gossip!I cannot write the review without mentioning how much I was disappointed by the way Rosalind Franklin was mentioned in this book, in my opinion, it was simply disrespectful. ""By choice she did not emphasize her feminine qualities. Though her features were strong,she was not unattractive and might have been quite stunning  had she taken even a mild interest in clothes"" ""Also, there was no denying she had a good brain. If she could only keep her emotions under control, there would be a good chance that she could really help him""""But at least Pauling was six thousand miles away, and even Francis was separated by a two-hour rail journey.

It was unbelievably damp and heated only by an aged electric heater. Nonetheless, I eagerly accepted the offer. Though it looked like an open invitation to tuberculosis, living with friends was infinitely preferable to any other digs I might find at this late moment.""--Talking about his sister "" Furthermore, if Maurice really liked my sister, it was inevitable that I would become closely associated with his X-ray work on DNA.""""Though my sister was upset when she saw me, I knew that months, if not years, might berequired to replace her superficial values with those of the English intellectual. Carradale thus was the perfect environment to go one step further and acquire a beard.

Moreover, he remained unconvinced that Crick was needed. Already for thirty-five years, he had not stopped talking and almost nothing of fundamental value had emerged.""""Though a few dissidents still thought he was a laughing talking-machine, he nonetheless saw problems through to the finish line.""--Talking about Crick and Odile's relationship ""At no moment did Francis see any point in trying tosimplify the matter for Odile’s benefit. Ever since she had told him that gravity went only three miles into the sky, this aspect of their relationship was set. Not only did she not know any science, but any attempt to put some in her head would be a losing fight against the years of her convent upbringing. The most to hope for was an appreciation of the linear way in which money was measured.""I think I should end this review, I think what annoyed me the most is the fact that Watson admitted that he used Rosalind's data without her knowledge and that she never got the Nobel prize for her contribution ""Rosy, of course, did not directly give us her data.

Watson's honesty in admitting his laziness in certain areas of science...yet he had a vision and drive to be one of the scientists to discover the secret to life. He obviously wrote and worked in the science field at a time when women were not as respected. In the epilogue he did apologize for his attitude towards Rosalind Franklin who did much work on decoding DNA at the same time he and Crick worked out the problem. I have read several reviews that felt like he was quite sexist, and I certainly have to agree that he was at times. I found it fascinating how various scientists in different parts of the world were racing to figure out the coding of DNA, yet they also seemed to work in a such a way where they held back if they felt someone else had already begun work in a particular area. At least in England.I definitely felt like there were parts of the book that were way over my head, but I was comforted by the fact that even Watson felt the same in reading several of his colleague's papers. Overall, I enjoyed the book, but I think I kept pushing on in parts because it was a book club book-although I felt like it was written in a way that was interesting to those who do not have a science background.

45,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63366285-anne,4,"Watson doesn’t use flowery language or attempt many literary devices and I’m so grateful for that. This story is told plainly, letting the excitement of the research speak for itself. The climax occurs a bit slowly and ends the book abruptly. It’s as if he’s telling someone the story over lunch. Because he is so straightforward, it allows you to focus on the experience itself - I found myself wondering again and again what it must feel like to find out something that in a few years is taken for granted worldwide. It was a mental exercise to strive to put myself in a place where I DIDN’T know the structure of DNA. Like when you imagine a place before you see it, after you see it it’s hard to remember how you used to imagine it. The mental working backwards like that for me reading it (as he also was working backwards in a way writing it - *after* his discovery) was really exciting. I also loved that he gave such good credit to the others working on the problem of DNA, and particularly that he includes such a respectful and changed perspective on Rosalind Franklin and the challenges she faced as a female scientist among them (acknowledged publicly after her death, unfortunately). This is a fast read that mimics in structure and payoff the elegant simplicity of the structure of DNA itself. “...the structure was too pretty not to be true.” :] "
46,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79820234-shortjg,4,"The amazing first hand story of the discovery of DNA structure takes you back to another time and place, Cambridge, England 1952. James Watson’s account reads more like a diary than a scientific treatise. He intersperses stories of his scientific progress with descriptions of the social scene of the day. The result is sometimes dated with awkward juxtapositions. “My first X-ray pictures revealed, not unexpectedly, much less detail than was found in the published pictures. Over a month was required before I could get even halfway presentable pictures. They were still a long way, though, from being good enough to spot a helix. The only real fun during February came from a costume party given by Geoffrey Roughton at his parents’ home on Adams Road.” But, In the end, Watson captures the personalities of the important contributors, the necessity of collaboration, and the sometimes messy way that science marches forward. The reader is left with a feeling of excitement and joy that comes with discovery. "

It's also a lot of fun to read, because Watson has a keen, sharp way of writing that reads almost as a fast paced novel instead of an autobiographical account of a hugely important scientific discovery. I think this would be a great work for non-scientists to read, as it shows how science is done, building off the work of others, and that even Nobel Laureates aren't universal experts in their own field. It was amusing to read Watson relay his ignorance of various aspects of chemistry and biology, even aspects that were vital to his discovery. Science is very much like this, requiring the best combined efforts of everyone interested in a project in order to cover all weaknesses."

Not the most easy-to-understand book that I've read because you would need a background in chemistry to understand what's going on. Even Einstein's General Theory of Relativity was easier to comprehend. However you can definitely relate to the urgency and competitiveness between the scientists as they race to determine the structure of DNA, the basic building block of life."

The epilogue contained a brief almost-apology to Rosalind Franklin, but it fell short for making up for his earlier disregard for her opinions and work, not to mention the numerous other women who seemed almost unimportant to him (depending on their attractiveness).I wish he would have stayed focused on the science. While this serves to show more about the culture of the time and the challenges women still face in research, I lost respect for the scientists involved (not due to their discovery, but due to their attitudes toward their peers and apparent unwillingness to change). So five stars for the science, one star for the attitudes. "

There is little to no introduction if you have no previous knowledge about DNA, the part about biology is little, but very specific.

I wanted to punch him in the face several times. Even thought the story itself is important. Surely they could have re-written the new versions to get rid of this and just keep what is actually relevant... On the other hand, I guess it's a good idea to make people aware of how difficult it has been for women in science."

Watson is a story about himself that actually happened in the which he and his partner, Francis Crick, were able to find the chemical bonding of DNA and the overall structure of the code of life. This story is the story of how they slaved over the DNA molecule until they finally could make a model that well explained the structure of the DNA molecule. They received a Nobel prize for their efforts and both wrote a book recollecting what had happened. The Double Helix is a good book because it is not 100 percent science, it is very behaviorally interesting, and it grabs and takes your attention from the first few pages, although sometimes I disliked it because it was a little over my head in scientific matters. I liked reading this book most of the time,though. James Watson starts off his book in the first few pages by saying ""One could not be a successful scientist without realizing that . . . a goodly number of scientists are . . . narrowminded . . . dull. . . [and] just plain stupid."" He then goes on to tell how Francis Crick and he met and became lab partners who found that they were both interested in the structure of DNA. At this time, everyone wanted to be the first one to find out the structure of DNA because of the fame and rewards it would bring. With some help from Maurice Wilkins, a scientist their elder, and his assistant Rosy, they were able to discover that DNA was a double helix with bases on the inside and sugars and phosphate groups as the molecules that held the base ""rungs"" together. After their discovery was proven right by other scientists, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins all received the Nobel prize. This almost autobiography about the discovery of the structure of DNA is fascinating and spellbinding, and I enjoyed reading it. There were very few things about this book that I didn't like, although they are existent. A reason that made the book harder to read was how you understand the science. The times when James Watson makes an observation about a certain molecule in DNA, you want to know more about it because it is driving you crazy to know how he arrived at the solution that he did. For example, when he talks about the number of hydrogen atoms in a certain molecule and how they can be ""fudged"" somewhere else, I get that he knew that and how it works, but I don't know how it works, and I don't want him to explain it to me. Another small reason that made this book more difficult to read was that there were so many places and people to keep in line. There were a lot of scientists that Watson and Crick worked with from a lot of different places. Sometimes, the book could be slightly confusing, but I liked it overall. There are many things that I liked about this book, but to name a few: the ease on science, the anticipation, and the way that people interact with each other in this book. First, I like that the book wasn't all about science, it was about the people who made the science. You don't have to wade through difficult theorems and postulates to know what is going on, and sometimes, it is just plain funny how people react in this book, like the way everyone thinks that James Watson has the weirdest American hairdo, just because he likes it that way. Another thing that I liked about this book was that you knew that they were going to win at the end, but all through the book, you are wondering how they did it. Sometimes it seems like they are so close, you just want to tell them what it is. I also liked the way that the people interacted in this book. This is not a book about a bunch of dull scientists mumbling furiously about the structure of a deoxyribose, this about many colorful and unique personalities that all helped in making the discovery of the structure of DNA possible. For exapmle, take Francis Crick, an overexcited lab-nut who wants to tell everyone about how great or bad a certain theory might be, or Rosy, a stubborn loner X-ray diffraction scientist who wants to find the structure of DNA entirely though X-rays. They are all very different and unique, making this a fun book, not a science textbook. Overall, I give this book a good rating of four stars because, even though it may be slightly confusing at times, it was very well written and was made about people instead of science. Anyone can read a science textbook and say that it was boring, but it's hard to read this book and say that it was boring. It is very intricate and well crafted, a book deserving 2 thumbs up. I liked the human characteristics of this book and how they interacted, although I did not like the complex science sometimes involved and all the people that you had to remember. This book is a very good book that I recommend you read."

The book was beautifully written, in an easy-following narrative. But I remember how Watson in this book left an awfully bad impression on me. I think it has to do with something he said about women or Dr. Rosalind Franklin, or probably something about race and as 17-year-old brown person it made me feel uncomfortable. "
59,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12995319-laura-degenhardt,5,"I have to give this account of the discovery of the structure of DNA maximum rating: as gripping as an account can be of one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the Twentieth Century. This is an accessible read for the layperson (me); with fascinating insights into the eccentric personalities of the international physics community of the 1950s and 60s, and the two youngsters at Cambridge University who won the Nobel Prize for their discovery. This account is also infamous for Watson's treatment of fellow researcher Rosalind Franklin that shades from eccentricity to outright unacceptability: comments about her appearance and attractiveness dominate over any real consideration of her contribution to scientific discovery. Even the postscript, I suspect requested by the publisher of the original edition for appearance sake, does little to address what can only be seen as a blatant and disappointing case of male chauvenism that can be understood as typical of the scientific community and Cambridge not that long ago."
60,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84826805-aiman-adlawan,4,Wonderful account of James Watson's journey to his discovery of the DNA. It's like reading his journal way back when he was still in his mid twenties. All the blunt conversations and reactions of one fellow scientist's theory and another fellow's interpretations. Great story. Not too scientific but a little bit feminist knowing this was in the 50's which was probably just normal.

63,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1627591-robert,4,"Martin Amis or Evelyn Waugh might have written The Double Helix, but no, James Watson, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA wrote it, an entertaining, witty, bold series of swipes at himself, at his scientific partner, Francis Crick, and a long list of renowned researchers racing to discover ""the secret of life"" in the early 1950s.This is a fun book that probably isn't fair to anyone but reflects a young man's joyous arrogance, sharp tongue, and almost casual brilliance. Watson first receives a post-doc fellowship to Denmark, can't get any traction there, doesn't understand a lot about what he's supposed to have mastered, and sneaks over to Cambridge where is he is one of the few scientists in the Cavendish laboratory who can bear Francis Crick's laugh, rapid-fire talk and instant theorizing about almost anything. The two of them are a pair of untamed rascals who only behave when they're forced to behave. Neither of them wants to master the math or experimental techniques needed to advance their research, but they barrel along, find themselves in a competition with the scientific giant, Linus Pauling, and crack the code by what I would call ""if this, then that..."" reasoning, not always getting the ""if this"" part right and therefore not always getting the ""then that"" part right.""The Double Helix"" has been around a long time. Don't know why I haven't read it before. Probably because I never anticipated Watson's gift for characterization, skill in mixing inconsequential details with complex scientific facts, and willingness to expose himself as a bungling, fugitive American trying to fit into the staid ranks of British science.The best thing about the book is that Watson isn't trying to write a satire. He's just spilling a lot of beans."
64,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5069314,5,"James Watson’s style of writing flows such that this book reads more like a novel than an account of one of the very greatest discoveries in the biological sciences. He bares to his reader the frailties of individual human nature in addition to his passionate description of the sheer excitement of the final discovery which is only now beginning to really be exploited, in our twenty-first century.Watson’s humility shines throughout; not that he was adverse to taking an advantage when an opportunity arose! Life’s like that. In this book he succeeds in communicating with skill and unerring accuracy the sense of how easy a solution appears to be after it has been found; but how obtuse, opaque, and obscure the solution/s is/are when as yet unsolved, and why, overall, though it may not be recognised at the time, it is a great asset to have persons of different background, expertise and temperaments working (together or apart) on a problem.The Forward to this book contributed by Sir Lawrence Bragg’s acts as a timely reminder to the reader that although a scientist, or team of scientists, may be credited with a great discovery and Nobel prizes galore; the success of their work is always built upon the discoveries of others; in this case X-ray crystallography (for which Lawrence Bragg and his father were each awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1915 – 47 years before Nobel recognition (in Medicine, 1962) was made for the discovery of the structure of DNA.No child should be allowed to leave school without reading this gripping, emotionally engaging and intellectually satisfying book; and I heartily also recommend it to every adult who has not yet read it. Those who are not yet good readers might like to first watch the 1988 British Broadcasting Corporation ‘Horizon’ production called “Life Story”, starring starred Jeff Goldblum, Juliet Stevenson, Tim Piggot-Smith and Alan Howard."
65,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1771751-troy,3,"My one-line rundown: anyone who thinks the scientific process is a dry affair, barren of drama, silliness, oddity or personality, should read this book.I started trying to keep up with the great quotes from this book, but eventually gave up; there are too many. Take the opening salvo of the first chapter: 'I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood.' Or Watson's contention, as a 24 year-old graduate student, that 'in contrast to the popular conception supported by newspapers and mothers of scientists, a goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.' Watson details a number of ridiculous sub-plots throughout the book, including forays into the sex life of bacteria, his attempt to set his sister up with Maurice Wilkins (to both keep her away from some 'mental defectives' and secure himself a direct line to Maurice's X-ray work on DNA), and deals made with disinterested lab supervisors which made it possible for him to live and work outside the institution required by his fellowship. Add I love the idea of cutting edge 1950s biochemistry revolving around people manipulating plaster-and-wire models.I have utterly no interest in biochemistry generally, and even less in trying to understand the specific details of the X-ray crystallography technology from a half-century ago. I just enjoyed reading Watson's sardonic references to 'dressing for dinner', girls, and the necessity of growing his hair into a wild mop to avoid being mistaken for those other local Americans - Air Force personnel. It helps me remember that, while this discovery was arguably the most important contribution to genetics since Mendel, the scientific endeavor is rarely if ever free from that entertaining and most fallible entity: humanity."
66,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/871468-andrewcharles420,4,"This was a strange edition of a book (any book) to read. In addition to the main text is a lot of mostly critical commentary about the book and its popular reception; also there were some original references, for those more concerned with the details of scientific history (I read 2 of the 6 academic papers included but then (like most academic papers) skimmed the rest).I thoroughly enjoyed the main text! I thought Watson did a wonderful job of describing life as a lowly researcher in a big institution, the politics and mentalities in academia, and the weird interplay of life (food, sex, movies, travel) in what is otherwise a daily 24-hour devotion. There are many times where the author comes across as an arrogant jerk (and his treatment of his only female colleague: appalling), but overall the balance is almost charming. Of course he's quite brusque, but his disdain is spread evenly about (and frequently on the mark) and his advancement along his quest is brilliant. I didn't find much value in the editor's notes and introductions, but I enjoyed most of the pieces included in the collection. The commentaries were widely varying in their opinion of Watson's account (and personality) but by and large they offered valuable and insightful comments on all aspects of the event: the scientific discovery, the scientific process, academia, the literary accomplishment of this scientific memoir, the personal character of Watson, etc. Overall a fascinating and strange thing to read!"
67,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5883693-andy,3,"Learned some new things in this book:1. How X-ray crystallography was used to help understand the structure of DNA, using Fourier transforms to find length measurements of the major structures and the orientation of the structures.2. Why guanine and cystosine, and adenine and thymine are associated with each other on the ""rungs"" of the ladder staircase. In a nutshell it provides a length that is roughly 3 benzene rings long and the connections between the two amino acids rely on 3 Nitrogen atoms and 1 Oxygen atom. It's illustrated in a figure in the book and it provided me a lot of insight to why that is. I had known about the association but hadn't known the why of it.3. Watson really was a jerk when describing Rosalind Franklin. There's a non-apology in the epilogue of the book that I suspect was not actually written by him, and I think was inserted into later editions of the book. I had also heard about this, but had never read the book in its entirety to see what his characterization was like.Interesting to see the process of doing science and his perspective on it. There's an account of having to hunt through bookstores looking for a copy of Linus Pauling's book on chemistry. Nowadays the internet is at your fingertips. Brings to mind having to search for information in the math library and hunting for books at other university librarys (I went to Temple, University of PA, Princeton) trying to hunt down information and reference sources for my master's paper back when the internet was kind of new."
68,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28000751-arimo,3,"The Double Helix is James D. Watson's memoir of the events that lead to his and Francis Krick's discovery of DNA's double helix structure. It's a very quick read that I finished in two days.The book itself is very short and straightforward. Watson gives colorful descriptions of his peers and writes about his daily struggles with chemistry, stomach aches, balding and other mundane things. Some (okay, most) of the scientific stuff went over my head, but the books is mostly easy to follow. However, there are lots of people involved in the events, so it's sometimes difficult to remember who everybody is.As a reading experience, The Double Helix is an entertaining little book, not much more. However, the book's main value lies in its historical significance. Discovering the double helix was one of the most significant scientific events of the 20th century. The Double Helix is like a small anecdote or footnote on the pages of history, showing what events lead to the correct solution.Perhaps more importantly, The Double Helix changed the way public saw science and scientists. The Double Helix showed how ordinary people researches could be, and how science may be thrust forward by very humane goals and behaviour. Being probably the first book of its kind, the Double Helix added a new level to popular scientific discourse."
69,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99666-audrey,3,"Watson's story is readable for the layperson, although I won't pretend I understood a lot of the science. I enjoyed the way Watson portrayed science like a creative endeavor: a stop-and-start business with a lot of false turnings and sudden inspirations. Watson explains all of it thoroughly, although perhaps overestimating how conversant a layperson is with biochemistry. I didn't expect Watson to focus so much on the personalities of the scientists involved, and how their personal dynamics affected their work. There's a lot about internal politics of Cambridge, rubbing elbows with the right people at conferences and, especially egregious, a lot of mean-spirited contempt towards the one woman working in the milieu, Rosalind Franklyn. Watson spends the entire book putting her down for being by turns unfeminine and emotional, and being afraid of her criticism. In the last chapter he does a 180 when they become friendly, and then it's practically a paean to her ""personal honesty and generosity."" Of course, since this is the 50's, you might expect this attitude, but given that women (and people of color) face similar obstacles today in science fields, I'm not inclined to give it a pass. "
70,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1687252-eric,5,"In this book James D. Watson chronicles the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA along with Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin, and Maurice Wilkins. It is a fascinating first-person account of what Watson was experiencing as it occurred, and includes his thoughts as he reflects back on the events and the people he misjudged at the time. The reader encounters such scientific giants as Linus Pauling, and is given a real feel for how Watson and Crick's thinking process occurred as they developed their model. You are given a real sense for the rivalries and other, usually unspoken, human sensibilities that underly even the greatest scientific discoveries. I honestly would recommend this book to almost anyone. It is a fascinating read from a historical, social, or scientific perspective. And it goes a long way toward knocking even our greatest scientific heroes off their pedestals and helping one to realize how their concerns, problems, and impressions are all too human. "
71,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1653168-larry,5,"This self promoting story of the conceptual breakthru that led to the discovery of the composition and structure of the DNA molecule has been in publication for over 50 years which attests to Watson's skill as a story teller. It does accomplish the goal of describing the agonizing task of unraveling the mystery and to that end is a darn good detective story. It also explains the science in terms understandable to us lay people but it only hints at the true magic of the discovery, the sequencing of the atoms, their ability to unzip, as it were, and to replicate some or all of their code. But that would come later largely from the intellectual curiosity of his partner Francis Crick. The discovery itself had a number of fathers and at least one critically important mother, who is mentioned on occassion. But the history has come down to us as a partnership of Watson and Crick largely because of this book. Like Darwin's first book the science of this book has changed our view of all life and our position therein."

It is really sciency, but not boring. My brain didn't explode.He arrives at Cavendish laboratory in Cambridge, England. He becomes ""friends"" with two other scientists. James goes to the Cavendish lab to look at the molecular structore of proeins. he began his work by building 3-d models. he met a scientist named Crick. They were both interested in researching DNA. They had troubles seeing the DNA, because they cannot see weel through the microscope. They seek someone who specializes in crystallography so they can discover the DNA structure.I find Watson to be a very interesting scientist/ author. I liked how he wrote the book so people with simple minds could have an understanding. I recommend this to any student seeking an easier understanding, and perspective of DNA. "
73,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2640921-michael-cable,4,"This was an interesting look into the days leading up to the discovery of the DNA molecule. Watson's style is easy to read, though there are portions which exhibit some science that most people will not understand, one should just gloss over them and continue on with the fast paced narrative. The history of the race for this discovery built in tension as the story progressed and the credit that Watson gives to all of the other individuals who assisted in some way is encouraging and thoughtful. His writing style is honest and trustworthy. At the outset he readily indicates that this is just his interpretation of events and that others would surely agree and disagree on many points. Though a peripheral character, the reader is given further insight into the nature and character of Linus Pauling, one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century. My favorite part, however, comes in the epilogue when Watson eulogizes Rosalind Franklin by giving her the credit and understanding she deserved being a woman in a male dominated scientific world during the mid 20th century."

I enjoyed the perspective and did find the final chapters engaging as the final pieces of the DNA puzzle were discovered. The book as a whole, however, was quite difficult to get through with feigned interest. Watson recounts the experience by pulling from personal letters and his journal, and it is quite obvious to the reader throughout. The writing style and quality is subpar, and he certainly focuses on aspects of the experience that I doubt many readers care about.The book itself is not horrible, and this first hand account certainly carries value, but it isn't something I would recommend to anyone other than those with a very keen desire to understand the discovery of the structure of DNA.

Written in a light, easy, and amusing style, it concentrates on Watson's own role and that of Crick, but does not fail to acknowledge the contributions of others. I particularly liked the fact that the forward was written by Bragg, who does not escape being made fun of in the book - the Professor clearly had the ability to laugh at himself.This is probably not the book to read for a thorough and scholarly account of all the main strands (ho ho) in this scientific discovery. But it more than makes up for that by providing such a fresh and exciting read. It also has the merit of being very short - an enjoyable way of spending an afternoon but then you'll have to find another amusement!"

This well-crafted narrative by James Watson, the co-discoverer of DNA along with Francis Crick, is perhaps one of the earliest modern demonstrations of this fact. Anyone who has done active research in any scientific discipline would read it as a well familiar account of aspirations, struggles, frustrations, hopes, fears and competitions; most importantly, competition to imagine and translate imaginations into experiments that can reject those imaginations or build upon them. Watson doesnt hide his sexism, and undertones of those early traces of racism of which he has been accused even recently can be seen scattered all over the story. I wont be cruel to deduct a star for these personal proclivities which are an essential part of this narrative."

Told through the eyes of a wide-eyed 20-something James Watson, The Double Helix makes scientific discovery feel like a high-speed chase. The race against Linus Pauling, the tension with Rosalind Franklin, coincidences and bursts of theoretical inspiration. All at a frenetic, whirlwind pace in just over 200 pages, including loads of photographs, diagrams and scanned images of notes scribbled on scrap paper that would change biology forever. This book has completely changed the way I think about the world of scientific research, and the esoteric world in which university scientists work. It's also just simple voyeuristic fun to get a front-row seat to one of the most important biological discoveries in the modern era."

It is an interesting illustration of the process of scientific discovery that I have experienced first hand in my work. There are a lot of conversations and back-and-forth ideas that lead to insights. In this environment, one or a few people finally get everything together, but the success wouldn't have been possible without many others. When Isaac Newton gave his famous quote ""If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."" He wasn't just being humble, he was acknowledging this vital interplay with both contemporary and past experts. "

Watson, for what he couldn't ignore for long; he did not give enough credits for the discovery of DNA helix construction to Rosalind Franklin BUT his language is far from a sorry, misogynic, degrading and the grateful letter and thank you's at the end of the book is not helping either. this is not changing the fact this book is a must-read and the neatly recorded time-line of the events is really mind-opening."

But James Watson was lazy, rude, and misogynistic, and it comes across clearly in his writing. The last line of the book was literally about him not wanting to date long haired girls??? Which had nothing to do with anything??I give James Watson zero stars, BUT I give the book 3 stars (maybe 2.5) because of the dramatic irony. Knowing everything we know about DNA today, it’s fun watching the founders of the theory put all the pieces together, and all the bad ideas that led to the good ones.Overall, It’s an easy, short read.

They were in a race with Linus Pauling and engaged in some scientific skullduggery to lunch off Rosalind Franklin's research. The latter might have been forgiven but for the fact that neither mentioned a word about her in thei Nobel Prize acceptance speeches. They explain the status of knowledge in this field at the time they began their work, how this evolved, the politics of getting money for the lab and the personalities of the people they dealt with.

I recall that the 2001 edition included a re-examination and fairer view of her contribution.BTW, Franklin was thrilled when the problem of DNA was solved and never complained about getting enough credit.

But Watson so powerfully captures the humanity of what was going on in the months leading up to the discovery of the structure of DNA that I was swept up in the story even as its facts flew over my head.Here’s what I mean “… we only wished to establish that at least one specific two-chain complementary helix was stereochemically possible. Until this was clear, the objection could be raised that, although our idea was aesthetically elegant, the shape of the sugar-phosphate backbone might not permit its existence. Happily, now we knew that this was not true, and so we had lunch, telling each other that a structure this pretty just had to exist.”My eyes filled with tears near the end as one collaborator after another looked at the model, checked the math, reviewed the chemistry and confirmed what he and his partners had done. I felt the magnitude of it.Watson was one of three scientists awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery. He was 25 in 1953 when the structure was announced to the scientific world. This memoir was published about 15 years later, but it breathes the life of the younger man, from every boarding house or pub lunch to the breaks from chemical bonds to attend a party that was sure to attract all the international au pairs. Early in the book he takes science off its pedestal and sets it firmly on the ground. “One could not be a successful scientist without realizing that, in contrast to the popular conception supported by newspapers and mothers of scientists, a goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.”And I was comforted as he read some early findings from another American working on the same problem. “Most of the language was above me, and so I could only get a general impression of his argument. I had no way of judging whether it made sense. The only thing I was sure of was that it was written with style.”He speaks often of the beauty he anticipated in the structure. It would never have occurred to me to describe it that way. I was fascinated, too, that the work was split between theory and equations and the literal, physical construction of the proposed structure. I could picture him – short American hair grown out into a floppy, European look – bent over the metal discs and spheres, manipulating one way, then another, determined to find the position that would hold them all in perfect order.He also speaks of a kind of meditation that bordered on obsession. It would distract him from girls, meals and sleep. Even moments not actively devoted to the question ended up feeding it: “I went ahead spending most evenings at the films, vaguely dreaming that any moment the answer would suddenly hit me.”At some point, I started noting the specific fields involved in (and impacted by) this discovery. Biology and math and genetics I could have anticipated, but then I wrote down specialties such as quantum mechanics, nucleic-acid biochemistry, and theoretical structural chemistry.To me, Watson’s account feels generously inclusive, naming scientist after scientist who contributed an answer to a question or a piece of research. He states in the beginning, in fact, that he would personally credit the discovery to five people, not just the three who received the prize. I’ve learned not everyone shares my opinion of his inclusiveness – and he seems to almost anticipate that in his opening words, acknowledging that any process over such a long time, involving so many people and so much work, is bound to be reported differently from various perspectives. I’m not qualified to give the definitive word, but I didn’t walk away feeling that he’d done this single-handedly or even with only the help of his fellow prize-winners.Don’t get bogged down by the paragraphs you don’t understand. I tried to reread them and despaired. You can appreciate the pursuit and the feat without grasping the details. I did."
112,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58444614-jenna,0,"A Scientist and A Writer	The Double Helix by James Watson is a well-written, informative autobiography about the lifelong workings of scientist James Watson and his partner, Francis Crick, in discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid — more commonly known as DNA. James Watson’s and Francis Crick’s discovery was revolutionary to the scientific community. By discovering the double helix nature of all DNA molecules, it provided a gateway into further learning and understanding a myriad of important biological process such DNA replication, RNA replication, and protein production. In addition, the discovery allowed for an increase in understanding about the behavior of virus and infections. As a result, through research and development, scientists are able to create antibiotics and antiviral injections to improve human life. Therefore, Watson and Crick’s one discovery created a pathway for many discoveries. 	In cell biology, the central focus is DNA as everything always stems back to one’s DNA. Even though Watson is credited to for his work on discovering the DNA, his name is mentioned for a minute or two. Intrigued to learn more about his experiments, I decided to read his autobiography. After reading the book, James Watson does more than just recount the facts leading to the discovery. Through the use of his first-person narrator, he tells personal stories of the people he encountered and collaborated with. He shows the frustration and tedious work within all his trials. His thoughts and reasoning behind certain observations were made. Thus, as a reader, I was able to engage in the book and feel angry when Watson was angry or excited when an experiment had promising results. Additionally, it highlighted a major theme of success and failure. Every time, Watson and Crick endured a setback, they preserved until they reached a success. This concept of perseverance and success is important to young adults as they enter a world where failures and setbacks are inevitable. Overall, his autobiography was not a book filled with scientific jargon. Instead, it was a story with an actual plot, which made it more interesting. 	However, although the main focus of The Double Helix is about one of the greatest scientific discoveries, it also talks about a major scientific controversy. Watson talks about four people that helped him: Maurice Wilkins, Linus Pauling, Francis Crick, and Rosalind Franklin. In the 20th century, Rosalind Franklin was one of the few women working in a male-dominated field. It was her work with an x-ray cryptography that lead Watson and Crick to deduce a final conclusion. Without her knowing, Maurice Wilkins sent Watson and Crick the picture of Rosalind Franklin’s DNA x-ray, which clearly shows the double nature and overall structure of a DNA molecule. Therefore, Watson and Crick quickly learned that their prior structure was wrong. If it wasn’t for Rosalind Franklin, the two scientists would not have gotten the Nobel Prize, which excludes Franklin’s name. In his book, Watson unsympathetically describes Rosalind Frank, saying that “clearly Rosy had to go or be put in her place” when she would not give him what he wanted. In addition, because Rosalind Franklin was the only girl at that time, Watson and his colleagues made fun of her by calling her Rosy, which was demeaning. Watson carries this nickname into his book, thus showing the stereotypical behavior Rosalind endured. During this chapter of the book, the major theme of stereotyping against women in science in the 20th century was highlighted Overall, I would highly recommend this book who is fascinated by the subject of biology. Not only does it explain the science behind one of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time, it tells a story; one that is characterized by failures, successes, and stereotyping."
113,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92553179-faatihah-nayeem,2,"	As one of the most famous contributors to the biological sciences, you cannot read one biology textbook without learning about the Watson and Crick model. But, we don’t get the full story of how James Watson and Watson Crick determined the structure of DNA. Through their many tumults and endeavors, and even with the help of Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray diffraction of DNA to which she wasn’t given enough credit to, they eventually solved the mystery that codes all life.	The Double Helix is written and told through the eyes of American scientist James Watson where we get his perspective of his personal recollection of the discovery of the structure of DNA. He basically explains his journey from a little bit before his arrive in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1953, through his journey in collaboration with Francis Crick, to eventually the validation of their famous Watson and Crick model in 1953 where Watson, Crick, and another scientist named maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1962.	The book is structured and organized into Walston’s account from the intertwinement of letters and memories that reflect his thoughts. Watson chronologically shows the reader the process of how the structure of DNA was discovered and his partner relationship with Crick. He shows how science is discovered and studied through a human perspective instead of only from a factual standpoint. In fact, the terminology used in the book as well as the scientific comparisons are thoroughly explained and put into simpler terms for every audience to understand. Watson’s narrative illustrates how the science discoveries and long periods of research affect personal life. In fact, there are often shifts between the information of how each piece of the puzzle relates to the structure of DNA and the social/background lives of researchers.	Even though Watson mentioned some contributions from other scientists and their backgrounds, I felt as if he didn’t focus on how they were heavily involved. When it comes to these tremendous discoveries of science, we often see competition and separation which is exactly what the book shows. Although there were many characters working on this project, after it's DNA structure verification, Watson only emphasized himself and Cric as well as Wilkins. I was deeply disappointed how little he mentioned of Rosalind Franklin whose x-ray diffraction picture of the double helix was the major catalyst for the final determination of DNA’s structure. He often made sexist and controversial comments about her which I didn't like at all, discrediting her major contribution to science for she didn't receive a Nobel Prize. He often paints her as uncooperative and sour. This led me to kind of decreasingly like the book. Watson’s ego and arrogance shined through and his tone became proud.	Watson did successfully ensnare the reader into the dramatic events that led up to the discovery of DNA’s double helix structure; however, the problem was the drama that I felt like was created by himself. Gossip, pettiness, and misogyny take the wheel in this personal account of how the double helix structure of DNA was discovered, and I expected a more of a respectful, fortunate attitude from Watson. But, in the end, he just made it sound like it was all him and Crick. He owes a better recollection to Rosalind Franklin that was the main contributor to this tremendous discovery. Her years of working with radiation for this discovery cost her life, thus it should be honored.FN"
114,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1793373-misty,4,"Let’s get this straight: James Watson is a shitty human being. Not even counting the racist and eugenist comments that disgraced him in later life - as portrayed in this book, he’s a sexist, privileged dilletante. He’s a real dick. And considering the fact that he’s a mid-century male in the inequitable field of academia, he’s true to type.Yet reading it again feels like having a conversation with 11th-grade me. That’s when I saw the BBC adaptation, with Jeff Goldblum as Watson, and that’s when I read this book for the first time. I was obsessed. I hung paper double helixes in my locker and signed “Watson and Crick are COOL” in my yearbook. I dreamt of being a famous scientist who burned with the desire to make a discovery.I cracked it open again (actually, listened to the audiobook), because I needed a story of an exciting scientific discovery in the era of coronavirus, where it feels like science can’t move fast enough. And I see why 11th-grade me loved it. The discovery itself is thrilling. The science is action-packed and inspired, not just egghead stuff. Sure I’d like to play with models and talk passionately with friends and make history along the way. Who knew science could be so dramatic? The discovery of the double helix is a story of obsession, competition and drive, with a touch of chance that gives it a certain beautiful sense of meant-to-be. It’s a story of people who, while shitty, are brilliant. When not thinking of sex and tennis, they are thinking about big problems in mad flashes of inspiration and passion. Even though someone like me (female, not white) would never be included in the circles described in this book, it was a part of my personal dysfunction that I loved the images of these nerdy but jocular clubs for brilliant people - brilliant men in backrooms and the charming women who were charismatic enough to enthrall them. I had trouble feeling like I belonged, so ironically I was drawn to an ethic with a rigid or elite definition of belonging - geniuses, intellectuals, artists. I dreamt about being worthy enough to find a place in their ranks and having external validation that I was good enough. The tension with Rosalind Franklin adds to the dramatic tension - data versus theory and the clash of personalities. Then I only saw the drama. Now I see that Watson’s comments on Franklin are unforgivable. I knew it was sexism at the time, but I didn’t take it seriously enough. I’m sad that I didn’t empathize with Rosalind Franklin; I didn’t allow myself to identify with her. I was fine accepting a world where I was on the sidelines, just as she is on the sidelines of this story. And I’m horrified that I watched this in school. Is this the right message to send to young women interested in science?I’m still in awe of the discovery and the incredibly faulty and human narrative that describes it. It’s ugly - but girlfriend, it’s real. I took my last real science class in high school - I never even approached becoming the brilliant scientist I once dreamed of being. But I still am thrilled by this book because it shows science as a very human and relatable affair. Who gets the credit is not based purely on good work. People are pushed out or not included. Like all matters, it is highly political. Science is supposed to be objective, but this story pops that balloon in a way that resonates, thanks to the polarization around science today. I’m 43 and far from 11th-grade me. And while I no longer idolize these men, I appreciate the way it portrays science, warts and all."
115,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7069868-john,3,"The ""Double Helix"" is a colorful and informative scientific memoir, with a clear narrative from a clear, singular, and candid viewpoint as though at the time of the discovery. However, this candid viewpoint is in the hands of a fellow who holds the wicked sting of cleverness without the benefit of wisdom, perspective, empathy, or reflection; which is sadly not atypical for when many of us were in our early twenties. As a result of this perspective, it's a book that really demands more context to not be misleading and to do justice to the other participants in the story. For that reason, I'm really glad to have read the ""Norton Critical Edition"" of the book, which includes the original set of scientific papers from all of the three core groups involved, additional memories of the participants, reviews from the time, and facts about how the book came to be published, all set off with framing essays from a peer of the author. With the papers, the multiple remembrances, and the contents of ""The Double Helix"" itself, the core scientific questions are clearly explained, though some of the further supplemental details will be unclear to some, for example to those who have forgotten or never learned what Bessel functions are all about.Though the original reviews were maybe over-sampled for the casual reader, they certainly had their insights. For example, one reviewer keenly noted that this was a very atypical for a work of science. The necessary experimental work was already done, and there was also relatively little to do in terms of the theoretical framing to the problem. Instead of a problem, a question, or a muddle, they had a puzzle on their hands, a geometric and chemical puzzle. This fact the central issue is a race to solve a puzzle one factor in making the central narrative an easy read.The events of the main memoir concern two years in the mid-twenties of the author. However, it was published sometime later (when the author was in his forties). I hope the author must have access to some diaries, to be able to access the sensibilities and details of the younger author, and decided to keep as close to those materials as he could for the sake of giving a very accurate view of the author as those events were happening. Otherwise, it's a very unseemly perspective for someone then forty. From my perspective, there is a pervasive sexism that seems unremarked upon in the reviews. It's hard to tell if that is entirely the point of view of the author, or whether he's particularly uncharitable to Rosalind Franklin because of her critiques on his theory while enjoying the company of young women in a rather impersonal way. Either way, it was with some enjoyment that I noted that the acknowledgements of Franklin and Gosling's paper thank Crick, but not Watson, which seems appropriate given the circumstances.Overall, if you just read the core narrative, it's very bracing but you'll surely be misled. With all of the contextual materials, it's now a bit more work but provides a full experience."
116,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45541682-sachin-h-n,4,"The Double Helix (once intended to be titled 'Honest Jim' and 'Base Pairs') is a Nobel Laureate, Dr. James Watson's account of one of the ground breaking discoveries in science. Having read this book after reading Brenda Maddox's 'The Dark Lady of DNA', to come to an appropriate conclusion, as far as the accuracy of this book is concerned, is difficult. This is more a novel than history; though a feast for a non scientific reader, a historian would definitely object to the way one of the most important discoveries in the field of molecular biology and genetics has been retold. This is more a fast paced thriller (which in fact was, with Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin of King's college, Linus Pauling of CalTech and our boys from Cavendish all trying to have a crack at it) than a history of science. Then, there is the matter of Rosalind Franklin, a prolific x ray cryptographer (dubbed 'Rosy' which the feminist lot find offensive) being discredited of her contribution for the sake. Watson says 'It is quite possible that there are inaccuracies here and there. The portrayal of many might not do justice to their caliber, for i write this as I saw when i was 23.' The words written in the epilogue trying to remedy disregard towards Rosalind and her contribution to elucidation of the structure of DNA probably arise from the need to make the book more acceptable. The book was published in spite of uncompromising opposition from Francis Crick, putting their friendship at risk. Many argue that this book is a symbol of blatant misogyny, painting a monster out of Rosalind, who in a manner has become an icon for feminists. It is very unfortunate that she was not recognized for what she was by many. Yet, that is by no means a reason to not hear out what Watson has to say. At the end of the day it all comes down to Science and the hunger of mankind to uncover it's secrets, of which DNA was a huge chunk from a great puzzle whose solution would open up innumerable applications in the field of medicine later on.  To understand how it all went about, this book is a good place to begin with."
117,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17466394-rustyj,3,"The Double Helix is a personal account of the discovery of the double helical structure of the DNA by one of the co-discoverers, James D. Watson.Watson, his co-collaborator Francis Crick (the senior of the two) alongwith Maurice Wilkins (who was at the same time independently working on the structure of the DNA) were awarded the Noble Prize in Medicine in 1963, for their discovery in 1953.Considering the importance of the discovery on the future of science, it ought to have been a thrilling account, coming from one of the participants. Unfortunately, the book disappoints on many counts.Before getting into the review, we should remember that Watson was barely 25 years old when the discovery was made.Surprisingly for a work of autobiography, the picture that emerges of Watson is that of a flippant, misogynist, careless, lazy person, who just happened to be at the right place at the right time.The portrayal of Rosalind Franklin (who worked with Wilkins), the X-ray crystollagrapher without whose X-ray images of the DNA molecule, the discovery of the helical structure would have been impossible, borders on the disrespectful. That Rosalind believed for a long while that the molecule was not a helix is a different matter.So is the portrayal of Linus Pauling, a brilliant Caltech scientist who was independently working to unravel the structure of the DNA. Pauling is painted as a wolf to be wary of, while it turns out to be pretty opposite.There are pages devoted to the social life of the author, his (absence of) sexual life, food habits and other mundane details that reflects a lack of maturity in handling a subject matter of gravity.By the end of it, one cannot but wonder, if Rosalind was deprived of a deserved Nobel and whether Watson was truly deserving of it. I am sure he was a brilliant scientist and was deserving of the Nobel, but the manner in which the subject matter has been handled, and indeed presented, makes one wonder if it was otherwise.Recommended for aficionados of science."
118,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11990289-kevin,4,"It's a breezy read, iconoclastic and yes, sexist, and at turns charming in its candor and youthful enthusiasm, intriguing in its machiavellian nature, and annoying in its provincial attitudes. In short, it's an expose and it stepped on some toes. Crick, Watson's chief collaborator, considered it ""a betrayal of friendship"" (paraphrase). There are serious questions regarding the portrayal of Rosalind Franklin, who is essentially cast as the villain in the piece, that are tempered (albeit inadequately) at the conclusion of the tale. My impression is that Watson's prime directive beyond producing a credible account of his interpretation of the mood and circumstances leading to the discovery of ""the secret of life"" is that he not commit the cardinal sin of being a bore about it. He is anything but that. I was most surprised by the lack of technical training Watson had, and even Crick to a lesser extent, going in. Their ""structural approach"" to DNA made this possible, through a technique of model building borrowed from Linus Pauling, who became their foil in the race to the landmark discovery. Watson backfilled gaps in his knowledge as needed, gaining a working proficiency in the fields of organic chemistry and X-ray analysis, for example. There was thus a deeper, philosophical divide between Crick & Watson and Franklin regarding the relative merits of theory and practice in the understanding of DNA. The imperatives for such ""backfilling"" become apparent at various stages in their search and these manifest themselves in several ingenious ploys used to thwart institutional barriers and to pump experts for information. These negotiations, which are fleshed out by Watson's characterization of the people and circumstances involved, infuse the narrative with an immediacy and sense of purpose that builds to a climax when the final pieces of the puzzle are literally put into place. In this fashion, Watson and Crick's discovery of the structure of DNA emerges as a true tour de force. This, IMHO, redeems the narrative and is why I give it four stars, with the noted caveats. At a minimum I would augment this account with a reading of Rosalind Franklin's Wikipedia page."
119,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95290952-crystal-li,4,"An overall light-hearted and amusing read about real-life progress towards a great discovery, alternating between sun, rain and mist, suffused with a modernly classical English air.As Watson was an American, I have expected the absurdity of his presence in the British science community, I.e. the vigorous confidence and anxious air permeated from his words, which only enhances the fun as I could see how his surrounding fellow thought of such an untraditional scientist. It is also within expectation the difficulties rising from several wrong assumptions. The illustrations show an evolution of (modern-seen) nonsense to the model we are using today, which is quite interesting for me.However, the non-pedantic, relatable account of scientist lives took me by surprise, as I’m able to peer into geniuses’ not-so-clever everyday behaviour, common-people mistakes which led to embarrassing moments and straight-forward description of Nobel competition, honestly stating it as an essential propeller towards high-level scientific discoveries. Having won the Nobel prize at age of 24, isn’t it symbolic that he has beaten the giant chemist Linus Pauling?Despite joyful at majority of time, Watson’s comments on Rosy’s being feminist in negative terms is indeed sexist, which made me frown more than a few times throughout the book, but a realistic record of the society view to such female scientists. The epilogue rendered me a great deal more comfortable with his remorseful remark on early misunderstanding with her struggle to equality. As Watson has changed his view, the science community today has transformed in sex equality since Rosy’s bickering 24 year-old Watson.Double Helix is a valuable account. Watson may have been filling his mind with seemingly annoying fantasies about girls and Nobel glory, but the passion to biology is what ultimately made him a forever acknowledge-able figure in the field."

DNA is now an extremely important biological item that allows the transfer of genes from generation to generation to occur. Its discovery was not an easy one, as Watson states. Basically, there was a race between James Watson and Francis Crick and other scientists in the world; rivalries between everyone were tight and a huge discovery was stolen from a woman named Rosalind Franklin. The young, fame hungry James Watson was so desperate to discover the structure of DNA that he actually stole information from her. Rosalind, or “Rosy” as the men called her “from a distance”, used X-ray crystallography in order to realize that DNA is shaped in a double helical structure. Previously, Watson and Crick were attempting to build a model of DNA, but there was something missing from it. Watson fails to say that he stole data from Rosalind, and he also fails to mention his misogynistic personality. In fact, he mentioned that if “Rosy” could get her “emotions under control, there would be a good chance that she would really help him”.However, despite this lack of honesty, Watson thoroughly writes this book with a certain eloquence. His word choice is phenomenal and his style of writing, although fairly scientific, is fairly easy for a reader to follow. He is personal and what he writes is interesting, but I do not think it is enough to mask the disrespect toward Rosalind Franklin. Overall, I would recommend this novel to anyone interested in learning more about the discovery of DNA or even if they just appreciate biology in general. However, it is not a good read if neither of those descriptions fit you!"

We have heard a lot about what it is supposed to be. We certainly take it for granted. Almost nobody questions it. But how many of us (non-scientists / mortals) have taken a look behind the curtain? Seen behind the glossy papers, the peer-reviewed journals, into the inner-workings of our favorite tool to be the person who claims to be the one to have the right opinion in an argument?The Double Helix is a short account of the discovery of the structure of DNA by James D. Watson. After Avery's experiment, demonstrating that a virus deposits mostly DNA inside a host bacteria (instead of the previously assumed protein to transmit its genes), you'd guess that it would have been a short road to the conclusion that the key to life lies in DNA. This book shows otherwise. Oftentimes, the scientific process gets (mis)represented as a clean-cut, theory-to practice flowchart. Instead of the tinkering, ""let's try and see what happens""-approach that really gets you the result. I can wholeheartedly recommend this book to get a lasting impression otherwise. Watson seems eager to rub one in on competitors, his ego and zeal not allowing anyone else to steal what could be his accomplishment. Instead of the detached and focused researcher, it paints a picture of a young man, caught by the want for success, interest in women and maybe a little bit of earnest curiosity. Apparently, Watson became a controversial figure later in life. As I do not know any details, I'll refrain from making any judgments. But do beware that these are the thoughts of a successful young man, who is quite honest about his lust for reputation, acknowledgment and the opposite sex. "

The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA by James D. Watson. The book details the story of the discovery of the structure of DNA, as well as the personalities, conflicts and controversy surrounding their work, and includes many of his private emotional impressions at the time. In 1953, Watson co-authored with Francis Crick the academic paper proposing the double helix structure of the DNA molecule. Watson, Crick and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ""for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material"". The personal narrative gives you a bird's eye view of the process. A book of its time, does have some cringe worthy moments when talking about ""Rossie"" the one female scientist involved with the research and her ""pretty"" pictures. The one lady being Rosalind Elsie Franklin (1920 - 1958) an English chemist and X-ray crystallographer whose work was central to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid), viruses, coal, and graphite. Although her works on coal and viruses were appreciated in her lifetime, her contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were largely recognised posthumously but it was the early 1950s so what you going to do. Watson does give her moving praise in the epilogue, almost like he was trying to set the recored straight. From a scientific point of view the book is very interesting as it gives you the human story behind this magnificent discovery which really did revolutionize modern science. "

Out of The Cavendish, The Discovery. In the thick of the race to break the genetic code between Cal Tech's Linus Pualing, founder of the a-helix and B-sheet secondary structure of acids and the Cavendish Lab of Watson and Associates. From early on, 23 yo James knew the secret to life was close to being unraveled. Hershey's experiments on phage transformation suggested that a single, simple molecule of DNA unbeileivably determines the nature of all species. Physicist turned biologist out of fear of nuclear disaster, Francis Crick flooded the halls of the Cavendish with impotent elation at holding the secret of life, postulated from Pauling's helical mastery of the collagen triple helix and the helix in general, the fundamental shape of wet proteins. Rosy Franklin's King's College lab was the only one east of the Missisipi to be putting forth any significant effort to the discovery. Painstakingly extracting DNA out of cow thymus is different experimental conditions, Rosy spent years calculating bond distances from X-ray crystallographs. Upon finding a particular crystallography of partially hydrated DNA, a striking symmetric reflection appeared, one we are all too familiar with today. Though she died before the Nobel awards were given, Rosy earns her right the most brilliant woman in science since Madame Curie's play on radiation. Jerry Donohue, celebrity structural chemist who demanded the key finding that purine and pyrimidine can only exist in the keto tautomer and not enol, did not receive Nobel credit for his work. ""Rosy's difficulties with Maurice and Randall were constructed with her understandable need for being equal to the people she worked with"" (124). Rosy's X-ray work at Kings' is increasingly regarded as superb: the sorting out of the A and B forms, by itself would have made her reputation; the phosphate backbone; and helical construction of the tobacco mosaic virus halfway out of the century."

There is a real lack of detail on the technical aspects of the work while there is much more detail on the social and personal aspects of the work. Another word of warning - anyone under the slightest illusion that scientist are all liberal folks with progressive attitudes prepare to have those illusions shattered. The belated ""apologia"" tagged on to the end of the book aside Watson and Crick come across as very sexist particularly in regards to the comments and attitudes displayed towards Rosalind Franklin, although the patronising attitude shown by Watson towards his sister vis a vis her love life and finding the ""right"" boyfriend / husband is cringe worthy. Setting the sexism aside the arrogance and the overly aggressive competitive attitude is unlikely to endear the dreadful duo to anyone. The overall impression I was left with of Crick was of an egotistical, irritating, patronising oik whose one saving grace was that he was smart. Watson comes across as a lazy intellectual freeloader with an eye for the main chance. I get the impression that the overriding motivation behind Watson and Cricks work was to feed their overweening ambitions and preen their egos. Having said all that the book is a fun roller-coaster ride of the up's and downs involved in the race to solve the structure of DNA - a race that was sadly won by Watson and Crick (I can only lament the fact that it wasn't Pauling or Franklin and Gosling)"

I'm not sure why no Hollywood director has yet approached Cumberbatch for the role of Crick - you couldn't get a better science drama!The writing was by no means exemplary; then again neither is Watson a writer nor is the book a literary gem. Knowing that an ornithologist turned molecular biologist decoded DNA through an unbeknownst field of crystallography... really gives you the push you needed all week. (Hopefully, it lasts for atleast a month!)Now, to the murky politics of Rosalind's structure theft. Though it is unfair on my part to comment on it before reading 'The Dark Lady of DNA', I guess Rosalind was opposed to the idea of DNA being a double helix and wouldn't have envisioned the correct structure. Maybe some pages of this book does portray Watson to be unmindful of Rosalind's genius; though he does admit his injustice in the end. As far as feminism goes, one can't blame Watson or Crick for not being feminists, just because they were scientists. They did treat her as a fellow colleague and scientist. I'm afraid I'm being too partial to the duo, but analysing data is the crucial part of every experiment as I painfully realised. Yes, Rosalind didn't get enough credit for her work, but neither does it mean she should have been the co-discoverer.Maybe I'll change my views after reading the aforementioned book."

Subsequent developments and writing about these development in the realm of genetics and genomics help to frame this work and point up Watson's limitations and his misdirected race and gender biases. It's a relatively quick read, although given Watsons' recent ill-conceived statements about race-based intelligence and other wrongheaded ideas, you may want to hold your nose while digesting. Incidentally, the stars-based rating system is totally unhelpful for a book like this. I hate the racist vitriol Watson spews and his blatant sexism, but the book itself is helpful as a starting point for learning about DNA. 3 stars seems like a difficult thing to sign in the circumstances, and I understand the objections for those who disagree. I think reading this as a companion to Brenda Maddox's ""Rosalind Franklin: Dark Lady of DNA,"" and/or Rachel Ignotofsky's ""Women in Science: 50 Pioneers who Changed the World"" can help to ease the strain and broaden one's understanding of what discover actually looks like in science, and who is involved.

Granted, it was interesting to see their discovery play out (even though they often hated to mention the contributions of Franklin) and the high stakes and competition between researching scientists.Some of Watson's greatest lines ever: ""Momentarily I wondered how she would look if she took off her glasses and did something novel with her hair."" ""The thought could not be avoided that the best home for a feminist was in another person's lab.""While James D Watson and Francis Crick were great scientists that contributed heavily to the science of DNA, I would also like to add that if I ever met Watson, I'd probably roundhouse kick him into next week.I would only recommend reading this to fuel the fiery flames of hatred introduced by passionate and woke biology or chemistry teachers that knew what was up when teaching about important scientists to their students.

This book goes through the difficulties of finding the structure of DNA, the double helix, and winning a nobel prize afterwards. The book was written in the perspective of James Watson.	A word or phrase that is used frequently is DNA. I know this is obvious, but it is used a lot. This makes sense because the whole entire book is about DNA and how the structure of it was discovered. It also talks about James Watson a lot in the book, and this is obvious as well because the whole book is written in the perspective of him. Those 2 phrases sum up the book pretty well, and I think they are the most used words.I like this book because it is not only entertaining, it's also educational. I love learning about things, so I enjoyed reading the book. I have learned about DNA before but I never actually learned how the structure of it was found, and this book gave good detail on how it was.

What's shocking (even though I know it is near-universal) is just how serendipitous the discovery was, and how critical seemingly meaningless personal and administrative decisions were to the process.Another interesting aspect was the ""friendly"" state of the (then fallen from importance) UK scientific culture. He contrasts it to the then-recent Manhattan Project and physics of the time, where the true top-tier science was happening, with all artificial impediments forced to the side -- this was instead a field where not stepping on a colleague's toes who had done previous work but wouldn't take it to completion was a serious concern (and in the end, only a US research group run by Linus Pauling put fire underneath them to complete it; without Pauling it's possible DNA wouldn't have been fully characterized for another decade)."

It has always been hammered to our minds that the discoverers were Watson and Crick - but what do we know beyond the names?This book makes scientists - the brilliant ones, the less brilliant ones, all manners of scientists - more relatable. So human. A god - it seems to be a suitable epithet for a man of Pauling's caliber - can err, a newcomer can spot errors, scientists are sometimes 'exploited' by their peers and 'exploit' their peers, and all the races to solve various things.I started reading this with prejudice towards both Watson and Crick, but after this book, I found that that prejudice had dissipated and been replaced with something akin to tolerance.And a fact shook me a bit.

Many of us who support science tend to have these romantic views of the scientific method where scientists are these individuals driven solely by a selfless desire to expand the scope of human knowledge. What made this book fantastic was the honest way in which the author lays out the process by which science discovery actually occurs with all the messiness. It's a process driven by not wholly altruistic motives. There's jealousy, self-interest, misogyny, and a whole collection of other emotions that lead to the general forward progression of our understanding of the universe. When we ignore the messiness, as we often do, I think we lose something.I will note that the book definitely contains a fair bit of misogyny. I have noticed that others have tended to count that against the book. For me, that was an important component of the book. The way in which Rosalind Franklin was treated by her peers is an integral part of the historical record and bares acknowledging."

His misogynistic portrayal of Rosalind Franklin is appalling and the frankness with which he describes stealing her experimental data is a disgrace for the scientific world. While I still wonder whether he and his buddy F. Crick actually performed any scientific experiment themselves or simply used other scientists results, I am genuinely astonished of how little scientific quality is needed to win a nobel price in medicine. Reading this collection of bullshit (stalking young foreign au pair women is neither a hobby one could be proud of nor is bragging about it anything suitable to mention in a nobel prize background story) made me seriously doubt the nobel prize committee´s claim to honor outstanding scientists and their work. Neither is it his work, nor is James D. Watson anything else than outstandingly lazy and sexist.For a scientist, the revelations in this book are an embarrassment, for an average reader it is a waste of time.

His treatment of Rosalind Franklin is brutal and is not redeemed by the kind words about her in the epilogue. There isn't much racism, but that's mostly because there are no people of color in the story. In addition to his disdain for women, he takes a few unwarranted potshots at the French and the English. I acknowledge that this part of it shocked me a bit. I want my heroes of science to be good guys all around.And Watson's flaws go beyond social and gender prejudice. He is more than a little arrogant and lazy and is constantly bending the rules. He and Crick were both supposed to be working on other projects. In working on the structure of DNA, they were sneaking around behind the backs of their supervisors. He's not the kind of person that I would pick as a colleague.And yet you have to respect his honesty in telling the story without trying to hide the obvious warts and in giving us an inside view on how a very famous and important scientific discovery happened. And you have to acknowledge the importance of the result.The story told here by Watson strongly supports the theory of how science advances advocated by Paul Feyerabend in ""Against Method."" It is ad hoc and haphazard, proceeding by fits and starts. They try one method that fails, so they try another and another and then back to the first. It is very unsystematic. And they come to the project with a lot of judgments not yet supported by experiment which they push and push until they manage to bring some colleagues around to their way of thinking with some additional modeling that better fits the facts.

Together they supplied some of the most important information for future experiments and discoveries. And although the novel was published at a later date (1968,) Watson tells his account from a much earlier date, the 1950’s. The most important element of the novel is Watsons motivation to show how science develops from the perspective of scientists. 	I am much more interested in Fictional books, so I would not recommend reading this book if you have a similar liking for fabricated stories. It was definitely interesting to read the accounts of this story from Watson’s perspective;however, it wasn't enough to keep the book in my hands.

As a woman in the sciences, I found that very inspiring and I appreciated Watson's apology to Franklin, as he mentioned at the end that he did not give her enough credit. I also loved the way Watson depicted Franklin as a man with a lot of crazy ideas--sort of like someone who would just throw things at a wall to see what sticks. I found that comical and very cool because as researchers I think it is important to keep your curiosity going and not be deterred when an idea doesn't turn out the way you think it should... just come up with another! Apparently the Watson & Crick (& Franklin) DNA structure model stuck to the wall pretty well!

His unfounded, complete and utter personal disregard for Dr. Rosalind Franklin, who had a PhD degree and was his colleague (not his junior as he seems to have believed) and had structural biology skills (i.e., was able to generate x-ray crystallographic images) was beyond distasteful. For those of you unfamiliar with x-ray crystallography, this remains an important means to generate information that ultimately leads to a three dimensional image or map of complex molecules. It is an art as well as a science and requires critical hard-won skills and training not only related to generating the crystals, but also interpreting the findings that emerge. If nothing else, read Chapter 2 where Dr. Watson comments disdainfully Dr. Franklin's lack of attention to her wardrobe, cosmetics, and more egregious errors of conduct, mostly related to ""not knowing her place.""

The fact that this book was published in 1968, just a few years after Dr. Franklin's untimely death at age 38 from ovarian cancer, speaks volumes, about what, I almost cannot bear to imagine.

As many reviewers rightfully noticed, he clearly a sexist and he doesn't even try to be humble while describing his contribution in the work. For me that was the most enjoyable part - to see a scientific breakthrough through the prism of a real person, with his biases, limitations and imperfect character traits. Also the book does a good job in conveying the culture in Cambridge academic circles of that era.In short, if you want to know more about DNA or genome structure - this book is not for you, there are plenty of other good books on that topic.

I suspect that most of the negative reviews amount to virtue signalling by people who haven't actually read the book. Watson's account of the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA is a memoir, written in memoir form. Watson in this book writes more about the people related to this discovery than about the science of the discovery. He is writing about his personal impressions at the time the events occurred, and so virtually no one, including Watson, comes out with a flattering portrait. The book gives us a good view of the state of biology at the time, with its clashing personalities, rivalries between labs, and rising profile in the public sphere. My main reservation about the book is that Watson is not a very literate writer. The prose is rather bland and he has trouble building a compelling story. "

It was also interesting to read about Rosalind Franklin, whose pioneering and grossly under-appreciated work in X-ray diffraction helped solve the helical puzzle.

The book is also an account of the personalities, politics and interactions that allowed for this discovery.I appreciated how Watson clearly stated right from the beginning that there were contributions from five people. Only three of them got the Nobel for it, though - Rosalind Franklin died before it was awarded (and they apparently don't award them posthumously), and Linus Pauling, though he was on the right track, got soundly beaten to the final line by Watson and Crick.It's a quick and interesting read and I enjoyed it."

She was the one who provided the proof, laid the groundwork. And not only was she not celebrated for her work, the men involved constantly demeaned her because of her personality. They said she was the dark lady of DNA, that she was angry and mercurial. They dismissed and belittled her. She was a brilliant individual. The few paragraphs at the end where a “regretful” Watson says his views were wrong do not make up for the fact that she does not get the credit she deserves.

The recap of typical scientific discovery - starts and stops, bouncing ideas off colleagues and foes, getting inspiration from totally unrelated projects or conversations, and finally having everything crystallize - was excellent. The overnight a-ha moments rarely happen, typically it's a long slog to get there, and this discovery definitely fits that time frame. Watson, Crick, and Wilkins eventually won a Nobel Prize in 1962 for their discovery. Recommended for history buffs, people who enjoy science, and anyone involved with DNA today. "
146,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/567005-colleen,5,"I really enjoyed this account of the scientist's experience, as a very young man (25 yrs when the DNA structure was identified). I enjoyed that he told the experience from his perspective as an immature, young scientist....with all his biases and foibles. It was interesting to see how competitive the process for scientific discovery and the Nobel Prize can be. I appreciated that he explained the processes in a way that could be understood by a layperson. It was also interesting to see the interaction and influence of various scientists and university research groups upon the understanding of DNA. He expressed his perspective of his experiences throughout the process....and it may be interesting to hear the perspective of others in this scientific circle."
147,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91343416-abi,1,"I couldn’t help but think this book must be somewhat of a joke in the beginning.Whether for entertainment purposes for the mass audience, or Watson being genuinely more concerned with the personal lives of his colleagues, the majority of the book just reads as a sexist, juvenile and gossip-y commentary of the behind the scenes race between the American and English labs surrounding the discovery of the DNA structure. Only the last 40 or so pages started to hint at actual science and were interesting. However, for those wanting to gain an intellectual understanding of the thought processes and scientific events leading to the discovery of the DNA structure, this book is a waste of your time."
148,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53731064-addyf,3,"This was surprisingly readable for a non-scientist like myself. The readability of the text (for the most part-ha! My eyes wiped over a lot of the science, although I do think it was simplified for the average reader) and down-to-earthness of the author inspired me to believe that becoming a Nobel prize winner is something that a regular person with a tenacious spirit and love of science could accomplish. I do think this book would be most appreciated by people who are more science-minded than myself. I appreciated the author's candor, especially as it related to Rosy and to the contributions of so many others who did not ultimately receive credit for the discovery. "
149,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44413784-lindsey-m,3,"I was confused at the careful-- and often condescending-- descriptions James made of his contemporaries, particularly the women around him. He struck me as a selfish, sexist, egotistical man who just barely ekked out a win amongst many, many other capable, brilliant scientists. They were all in pursuit of the same goal: nailing DNA down. Watson (not really Watson, though, because it was Watson, Crick, and Rosalind Franklin, equally) just happened to get there first. Well, to the victor go the spoils, including the book deal. Ironic that his book made me like him less and value his contribution less."
150,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11723162-b,3,"Interesting memoir of the experience of Watson leading up to his and Crick's discovery of the structure of DNA. Watson does come across as a complete jerk, though. And he's also incredibly sexist about women in general and specifically about Rosalind Franklin. Although he does address his hostile portrayal of Franklin in the appendix, and explain why she actually was incredibly important in the discovery of DNA's structure, it almost feels like someone made him add this after the fact. In spite of this, I would recommend this book, since it was short and somewhat interesting (and also for some reason, Watson's portrayal of himself reminded me a bit of Hemingway). "
151,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12208018-fiona-howells,3,"I'm not a scientist but I am familiar with this story and it has always fascinated me. It's a short read and a relatively easy one. It is a clear insight into how science was in the 1950s, a male dominated, often misogynistic, environment, with different research departments competing for various 'prizes'. James Watson's narration seems honest, and ""of it's time"", but his description of Dr Rosalind Franklin and his dismissive use of the name ""Rosy"" in his account of her, does not sit well with me. Decent read though, and I might well read more about Rosalind Franklin aka ""The Dark Lady of DNA"" "
152,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69113665-jean,3,"This book gets bogged down at the beginning, but last third is pretty thrilling as they unravel the answer to the DNA structure. I always knew Watson was not a very nice man. His views of this undertaking are seldom complimentary to others. Even Francis Crick, his partner, is described more by negative traits. He especially lambasts Rosalind Franklin. In the Epilogue he manages to give her credit, praise her knowledge and achievement and admits to his misjudgment of her. However, he knew this as he wrote the book and could have easily related his impressions then to his later understanding. He might not have come off as such a raging misogynist that way."
153,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46303821-egemen,4,"An illuminating look into the timeline and nature of a collaborative discovery and the mindset of a young, ambitious scientist. It is a reminder of the fact that science is built upon previous steps and our understanding of a breakthrough does not usually reflect the reality about developing knowledge. I conclude, after reading this book, that there are two types of discoveries- one is the resolution of a major investigation, such as the discovery of DNA's structure or a feasible steam engine, and the other is a paradigm shift, such as relativity, discovery that DNA is the inheritance molecule, etc. I believe that the second type is more worthy of individual praise."
154,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84321703-sujay-rainchwar,5,"Exceptional passion leading to unraveling the code of life ... It inspires ones to he smart, lively and open minded in one's pursuit for truth and meaning of life. Watsons quirky ways, down to earth attitude and easy going nature helped him achieve it. The journey of dna following thru Watsons life is much more interesting and amusing than the end of story. It's very simply written yet conveys meaning of life to the very core of it, a guide specially for those involved in research. Thrilling, suspenseful. The race among the scientific community to beat another team is presented in the most surreal form thru this book."
155,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127480-lisa-butterworth,4,"So Watson is famously terrible, but this book is actually really interesting. Basically he recreate his search for the double helix structure through reading his old notes and letters home and he comes off as exactly the privileged douche he so clearly is. And it's just interesting to see inside the mind of clever douche on the edge of a great discovery that changed history, built mostly upon the deeper work of other people (as science inevitably is). He was just soooo worried about the fact that Rosalind Franklin had no interest whatsoever in making herself attractive or agreeable for him, HE COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW SHE GAVE NO SHITS ABOUT HIM AT ALL, it's kinda hilarious. "
156,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2456844-theresa-leone-davidson,4,"The writing is well done, the science fascinating, the male scientists repugnant. If you can get past that last part, I would recommend the book (anyone who was not a white male was treated like not even a second class citizen, more like a fourth or fifth). The book details the 1953 discovery of the structure of DNA, and it is interesting if you like that kind of thing. Reading about Rosalind Franklin and HER discovery, and the subsequent theft (yes, that is how I see it) of her research is well worth the time."
157,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72399727-tara,2,"So! This book is basically a biography of James Watson with a focus on his work with the double helix and journey toward winning the Nobel Prize. If such a subject interests you, you may enjoy this book. I didn't find it entertaining or interesting, although I thought I would. I usually really enjoy biographies and science so... Also, something strange happened. I usually take a great amount of notes when I read, but this one didn't spring about such action. It's freaking me out! How is that possible?"
158,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37421018-manasa,5,"I saw my own self in parts of the story. Time spent in the lab, my dislike for chemistry and my love for scientific curiosity in general. Dr.Watson's way of communicating science and his style of writing, are both brilliant, like himself and his colleagues. It was delightful, reading about the DNA, something that is of much importance to me, something that is going to shape my career and research as I am a biotechnology student, in the voice of the very man who was a part of discovering it. His sense of humor is absolutely wonderful. A must-read for all people having science backgrounds."
159,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23264964-mike-harper,4,"Watson's description of the competition to identify DNA is fascinating. About half of this blessedly short memoir is great reading, showing that in the case of DNA, at least, human factors were as influential as the rigorous application of scientific method.The problem with the book is that Watson makes practically no attempt to explain the science. Terminology used by these brilliant young scientists is as alien as can be, unless the reader has a pretty good background in biology and organic chemistry. The story would undoubtedly be even better if there were some sort of a primer."
160,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75157556-lucas-h-golding,3,"An interesting biographical account of the events leading up to the discovery of the double helix(DNA). The book seemed a little slow through the the first 2/3rds, but picked up and became a pretty enjoyable read at the end. It was pretty entertaining to read about the race for what is arguably the defining scientific achievement of the 20th century. I had no idea that Linus Pauling played such a huge role in the discovery. I do very much appreciate these kinds of stories about the scientists that make such discoveries, even if it took awhile to get interesting."
161,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28381093-anna-t,1,"My rating has to do with the author. I cannot give a high review to such a man as this author. The majority of the book was him bragging about who he was socializing with and where. His misogynist statements about Rosalind Franklin cannot be condoned and the two page whitewash in his Epilogue is not enough. The science was fascinating, the man not so much. Also, he was admittedly lazy, never seemed to be working very long or very hard and I am surprised he stumbled on to the correct answer."
162,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42444234-jason-peters,4,"Story told by James Watson about discovering the structure of DNA. He was an American studying in England in the early 50's and collaborated with a few characters, namely Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins. This structure of DNA had the attention of many scientists and it was a sort of race to discover the structure. They finally did and received a Nobel prize for their efforts. Lots of focus and effort required to make this discovery. I have heard that an LSD trip inspired them to make the discovery but that was not addressed in the book."
163,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26745801-klevin-mlarc,3,"I was beaming at the end of this book. It’s so satisfying that after all the grueling trial-and-errors and academic politics and drama, Crick and Watson arrive at the solution that eventually united everyone. Must mention the important fact though that Rosalind freakin Franklin stood her ground over the idea the phosphate backbone was outside unlike Crick’s and Watson’s presumptions, and her research provided important insight to both men.I give it 3 stars for Watson’s choppy language. I’d had to read sentences over and over to see what he meant."
164,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1387221-ezgi,3,"I think this book was fascinating for many aspects - it shows the ambitious, egotistic and super competitive side of academic researchers, the true nature of scientific progress and the misogyny within the field (it is 1950s though, so hopefully this is more subdued nowadays). The reason for three stars is (I suspect) the translation. I read this book in Turkish and had to re-read every second sentence to be able to understand, especially the scientific parts were completely puzzling (my lack of knowledge in the field of chemistry aside)."
165,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11312088-harrison,4,"Watson was REALLY sexist, but the story he tells is fascinating because it doesn't just illuminate how DNA was determined to be a Double Helix, but gives us a sense of what life was like as a postdoc at Cambridge in the 60s. Watson's attempts to make the book a bildungsroman of sorts places the book in a weird hybrid category of science writing and self-obsessed coming of age novel, which makes for an interesting, if not sometimes appalling, read. "
166,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51458999-mark-baines,4,"Excellent. There are some tricky technical explanations in here, and they are necessary, for without them there would be no story. An individual view of the close society that academic science is, along with how cheap it was to live in the fifties. In addition time was 'slower' and distance still no barrier to skiing holidays, academic conferences , publication and sharing ideas. Not the space race, but a compelling read all the same."
167,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51539215-ryan-mckenzie,5,"The discovery of the structure and function of DNA is, undoubtedly, one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the 20th century. Watson’s personal account of the discovery is fascinating, to say the least. Watson’s book also clearly illustrates that there’s no need to be a decent person in order to be a successful scientist. “Honest Jim” has no qualms about putting his pettiness and egomania on full display."
168,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7521080-christopher-benassi,4,"I really liked this book for a few reasons:(1) it provided a behind the scenes perspective into the life in academia(2) it was very raw and allowed (what seemed to be) an unedited view of his experiences(3) one was able to witness the random path to innovation (too often, we are told a fabricated story that has been reverse engineered for the most logical possible narrative - when this was often not the case in reality)"
169,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85456684-connor-cuevo,1,"This one was a real struggle to get through. First, the author finishes a chapter on one note and then picks up an entirely different subject in the next. This would be alright if he wasn’t ending each chapter with an indication of continuity. Also, lots of sexism. I picked up this book to read about DNA not to hear about how Dr. Rosalind Franklin could have made herself more attractive! Honestly, does the author have no dignity! The book is a complete waste of time. "
170,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,5,"We are in 1968, Watson is telling us how he and his friend Crick managed to figured out the pretty DNA structure. He is entertaining while speaking his mind sharing all the trouble to get the model done. The whole thing is knitted together with bits of his social life and impressions on Copenhagen and Cambridge. Sometimes it feels like a journal written by a 25 years old rebel eager to crack the secrets of life and to experience it to the hilt. Crick’s ""What mad pursuit"" complements this book beautifully. But not as pretty DNA."
171,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29265436-ella-catherall,2,I probably would have enjoyed this more if the author had been less generally insulting to Rosalind Franklin and if it had been more sciencey than it was - a lot of it was 'I went and had dinner with this person' or 'I played tennis with that person'. I know that it isn't a science book in the traditional sense and that it is more in the style of a biography but it didn't feel like the science sections were as fleshed out as I would have liked them to be. 
172,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1929687-jessica,2,"The scientific process, the trials of discovery, the failures--all extremely fascinating. The book demonstrates the wonder of scientific discovery. However, James Watson is not a lovely human, and his smugness and sexism is almost too much to bare sometimes. Fascinating story, annoying person. Of course, we're allowed to be imperfect, but the way he treated Rosalind Franklin was just flat out wrong. "
173,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45497490-alex-barker,3,"I recommend this book only to those interested specifically in the discovery of DNA , the process of scientific discovery or simply in the topic of genetics. Although James Watson has tried his best to make it an enjoyable read - and it is if you’re interested - it is certainly not captivating in its linguistics. On the other hand , the story as numerous twists and turns in this great discovery is really fascinating and let’s you understand the true significance in new scientific endeavours."
174,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24193620-mansi,3,"This is a short book that felt like a very long read. Too much detail and given that we all know how it ends made it a weary read. However, it's a remarkable insight into the reality of brilliance or innovation or achievement. What often to the outsider seems like genius is actually the result of perseverance, many many false starts and sheer hard work by (mostly) ordinary people. In that, I found it incredibly inspiring."

I really liked how it focused on the journey and every day life of how they reached their discovery, and gave due credit to the many other scientists who contributed to the discovery. It wasn’t ever confusing because of scientific jargon, but was still very factual and fun to read. "

That said, Watson comes across as thoroughly unlikable, pompous and misogynistic. His portrayal of Rosalind Franklin is particularly regretful. I suppose to some extent it's a comment on the time, but Watson's antics in later life lead me to believe it's also a comment on the man himself."

Not for beginning high school students--but maybe toward the end of a chemistry course they'd appreciate it. For any science major in college--definitely! I DID NOT know that Watson and Crick solved this through modeling!!! X-ray crystallography supported the helix, but the chemical bonds and base pairing were done with MODELING! Very cool! "

262,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6160687-05nathanw,5,"I just need to begin by saying that some (ok, a lot) of the science in this book goes over my head. I'm pretty sure that that's also the case for most people who read this who don't have a degree in microbiology. However, since I'm reading this book for my biology class, and we've been talking about the basic structure of DNA, there were parts that I actually understood (which made me feel great). Also, even when you don't understand exactly what's going on, you still can get an idea of what's going on because this is a personal account. The author effectively conveys the emotions that were racing through his mind during that time in his life, and that helps the reader understand at least the gist of what's going on. Now that I've given you this incredibly long and possibly boring introduction, I should probably get down to specifics. ""The Double Helix"" is by James D. Watson. It has 138 pages (at least the version I had did), which is a fairly short read. I completed it in an afternoon, although I had to re=read a few parts to write this report. The story takes place in Europe, specifically England, in the early 1950s. Some of the main characters are: Francis Crick, a boisterous and obnoxious British researcher; James Watson, the quieter and more absent-minded half of the DNA Duo (see what I did there?); Maurice Wilkins, a cautious, long-time researcher of DNA; Rosalind Franklin, the moody and often disagreeable crystallographer for Maurice.The book starts off with Watson in the Alps, after the events of the story have taken place. He sees a researcher who was part of Wilkins' DNA research lab. Expecting a friendly greeting, the researcher just says ""How's Honest Jim?"" This simple phrase alludes to the fact that Watson and Crick didn't come up with the structure of DNA solely by themselves. They had some help from a lot of people, some of whom didn't get due credit. The story then flashes back to Watson first arriving in Europe, Denmark specifically. He has wanted to study DNA for a while, and has finally got his chance with Dutch scientist Herman Kalckar. However, Kalckar's research on the metabolism of nucleotides fails to inspire interest in Watson. He learns of a lab in England, the Cavendish, that is studying more the structure of DNA than the processes of it's elements. He transfers to England, and begins to dream about the structure of the DNA molecule with fellow researcher Francis Crick. Watson and Crick brainstorm on the structure of DNA, and with advice from Maurice Wilkins, a researcher at King's College who had been pondering the question of DNA for a while. There, they meet Rosalind Franklin, the newest member of Wilkins' lab. She is a crystallographer, and can take pictures of DNA using X-Rays. However, her personality and ideas clash with those of Wilkins, Watson, and Crick. Several months later, Watson and Crick construct a triple-helic-ed DNA model. They call in the King's College team for remarks, but they are disappointed when Franklin points out that the model is chemically impossible. For the next 15 months, they have little interest in DNA. Then, renowned scientist Linus Pauling states that he has discovered the structure of DNA. However, Watson realizes that Pauling has made a mistake. He and Crick work with renewed vigour, knowing that the great scientist will as well to correct his mistake. Finally, using previously recorded data by Erwin Chargaff, and fellow US chemist Donahue, the two build an accurate model representing the structure of DNA. The King's team approves, and they publish simultaneous articles in the magazine ""Nature.""Something that I like about this book was that the author doesn't try to hide the character's flaws (sometimes including his own). One passage referring to Franklin talks about how she ""did something novel with her hair."" One of her lectures is described as ""without warmth of frivolity"" and a passage referring to Crick states that ""there existed an unspoken yet real fear of Crick."" I would recommend the book to those interested in the personal relationships surrounding the discovery of the structure of DNA. This book really hits home the fact that science isn't all about performing experiments in a lab. Human beings thoughts and emotions need to be considered when you are in a race to make the next big scientific discovery. This book is a very interesting combination of biology, chemistry, physics, and emotion. I really enjoyed the read, and enthusiastically recommend it."
263,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595-robert,4,"One of the best scientific autobiographies ever.What makes it good is how blunt and candid Watson is. This probably does not make him the nicest person in real life, but it makes for a very good book.He is still reasonably modest about his own contribution and gives plenty of credit to Crick and other contributors.I don't think a better book has been written about an important discovery."

265,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6166965-03adelinaw,2,"Imagine yourself one hundred or so years ago, before almost anything about the DNA was discovered. Wouldn't you think that the discovery of DNA would be a fantastic discovery? Well many did. Many don't know, though that it was James Watson and some of his friends and partners that discovered it. The book, The Double Helix was written in or around the 1970's and it is written by exactly who helped discover the DNA mystery, James Watson. The theme of the book I would say would be something like, 'If you work hard enough, sooner or later you'll succeed.' Now, before you go and jump into this book, think of what it is about. For me, The Double Helix was hard to understand and I hardly could finish it because of the big words and how it was ALL about science, DNA and things such as that. If you're a fan of science and understand big words, I push you to jump write into this book, if you're not, I wouldn't try.The DNA mystery was a long and hard journey for Watson and his partners, it took years and years to finally discover what DNA was, DNA's structure and all the different parts. James Watson's partners were Rosalind Franklin: A smart woman that Watson needed to help, yet in bad moods a lot of the time, Mourice Milkins: Works at Kings College and doesn't seem as enthusiastic about DNA as the others, Linus Pauling: Working on DNA in California and kind of competitors with Watson in the DNA mystery and the last main character, Crick: Not in good moods, 35 and he was barely known in 1951. With the help of all 5 of these characters, they had discovered the DNA mystery. First of all, maybe you'd like to know where the book takes place. It takes place in Cambridge, England mostly in a Cavendish Laboratory. Watson spent a lot of time there studying and making models of DNA.So you want to know some basics of the story? Well, Watson when he was pretty young went to the Cavendish Laboratory to study the protein structure and that is where he met Crick. The two of them shared the love and interest in DNA also, so they started to work on that. Another scientist named Linus Pauling they discovered was also learning to discover the DNA mystery. He ends up publishing a paper on it and Watson finds a mistake in it. I won't give the ending away, for that you'll have to read the book yourself.Personally, I thought the book was pretty short and super hard to understand so you may want to take that into consideration when you decide whether or not to read this book. I liked though, how Watson when he didn't understand or like something, such as on page 23 when he states, ""It made no sense to learn complicated mathematical methods in order to follow baloney."" That one statement he makes shows perfectly well that he speaks his mind, and that it made no sense, which I admire in him. I didn't like about the book is how, as I stated before, how complicated the science was, including the big and scientific words. The Double Helix is unique in some ways too, such as how it isn't like all the other biographies. It is actually written from the source itself and it doesn't describe his whole life, just his DNA journey, which is something most books would probably make a short chapter or possibly even leave out.Now, I recommend this book to maybe someone in high school, and someone who really likes science. You may want to actually understand science to because of all the high vocabulary and again, in my opinion, if you do not like science, you definitely will not like or enjoy this book, so don't even bother. I gave this book only two star for the simple fact that I didn't understand so I couldn't enjoy it, but you may want to give it a try before you judge this book. I'm sure if I actually understood science and how everything in science worked, I could really like it.Again, it is short so you may want to take a little time out just to read it so you know where you found the information about your DNA today. Everyone should admire the founders of DNA and how much they did and how long they worked just to find out, what some may thing is simple, the DNA structure. Take a bite out of this book an see if you can enjoy it or not!"
266,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27850068-sam,4,"A fairly short memoir about the discovery of the DNA double helix from the perspective of one of those responsible, though that focus is often shared (and overshadowed) by Watson's social life.I found it fun. I think it's well constructed, given I still remember most of the people and places despite usually having a very poor memory. It conveyed the important moments in the short few years in which the development of analytical techniques allows the structure of DNA to become known by scientists, and even with a pretty literary treatment - tension ramps up as Linus Pauling is close to the discovery, which is then dispelled close to the end. It comes together as a nice story.I do appreciate sincerity, so I don't consider the genuineness of Watson's account to be a negative as far as the work is concerned, but it is strange. The treatment of Rosalind Franklin is one matter which others have written entire books about, but the flippant and callous way in which he writes about those around him is shown throughout. I think the most perplexing thing I found was what seemed to be (in my limited interpretation) a lack of interest in the discovery itself, and more in the sense of ambition associated with it. There's definitely a feeling, even noted in an indirect way by Watson, that he didn't really need to rush the discovery - as said before, Pauling was close to it, and arguably most of the hard work had been done by crystallographers and structural chemists long before Watson saw the opportunity.The rest of the book, about the same quantity of focus as given to the actual pursuit, is about Watson attempting to increase his social standing - there are lots of parties and dinners. Overall, I appreciate the honesty of the account, and it's a genuine look into how academia worked at the time."
267,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6169107-01michaela,3,"Mike Adkins“The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA”By James D. WatsonThe Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA. The title states it all. This book is told from James Watson’s point of view of the discovery of the structure of DNA. The book details the often political nature of the research, as well as the scientists’ personalities, disagreements, and drama surrounding their work. Watson gives us an engaging story and inside look at one of the most significant discoveries of the 20th century.Of special interest is the cutthroat nature and jealous dealings between scientists of different universities working towards a common goal. The Book’s Preface conditions the reader with the line “On the other hand, I do not believe that the way DNA came out constitutes an odd exception to a scientific world complicated by the contradictory pulls of ambition and the sense of fair play.” In the opening narrative Watson relates a comment made to him by a fellow researcher; “But all he said was “How’s Honest Jim?” and quickly increasing his pace was soon below me on the path.” By the end of the book it is clear that the comment was not a compliment. What I liked about this book is Watson’s openness in admitting his own unscrupulous actions and dark side of research. Covertly obtaining others research data, withholding information from colleagues, animated arguments, and the quaint pleasure in watching a competitor’s blunder all play a role in making this book a provocative and fun read.Throughout the book Watson seems to regard Noble Laureate Linus Pauling with a mixture of awe and resentment. Watson views Pauling's achievements in building models of proteins as what Watson hopes to accomplish with DNA. Watson also views Pauling as his main rival and reacts with glee when he discovers a fatal error in Pauling’s flawed triple helix DNA model. Watson realizes that the error will set Pauling’s research back indefinitely. Ethically, Watson should have informed Pauling of the theory’s failings. Did he? Positively no. Instead, Watson used Pauling’s mistake to buy time for his own research. Watson is just about as competitive with his other rivals, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin.Watson is candid in that he was not very skilled in the laboratory and had to turn to the crystallography expert Rosalind Franklin to get pictures of the molecule. Rosalind Franklin’s contributions to the discovery of DNA’s structure can’t be overstated. It was Franklin who postulated that the phosphate components are located in the outer part of the molecule. Franklin also determined that the amount of water found in the molecule would be in equilibrium with the cell. These concepts are critical in terms of the stability of the molecule. She also generated the crucial X-ray data showing that the B form of DNA is clearly helical. As you read this book, you'll find that there is significant tension between Watson and Franklin. Watson’s scientific research relied on collaboration with Rosalind Franklin and the ability to share ideas; however Watson depicts Franklin with a certain amount of distain. He is not above intellectual theft and worse, character assassination. What stands out throughout the book is Watson’s determination to understand DNA and his willingness to do whatever it took to be the first to discover its structure. This is not to say that Watson was not an intellectual and gifted scientist in his own right. He did assemble the pieces of the DNA puzzle that others had missed. Overall the book is an fun read that keeps the reader’s attention with interesting character depictions and scientific discovery, but falls short in terms of pacing. While “The Double Helix” is a book about science it highlights the human elements often found in scientific research, 3/5 on good reads "
268,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61043374-sayed-mustafa,3,"Clearly not better than ""DNA the secret of life"", this book is a personal account of the events that led to the discovery of the marvelous structure of DNA. Therefore, the words written here are his own perception. The things I learned from Watson's experience in science are heavy and deep, there are so many things to learn from little pieces of information, and so many times you have look at the overall picture and listen carefully to others' opinions and appreciate their differences from yourself."
269,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12461782-monica,4,This was a great book. Some of it was over my head but I was still able to follow. it was nice that he told his story and didn't keep it pure science.This is my 2017 Reading Challenge book with a subtitle.
270,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/563742-margot,3,"Wow, Watson is kind of an blunt gossip! (Opening sentence of chapter 1: ""I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood"" pg 7.) And so of course I loved reading this book, which is rife with talking behind people's backs. The incredible scientific breakthroughs being made throughout are an added bonus. Watson makes no bones about the personal nature of memory in memoir: ""All of these people, should they desire, can indicate events and details they remember differently"" (225). I always enjoy reading about the everyday lifestyles of occupations so different from my own: I liked reading 365 Days: A Diary by Julie Doucet to see the daily life of a working artist, and I was delighted by Watson's frank report of the inner workings of his life as a scientists, albeit somewhat unorthodox.I was at first reluctant to read this book because of my perception of Rosalind Franklin getting the shaft for her part in the discovery of DNA structure. My image of the situation was of her getting screwed out of her due credit by ""the man,"" one of whom was James Watson. And this account did nothing to disabuse me of that impression. From the first mention of Franklin on page 16, she is portrayed as a troublesome, meddling, strident feminist man-hater whose sole purpose is to cause trouble (""Clearly Rosy had to go or be put in her place"" pg 17.) That Watson spends the closing pages of his book clearing her name (posthumously, I might add) of the vitriol he has spent the rest of the book heaping upon her--well, I would call that a classic case of too little, too late.Some samples:""Of course there were scientists who thought the evidence favoring DNA was inconclusive and preferred to believe that genes were protein molecules...Many were cantankerous old fools who unfailingly backed the wrong horses. One could not be a successful scientist without realizing that, in contrast to the popular conception supported by newspapers and mothers of scientists, a goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.""(14)""Her [Rosalind Franklin] past uncompromising statements on this matter thus reflected first-rate science, not the outpourings of a misguided feminist.""(212)""But now I was alone, looking at the long-haired girls near St. Germain des Pres and knowing they were not for me. I was twenty-five and too old to be unusual.""(223)""By then all traces of our early bickering were forgotten, and we both came to appreciate greatly her [Rosalind Franklin] personal honesty and generosity, realizing years too late the struggles that the intelligent woman faces to be accepted by a scientific world which often regards women as mere diversions from serious thinking. Rosalind's exemplary courage and integrity were apparent to all when, knowing she was mortally ill, she did not complain but continued working on a high level until a few weeks before her death.""(226)"
271,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036072-david-evans,4,"Highly readable and entertaining account of the discovery of the 3-dimensional composition of DNA from the point of view of one of the three recipients of the Nobel prize which resulted from the breakthrough. There is no requirement of the reader to have a scientific background; the book is as much a tale about postgraduate university life and the difficulties of obtaining enough decent food and heat in austere post war England during the 1950s. Interestingly the Cavendish laboratory were trying to get rid of Francis Crick, his professor avoided him as much as possible due to Crick's loud voice and laugh. Watson was scratching around looking for something interesting to stimulate him when he became involved in the race to discover the structure of DNA. Much of the groundwork had been done by others, notably Wilkins and Franklin in King's (London) and Linus Pauling in the USA. Wilkins didn't get on with Rosalind Franklin and their work seemed, to Watson, to be stagnating. Pauling was nearly there having deduced the structure of the alpha helix through sheer brain power and was a genius as well as a force of nature. Watson could sense an opportunity for greatness, if only he could learn enough quickly about the biology and chemistry needed to proceed to making 3-dimensional models of DNA. He attended lectures by Franklin but was terrified of her scorn and couldn't bring himself to ask her the necessary questions, afraid he wouldn't understand her answers about her x-ray crystallography photographs of DNA. Watson taught himself how to perform this and confirmed to his own satisfaction that DNA was helical but they couldn't get the bases to fit together in the models and they had no idea how many strands there were in the helix. It seemed Pauling might hit the answer first but his published paper was flawed and Crick and Watson used the opportunity, and the inside knowledge provided to them by Pauling's son, who happened to be their colleague at Cambridge, to make their model fit perfectly; the key to life turned out to be simple and beautiful. Having been scathing about Rosalind Franklin throughout the book (she rubbished Watson's conviction that DNA was a tightly coiled helix), Watson is very charitable about her contribution to the discovery of the structure of DNA and her subsequent generosity of spirit and co-operation towards her rivals at Cambridge. It would be very interesting to read the accounts of the other protagonists as there remains an indignant irritation at King's that Franklin (who died in her 30s) did not share the Nobel Prize or receive due acknowledgment at the time. Linus Pauling got 2 Nobel Prizes so probably suffered rather less.If you are in Cambridge you can still walk from the old Cavendish laboratory, down Free School Lane to the Eagle pub where Crick and Watson had their lunch 6 days a week and sit at the spot where they announced to anyone who was listening that they had discovered the secret of life itself."
272,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5562870-shweta-ramdas,5,"Everything I study in genetics arises from the basic structure of DNA, a much feted discovery that made Watson and Crick synonymous with DNA itself. On the other hand, Watson is (deservedly, in my opinion) considered a racist bigot, who happened to solve one of biology's fundamental puzzles. This made me approach the book with mixed feelings. Once I started, however, there was no stopping. The account, from Watson's point of view, presents him as an irreverent brash American, who is not afraid to state what he thinks, and has his mind set on the bigger picture in biology. In one chapter, he pooh-poohs the idea of his doing 'solid, yet unexciting research' instead of addressing full-on the nature of life itself. It's this uninhibited ambition that leaves a mark throughout the book. When Watson, after a series of positions in labs that didn't quite excite him, found himself in the Cavendish lab at Cambridge, he found an environment and a partner that propelled him towards his goal of discovering the structure of DNA. Watson was always interested in this question. However, politics (overstepping on maurice Wilkins' research) and inexperience (Watson not being a trained crystallographer) had prevented him from making inroads. With Crick's theoretical insights and Wilkins' (and Rosalind Franklin's) experimental data, the solution was within sight, and then reached. This week's New Yorker had a profile of Yitang Zhang, the mathematician who solved the prime number problem of mathematics last year. It led to my wondering what it takes to solve such a problem. Why did this man of all people solve it? Reading the Double Helix, an account of the discovery of another 'Big Question' opened my eyes a little wider. It was Watson's single-minded pursuit of the idea that allowed him to make connections that others didn't.Also fascinating to read was the nature of science in the pre-internet era. Distance meant that a researcher in one continent (Linus Pauling in this case, who was also working on the same problem) had little or no access to data on another continent (Rosalind Franklin's extraordinarily important crystallographic data) unless he happened to be aware of it through personal sources. Watson and Crick were brilliant men, but they were fortunate to be where they were. Rosalind Franklin's story is one of the most tragic in biology, and one that fascinates me. I was curious to see how Watson would present it, considering he has made sexist remarks in the past. He calls her 'Rosy' throughout the book, and at one point remarks on her physical appearance and how she would be presentable were she only to try. As unsavoury as these statements are, he comes around later and acknowledges her integrity, her scientific expertise and her brilliance in an epilogue that comes close to being moving. I would have loved to have read Franklin's account of the same events. One has to do, however, with Watson's account, and it is an engaging and inspiring read. An absolutely essential read for biologists."
273,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2404888-daniel,5,"An invaluable account of the discovery of the structure of DNA in the early 1950s by one of the co-founders himself. Many have criticized Watson for arrogance, sexism (against Rosalind Franklin), and unscrupulous use of others' scientific research (especially Franklin's), and they certainly have their grounds for doing so. But I'm so immensely grateful that Watson dared publish the sometimes-politically-incorrect views he held during the discovery of DNA's structure. To whitewash the questionable bits would have been to distort reality (the way, for better or worse, it actually happened for one of the five major players involved)--to obscure the characteristic quirks and prejudices that accompanied one of the co-discoverers of DNA in the heat of the hunt. To see things as Watson saw them in the early 50s (for all his misconceptions) is to get magically close to the all-too-human personalities that helped elucidate the gene-bearing structure. Usually these autobiographical details are excised from scientific history as irrelevant and superfluous. This is unfortunate, as it helps bring science history to life. Watson reminds us of the very human context in which great discoveries take place, and the identification of DNA's molecular structure is interspersed with detours about Cambridge drinking parties, Alpine vacations, and bitter rivalries. All the conversations take place ""over lunch"" or ""over coffee"" or ""at tea."" And all the set backs, all the trials an errors are recorded. This is how scientific discovery really happens. The dead ends have not been ""edited out.""Things may not have happened precisely as Watson recounts, but I don't mind that. Nothing ever happens precisely the way people remember, and as long as we take Watson's account with a grain of salt (as he advises us to do), we're not in danger of conflating his account with the infallible truth. To see the structure of the DNA molecule coming to light from Watson's perspective is breathtaking. Really, this is such a wonderful read (especially the second half, when all of the pieces are nearly together.) Furthermore, this is a narrative of immense historical import, as the discovery of the structure of DNA in '53 initiated perhaps the greatest scientific revolution since Darwin. This narrative has become a useful point of reference for me, helping to orient me in the disorienting currents and countercurrents of 20th-century intellectual history.As a historical document, I give this an unequivocal five stars. (There's simply nothing like it.) As a piece of ""creative non-fiction,"" I give it four stars. Watson is a good writer, though not a great one, and the prose could be tighter a points and less unnecessarily tight at others. That said, he's still a pleasure to read, and the prose can be tremendously humorous at times--especially when he's poking fun at people. I will never forget this book, and look forward to re-reading it in the future. For all its faults, it's already so near to my heart."
274,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14795501-hamptonenglish10,4,"James DiPernaMs. Brooks Academic English 10January 7 2013The Double Helix is a personal account of one of the most important biological and scientific discoveries ever uncovered by man. The book is told in the first person by James D. Watson, who along with Francis Crick, discovers ultimately that DNA is in the structure of a double helix. This personal account of James D. Watson allows you to learn about the other completing scientists of the time, and the hard work that James D. Watson and Francis Crick put into this magnificent discovery. The book profiles their early work at Cambridge University, their interactions with other scientists, and their personal thoughts and opinions aside from the straight science of the topic. By reading The Double Helix, the reader gets to experience the discovery of DNA on a personal scale and gets to encounter the trials and tribulations, and ultimately the rewards of one of the greatest scientific discovery of the twentieth century.This book falls into the category memoir in nonfiction. It could, however, also be considered an autobiography. Th reason The Double Helix is a memoir is because it profiles a certain segment of a person's life, told by that particular person, whereas an autobiography is a self-told account of that particular person's entire life. The two main things that lead me to conclude that this work of nonfiction is a memoir are that it is told in the first person point of view, by James D. Watson himself, which would sway the genre towards autobiography. However, since the book only describes the scientific part of James D. Watson's life, the nonfiction work would be classified as a memoir.I learned a significant amount from this book, especially since it is closely similar to the Biology course that I am currently enrolled in. When reading this book, I learned about another scientist who played a major role in DNA structure discovery, Maurice Wilkins, a scientist who used x-ray diffraction techniques to get images of purified DNA that helped Watson and Crick produce the final product of the double helix structure. I also learned much information about the smaller experiments that James D. Watson and Francis Crick performed that helped reach their double helix product. They did experiments with bacteria and viruses, DNA purification and DNA imaging, just to name a few. Through reading about these experiments I also learned more about a real life biology lab, and the processes and procedure that scientists go through when working there.If you are a person that likes to read about science and is interested in science, especially biology, then I would recommend this book. The fact the it is a personal account can help a reader understand the discovery of DNA on more of a level than just a purely scientific one. However, if science does not interest you, then this book is probably not one that would be interesting to you."
275,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6156672-03morganm,1,Can you imagine being 24 and writing the most boring book ever. Well that would be me if I would have had to write this book. Even though it was a personal accout and all you could at least make it a little interesting. Well most personal records type books I don't like. Well this book put me over the top. Its all about DNA well and also some failure and finally getting something right. James D Watson was one of the people that most people recognize as the DNA man. He was able to take a structure that no one really knew all that well and he made many pople recognize him for that and not this book. This book was all about him trying to figure out what combinations and other things that made up DNA. In this book it had some pictures and those were kind of interesting to see what James looked like. He worked with Francis. But the person that made James really exited about DNA work was a man named Wilkins. That whole excitement lead to the descovery of what DNA really was. Most of the reaserch was done at his collage. Watson had wanted to be a Crysallographich person but that didn't work out for his favor. But being able to be in that field and he figured out that the Crystallography was the key to genetics. He asked to be in another lab station but that did not work out either the Board would not approve his transfer. Being able for him to come up with a bunch of different ideas really hepled them to figure out the real reason what the DNA was. But once in a while the book just brings up the random idea that they all went out for tea. Who really cares about your tea time sorry but its not meant for this book. In this book Watson and his you could call team figured out that DNA-RNA-Protein. They then built lots of models and other things Three Dimensioanl to form DNA. Seeing those models helped to put the puzzle pecies together. Also the little X-ray pictures that they got. They then placed that Adenine(A) and Guanine(G) go together and Thymine(T) and Cytosine(C) have different shapes and coueld be the backbone of DNA. But they were wrong. Then they switched Cytosine and Adenine and it was approved. They were one day out to lunch and Watson told Francis and Francis told the whole resterant. So they built a model of that and it looked right. But still not a hundred percent sure they were in a race so they had to be right their whole carrer was bet on this idea. But that idea lead them to the Noble prize so you could say it was a good bet. This book over all was very boring but it was also kind of interesting to figure ou tht one bad idea can lead you to something new. That if you keep trying to figure out what things are then you could maybe end up winning the Nobel prize for all of your hard work.

Things that not only make you very rich and famous but also make the knowledge of what you are doing and who you are, that much more interesting. And if you are one of those people that loves science and the mysteries of the world and enjoy learning new things about genes. If you are then I have a book for you! James D. Watson wrote the book the Double Helix to show how they created the structure of DNA. It was a very interesting book, I learned a lot of things that I didn't know about DNA and other science stuff. Although I have to admit that the book was definantly not my favorite book I have ever read. I read the book for my science term project and when the book began it showed many things that were interesting just not my taste of a book. At someparts it was exciting to see that James and his partner finally figured out the sturcture it was difficult to get to that point when they found the structure. I am already not a big fan of science but when it came to the point that I had to read words about science that sometimes I didn't even understand, it made the book really hard to read. Now, I really shouldn't give it such bad comments when it was at some parts a very good book. From beginning to end you were always learning something new about the race to find what DNA is. I thought that when they finally found the structure it was really exciting. I had read this whole book just waiting to see if they would actually find the structure and when they finally did, pieces came together and formed the picture when before it was just a massive puzzel of how does the science involve with this fact about DNA and so on. So in all the things that I read about this book I rated it at a two star because it really didn't go for me and my type of books. But there are people who really like these type of books and I would really encourage those that like these kinds of books to read this book because it is interesting and a good way to learn something new about genes and well since we're made up of genes, you. You can be able to learn why your hair is red or brown just because of the structure and the different orders of the stuff in the helix that make up genes. Do you know why they call it double helix, well it's not just because thats the shape but also because it's two times better the just a-helix."

Watson, one of the two men who discovered the structure. Watsons companion was Francis Crick.James D. Watson is a young american scientists who heads to Europe to work on the structure of DNA. Watson works at many different universities, until he finds himself at Cambridge, working with the great Francis Crick. Crick is a fiery guy always trying to prove people wrong. Because of this sometimes people did not like him. Watson and Crick become interested in the structure of DNA, particularly after an American collegue discovers the structure of protein. Watson and Crick work very hard trying to discover the structure. One of their methods was basically to get toy versions of molecules, and try to fit them together in a way that worked. They used X-ray diffraction pictures to help them see that the structure was a helix, they just didn't know how many strands it had. Watson and Crick were very nervous that the American collegue would find the structure first, so they were very nervous. At one time Watson and Crick's boss made them stop working on the structure because Crick was driving him crazy. Slowy though Watson and Crick started to work on it again. Watson had some trouble with the people that were funding his trip to Europe, and at a time was not even allowed to be at Cambridge but he disobeyed them. Watson was able to figure out that the strands of DNA were made up of sugar, and phosphate, and that the strands were connected by Adenine and Thenine, and Citocene and Guanine. Through much trial and error, and help from collegues, Watson and Crick were able to discover that the DNA structure was a double helix. Watson and Crick hurridly published their findings as their american collegue was right on their tails. Watson and Crick eventually won the Nobel Prize for their findings.Though this book was short I found it took along time to read because it was hard to follow. It is an advanced book, and would not suggested it for younger people unless they have a very high reading level. I would not recommend it as a book you just sit down an read, because it is very boring. I would suggest it for scientists learning about DNA, so that they can see how we discovered what it looked like.In conclusion, it is a personal account of the discovery of DNA, and it is very boring and I would not suggest it."

He goes to many colleges trying to find someone who likes DNA as much as him. 	He goes through many teachers, and mentors before he meets Crick. Francis Crick is as crazy as he is; he always is trying to find new ways to form the model of DNA. They both want to discover DNA’s model before anyone else. Francis is married and lives in a nice apartment and when the government stops paying for Watson to keep moving colleges he practically lives with them; always eating over there, talking about how great it’s going to be when they finally discover DNA. 	Crick and Watson go to many conventions and lectures, trying to get more information about DNA. They have both changed majors many times. No one at Kings College likes Crick, they think he is too crazy, loud, annoying, and just insane. They don’t mind Watson; he isn’t as, out-there as Crick is. Linus is one of their enemies trying to discover DNA first, and Franklin swear that DNA has only one helix, but they know better than that, they know it’s a double helix, obviously, I mean look at the title.

This book starts about how Watson goes to the Alps to expand his education, and he takes up a desire to learn about DNA. He then goes to Cambridge University to learn more about this subjects, and finds he has found his passion. While at Cambridge, he finds another scientist who is studying the same subject. Guess who? Yup. Francis Crick. The two begin their companionship, and decide to work together. The two struggle to find the structure of DNA first, and it turns out that others wanted this very same thing, it becomes somewhat of a race. It is a story that examples teamwork, companionship, and let’s not forget, SCIENCE! Personally, I found this book very boring. But, I knew it would be even before I started reading. In the book, Watson talks about how he didn’t like not understanding something. THIS IS HOW I FELT THE WHOLE BOOK. But, don’t get me wrong, there were some parts that were enjoyable to me. I found myself liking some of the times they would discuss things over coffee, or how Watson would talk about Cambridge. It was just the whole science aspect that flew over my head (which is basically what the whole book is about.) Yes, I do understand some things about DNA, but those things are few, and they are the things that fight their way into my brain as I am struggling to lift the enormous weight of my eyelids during 5th period biology. So, yes, at times I thought that this book was enjoyable, but at other times I would find myself laughing about the level of boredom I was experiencing.  Personally, I thought that this book was so-so. I will diffidently re-read it when I start to really understand DNA, if that ever happens. I found that this book was a good example of teamwork, and at times it was even mildly humorous. But I found the main topic of the book (which is science) was the hardest one to grasp. Now, I’m not going to give this book a bad review for my lack-of-comprehension, but I would certainly wish you already have a good knowledge on the subject of DNA BEFORE you read it, or you will find yourself re-reading many parts, along with suffering though multiple headaches. "
280,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4975021-ali,3,"First of all, I had the honor of meeting the author of this book and taking a picture with him. As the subtitle suggests, this is James Watson narrating the account of the discovery of the structure of DNA: the double helix. The journey of this discovery was basically a heated race between Watson/Crick and a great American chemist named Linus Pauling. Watson and Crick were smart men and curious. That was all it took! They didn't have the background for their discovery, for Watson was set to be a zoologist and Crick was a physicist. However, they learned quickly off from textbooks and enjoyed solving the puzzle. They both contributed to this marveling discovery.Another interesting character involved in this race was Linus Pauling. Pauling was an exceptional chemist who had won the Noble Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of the alpha-helix structure of protein. He was also a pacifist and won the Nobel Peace Prize. This scientist was truly feared by Watson and Crick since they thought he'd beat them to the double helix, which he almost did! However, his experimental data weren't as good as those owned by Watson and Crick. He would have cracked it open, otherwise, and won his third Nobel Prize! A magnificent scientist!Another, rather controversial part of the story, was Rosalind Franklin. Franklin was an expert in X-ray crystallography and she had been taken x-ray images of the DNA. She was very accomplished, but very grumpy and arrogant, too. This made it so hard to work with her in the lab environment. She fundamentally disagreed with Watson and Crick and saw their approach (model-building, influenced by Pauling) as futile and unfit to unravel the structure of the DNA. She actually didn't think it was a helix at all! Watson, Crick, and Maurice Wilkins thus duplicated her experimental data to support their models, but without her permission. However, Watson at the end of the book extensively acknowledges her crucial role in the discovery and praises her and women of science and he criticizes alienating women in the scientific field in general. An interesting read about one of the greatest discoveries in science generally and in molecular biology in particular by probably the greatest biologist living today."

Although very limited, the author tells a few stories explaining the dynamic among the group (yes the story was so limited that this was one of the highlights.2.

It was cool to hear how one of the biggest discoveries happened because of a few scientists refusal to quit.Least1. This book is HEAVY, HEAVY, HEAVY on science. It was not written for the laymen but for those who understand complex science ideas. If you understand these things, I am sure it is very interesting, if not then it sounds like Charlie Brown's teacher until the author returns to the story about his interaction with his colleagues.2. This book was billed as explaining the experience the author had yet it was 75% science as he explained his missteps on the science and little on actual experience he had doing it. There were funny parts he explains the awkward scientists talking in bars and such but it is a line or two here and there. He talks about people not getting along but nothing is explored in depth so it sounds like he marched forward towards the goal and the interactions were a blur. Overall, I was interested in how amazingly smart people make discoveries. How they interact with other smart people on this common goal. What I got was an in-depth explanation about the missteps of science along the way, sprinkled with the occasional story of interaction."
282,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7250175-dominick-lemas,4,"The Double Helix presents the narrow of window in time (1953-1954) just prior to solving the DNA structure when molecular biology was still a new field. I enjoyed Watson's book, particularly his concise perspective on the event leading up to their triumphant discovery. It was interesting to learn that the majority of scientist at the time were largely unaware that DNA was the ""transforming principle"". As this book points out- although the discovery of the DNA molecular structure was credited to James D. Watson and Francis H.C. Crick, the quest to elucidate the structure of DNA was many years in the making and accomplished through the efforts of many devoted scientist. I read the Norton Critical Edition of the Double Helix that was edited by Gunther S. Stent. This edition includes a series of photos, notes, and a great introduction by along with 13 reprinted reviews by a number of scientific minds that offer views on James D. Watson and commentary on the ethics of scientific discovery. As many reviewers have pointed out, this book is the perspective of one tenacious mind and should not be considered in light of other historical narratives that are available in print. I agree with the reviewers included in the book that the Double Helix will remain a literary achievement apart from its scientific merits. Prior to reading the Double Helix I was vaguely aware of Rosalind Franklin's x-ray work with Maurice Wilkins; however it was only after reading this book that I realized how important x-ray crystallography was to the discovery of the DNA structure and how underappreciated Dr. Franklin's efforts were. I am eager to read Maurice Wilkins book (The Third Man of the Double Helix: The Autobiography of Maurice Wilkins) and at least one of the books dedicated to the contributions Dr. Franklin (Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA & Rosalind Franklin and DNA). Overall, I recommend this book to emerging scientists and self-confessed DNA addicts- the Double Helix is a great piece of literature that illustrates the excitement of discovery and the people who defined molecular biology.

283,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6159595-07enyab,0,"James Watson has become introduced to DNA, and now he's obsessed with it. For some time, Watson learned under Randal, a biochemist in Copenhagen. They did much research and even went to Naples, where Watson first heard of Paulings idea of an alpha helix. Watson goes to study under other scientists in order to become a crystallographer and go to Cambridge. There's one problem,when Watson requests to go to Cambridge, the board refuses.So Watson has to trick them into thinking that the real reason he wanted to go to Cambridge was to study under a famous biochemist that was there. When Watson arrives at Cambridge, he finally gets to meet his famous partner Crick. They start having conversations about DNA and it's structure and decide that Paulings design was wrong. Firstly, because DNA had to twist about a central axis and secondly because DNA wasn't flat, it could come in many shapes. Later, Watson learns about the bonds between Adenine-Thymine and Cytosine-Guanine. Rosy's X-ray pictures show that DNA is in a ""'B' pattern"". Watson and Crick had figured out the backbone structure, but couldn't figure out the bases until they realised that they need 2 hydrogen bonds in order to fit right. They had finally found the structure of life. I thought this book was incredibly boring. I had to read it 3 times just to understand what was going on, but then again, I might just be a simple-minded person. I really didn't care very much about this book, mostly because all that happened was James Watson going from scientist to scientist to learn about different sciences and I really couldn't care less. hmm . . . I don't know if this review is long enough, probably not. . . . All I can do right now though is complain . . . . I guess I liked how they were persistant in pursuing their dream of finding the structure of DNA. It was cool that, even though they took a couple years to find it, they didn't give up. Other than that I really didn't like anything about this book. So, there ya go, my review of this incredibly boring book."
284,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6160531-01sarahk,1,"I HATE when you get an assignment at school to read a boring book! This was how I felt when I was assigned The Double Helix by James Watson. This is the kind of book that only science lovers will enjoy. This is a book about James Watson and Francis Crick. They are responsible for the discovery of the structure of DNA. They won the noble peace prize which I think is unfair. Watson and Crick used many people's ideas to create the model. They stole Rosy's picture of DNA to create their model. They totally cheated. Some people...The theme of this book is ""many people are involved in a discovery."" Creating something doesn't just take one person. Everything that is invented or discovered is a group effort...even if you have to cheat. In this book the theme is illustrated many times because the ideas of James Watson, Francis Crick, Rosy, Linus Pauling, and many others came together to result in a discovery.I don't recommend this book to anyone (unless of course you want to be bored out of your mind.) I dislike many aspects of this book, and I especially didn't like how Watson kept mentioning food in the book. Really? Here's a quote from the book: ""As we munched chocolate biscuits..."" I mean, how boring can it get? My advice is to not read this book unless you love DNA.I did enjoy the setting of this book because it was set in Europe which is a very beautiful place. Although James Watson chose a boring field of study, at least he chose an interesting place to go to college. He studied at Cambridge University and went to the alps. The setting really contributed to the mood of the book because if the book took place somewhere else, the book could have been a lot more boring. Long story short- don't read The Double Helix by James Watson. It is a time waster! It is definitely on my ""Boringest Books of all Time"" list. The story covers Watson and Crick's journey to discovering the structure of DNA. I liked the setting of the book but just go visit Europe instead of reading this book. I don't recommend this book to anyone but DNA lovers."
285,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50132044-ian-vanderley,0,"The Double Helix by James D. Watson is about how the discovery of DNA came to be. The book focuses on Erwin Chargaff and Francis Crick and how the ended up discovering how DNA was a double helix and not a single. Erwin Chargaff was a biochemist born in Austria and worked at Columbia University in New York. While mostly working on his own he was the first to discover the accurate pairing of the base molecules in DNA. During this Crick and James Watson were working at Cambridge also conducting research on DNA. Together the two made many discoveries with the help of Maurice Wilkins who used x-rays to get pictures of DNA. Later Crick and Watson met Erwin who traveled to Cambridge to compile their research. While they never got along Chargaff shared his discoveries of the four base molecules with Crick and Watson who later were able to create the first accurate model of DNA using this information. Overall this was an interesting book and taught me so much about DNA and its discoveries. Even though this was an interesting book is was a difficult read because I didn’t know much of the language that Watson used in the book. Watsons syntax in this book was very professional which helped layout the information in an organized way. Although the syntax of the book was professional, it was very hard to keep up with what was happening. This is because the book is a story of how he and other scientists conducted their research and ended up discovering DNA. Also, there were many different people who researched DNA and had a hand in the discovery of it, this included many that worked at different colleges and countries which was confusing to keep straight. Also, Watson and some of the others traveled to share their research with others making it difficult to understand the relations of each of the scientists and chronologically place when they made discoveries vs. when they met. Even though it was a difficult read I found it very intriguing and it was able to keep my attention the whole time because of the vast amounts of information."
286,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/253404-sam,4,"Watson is a racist and sexist asshole who wanted very much for genetics to supplant and justify his thinly veiled eugenic ideas. He believes too much in DNA and the 'central dogma' which was spawned from this discovery. There is obviously more to Life than genes turning on and off in a specific sequence. In a sense genetics since the discovery of DNA has been half the story of eugenecists' scramble for ammunition and half the story of the seemingly infinite depth of gene regulation. We may never find a gene for alcoholism or gender dysphorphia because human behavior is definitely not merely a function of gene expression as our minds (and bodies) have evolved to be pliable not rigid structures that react dynamically to the changing state of the real world. At present epigenetics and ideas like morphogenetic fields in the field of embryology (not to be confused w/ Sheldrake's morphogenetic fields) are pointing us towards the sundry ways that our cells and bodies deal with a changing environment. During my studies of cell and molecular biology I was astounded at the variety of ""meta"" enzymes that helped simple tasks along within the cell. For instance we now know that proteins do not spontaneously assume their shapes based on mere molecular size and charge asymmetries but there are helper proteins that guide the molecules into their final useful shapes (Imo there are probably also 'fields' created by size and charge asymmetries in a polypetide that help the helper proteins know in which ways to fold the proteins being processed.) All that being said this is a great story told by a great fucker (for lack of a better term) that can inspire one to be a badass scientist. This book is also important because it provides frank evidence for Watson's plagiarizing of Rosalind Franklin's data as this heist is detailed in this book. Franklin should have shared the Nobel with Crick and Watson, but alas her dedication to her work took her life before this could be. "
287,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/426277-james,5,"This is a memoir of a Nobel prize-winning Scientist that reads like a cross between a personal autobiography and a detective story. Add the insights into the imagination of one of the greatest scientists of the twentieth century and you have a unique book. I read the book with wonder, delight and puzzlement alternatively as I encountered different aspects of the life of James Watson. He is unafraid to compliment his colleagues and competitors yet is also uncompromising in his criticism of those scientists (Linus Pauling, for example) who are either on the wrong track or just wrong-headed in their ideas or both. I was impressed with his methods which involved serious study combined with leisure activities, tennis being a favorite, that did not seem to detract from his scientific thinking and probably helped his imagination achieve more than it might otherwise have. The book describes a different time, the 1950s, when the ""Red scare"" was predominant in the United States and Europe (not without reason) to the detriment of the free exchange of scientific ideas (again Linus Pauling is a prominent example in his sufferings at the hand of the United States government). But more importantly it describes the collaboration of two colleagues (Watson & Francis Crick) with very different personal styles of scientific endeavor in their pursuit of the goal of identifying the essential nature of DNA. This includes giving credit to those who provided helpful details that made their discovery possible. Written with a lucid style that put this reader at ease this is one of the best memoirs of any kind that I have read. While there are a number of scientific details and references, they are not terribly difficult to digest and I would particularly recommend this memoir to readers who might otherwise shy away from scientific tomes - Watson makes scientific endeavor the most interesting if not exciting thing in the world."
288,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,5,"I cannot believe that I had not read this before. I had been carrying around my father's copy for twenty-five years but only just read it. It is a fascinating, exciting and sometimes even funny account of the race to unravel the structure of DNA. It is unflinchingly honest in describing not only the thrill of scientific discovery but also the more ordinary impulses including scientific rivlaries and everything from the desire to win the Nobel Prize to the desire to win over girls. It is also a great account of collaboration, not only with Francis Crick but also with Maurice Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin, and Linus Pauling -- in the case of the later three the collaboration was mixed with a fervent desire that they not beat Watson and Crick to the discovery of the strucure of DNA. Finally, it is also an excellent detective story as Watson and Crick follow fragmenatory and contradictory evidence along several false leads but eventually stumble on the extremely elegant answer.The Double Helix is at the opposite extreme of Einstein's book Relativity which presents the pure science, derived from first principles, and explained to the lay reader. Instead in The Double Helix, the extensive descriptions of the science are all subsurvient to moving the story of the discovery forward. None of these scientific discsussions are derived from first principles or includes any explanation for the reader (and I, for one, started the book with no knowledge of x-ray crystallography or stereoscopic chemistry and only pieced together a dim understanding of them over the course of the book). And there is virtually no discussion of the implications of the discovery, what followed, or really much in the way of context. But it is hard to hold any of that against The Double Helix, especially when many, many other books have handled all of those topics, while this book uniquely and superlatively describes the process of discovery itself."
289,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6173255-01kylies,1,"I would stay up so late, reading and reading this book, but not because I liked it; it was because I had a deadline and I was a little behind schedule. This book did give you a lot of information, but nothing really important or even worth reading (except for a grade).When I started this book, it didn't seem like it would be too bad, and it wasn't that long... but it really showed me you can not judge a book by it's cover... or how many pages it has. This book was suppose to be focusing on the discovery of the structure of DNA, and though it did discuss it from time to time, a lot of the time I felt like Watson just liked talking about himself. The reviews printed on my book about a wonderful, breathtaking story, in my opinion, were meant for another book. The style James Watson wrote this story in I wan't too crazy about either. His tone sounded, not to sound too mean, but like an awkward nerd who thinks his life is super exciting (which isn't a bad thing, I'm glad he likes his life, but personally the life of a DNA scientist didn't appeal to me). Just the way he phrased things didn't set well with me sometimes. To me it seemed like he was trying too desperately to make you as excited about his life story as he was.Not everything I have to say is negative though...even though on my own I probably wouldn't have even picked this book, it wasn't a total loss. Sometimes the strange way Watson phrased his words was hilarious. Sometimes he would let you in on specific thoughts that went through his mind and they were funny; they made me laugh (again, not trying to be mean).Overall I probably wouldn't really recommend this book to others as a great, lovable classic, but maybe there are people who like this kind of a thing that I could interest in it. Although I wasn't too crazy about the book myself, the book wasn't the end of the world... but next time I choose an author, it probably won't be Watson."
290,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21089028-sanchari-chaudhuri,2,"My rating might be (or might not be, in all honesty) influenced by the fact that I read Siddhartha Mukherjee's The Gene: An Intimate History (first), then Francis Crick's What Mad Pursuit and Anne Sayre's Rosalind Franklin and DNA before reading Watson's infamous The Double Helix. I have tried to keep in mind that this book is a memoir of impressions of a 23 - 25 year man. I couldn't hold onto after the first few pages of the book. Most people who're interested in the story behind one of the modern world's greatest discoveries will know why. However, on reading this book (finally!), I see I had grossly underestimated what an absolute ass Jim Watson actually is - which is not easy considering I had read Sayre's book already. The flippant tone of this entire book dangerously overrides the actual discovery and the thrill of it. It's of little consolation that Watson's attitude towards Franklin wasn't really only reserved for her - he speaks of everybody around him in a very unfortunate light. Take for example Crick himself, who is portrayed (again and again and again - too many times in such a short book) as loud mouthed, brash and irritating - only too fortunate to be put up by Watson.The fact that the foreword by Sir Lawrence Bragg and the preface and epilogue by Watson are both apologetic doesn't really amount to anything. So then here I am, trying to decide why Watson chose to write the book in the first place. It's my personal opinion, and I'm entitled to it (just like Watson is, of course.) The extra star is for science, do not be mistaken."
291,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6160043-05mailer,2,"If I were you, I would NOT READ this book. It is so unbelievable boring, and I found as I was reading, I was 'reading' the words, but not really paying attention to what they were actually writing. Maybe because of that, that is why I didn't enjoy this book as much as I probably should. Maybe having the word SCIENCE just makes my mind go blank.In the Double Helix, there are two main scientists, Watson and Crick. Watson is the main guy that is reporting his experience. Crick is known as the super moody and emotional scientist, but Watson's partner in this research.Watson goes to the Alps to do a study there. Once he is there, he finds a strange interest in DNA. He goes to Cambridge University to get some further information on this subject. At Cambridge, he finds he really likes this subject. While he in at Cambridge, he meets another scientist that is studying the same thing. His name was Crick. Crick ends up helping him a lot, and it leads to further studies of DNA and genes. I found that after taking many coffee and lunch breaks, the finally get closer to what they are trying to discover.On the cover of this book, it said that it was a really funny, and entertaining book. I found that I found the most humor in the book when they weren't doing any studying. I found this book more amusing when they were out for coffee or something and discussing what they just recently discovered. Besides the occasional 'knee slapper' I did not find this book remotely funny.One thing that I did enjoy about this book is where the setting was. Cambridge University in is the United Kingdom, and I would DIE to go and visit there. Some of the stories in the Double Helix made me want to go and visit there even more! I would love to go visit Cambridge University someday.Sorry for my complaining of this book...=/ I just did not find this book to my liking."
292,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6160743-01annak,1," Don't you HATE having to read required books? They are never interesting. The Double Helix by James D. Watson was no different. I spend hours(literally)trying to understand this book. This book is a autobiography about how James Watson discovered the structure of DNA. James Watson was really just like most people in history--he stole other people's ideas and received all the credit. He used Rosy Franklin's picture of DNA. Rosy should have been the one credited with discovering the DNA structure. James and Francis basically just guessed on how to make the DNA model, and they were lucky to have others' imput on how it should look. One theme that I constantly saw in this book is that first impressions aren't always correct. James initially didn't like Rosy, and in the end, he ended up liking her. He says (I think in the last chapter) that he feels bad for stealing her ideas and judging her. She had already passed away when he finally realized that he had treated her wrongly. James origianlly was not interested in chemistry or DNA. Later in life, he ended up discovering DNA's structure.  The one thing I noticed in this book was that he talked about all the food that he ate. ""over a cup of coffee..."", ""we ate chocolate biscuits..."", etc. It kind of bugged me that he would always talk about what he was eating when he discovered certain things. At least he was honest in his telling of the story. It was amazing that the person who discovered the structure wrote about his experiences.  I would only recommend this book to those who want to be bored to death. If you like history and science, you might also enjoy this book. At least it's not as bad as reading a textbook about the structure of DNA. Sorry for all the complaints, but that is how I feel about this book. :)"
293,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26726770-ruhi-chitre,3,"I'm glad I read this book. Although it was not as ground-breaking as it could have been, it captured the excitement of making a life-changing discovery (the 'secret to life'). I also enjoyed the personalities attached to people I've learned about in my physics degree, such as Bragg from Bragg's law.I now have a better understanding of DNA, the scientific discovery process and, although not Watson's intention, the struggles of women in science. With regards to the reviews claiming that this book gives a sexist account, I do agree. All of the women mentioned, even Rosalind Franklin, were described extensively by their appearance and were not taken seriously intellectually. If that level of sexism were to not exist in their environment, Franklin's work would have been more respected by her co-workers. Perhaps she wouldn't have felt like she needed to leave, choosing instead to work more closely with Crick and Watson, and maybe this would have ended up with her also winning the Nobel prize.Although it is easy to blame Watson for his portrayal of her, his biases towards women reflected those of everyone around him. His acknowledgement of this sexism in the epilogue shows that, to some extent, he must have chosen to depict Franklin in this demeaning way. I strangely appreciate this, since he does not dishonour her by ignoring her struggles and changing the story retrospectively. However, it is unlikely that he underwent the deep self-reflection necessary to fully combat his biases.It is a great shame that women such as Rosalind Franklin had to face discrimination and be regarded as tough and brash in her attempt to be seen as an equal. From my personal experience with physics, this is still a significant problem today. There are many more measures in place to prevent it, but sexism still thrives and affects every woman in the field."
294,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12709414-joshua-h,3,"The book I read was The Double Helix by Watson, James. I chose this book because I am more interested in DNA than any other science topic. This book focused on DNA research by the author James Watson who is still alive. Watson investigation was in genetics. While he was studying with Maurice Wilkins, Wilkins suggested to use X-rays to study DNA but Watson avoided chemistry through his graduate work and was sent on a postgraduate fellowship to study biochemistry with Herman Kalckar in Copenhagen. Maurice's presentation, showing an X-ray image of crystallized DNA, was the first thing to interest Watson. The crystallized images were evidence that DNA had a regular structure. Then, Watson saw a connection between his interest and chemistry. He introduced himself to Maurice, but only was able to speak to him briefly. Watson and his other scientist friends soon discovered that DNA has a double helix structure. They discovered this by crystallographic research. Also thanks to a scientist named Max Delbrück's who discovered that genes were made from DNA, rather than proteins. Some questions this book rose up for me what if this info is from like the 1940 and I was learning this last year when am I going to learn about the progression of DNA now in 2012, hope its this year so I can learn more about turning on and off traits on a growing embryo. I thought that lesson was pretty interesting. Also I’ve read in the internet that some people are against DNA testing on animals and I think that is messed up because It said that there is a possibility on curing cancer. Which is great for us because cancer is a well know dangerous disease but terrible for a few animals but only for a few animals which is why I think people should not be against animal testing."
295,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23831512-nicholas,4,"The novel Double Helix by James D. Watson documents the discovery of the shape and importance of the DNA molecule in a first person narrative. It shows the turbulent politics of science in the mid 20th century and how discoveries are made not through forward logical thinking, but a combination of all sorts of factors, the human and emotional element not being the least of which. It details how Watson and Crick use crystallography to determine possibilities for the shape of DNA. It was a new idea at the time for any serious scientist to think that DNA held any importance to genetics, the dominant thought at the time being that proteins were at the root of genes.	This novel is a great insight into how science is conducted in the real world. It gives the reader a look into the clash of culture, emotion, and personality that is often prevalent in different scientific fields. It shows how messy science can get and how it is not nearly as straight forward or “boring” as many in the media would have you believe. It is full of turmoil, politics, social gatherings, and culture, but at it's heart it is still all about determining how the universe works through the use of experimentation and testable hypotheses.	The Double Helix shows that in order to be a great scientist you do not need to know everything by memory or have the capacity to understand every rule and principle there is to know. Instead, it takes determination, willpower, plenty of knowledge, but also a sense of wonder that keeps you thinking and always questioning. In addition, it shows that there is always something further to learn, that if you somehow run out of questions to ask, then you simply aren't looking hard enough."
296,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14365792-patricia,3,"For most people, the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA is the kind of ninth grade science fact you forgot as soon as the final was over. But the real story behind the breakthrough is a lot more interesting than trying to remember which of the bases pair up – and in The Double Helix, DNA-discoverer James D. Watson shares his memories of the find that earned him and his research partner, Francis Crick, a Nobel Prize.Watson was in his early 20s. He and Crick raced frantically against other researchers – most notably Linus Pauling – in an effort to illuminate the structure of DNA, and thereby shed light on the genetics of all life. Watson doesn't shy away from using scientific terms, but Gardner's straightforward reading makes even the most complicated experiments easy to follow. Gardner gives Watson's voice all the excitement, passion, and dedication you'd expect from a young scientist on the verge of one of the world's greatest discoveries.Roger Clark lends his elegant tenor to the book's afterward, written by Sir Lawrence Bragg --the youngest Nobel winner in history - who offers a scientist's take on Watson's memories. Bragg points out that The Double Helix is a record of ""impressions, not facts"" but he gets to the heart of what makes this memoir so appealing.I enjoyed the down-to-earth telling of his thoughts. I was surprised to learn that men we think of in such great terms shirked work they don't like, avoid areas they didn't want to learn, and fought and fussed with their peers. At least in Watson's memories, there was a lot of play in addition to work. It seems that play and interaction with others is the stimulus that prompts the ""a ha"" moments. "
297,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4813606-michelle,5,"I was originally going to deduct a star for James Watson's one sided, rather sexist, portrayal of Rosalind Franklin (or 'Rosy', as he refers to her in the book, as they did behind her back in the early 50's when this all took place) but Watson makes it clear from the outset that he wanted to write the book as an honest portrayal of his own personal viewpoint during the lead up to his and Francis Crick's discovery of the 3D structure of DNA and to not write a definitive and objective tome on the whole matter (stating more than once that other people involved may remember certain events differently). And candid and subjective it is. We'd be kidding ourselves if we thought males of the 1950's weren't a sexist bunch, so in the end I believe Watson deserves kudos for being honest about his sometimes unflattering impressions of people (both male and female) during the 1951-53 time frame covered in this book, even though his feelings for the person may have changed later on. The final 2 paragraphs in the epilogue are solely about Rosalind Franklin (who died 10 years prior to this book being published) and how that after the double helix discovery he came to realise that his ""initial impressions of her, both scientific and personal [...], were often wrong.""Overall The Double Helix is a quick and enjoyable read about James Watson and the three years of his life that lead to one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the 20th century. A new edition has just been published with a lot of extra content (letters and such) and I think I'll have to track down a copy to add to my library next to the old and dog-eared 2nd hand copy that I just finished."
298,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6179279-04isaach,2," If you want to know about the Discovery of the Double Helix, this is the book for you. Was this the book for me? No, but that doesn't mean it was bad. I am only in ninth grade so it was probably harder for me to follow and read rather than an adult to read. I think another reason I didn't like it was because it was published way back in 1968. I am still not saying it was a bad book, but just not the type of book that a typical ninth grader would read. It was about James Watson's journey he took to discover DNA. He started as a biologist and didn't neceasarily hate it, but didn't like it as much as other jobs/careers he could've had. He then went into Crystallography. He went to England, more specifically, Cambridge University, to become part of the DNA race.  The most important key to Watson's success easily would be Francis Crick. He and Francis were the two credited for being the first to discover the shape of the double helix. He took many failures first. There was a time where Rosy Franklin (expert in X-Ray diffractoin), gave a talk, and he failed to take notes. Francis Crick, was obviously mad at this because now, the mind doesn't remember all of what she spoke of (even though it was brief). I am sure there were many other stories of this, even if was not in the book.    In a way, Watson and Crick were very different. They got along very well though. James at first, being a biologist, wasn't as informed as other scientists. Crick helped him all along the way. Watson, being a biologist definitely helped them. As Watson went on, to me it seemed like he learned a lot. Maybe even too much. "

In 9th grade our ISM teacher taught us many things about the double helix. Which can also be called the alpha helix. The double helix is referring to the structure our DNA has. It is very similar to a spiral.	James Watson talks about his collaboration with scientists who are also discovering new things about double helixes. Mr. Watson arrived in his laboratory in Cambridge and met many scientists who had even more knowledge then he had about our DNA. When he arrived there him and his partner crick. They both had knowledge on the subject but didn’t have enough of it to comfortably research their subject thoroughly. They turned to another laboratory in England that had exactly what they needed for their investigations. 	James Watson used anatomy to discover what makes everyone in this world different. DNA is what differentiates one person from the other. Watson used crystallized X ray scanners to get a 360-degree angle and a better understanding of the Double helix. Showing an X-ray image of crystallized DNA, was the first thing to interest Watson. The crystallized images were evidence that DNA had a regular structure. Then, Watson saw a connection between his interest and chemistry. Using this technique is how Watson discovered the double helix.	 Some of the major questions I have are what do crystals do to the images that make them clearer? Also, if they use crystals are they made by the scientist themselves or are they brought in from other locations.								Sincerely,									Francesco Musio"
